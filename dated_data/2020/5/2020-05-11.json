    "abstract": "Numerous brain lesion and fMRI studies have linked individual differences in executive abilities and fluid intelligence to brain regions of the fronto-parietal \"multiple-demand\" (MD) network. Yet, fMRI studies have yielded conflicting evidence as to whether better executive abilities are associated with stronger or weaker MD activations and whether this relationship is restricted to the MD network. Here, in a large-sample (n=216) fMRI investigation, we found that stronger activity in MD regions - functionally defined in individual participants - was robustly associated with more accurate and faster responses on a spatial working memory task performed in the scanner, as well as fluid intelligence measured independently (n=114). In line with some prior claims about a relationship between language and fluid intelligence, we also found a weak association between activity in the brain regions of the left fronto-temporal language network during an independent passive reading task, and performance on the working memory task. However, controlling for the level of MD activity abolished this relationship, whereas the MD activity-behavior association remained highly reliable after controlling for the level of activity in the language network. Finally, we demonstrate how unreliable MD activity measures, coupled with small sample sizes, could falsely lead to the opposite, negative, association that has been reported in some prior studies. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a core component of individual differences variance in executive abilities and fluid intelligence is selectively and robustly positively associated with the level of activity in the MD network, a result that aligns well with lesion studies.",

    "abstract": "Objective Obesity is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Despite success of human genome wide association studies (GWAS), the specific genes that confer obesity remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to use outbred rats to identify genetic loci underlying obesity and related morphometric and metabolic traits.Methods We measured obesity-relevant traits including body weight, body length, body mass index, fasting glucose, and retroperitoneal, epididymal, and parametrial fat pad weight in 3,173 male and female adult N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats across three institutions, providing data for the largest rat GWAS to date. Genetic loci were identified using a linear mixed model that accounted for the complex family relationships of the HS and covariate to account for differences among the three phenotyping centers.Results We identified 32 independent loci, several of which contained only a single gene (e.g. Epha5, Nrg1 and Klhl14) or obvious candidate genes (Adcy3, Prlhr). There were strong phenotypic and genetic correlations among obesity-related traits, and extensive pleiotropy at individual loci.Conclusions These studies demonstrate utility of HS rats for investigating the genetics of obesity related traits across institutions and identify several candidate genes for future functional testing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cell migration and axon guidance are important steps in the formation of neural circuits. Both steps depend on the interactions between cell surface receptors and molecules on cells along the pathway. In addition to cell-cell adhesion, these molecular interactions provide guidance information. The fine-tuning of cell-cell adhesion is an important aspect of cell migration, axon guidance, and synapse formation.\n\nHere, we show that Endoglycan, a sialomucin, plays a role in axon guidance and cell migration in the central nervous system. In the absence of Endoglycan, commissural axons failed to properly navigate the midline of the spinal cord. In the developing cerebellum, a lack of Endoglycan prevented migration of Purkinje cells and resulted in a stunted growth of the cerebellar lobes. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that Endoglycan acts as a  lubricant, a negative regulator of cell-cell adhesion, in both commissural axon guidance and Purkinje cell migration.",

Here we investigate ITH and clonal evolution of papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) and rarer kidney cancer subtypes, integrating whole-genome sequencing and DNA methylation data. In 29 tumors, up to 10 samples from the center to the periphery of each tumor, and metastatic samples in 2 cases, enable phylogenetic analysis of spatial features of clonal expansion, which shows congruent patterns of genomic and epigenomic evolution. In contrast to previous studies of ccRCC, in pRCC driver gene mutations and most arm-level somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are clonal. These findings suggest that a single biopsy would be sufficient to identify the important genetic drivers and targeting large-scale SCNAs may improve pRCC treatment, which is currently poor. While type 1 pRCC displays near absence of structural variants (SVs), the more aggressive type 2 pRCC and the rarer subtypes have numerous SVs, which should be pursued for prognostic significance.",

    "abstract": "The regulated excretion of CO2 during breathing is a key life-preserving homeostatic mechanism. In the rostral medulla oblongata, neurons in two nuclei -the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and the rostral medullary Raphe -have been proposed as central CO2 chemosensors that mediate adaptive changes in breathing. One such adaptive change is active expiration, thought to be controlled by the lateral parafacial region (pFL). Here we use promoter-driven expression of GCaMP6 and head-mounted mini-microscopes to image the Ca2+ activity in neurons and glia of RTN, Raphe and pFL in awake adult mice during inspiration of elevated CO2 to discriminate their roles in the adaptive response to hypercapnia. While there were multiple types of neuronal response to hypercapnia in both the RTN and the Raphe, a substantial proportion of neurons in the Raphe encoded the inspired level of CO2. By contrast, such responses were very rare in the RTN and the responses of RTN neurons suggest that this nucleus plays an integrative rather than a direct sensing role in the chemosensory reflex. pFL neurons were reliably activated by hypercapnia and their activity preceded active expiration suggesting a key causal link to this aspect of breathing. Our analysis considerably revises understanding of chemosensory control in the adult awake mouse and paves the way to understanding how breathing is coordinated with complex non-ventilatory behaviours such as swallowing and vocalisation.",

Dicer-like 5 (Dcl5) is proposed to be responsible for precise slicing in many monocots to generate diverse 24-nt phased, secondary small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), which are exceptionally abundant in meiotic anthers of diverse flowering plants. The importance and functions of these phasiRNAs remain unclear. Here, we characterized several mutants of dcl5, including alleles generated by the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) Cas9 system and a transposon-disrupted allele. We report that dcl5 mutants have few or no 24-nt phasiRNAs, develop short anthers with defective tapetal cells, and exhibit temperature-sensitive male fertility. We propose that DCL5 and 24-nt phasiRNAs are critical for fertility under growth regimes for optimal yield.",

    "abstract": "Vision is obtained with a continuous motion of the eyes. The kinematic analysis of eye motion, during any visual or ocular task, typically reveals two (kinematic) components: saccades, which quickly replace the visual content in the retinal fovea, and drifts, which slowly scan the image after each saccade. While the saccadic exchange of regions of interest (ROIs) is commonly considered to be included in motor-sensory closed-loops, it is commonly assumed that drifts function in an open-loop manner, that is, independent of the concurrent visual input. Accordingly, visual perception is assumed to be based on a sequence of open-loop processes, each initiated by a saccade-triggered retinal snapshot. Here we directly challenged this assumption by testing the dependency of drift kinematics on concurrent visual inputs using real-time gaze-contingent-display. Our results demonstrate a dependency of the trajectory on the concurrent visual input, convergence of speed to condition-specific values and maintenance of selected drift-related motor-sensory controlled variables, all strongly indicative of drifts being included in a closed-loop brain-world process, and thus suggesting that vision is inherently a closed-loop process.\n\nAuthor summaryOur eyes do not function like cameras; it has long been known that we are actively scanning our visual environment in order to see. Moreover, it is commonly accepted that our fast eye movements, saccades, are controlled by the brain and are affected by the sensory input. However, our slow eye movements, the ocular drifts, are often ignored when visual acquisition is analyzed. Accordingly, visual processing is typically assumed to be based on computations performed on saccade-triggered snapshots of the retinal state. Our work strongly challenges this model and provides significant evidence for an alternative model, a cybernetic one. We show that the dynamics of the ocular drifts do not allow, and cannot be explained by, open loop visual acquisition. Instead, our results suggest that visual acquisition is part of a closed-loop process, which dynamically and continuously links the brain to its environment.",

We identify linked chromatin domains (CDs) composed of irregular [~]200-300-nm-wide aggregates of nucleosomes that can overlap with individual topologically associating domains and are distinct from a surrounding RNA-populated interchromatin region. High-content mapping uncovers confinement of cohesin and active histone modifications to surfaces and enrichment of repressive modifications towards the core of CDs in both hetero- and euchromatic regions. This nanoscale functional topography is temporarily relaxed in post-replicative chromatin, but remarkably persists after ablation of cohesin.

The brains ability to discover extrinsic regularities is called statistical learning. Structure can be represented at multiple levels, including transitional probabilities, ordinal position, and identity of units. To investigate sequence encoding in cortex and hippocampus, we recorded from intracranial electrodes in human subjects as they were exposed to auditory and visual sequences containing temporal regularities. We find neural tracking of regularities within minutes, with characteristic profiles across brain areas. Early processing tracked lower-level features (e.g., syllables) and learned units (e.g., words); while later processing tracked only learned units. Learning rapidly shaped neural representations, with a gradient of complexity from early brain areas encoding transitional probability, to associative regions and hippocampus encoding ordinal position and identity of units. These findings indicate the existence of multiple, parallel computational systems for sequence learning across hierarchically organized cortico-hippocampal circuits.",

However, the complexity of drought-response mechanisms make the design of new drought-tolerant varieties a difficult task that would greatly benefit from a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship. To provide novel insight into this relationship, we applied a systems genetics approach integrating high-throughput phenotypic, proteomic and genomic data acquired from 254 maize hybrids grown under two watering conditions. Using association genetics and protein co-expression analysis, we detected more than 22,000 pQTLs across the two conditions and confidently identified fifteen loci with potential pleiotropic effects on the proteome. We showed that even mild water deficit induced a profound remodeling of the proteome, which affected the structure of the protein co-expression network, and a reprogramming of the genetic control of the abundance of many proteins, notably those involved in stress response. Co-localizations between pQTLs and QTLs for ecophysiological traits, found mostly in the water deficit condition, indicated that this reprogramming may also affect the phenotypic level. Finally, we identified several candidate genes that are potentially responsible for both the co-expression of stress response proteins and the variations of ecophysiological traits under water deficit. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance and suggest some pathways for further research and breeding.",

Recently, novel formalisms have been developed to quantify tissue deformation and underlying cellular processes. A major challenge for the study of morphogenesis now is to objectively define tissue sub-regions exhibiting different dynamics. Here we propose a method to automatically divide a tissue into regions where the local deformation rate is homogeneous. This was achieved by several steps including image segmentation, clustering, and region boundary smoothing. We illustrate the use of the pipeline using a large dataset obtained during the metamorphosis of the Drosophila pupal notum. We also adapt it to determine regions where the time evolution of the local deformation rate is homogeneous. Finally, we generalize its use to find homogeneous regions for the cellular processes such as cell division, cell rearrangement, or cell size and shape changes. We also illustrate it on wing blade morphogenesis. This pipeline will contribute substantially to the analysis of complex tissue shaping and the biochemical and bio-mechanical regulations driving tissue morphogenesis.\n\n1 Summary statementTissue morphogenesis is driven by multiple mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Some directly transmitted human pathogens such as influenza and measles generate sustained exponential growth in incidence, and have a high peak incidence consistent with the rapid depletion of susceptible individuals. Many do not. While a prolonged exponential phase typically arises in traditional disease-dynamic models, current quantitative descriptions of non-standard epidemic profiles are either abstract, phenomenological or rely on highly skewed offspring distributions in network models. Here, we create large socio-spatial networks to represent contact behaviour using human population density data, a previously developed fitting algorithm, and gravity-like mobility kernels. We define a basic reproductive number R0 for this system analogous to that used for compartmental models. Controlling for R0, we then explore networks with a household-workplace structure in which between-household contacts can be formed with varying degrees of spatial correlation, determined by a single parameter from the gravity-like kernel. By varying this single parameter and simulating epidemic spread, we are able to identify how more frequent local movement can lead to strong spatial correlation and thus induce sub-exponential outbreak dynamics with lower, later epidemic peaks. Also, the ratio of peak height to final size was much smaller when movement was highly spatially correlated. We investigate the topological properties of our networks via a generalized clustering coefficient that extends beyond immediate neighbourhoods, identifying very strong correlations between 4th order clustering and non-standard epidemic dynamics. Our results motivate the joint observation of incidence and socio-spatial human behaviour during epidemics that exhibit non-standard incidence patterns.\n\nAuthor SummaryEpidemics are typically described using a standard set of mathematical models that do not capture social interactions or the way those interactions are determined by geography. Here we propose a model that can reflect social networks influenced strongly by the way people travel and we show that they lead to very different epidemic profiles. This type of model will likely be useful for forecasting.",

It also stimulated dendritic cells to release high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a behavior we linked to xylose expression. We further discovered that inducible bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) forms in response to infection with either wild-type cryptococci or the mutant strain with reduced surface xylose; although iBALT formation is slowed in the latter case, the tissue is better organized. Finally, our temporal studies suggest that lymphoid structures in the lung restrict the spread of mutant fungi for at least 18 weeks after infection, in contrast to ineffective control of the pathogen after infection with wild-type cells. These studies demonstrate the role of xylose in modulation of host response to a fungal pathogen and show that cryptococcal infection triggers iBALT formation.",

    "abstract": "AimBiodiversity and ecosystem productivity vary across the globe and considerable effort has been made to describe their relationships. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research has traditionally focused on how experimentally controlled species richness affects net primary productivity (S[-&gt;]NPP) at small spatial grains. In contrast, the influence of productivity on richness (NPP[-&gt;]S) has been explored at many grains in naturally assembled communities. Mismatches in spatial scale between approaches have fostered debate about the strength and direction of biodiversity-productivity relationships. Here we examine the direction and strength of productivitys influence on diversity (NPP[-&gt;]S) and of diversitys influence on productivity (S[-&gt;]NPP), and how this varies across spatial grains.\n\nLocationcontiguous USA\n\nTime period1999 - 2015\n\nMajor taxa studiedwoody species (angiosperms and gymnosperms)\n\nMethodsUsing data from North American forests at grains from local (672 m2) to coarse spatial units (median area = 35,677 km2), we assess relationships between diversity and productivity using structural equation and random forest models, while accounting for variation in climate, environmental heterogeneity, management, and forest age.\n\nResultsWe show that relationships between S and NPP strengthen with spatial grain. Within each grain, S[-&gt;]NPP and NPP[-&gt;]S have similar magnitudes, meaning that processes underlying S[-&gt;]NPP and NPP[-&gt;]S either operate simultaneously, or that one of them is real and the other is an artifact. At all spatial grains, S was one of the weakest predictors of forest productivity, which was largely driven by biomass, temperature, and forest management and age.\n\nMain conclusionsWe conclude that spatial grain mediates relationships between biodiversity and productivity in real-world ecosystems and that results supporting predictions from each approach (NPP[-&gt;]S and S[-&gt;]NPP) serve as an impetus for future studies testing underlying mechanisms. Productivity-diversity relationships emerge at multiple spatial grains, which should widen the focus of national and global policy and research to larger spatial grains.",

    "abstract": "Detection of protein structure similarity is a central challenge in structural bioinformatics. Comparisons are usually performed at the polypeptide chain level, however the functional form of a protein within the cell is often an oligomer. This fact, together with recent growth of oligomeric structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), demands more efficient approaches to oligomeric assembly alignment/retrieval. Traditional methods use atom level information, which can be complicated by the presence of topological permutations within a polypeptide chain and/or subunit rearrangements. These challenges can be overcome by comparing electron density volumes directly. But, brute force alignment of 3D data is a compute intensive search problem. We developed a 3D Zernike moment normalization procedure to orient electron density volumes and assess similarity with unprecedented speed. Similarity searching with this approach enables real-time retrieval of proteins/protein assemblies resembling a target, from PDB or user input, together with resulting alignments (http://shape.rcsb.org).\n\nAuthor SummaryProtein structures possess wildly varied shapes, but patterns at different levels are frequently reused by nature. Finding and classifying these similarities is fundamental to understand evolution. Given the continued growth in the number of known protein structures in the Protein Data Bank, the task of comparing them to find the common patterns is becoming increasingly complicated. This is especially true when considering complete protein assemblies with several polypeptide chains, where the large sizes further complicate the issue. Here we present a novel method that can detect similarity between protein shapes and that works equally fast for any size of proteins or assemblies. The method looks at proteins as volumes of density distribution, departing from what is more usual in the field: similarity assessment based on atomic coordinates and chain connectivity. A volumetric function is amenable to be decomposed with a mathematical tool known as 3D Zernike polynomials, resulting in a compact description as vectors of Zernike moments. The tool was introduced in the 1990s, when it was suggested that the moments could be normalized to be invariant to rotations without losing information. Here we demonstrate that in fact this normalization is possible and that it offers a much more accurate method for assessing similarity between shapes, when compared to previous attempts.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning requires initial encoding of the semantic association between premises or assumptions, retrieval of these semantic associations from memory, and recombination of information to draw a logical conclusion. Currently-held beliefs can interfere with the content of the assumptions if not congruent and inhibited. This study aimed to investigate the role of the hippocampus and hippocampal networks during logical reasoning tasks in which the congruence between currently-held beliefs and assumptions varies. Participants of younger and older age completed a series of syllogistic reasoning tasks in which two premises and one conclusion were presented and they were required to decide if the conclusion logically followed the premises. The belief load of premises was manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with currently-held beliefs. Our whole-brain results showed that older adults recruited the hippocampus during the premise integration stage more than their younger counterparts. Functional connectivity using a hippocampal seed revealed that older, but not younger, adults recruited a hippocampal network that included anterior cingulate and inferior frontal regions when premises were believable. Importantly, this network contributed to better performance in believable inferences, only in older adults group. Further analyses suggested that, in older adults group, the integrity of the left cingulum bundle was associated with the higher correct rejection of believable premises more than unbelievable ones. Using multimodal imaging, this study highlights the importance of the hippocampus during premise integration and supports the compensatory role of the hippocampal network during a logical reasoning task among older adults.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral sensory neurons switch to a regenerative state after nerve injury to enable axon regeneration and functional recovery. Intrinsic mechanisms operating in sensory neurons are known to regulate nerve repair, but whether satellite glial cells (SGC), which completely envelop the neuronal soma, undergo injury-evoked transcriptional changes and contribute to nerve regeneration remains unexplored. This is largely due to the lack of molecular and genetic tools to study SGC. Using a single cell RNAseq approach to define the transcriptional profile of SGC in naive and injured conditions, we reveal that these cells are distinct from Schwann cells and share similarities with astrocytes. We find that nerve injury elicits gene expression changes in SGC, which are related to fatty acid synthesis and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. Conditional deletion of Fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the committed enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis, in SGC, impairs axon regeneration. The PPAR agonist fenofibrate rescues the impaired axon regeneration in mice lacking Fasn in SGC, indicating that PPAR functions downstream of fatty acid synthesis in SGC to promote axon regeneration. These results identify fatty acid synthesis in SGC as a fundamental novel mechanism mediating axon regeneration in adult peripheral nerves. These results also highlight that the sensory neuron and its surrounding glial coat form a functional unit that orchestrates nerve repair.",

    "abstract": "When divergent populations are connected by gene flow, the establishment of complete reproductive isolation usually requires the joint action of multiple barrier effects. One example where multiple barrier effects are coupled consists of a single trait that is under divergent natural selection and also mediates assortative mating. Such multiple-effect traits can strongly reduce gene flow. However, there are few cases where patterns of assortative mating have been described quantitatively and their impact on gene flow has been determined. Two ecotypes of the coastal marine snail, Littorina saxatilis, occur in North Atlantic rocky-shore habitats dominated by either crab predation or wave action. There is evidence for divergent natural selection acting on size, and size-assortative mating has previously been documented. Here, we analyze the mating pattern in L. saxatilis with respect to size in intensively-sampled transects across boundaries between the habitats. We show that the mating pattern is mostly conserved between ecotypes and that it generates both assortment and directional sexual selection for small male size. Using simulations, we show that the mating pattern can contribute to reproductive isolation between ecotypes but the barrier to gene flow is likely strengthened more by sexual selection than by assortment.",

    "abstract": "Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential cofactor for various pivotal cellular processes in all living organisms, including bacteria. As thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria but not humans, bacterial thiamine biosynthesis is an attractive target for antibiotic development. Among enzymes in the thiamine biosynthetic pathway, thiamine monophosphate kinase (ThiL) catalyzes the final step of the pathway, phosphorylating thiamine monophosphate (TMP) to produce TPP. In this work, we extensively investigated ThiL in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen of hospital-acquired infections. We demonstrated that thiL deletion abolishes not only thiamine biosynthesis but also thiamine salvage capability, showing growth defects of the {Delta}thiL mutant even in the presence of thiamine derivatives except TPP. Most importantly, the pathogenesis of the {Delta}thiL mutant was markedly attenuated compared to wild-type bacteria, with lower inflammatory cytokine induction and 103~104 times decreased bacterial load in an in vivo infection model where the intracellular TPP level is in the submicromolar range. In order to validate P. aeruginosa ThiL (PaThiL) as a new drug target, we further characterized its biochemical properties determining a Vmax of 4.0{+/-}0.2 nomol{middle dot}min-1 and KM values of 111{+/-}8 and 8.0{+/-}3.5M for ATP and TMP, respectively. A subsequent in vitro small molecule screening identified PaThiL inhibitors including WAY213613 that is a noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 13.4{+/-}2.3 M and a potential antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. This study proved that PaThiL is a new drug target against P. aeruginosa providing comprehensive biological and biochemical data that could facilitate to develop a new repertoire of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "In the past decades, the expansion and modernisation of agriculture in the mountainous areas of Southeast Asia has had severe impacts on biodiversity, as the once species-rich forests were turned into homogeneous fields receiving ample external inputs. A common feature of permanent cropping with annual crops is the frequent change of crop choice, depending on market opportunities or other motives. However, the precise effect of crop shifts on weeds in tropical areas is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the short-term effect of crop sequences on the diversity of weed communities in smallholder fields in Northern Thailand. Crop choices were upland rice, maize, fallow and young tree plantations with or without intercrop. We counted the number of crop shifts and the number of crops involved during a 3-years period preceding weed sampling. We showed that the number of crop shifts did not affect weed density and biomass. However, herbaceous species number and diversity (measured as Shannon index) increased by 36% and 46% respectively, while herbaceous species dominance decreased by 38%, in fields with yearly crop shifts compared to fields with no shifts in the previous three years. The effect of a particular crop on diversity, or the effect of intercropping with young trees, was weaker. It was likely due to the more variable resources (especially light) in fields with two crop shifts, allowing species with different niches to co-exist. Crop type and frequent crop shifts did not affect shrub and tree species number, diversity or dominance. Some species were strongly associated with fields with no crop shift in the sequence (e.g. the tree Antidesma velutinosum) or to fields with two crop shifts in the sequence (e.g. the herb Centella asiatica, the C4 grass Digitaria radicosa). Overall, this study showed that in this agronomical system, maintaining yearly crop shifts does not significantly affect weed abundance, but supports in-field plant species diversity, which is likely to impact the services provisioned by tropical mountainous agro-ecosystems\n\nHighlightsO_LIFrequent crop shifts in a crop sequence increased weed richness and diversity.\nC_LIO_LICrop shifts had a stronger effect on weed richness and diversity than the current crop.\nC_LIO_LIThe number of crop shifts did not affect weed biomass and density.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/988469v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bf6c81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6cb72forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e825eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30ff98_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance local folding and presentation of the interaction epitope.

SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD out-competes the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 35% in terms of the calculated binding affinity. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal circuits of the spinal dorsal horn integrate sensory information from the periphery with inhibitory and facilitating input from higher CNS areas. Most previous work focused on projections descending from the hindbrain. Less is known about inputs descending from the cerebral cortex. Here, we identified cholecystokinin (CCK) positive layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (CCK+ S1-CST neurons) as a major source of input to the spinal dorsal horn. We combined intersectional genetics and virus-mediated gene transfer to characterize CCK+ S1-CST neurons and to define their presynaptic input and postsynaptic target neurons. We found that S1-CST neurons constitute a heterogeneous population that can be subdivided into distinct molecular subgroups. Rabies-based retrograde tracing revealed monosynaptic input from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, from parvalbumin (PV) positive cortical interneurons, and from thalamic relay neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus. WGA-based anterograde tracing identified postsynaptic target neurons in dorsal horn laminae III and IV. About 60% of these neurons were inhibitory and about 60% of all spinal target neurons expressed the transcription factor c-Maf. The heterogeneous nature of both S1-CST neurons and their spinal targets suggest complex roles in the fine-tuning of sensory processing.",

Missense mutations that alter protein-RNA interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases.

The multiple linear regression scoring function of PremPRI is composed of 11 sequence- and structure-based features, and is parameterized on 248 mutations from 50 protein-RNA complexes. Our model shows a good agreement between calculated and experimental values of binding affinity changes with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.72 and the corresponding root-mean-square error of 0.76 kcal mol-1, outperforming three other available methods. PremPRI can be used for finding functionally important variants, understanding the molecular mechanisms, and designing new protein-RNA interaction inhibitors.

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the pandemic of respiratory disease known as COVID-19, which emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China in late 2019. Both vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed hACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of \"human antibodies\" based on H-score (human string content, HSC)3. We generated 106 different designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike RBD epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low H-scores. By grafting the designed Heavy (VH) and Light (VL) chain variable regions onto a human framework (Fc), high-affinity and potentially neutralizing full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can be constructed. Having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection devices and for their deployment as therapeutic antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus and coronavirus strains cause a mild to severe respiratory disease that can result in death. Although vaccines exist against circulating influenza A viruses, such vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic influenza A viruses. Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. In January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified enisamium as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries. Here we show using in vitro assays that enisamium and its putative metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the activity of the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. VR17-04 displays similar efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate. These results suggest that enisamium is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis, and implicate it as a possible therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike remdesivir, enisamium does not require intravenous administration which may be advantageous for the development of COVID-19 treatments outside a hospital setting.\n\nImportanceInfluenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 are respiratory viruses capable of causing pandemics, and the latter is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Both viruses encode RNA polymerases which transcribe their RNA genomes and are important targets for antiviral drugs including remdesivir. Here, we show that the antiviral drug enisamium inhibits the RNA polymerases of both influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that a putative metabolite of enisamium is a more potent inhibitor, inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase with similar efficiency to remdesivir. Our data offer insight into the mechanism of action for enisamium, and implicate it as a broad-spectrum antiviral which could be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or nCovid-19) outbreak has become a huge public health issue due to its rapid transmission and global pandemic. Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs available for nCovid-19, hence early detection is crucial to help and manage the outbreak. Here, we report an in-house built biosensor device (eCovSens) and compare it with a commercial potentiostat for the detection of nCovid-19 spike antigen (nCovid-19Ag) in spiked saliva samples. A potentiostat based sensor was fabricated using fluorine doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) with gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and immobilized with nCovid-19 monoclonal antibody (nCovid-19Ab) to measure change in the electrical conductivity. Similarly, eCovSens was used to measure change in electrical conductivity by immobilizing nCovid-19 Ab on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The performances of both sensors were recorded upon interaction of nCovid-19Ab with its specific nCovid-19Ag. Under optimum conditions, the FTO based immunosensor and eCovSens displayed high sensitivity for detection of nCovid-19Ag, ranging from 1 fM to 1 M. Our in-house developed device can successfully detect nCovid-19Ag at 10 fM concentration in standard buffer that is in close agreement with FTO/AuNPs sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 90 fM with eCovSens and 120 fM with potentiostst in case of spiked saliva samples. The proposed portable eCovSens device can be used as a diagnostic tool for the rapid (within 10-30 s) detection of nCovid-19Ag traces directly in patient saliva in a non-invasive manner.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset. Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosing and studying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), this method amplifies the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This contrasts with typical RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests, which amplify only a few loci. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. Using this method, we can reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter (GE/mL). Almost all diagnostic methods currently authorized for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorization require larger concentrations of the virus to achieve this degree of accuracy. In addition, we can reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. The genotypic data contained in these genome assemblies enable the more effective analysis of disease spread than is possible with an ordinary binary diagnostic. These data can also help identify vaccine and drug targets. Finally, we show that the diagnoses obtained using POLAR of both positive and negative clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples 100% match the diagnoses obtained in a clinical diagnostic lab using the Center for Disease Controls 2019-Novel Coronavirus test. Using POLAR, a single person can manually process 192 samples over an 8- hour experiment at the cost of [~]$36 per patient (as of December 7th, 2022), enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time. We anticipate that further testing and refinement will allow greater sensitivity in this approach.",

    "abstract": "A key component of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the increased generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to enhanced inflammation and tissue dysfunction in patients following intervention for myocardial infarction. In this study we hypothesized that oxidative stress, due to ischemia-reperfusion, induces senescence which contributes to the pathophysiology of cardiac IRI. We demonstrate that IRI induces cellular senescence in both cardiomyocytes and interstitial cell populations and treatment with the senolytic drug navitoclax after ischemia-reperfusion improves left ventricular function, increases myocardial vascularization, and decreases scar size. SWATH-MS based proteomics reveal that biological processes associated with fibrosis and inflammation, that were increased following ischemia-reperfusion, were attenuated upon senescent cell clearance. Furthermore, navitoclax treatment reduced the expression of proinflammatory, profibrotic and anti-angiogenic cytokines, including interferon gamma-induced protein-10, TGF-{beta}3, interleukin-11, interleukin-16 and fractalkine. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that cellular senescence contributes to impaired heart function and adverse remodeling following cardiac ischemia-reperfusion. We also establish that post-IRI senescent cells play a considerable role in the inflammatory response. Subsequently, senolytic treatment, at a clinically feasible time point, attenuates multiple components of this response and improves clinically important parameters. Thus, cellular senescence represents a potential novel therapeutic avenue to improve patient outcomes following cardiac ischemia-reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "A decision to express a defensive response or an escape response to a potential threat is crucial for insects to survive. This study investigated an aminergic mechanism underlying defensive responses to unexpected touch in an ant that has powerful mandibles, the so-called trap-jaw. The mandibles close extremely quickly and are used as a weapon during hunting. Tactile stimulation to the abdomen elicited quick forward movements in a \"dart escape\" in 90% of the ants in a colony. Less than 10% of the ants responded with a quick \"defensive turn\" towards the source of stimulation. To reveal the neuronal control mechanisms underlying this defensive behavior, the effects of brain biogenic amines on the responses to tactile stimulus were investigated. The levels of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) in the brain were significantly elevated in ants that responded with a defensive turn to the unexpected stimulus compared to ants that responded with a dart escape. Oral administration of DA and 5HT demonstrated that both amines contributed to the initiation of a defensive response to the stimulus. Oral administration of L-DOPA weakly affected the initiation of the defensive turn, while 5HTP strongly affected the initiation of defensive behavior. Oral administration of an antagonist of 5HT, ketanserin, abolished the effect of 5HTP. These results indicate that endogenous 5HT in the brain has a key role to play in modulating the initiation of defensive behavior in the trap-jaw ant.",

    "abstract": "Seed germination is characterized by a constant change of gene expression across different time points. These changes are related to specific processes, which eventually determine the onset of seed germination. To get a better understanding on the regulation of gene expression during seed germination, we performed a quantitative trait locus mapping of gene expression (eQTL) at four important seed germination stages (primary dormant, after-ripened, six-hour after imbibition, and radicle protrusion stage) using Arabidopsis thaliana Bay x Sha recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The mapping displayed the distinctness of the eQTL landscape for each stage. We found several eQTL hotspots across stages associated with the regulation of expression of a large number of genes. Interestingly, an eQTL hotspot on chromosome five collocates with hotspots for phenotypic and metabolic QTLs in the same population. Finally, we constructed a gene co-expression network to prioritize the regulatory genes for two major eQTL hotspots. The network analysis prioritizes transcription factors DEWAX and ICE1 as the most likely regulatory genes for the hotspot. Together, we have revealed that the genetic regulation of gene expression is dynamic along the course of seed germination.\n\nOne-sentence summaryTwo transcription factors, DEWAX and ICE1, may be important regulators of gene expression during seed germination, based on network analysis of eQTL hotspots.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin and was transmitted to humans via an undetermined intermediate host, leading to infections in humans and other mammals. To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia assemble unique integrin-adhesion complexes to sense the extracellular matrix. However, the mechanisms of integrin localization and regulation in filopodia are poorly defined. Here, we observed that active integrins accumulate at the tip of myosin-X(MYO10)-positive filopodia while inactive integrins are uniformly distributed. RNAi depletion of 10 integrin activity modulators identified talin as the principal integrin activator in filopodia. Deletion of the MYO10-FERM domain, or mutation of the {beta}1-integrin-binding residues within, revealed MYO10 as facilitating integrin activation but not transport in filopodia. However, MYO10-FERM alone could not activate integrins, potentially due to dual binding to both a- and {beta}-integrin tails. As swapping MYO10-FERM with talin-FERM enabled integrin activation in filopodia, our data indicate that an integrin-binding FERM domain coupled to a myosin motor is a core requirement for integrin activation in filopodia. Therefore, we propose a two-step integrin activation model in filopodia: receptor tethering by MYO10 followed by talin-mediated integrin activation.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for the effective antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has an inherent high mutation rate. These mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability, thereby, facilitating viruses to have rapid antigenic shifting to evade host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) perform viral genome duplication and RNA synthesis. Therefore, we compared the available RdRp sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates and  Wuhan wet sea food market virus sequence to identify, if any, variation between them. We report seven mutations observed in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and three unique mutations that showed changes in the secondary structure of the RdRp protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that these mutations alter the stability of RdRp protein. Therefore, we propose that RdRp mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates might have functional consequences that can interfere with RdRp targeting pharmacological agents.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which started in 2019. This is a member of Coronaviridae family in the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols. This computational finding provides a molecular basis for the severity of COVID-19 infection due to the oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Auxin transport activity of ABCB1 was suggested to be regulated by physical interaction with the FKBP42/Twisted Dwarf1 (TWD1), a bona fide peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), but all attempts to demonstrate such a PPIase activity on TWD1 have failed so far.\n\nBy using a structure-based approach we have identified a series of surface-exposed proline residues in the C-terminal nucleotide binding fold and linker of Arabidopsis ABCB1 that do not alter ABCB1 protein stability or location but its catalytic transport activity. P1.008 was uncovered as part of a conserved signature D/E-P motif that seems to be specific for Auxin-Transporting ABCBs, we now refer to as ATAs. Beside the proline, also mutation of the acidic moiety prior to the proline abolishes auxin transport activity by ABCB1. So far, all higher plant ABCBs for that auxin transport was safely proven carry this conserved motif underlining its diagnostic potential. Introduction of this D/E-P motif into malate importer, ABCB14, increases both its malate and its background auxin transport activity, suggesting that this motif has an impact on transport capacity. The D/E-P1.008 motif is also important for ABCB1-TWD1 interaction and activation of ABCB1-mediated auxin transport by TWD1, supporting a scenario in that TWD1 acts as an activator of ABCB1 transport activity by means of its PPIase.\n\nIn summary, our data imply a dual function for TWD1 acting as an ABCB co-chaperone required for ABCB biogenesis and as a putative activator of ABCB-mediated auxin transport by cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds.",

The specifics of this development are still poorly understood, as are the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that drive it. In a cross-sectional sample of participants 8-19 years old (n = 108), we used blind source separation of EEG data recorded in a Flanker task to derive electrophysiological measures of attention and the processing of cognitive conflict, including a frontal negative component corresponding to the N2 and a parietal positive component corresponding to the P3. Additionally, we examined multiple behavioral measures of interference control derived from the Flanker, Stroop, and Anti-saccade tasks. We found a positive association between age and the amplitude of the parietal positive component, while there was no relationship between age and the amplitude of the frontal negative component. A stronger frontal negative amplitude was, however, age-independently related to better performance on both Stroop and Anti-saccade measures of interference control. Finally, we examined post-conflict behavioral adjustment on the Flanker task. A Gratton effect was found with slower reaction times on current congruent and better accuracy on current incongruent trials when preceded by incongruent as opposed to congruent trials. The Gratton effect on accuracy was positively associated with age. Together, the findings suggest a multifaceted developmental pattern in neurocognitive mechanisms for conflict processing across adolescence, with a more protracted development of the parietal positive compared to the frontal negative component.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive understanding of pleiotropic roles of RNAi machinery highlighted the conserved chromosomal functions of RNA interference. The consequences of the evolutionary variation in the core RNAi pathway genes are mostly unknown, but may lead to the species-specific functions associated with gene silencing. The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, is a major polyphagous chelicerate pest capable of feeding on over 1,100 plant species and developing resistance to pesticides used for its control. A well annotated genome, susceptibility to RNAi and economic importance, make T. urticae an excellent candidate for development of an RNAi protocol that enables high-throughput genetic screens and RNAi-based pest control. Here, we show that the length of the exogenous dsRNA critically determines its processivity and ability to induce RNAi in vivo. A combination of the long dsRNAs and the use of dye to trace the ingestion of dsRNA enabled the identification of genes involved in membrane transport and 26S proteasome degradation as sensitive RNAi targets. Our data demonstrate that environmental RNAi can be an efficient reverse genetics and pest control tool in T. urticae. In addition, the species-specific properties together with the variation in the components of the RNAi machinery make T. urticae a potent experimental system to study the evolution of RNAi pathways.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe factors affecting host-pathogen ecology in terms of the microbiome remain poorly studied. Chickens are a key source of protein with gut health heavily dependent on the complex microbiome which has key roles in nutrient assimilation and vitamin and amino acid biosynthesis. The chicken gut microbiome may be influenced by extrinsic production system parameters such as Placement Birds/m2 (stocking density), feed type and additives. Such parameters, in addition to on-farm biosecurity may influence performance and also pathogenic bacterial numbers such as Campylobacter. In this study, three different production systems  Normal (N),  Higher Welfare (HW) and  Omega-3 Higher Welfare (O) were investigated \"in a natural environment\" at day 7 and day 30 with a range of extrinsic parameters assessing performance in correlation with microbial dynamics and Campylobacter presence.\n\nResultsOur data identified production system N as significantly dissimilar from production systems HW and O when comparing the prevalence of genera. An increase in Placement Birds/m2 density led to a decrease in environmental pressure influencing the microbial community structure. Prevalence of genera such as Eisenbergiella within HW and O, and likewise Alistipes within N were representative. These genera have roles directly relating to energy metabolism, amino acid, nucleotide and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) utilisation. Thus, an association exists between consistent and differentiating parameters of the production systems, that affect feed utilisation, advance our knowledge of mechanistic underpinnings, leading to competitive exclusion of genera based on competition for nutrients and other factors. Campylobacter was identified within specific production system and presence was linked with the increased diversity and increased environmental pressure on microbial community structure. Addition of Omega-3 though did alter prevalence of specific genera, in our analysis did not differentiate itself from HW production system. However, Omega-3 was linked with a positive impact on weight gain.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our results show that microbial communities in different industrial production systems are deterministic in elucidating the underlying biological confounders, and these recommendations are transferable to farm practices and diet manipulation leading to improved performance and better intervention strategies against Campylobacter within the food chain.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/084251v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (63K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c43951org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8efa5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d6db70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e09fb9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Mutations in HUWE1 have been associated with neurodevelopmental X-linked intellectual disabilities (XLIDs), however the pathomechanism at the onset of heterogenous XLIDs remains unknown. In this work, we identify p53 signaling as the process hyperactivated in lymphoblastoid cells from patients with HUWE1-promoted XLIDs. The hiPSCs-based modeling of the severe HUWE1-promoted XLID, the Juberg Marsidi syndrome (JMS), reviled majorly impaired neural differentiation, accompanied by increased p53 signaling. The impaired differentiation results in loss of cortical patterning and overall undergrowth of XLID JMS patient-specific cerebral organoids, thus closely recapitulating key symptoms, as microcephaly. Importantly, the neurodevelopmental potential of JMS hiPSCs is successfully rescued by restoring p53 signaling, upon reduction of p53 levels. In summary, our findings indicate that increased p53 signaling leads to impaired neural differentiation and is the common cause of neurodevelopmental HUWE1-promoted XLIDs.",

Co-depletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 induces precocious centriole disengagement in the interphase without compromising cell cycle progression. The disengaged daughter centrioles convert into centrosomes during interphase in a Plk1-dependent manner. Furthermore, the centrioles reduplicate and the centriole number increases, which results in chromosome segregation errors.

Among these proteins, depletion of DONSON leads to excessive number of centrosomes in interphase, caused by precocious centriole disengagement.

Here, we report comprehensive characterization of healthy aging in human classical monocytes, with a focus on epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations, as well as the corresponding proteomic and metabolomic data for plasma, using healthy cohorts of 20 young and 20 older individuals (~27 and ~64 years old on average). For each individual, we performed eRRBS-based DNA methylation profiling, which allowed us to identify a set of age-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) - a novel, cell-type specific signature of aging in DNA methylome. Optimized ultra-low-input ChIP-seq (ULI-ChIP-seq) data acquisition and analysis pipelines applied to 5 chromatin marks for each individual revealed lack of large-scale age-associated changes in chromatin modifications and allowed us to link hypo- and hypermethylated DMRs to distinct chromatin modification patterns. Specifically, hypermethylation events were associated with H3K27me3 in the CpG islands near promoters of lowly-expressed genes, while hypomethylated DMRs were enriched in H3K4me1 marked regions and associated with normal pattern of expression. Furthermore, hypo- and hypermethylated DMRs followed distinct functional and genetic association patterns. Hypomethylation events were associated with age-related increase of expression of the corresponding genes, providing a link between DNA methylation and age-associated transcriptional changes in primary human cells. Furthermore, these locations were also enriched in genetic regions associated by GWAS with asthma, total blood protein, hemoglobin levels and MS. On the other side, acceleration of epigenetic age in HIV and asthma stems only from changes in hypermethylated DMRs but not from hypomethylated loci.",

    "abstract": "Anatomical brain templates are commonly used as references in neurological MRI studies, for bringing data into a common space for group-level statistics and coordinate reporting. Given the inherent variability in brain morphology across age and geography, it is important to have templates that are as representative as possible for both age and population. A representative-template increases the accuracy of alignment, decreases distortions as well as potential biases in final coordinate reports. In this study, we developed and validated a new set of T1w Indian brain templates (IBT) from a large number of brain scans (total n=466) acquired across different locations and multiple 3T MRI scanners in India. A new tool in AFNI, make_template_dask.py, was created to efficiently make five age-specific IBTs (ages 6-60 years) as well as maximum probability map (MPM) atlases for each template; for each age-groups template-atlas pair, there is both a \"population-average\" and a \"typical\" version. Validation experiments on an independent Indian structural and functional-MRI dataset show the appropriateness of IBTs for spatial normalization of Indian brains. The results indicate significant structural differences when comparing the IBTs and MNI template, with these differences being maximal along the Anterior-Posterior and Inferior-Superior axes, but minimal Left-Right. For each age-group, the MPM brain atlases provide reasonably good representation of the native-space volumes in the IBT space, except in a few regions with high inter-subject variability. These findings provide evidence to support the use of age and population-specific templates in human brain mapping studies.

    "abstract": "In Mediterranean Europe and the United States, oak species (Quercus spp.) have been in various states of decline for the past several decades. Several insect pests and pathogens contribute to this decline to varying degrees including Phytophthora cinnamomi, Armillaria spp., various insect defoliators, and additionally in the U.S., the oak wilt pathogen, Bretziella fagacearum. More recently, two emerging canker pathogens, Diplodia corticola (Dc) and Diplodia quercivora (Dq) have been implicated in causing dieback and mortality of oak species in Europe and in several regions in the United States. In 2019, a fungal survey was conducted in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Eastern U.S., including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia to determine the range and impact of Dc and Dq on forest health within the U.S. A total of 563 oak trees between red and white oak family members were evaluated across 33 forests spanning 18 counties. A total of 32 Diplodia isolates encompassing three Diplodia spp. were recovered from 5,335 total plugs collected from the 13 of 18 sampled counties. Recovered Diplodia species included Dc, Dq, and D. sapinea (Ds), as well as Botryosphaeria dothidea (Bd), a closely related canker pathogen in the Botryosphaeriaceae. Both Dc and Ds were recovered from red and white oak family members, whereas Dq was exclusive to white oak family members and Bd to red oak family members. Of these species, Dc was most frequently isolated followed by Dq, Ds, and Bd. Overall, mortality was relatively low across all sampled counties, indicating that these fungi, at the levels that were detected, are not widely inciting oak decline across the region, but more likely are acting opportunistically when the environment is conducive for disease. In an attempt to better understand the relationships among Dc and potentially their geographic origin(s), a multi-gene phylogenetic study and corresponding morphological study were conducted. A total of 49 Diplodia isolates from Spain, France, Italy, and the U.S. were assessed. Across all isolates and geographic regions, Dc formed a strongly supported monophyletic clade sister to Dq and included two strongly supported subclades, one that included isolates from Spain and California and a second that included isolates from Italy, Maryland, and West Virginia. Both subclades also exhibited overlapping spore measurements. These results support Dc as a cosmopolitan pathogen, native to both Europe and the U.S. with the possibility of secondary introductions.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules are conserved biomolecular condensates that originate in response to many stress conditions. These membraneless organelles contain nontranslating mRNAs and a diverse subproteome, but our knowledge on their regulation and functional relevance is still incipient. Here we describe a mutual-inhibition interplay between stress granules and Cdc28, the budding yeast Cdk. Amongst Cdc28 interactors acting as negative modulators of Start we have identified Whi8, an RNA-binding protein that localizes to SGs and recruits the mRNA of CLN3, the most upstream G1 cyclin, for efficient translation inhibition and Cdk inactivation under stress. However, Whi8 also contributes to recruiting Cdc28 to SGs, where it acts to promote their dissolution. As predicted by a mutual-inhibition framework, the SG constitutes a bistable system that is modulated by Cdk. Since mammalian cells display a homologous mechanism, we propose that the opposing functions of specific mRNA-binding proteins and Cdks subjugate SG dynamics to a conserved hysteretic switch.",

However, quantitative analysis of fetal brain MRI remains difficult, partially due to the limited tools for automated preprocessing and the lack of normative brain templates. In this paper, we proposed an automated pipeline for fetal brain extraction, super-resolution reconstruction, and fetal brain atlasing to quantitatively map in utero fetal brain development during mid-to-late gestation in a Chinese population. First, we designed a U-net convolutional neural network for automated fetal brain extraction, which achieved an average accuracy of 97%. We then generated a developing fetal brain atlas, using an iterative linear and nonlinear registration approach. Based on the 4D spatiotemporal atlas, we quantified the morphological development of the fetal brain between 23-36 weeks of gestation. The proposed pipeline enabled the fully-automated volumetric reconstruction for clinically available fetal brain MRI data, and the 4D fetal brain atlas provided normative templates for quantitative analysis of potential fetal brain abnormalities, especially in the Chinese population.",

To understand the cerebellar compartmental organization, we mapped the PC birthdate (or differentiation timing) in the entire cerebellar cortex. We used the birthdate-tagging system of neurog2-CreER (G2A) mice hybridized with the AldocV strain which clarifies the zebrin (aldolase C) longitudinal striped pattern.\n\nThe pattern of the birthdate-dependent PC distribution was arranged consistently into longitudinally-oriented stripes throughout almost all lobules except for the nodulus, paraflocculus and flocculus, in which distinct stripes were observed.Boundaries of the PC birthdate stripes were found either in the middle or coincided with that of the zebrin stripes. PCs in each birthdate stripe were born in various periods between embryonic day (E) 10.0 and E 13.5.\n\nIn the vermis, PCs were chronologically distributed from lateral to medial stripes. In the paravermis, PCs of early birthdates were distributed in the long lateral zebrin-positive stripe (stripe 4+//5+) and the medially neighboring narrow zebrin-negative substripe (3d-//e2-), while PCs of late birthdates were distributed in the rest of all paravermal areas. In the hemisphere, PCs of early and late birthdates were intermingled in the majority of areas.\n\nThe results indicate that the birthdate of a PC is a partial determinant for the zebrin compartment in which it is located.

    "abstract": "Efficient task performance requires co-ordination of internal cognitive processes by implementing control policies adapted to the dynamic structure of task demands. The cognitive and neural basis of control policy implementation remains poorly characterized, in part because it is typically confounded with implementing new stimulus-response rules. To disambiguate these processes, we asked participants to perform multiple novel variants of a working memory control task. Each variant had a unique, novel sequential trial structure, but all shared common stimulusresponse rules, enabling us to test control policy implementation separate from rule learning. Behaviorally, we found evidence for two adaptive processes tied to control policy implementation. One process was reflected in slower responses on the first trial with a novel sequential trial structure, followed by rapid speeding on subsequent trials. A second process was reflected in the diminishing size of the first trial cost as participants accommodated different variants of the task over many blocks. Using fMRI, we observed that the striatum and a cingulo-opercular cortical network increased activity to the first trial, tracking the fast adjustment. This pattern of activity dissociated these regions from a fronto-parietal network including dorsolateral PFC, inferior frontal junction, inferior parietal sulcus, and rostrolateral PFC, which showed a slower decline in activity across trials, mirroring findings in rule implementation studies, but in the absence of rule implementation demands. Our results reveal two adaptive processes underlying the implementation of efficient, generalizable control policies, and suggest a broader account of the role of a cortico-striatal network in control policy implementation.\n\nSignificance statementRapid adaptation to novel tasks is a hallmark of human behavior. Understanding how human brains achieve this is of critical importance in neuroscience. Here we broaden the scope of this problem, going beyond task rules to more broadly consider the cognitive control demands produced by novel task dynamics. We propose that humans rely on two adaptive processes to rapidly implement efficient, generalizable control policies as task dynamics change, even when task rules remain unchanged. One process unfolds rapidly and underlies efficient adaptation. A second process unfolds slowly with experience across task conditions and underlies generalization of control policies. Using fMRI, we identify cingulo-opercular cortex, fronto-parietal cortex and striatum as dissociable components of a cortico-striatal network that contribute to control implementation.",

    "abstract": "We describe the operating principle of the detailed version of the soil-plant-atmosphere model SurEau that allows, among other things, to predict the risk of hydraulic failure under extreme drought. It is based on the formalization of key physiological processes of plant response to water stress. The hydraulic functioning of the plant is at the core of this model, which focuses on both water flows and water pools using variable hydraulic conductances. The model considers the elementary flow of water from the soil to the atmosphere through different plant organs (roots, trunk branches, leaves and buds) that are described by their symplasm and their apoplasm compartments. Within each organ the flow of water between the apoplasm and the symplasm is also represented; as well as the flow outside the system, from the symplasm of each organ to the atmosphere, through the cuticular conductance. For each organ, the symplasm is described by a pressure volume curves and the apoplasm by the vulnerability curve to cavitation of the xylem. The model can thus compute the loss of conductance caused by cavitation, a leading mechanisms of plant desiccation and drought-induced mortality. Some example simulations are shown to illustrate how the model works.",

    "abstract": "Complex diseases are systemic, largely mediated via transcriptional dysregulation in multiple tissues. Thus, knowledge of tissue-specific transcriptome in an individual can provide important information about an individuals health. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions such as blood, skin, and muscle, an individuals tissue-specific transcriptome is not accessible through non-invasive means. However, due to shared genetics and regulatory programs between tissues, the transcriptome in blood may be predictive of those in other tissues, at least to some extent. Here, based on GTEx data, we address this question in a rigorous, systematic manner, for the first time. We find that an individuals whole blood gene expression and splicing profile can predict tissue-specific expression levels in a significant manner (beyond demographic variables) for many genes. On average, across 32 tissues, the expression of about 60% of the genes is predictable from blood expression in a significant manner, with a maximum of 81% of the genes for the musculoskeletal tissue. Remarkably, the tissue-specific expression inferred from the blood transcriptome is almost as good as the actual measured tissue expression in predicting disease state for six different complex disorders, including Hypertension and Type 2 diabetes, substantially surpassing predictors built directly from the blood transcriptome. The code for our pipeline for tissue-specific gene expression prediction - TEEBoT, is provided, enabling others to study its potential translational value in other indications.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 6 million adults in the US have heart failure (HF). HF progression is variable due in part to differences in sex, age, and genetic ancestry. Previous population-based genetic studies have largely focused on cross-sectional data related to HF, a disease known to change over time. Utilizing longitudinal data trajectory probabilities as a continuous trait may increase the likelihood of finding significant, biologically relevant associations in a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis. We analyzed data from the electronic health record in a medical biobank from a single, metropolitan US center to gather clinically pertinent data for analyses. We evaluated whole genome sequencing of 896 unrelated biobank participants, including 494 with at least 1 electrocardiogram and 324 who had more than 1 echocardiogram ([~]3 observations per person). A censored normal distribution multivariable mixture model was used to cluster phenotype measures for genome-wide analyses. GWA analysis on the trajectory probability of the corrected QT measurement (QTc) taken from electrocardiograms identified significant associations with variants in regulatory regions proximal to the WLS gene, which encodes the Wnt ligand secretion mediator, Wntless. WLS was previously associated with QT length using of approximately 16,000 participants supporting the utility of this method to uncover significant genetic associations in small datasets. GWA analysis on the trajectory probability of left ventricular diameter as taken from echocardiograms identified novel significant associations with variants in regulatory regions near MYO10, which encodes the unconventional Myosin-10. We found that trajectory probabilities improved the ability to discover significant and relevant genetic associations. This novel approach increased yield from smaller, well-phenotyped cohorts with longitudinal data from a medical biobank.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYApproximately 6 million adults in the US have heart failure, a disease known to change over time. In a hospital based electronic health record, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, used to evaluate heart failure, can be tracked over time. We utilized these data to create a novel trait that can be applied to genetic analyses. We analyzed genome sequence of 896 biobank participants from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed on a subset of these individuals for heart failure outcomes. A statistical model that incorporates cardiac data that are tracked over time was used to cluster these data using a probabilistic approach. These probabilities were used for a GWA analysis for corrected QT measurement (QTc) and left ventricular diameter (LVID). The QTc interval analysis identified significant correlations with variants in regulatory regions near the WLS gene which encodes the Wnt ligand secretion mediator, Wntless. Analysis of LVID identified significant associations with variants in regulatory regions near the MYO10 gene which encodes the unconventional Myosin-10. Through these analyses, we found that using the trajectory probabilities can facilitate the discovery of novel significant, biologically relevant associations. This method reduces the need for larger cohorts, and increases yield from smaller, well-phenotyped cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Coral bleaching, a process where corals expel their photosynthetic symbionts, has a profound impact on the health and function of coral reefs. As global ocean temperatures continue to rise, bleaching poses the greatest threat to coral reef ecosystems. Here, untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze the biochemicals in pairs of adjacent corals from a patch reef in K[a]ne ohe Bay, Hawai i, where one colony in the pair bleached (in 2015) and recovered while the other did not bleach. There was a strong metabolomic signature of prior bleaching history four years after recovery found in both the host and its algal symbionts. Machine learning analysis determined that the strongest metabolite drivers of the difference in bleaching phenotype were a group of betaine lipids. Those with saturated fatty acids were significantly enriched in thermally tolerant corals and those with longer, unsaturated and diacyl forms were enriched in historically bleached corals. Host immune response molecules, Lyso-PAF and PAF, were also altered by bleaching history and were strongly correlated with symbiont community and algal-derived metabolites suggesting a role of coral immune modulation in symbiont choice and bleaching response. To validate these findings, we tested a separate in situ set of corals and were able to predict the bleaching phenotype with 100% accuracy. Furthermore, corals subjected to an experimental temperature stress had strong phenotype-specific responses in all components of the holobiont, which served to further increase the differences between historical bleaching phenotypes. Thus, we show that natural bleaching susceptibility is simultaneously manifested in the biochemistry of the coral animal and the algal symbiont and that this bleaching history results in different physiological responses to temperature stress. This work provides insight into the biochemical mechanisms involved in coral bleaching and presents a valuable new tool for resilience-based reef restoration.",

    "abstract": "The molecular chaperone 90-kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp90) assists the late-stage folding and activation of diverse types of protein substrates (called clients), including many kinases. Previous studies have established that the Hsp90 homodimer undergoes an ATP-driven cycle through open and closed conformations. Here I propose a model of client activation by Hsp90, which predicts that this cycle enables Hsp90 to use ATP energy to drive a client out of thermodynamic equilibrium toward its active conformation. My model assumes that an Hsp90-bound client can transition between a deactivating conformation and an activating conformation. It suggests that the cochaperone Cdc37 aids Hsp90 to activate kinase clients by differentiating between these two intermediate conformations. My model makes experimentally testable predictions, including how modulating the stepwise kinetics of the Hsp90 cycle--for example, by various cochaperones--affects the activation of different clients. My model may inform client-specific and cell-type-specific therapeutic intervention of Hsp90-mediated protein activation.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiration in mammalian cells not only generates ATP to meet their own energy needs but also couples with biosynthetic pathways to produce metabolites that can be exported to support neighboring cells. However, how defects in mitochondrial respiration influence these biosynthetic and exporting pathways remains poorly understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells is an emerging contributor to the death of their neighboring photoreceptors in degenerative retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration. In this study, we used targeted-metabolomics and 13C tracing to investigate how inhibition of mitochondrial respiration influences the intracellular and extracellular metabolome. We found inhibition of mitochondrial respiration strikingly influenced both the intracellular and extracellular metabolome in primary RPE cells. Intriguingly, the extracellular metabolic changes sensitively reflected the intracellular changes. These changes included substantially enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production, reduced release of pyruvate, citrate and ketone bodies, and massive accumulation of multiple amino acids and nucleosides. In conclusion, these findings reveal a metabolic signature of nutrient consumption and release in mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells. Testing medium metabolites provides a sensitive and noninvasive method to assess mitochondrial function in nutrient utilization and transport.",

    "abstract": "Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prdx2) and other typical 2-Cys Prdxs function as homodimers in which hydrogen peroxide oxidizes each active site cysteine to a sulfenic acid which then condenses with the resolving cysteine on the alternate chain. Previous kinetic studies have considered both sites as equally reactive. Here we have studied Prdx2 using a combination of non-reducing SDS-PAGE to separate reduced monomers and dimers with one and two disulfide bonds, and stopped flow analysis of tryptophan fluorescence, to investigate whether there is cooperativity between the sites. We have observed positive cooperativity when H2O2 is added as a bolus and oxidation of the second site occurs while the first site is present as a sulfenic acid. Modelling of this reaction showed that the second site reacts 2.2 {+/-} 0.1 times faster. In contrast, when H2O2 was generated slowly and the first active site condensed to a disulfide before the second site reacted, no cooperativity was evident. Conversion of the sulfenic acid to the disulfide showed negative cooperativity, with modelling of the exponential rise in tryptophan fluorescence yielding a rate constant of 0.75 {+/-} 0.08 s-1 when the alternate active site was present as a sulfenic acid and 2.29 {+/-} 0.08-fold lower when it was a disulfide. No difference in the rate of hyperoxidation at the two sites was detected. Our findings imply that oxidation of one active site affects the conformation of the second site and influences which intermediate forms of the protein are favored under different cellular conditions.",

A detailed examination of fecal metabolites was performed to investigate the effect of probiotics in formula compared to control formula and breast milk within the first months of life in healthy neonates. A broad metabolomics approach was conceptualized to describe fecal polar and semi-polar metabolites affected by diet within the first year of life. Fecal metabolomes were clearly distinct between formula- and breastfed infants, mainly originating from diet and microbial metabolism. Unsaturated fatty acids and human milk oligosaccharides were increased in breastfed, whereas Maillard products were found in feces of formula-fed children. Altered microbial metabolism was represented by bile acids and aromatic amino acid metabolites. Elevated levels of sulfated bile acids were detected in stool samples of breastfed infants, whereas secondary bile acids were increased in formula-fed infants. Co-microbial metabolism was supported by significant correlation between chenodeoxycholic or lithocholic acid and members of Clostridia. Fecal metabolites showed strong inter- and intra-individual behavior with features uniquely present in certain infants and at specific time points. Nevertheless, metabolite profiles converged at the end of the first year, coincided with solid food introduction.",

Recent surveys of mouse and human brains with single cell transcriptomics1-3 and high-throughput imaging technologies4,5 have uncovered hundreds of neuronal cell types and a variety of non-neuronal cell types distributed in different brain regions, but the cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory programs responsible for the unique identity and function of each brain cell type have yet to be elucidated. Here, we probe the accessible chromatin in >800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions spanning the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to define 491,818 candidate cis regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct sub-types. We link a significant fraction of them to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and uncover transcriptional regulators involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations. Our results provide a foundation for comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs of the mammalian brain and assist in the interpretation of non-coding risk variants associated with various neurological disease and traits in humans.

In cultured neurons, Drp1KO and hAPP converge to produce mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitoCa2+) overload, despite decreasing mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) and cytosolic Ca2+. This mitoCa2+ overload occurs independently of ATP levels. These findings reveal a potential mechanism by which mitochondrial fission protects against hAPP-driven pathology.",

    "abstract": "I.An emerging theme from large-scale genetic screens that identify genes essential for fitness of a cell, is that essentiality of a given gene is highly context-specific and depends on a number of genetic and environmental factors. Identification of such contexts could be the key to defining the function of the gene and also to develop novel therapeutic interventions. Here we present CEN-tools (Context-specific Essentiality Network-tools), a website and an accompanying python package, in which users can interrogate the essentiality of a gene from large-scale genome-scale CRISPR screens in a number of biological contexts including tissue of origin, mutation profiles, expression levels, and drug response levels. We show that CEN-tools is suitable for both the systematic identification of genetic dependencies as well as for targeted queries into the dependencies of specific user-selected genes. The associations between genes and a given context within CEN-tools are represented as dependency networks (CENs) and we demonstrate the utility of these networks in elucidating novel gene functions. In addition, we integrate the dependency networks with existing protein-protein interaction networks to reveal context-dependent essential cellular pathways in cancer cells. Together, we demonstrate the applicability of CEN-tools in aiding the current efforts to define the human cellular dependency map.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth is driven by the acquisition and synthesis of dry biomass and water mass. This study examines the increase of water in T cells biomass during cell growth. We found that T cell growth is initiated by a phase of slow increase of cellular water, followed by a second phase of rapid increase in water content. To study the origin of the water gain, we developed a novel method, Cold Aqua Trap - Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (CAT-IRMS), which allows analysis of intracellular water isotope composition. Applying CAT-IRMS, we discovered that glycolysis-coupled metabolic water accounts on average for 11 femtoliter (fL) out of the 20 fL of water gained per cell during the slow phase. At the end of the rapid phase, before initiation of cell division, a water influx occurs, increasing the water level by three-fold. Thus, activated T cells switch from acquiring metabolic water to incorporating water from the extracellular medium. Our work provides a method to analyze cell water content and an insight into the way cells regulate their water mass.",

Developing a method where toxoid and drug can be assembled immediately prior to in vivo administration has the potential to circumvent some of these issues. Using a phage-display screen, we identified two antibody mimetics, Anti-Cholera Toxoid Affimer (ACTA) -A2 and ACTA-C6 that non-covalently associate with the non-binding face of the cholera toxin B-subunit.

Chemotactic signals entail the motor to switch its direction of rotation. However, other factors such as protonmotive force and torque are involved in switching. In this work, we used peritrichously flagellated E.coli that stochastically tethers on surfaces in random geometries and studied how the cell size and position of the rotational axis affect the output of the motor. We developed a Cell Tethering Analysis Program (CTAP) to measure the length of the cells, the axis of rotation, rotational frequency of tethered cells. A D/L ratio (diameter traced by the cell body to the length of the cell body) was used to quantify the location of the rotational axis wherein, a D/L ratio of 1 and 1.9 means the axis of rotation is at the center of the cell body and near the tip of the cell body respectively. We performed experiments in controlled conditions and quantified the effect of cell size and tethering geometry on the output of the flagellar motor. The estimated torque of the tethered cells was 951 pN.nm and 1390 pN.nm for a D/L ratio of [~]1.0 and [~]1.9 respectively. As the torque increased, the motors rotated exclusively in CCW direction. We conclude that quantifying the cell size and tethering geometry is significant to characterize the output of the flagellar motors in a tethered cell assay.",

    "abstract": "Gardnerella spp. in the vaginal microbiome are associated with bacterial vaginosis, a dysbiosis in which a lactobacilli dominant microbial community is replaced with mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria including Gardnerella species. The co-occurrence of multiple Gardnerella species in the vaginal environment is common, but different species are dominant in different women. Competition for nutrients, particularly glycogen present in the vaginal environment, could play an important role in determining the microbial community structure. Digestion of glycogen into products that can be taken up and further processed by bacteria requires the combined activities of several enzymes collectively known as amylases, which belong to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) within the CAZy classification system. GH13 is a large and diverse family of proteins, making prediction of their activities challenging. SACCHARIS annotation of the GH13 family in Gardnerella resulted in identification of protein domains belonging to eight subfamilies. Phylogenetic analysis of predicted amylase sequences from 26 Gardnerella genomes demonstrated that a putative -glucosidase-encoding sequence, CG400_06090, was conserved in all species in the genus. The predicted -glucosidase enzyme was expressed, purified and functionally characterized. The enzyme was active on a variety of maltooligosaccharides over a broad pH range (4.0 - 8) with maximum activity at pH 7. The Km, kcat and kcat/Km values for the substrate 4-nitrophenyl -D-glucopyranoside were 8.3 M, 0.96 min-1 and 0.11 M-1min-1 respectively. Glucose was released from maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose and maltopentaose, but no products were detected on thin layer chromatography when the enzyme was incubated with glycogen. Our findings show that Gardnerella spp. produce an -glucosidase enzyme that may contribute to the complex and multistep process of glycogen metabolism by releasing glucose from maltooligosaccharides.",

We found that the onion thrips, Thrips tabaci (Lindeman) [Thysanoptera: Thripidae] is proliferating in indoor grown cannabis. Furthermore, our results showed that fresh yields were higher for the plants that initially received zero thrips compared to those that initially received five thrips. Moreover, the biostimulant did not help reduce the impact of thrips. We highlight the importance for growers to carefully monitor thrips infestations in indoor grown cannabis. Finally, we emphasize the need for more research related to the impact of pests on cannabis yields and safe means of pest control for this strictly regulated crop.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Engineered living materials (ELMs) based on bacterial cellulose (BC) offer a promising avenue for cheap-to-produce materials that can be programmed with genetically encoded functionalities. Here we explore how ELMs can be fabricated from millimetre-scale balls of cellulose occasionally produced by Acetobacteriacea species, which we call BC spheroids. We define a reproducible protocol to produce BC spheroids and demonstrate their potential for use as building blocks to grow ELMs in 2D and 3D shapes. These BC spheroids can be genetically functionalized and used as the method to make and grow patterned BC-based ELMs to design. We further demonstrate the use of BC spheroids for the repair and regeneration of BC materials, and measure the survival of the BC-producing bacteria in the material over time. This work forwards our understanding of BC spheroid formation and showcases their potential for creating and repairing engineered living materials.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is important for development and its aberrant regulation contributes to many diseases. The Scar/WAVE complex is essential for Arp2/3 mediated lamellipodia formation during mesenchymal cell migration and several coinciding signals activate it. However, so far, no direct negative regulators are known. We have identified Nance-Horan Syndrome-like 1 protein (NHSL1) as a novel, direct binding partner of the Scar/WAVE complex, which co-localise at protruding lamellipodia. This interaction is mediated by the Abi SH3 domain and two binding sites in NHSL1. Furthermore, active Rac binds to NHSL1 at two regions that mediate leading edge targeting of NHSL1. Surprisingly, NHSL1 inhibits cell migration through its interaction with the Scar/WAVE complex. Mechanistically, NHSL1 may reduce cell migration efficiency by impeding Arp2/3 activity, as measured in cells using a novel Arp2/3 FRET-FLIM biosensor, resulting in reduced F-actin density of lamellipodia, and consequently impairing the stability of lamellipodia protrusions.",

Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as thousands of isolates are being sequenced around the world and deposited in public data repositories. A number of methods using both short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach and represents a cost-effective and highly scalable method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.",

    "abstract": "mRNA translation is one of the most energy-demanding processes for living cells, alterations of which have been frequently documented in human disease. Using recently developed technologies that enable image-based quantitation of overall translation levels, we here conducted a chemical screen to evaluate how medically approved drugs, as well as drugs that are currently under development, influence overall translation levels. Consistent with current knowledge, inhibitors of the mTOR signaling pathway were the most represented class among translation suppresors. In addition, we identified that inhibitors of sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) also reduce mRNA translation levels independently of mTOR. Mechanistically this is explained by an effect of the compounds on the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, which activates the integrated stress response (ISR). Accordingly, the impact of SPHK inhibitors on translation is alleviated by the concomitant inhibition of ISR kinases. On the other hand, and despite the large number of molecules tested, our study failed to identify chemicals capable of substantially increasing mRNA translation, raising doubts on to what extent translation can be supra-physiologically stimulated in mammalian cells. In summary, our study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the effect of known drugs on protein translation and has helped to unravel a new link between lipid metabolism and mRNA translation in human cells.",

The ACE2 gene is expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells, including Type II Pneumocytes (Ziegler, 2020), and is activated by interferons. Viral RNA was also detected in breast milk (Wu et al., 2020), raising the possibility that ACE2 expression is under the control of cytokines through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we show that Ace2 expression in mammary tissue is induced during pregnancy and lactation, which coincides with the establishment of a candidate enhancer. The prolactin-activated transcription factor STAT5 binds to tandem sites that coincide with activating histone enhancer marks and additional transcription components. The presence of pan JAK-STAT components in mammary alveolar cells and in Type II Pneumocytes combined with the autoregulation of both STAT1 and STAT5 suggests a prominent role of cytokine signaling pathways in cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale re-engineering of synonymous sites is a promising strategy to generate attenuated viruses for vaccines. Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinculeotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies, that aim to force nucleotide usage against the estimated direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards T with concomitant selection against T. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed TT content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. A significantly different mutational profile at CDS sites that are not 4-fold degenerate is consistent with contemporaneous selection against T mutations more widely. Although selection against CpG dinucleotides is expected to drive synonymous site G+C content below mutational equilibrium, observed G+C content is slightly above equilibrium, possibly because of selection for higher expression. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily informed gene-bespoke approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 across the world has posed unprecedented and global challenges on multiple fronts. Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases. Using bioinformatics and structural modeling approach, we modeled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS-CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminal regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modeling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated proton channel. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds. Additionally, two distinct \u201ccore\u201d structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral proton channeling activity which may play a critical role in viral infection. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for generating therapeutic interventions against the virus.One Sentence Summary Structural modeling of the novel coronavirus envelope proteins (E-proteins) demonstrating its possible proton channeling activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Large vertebrates are extremely sensitive to anthropogenic pressure, and their populations are declining fast. The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is a paradigmatic case: this African megaherbivore suffered a remarkable population reduction in the last 150 years due to human activities. The two white rhinoceros subspecies, the northern (NWR) and the southern white rhinoceros (SWR), however, underwent opposite fates: the NWR vanished quickly after the onset of the decline, while the SWR recovered after a severe bottleneck. Such demographic events are predicted to have an erosive effect at the genomic level, in connection with the extirpation of diversity, and increased genetic drift and inbreeding. However there is currently little empirical data available that allows us to directly reconstruct the subtleties of such processes in light of distinct demographic histories. Therefore to assess these effects, we generated a whole-genome, temporal dataset consisting of 52 re-sequenced white rhinoceros genomes, that represents both subspecies at two time windows: before and during/after the bottleneck. Our data not only reveals previously unknown population substructure within both subspecies, but allowed us to quantify the genomic erosion undergone by both, with post-bottleneck white rhinoceroses harbouring significantly fewer heterozygous sites, and showing higher inbreeding coefficients than pre-bottleneck individuals. Moreover, the effective population size suffered a decrease of two and three orders of magnitude in the NWR and SWR respectively, due to the recent bottleneck. Our data therefore provides much needed empirical support for theoretical predictions about the genomic consequences of shrinking populations, information that is relevant for understanding the process of population extinction. Furthermore, our findings have the potential to inform management approaches for the conservation of the remaining white rhinoceroses.",

The widespread coexistence of resistant and sensitive bacteria in microbial systems presents an especially frustrating paradox. Recent advances in ecological coexistence theory offer a powerful framework to probe the mechanisms regulating intra- and inter-specific coexistence, but the significance of this body of theory to the problem of antimicrobial resistance has been largely overlooked. In this Perspectives article, we draw on emerging ecological theory to illustrate how changes in both competitive ability and niche overlap are critical for understanding costs of resistance and the persistence of pathogens in microbial systems. We then show how trade-offs in resource acquisition strategies can have counter-intuitive consequences for the coexistence of resistant and susceptible genotypes in variable environments.

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages) are being considered as alternative therapeutics for the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Considering phages have narrow host-ranges, it is generally accepted that therapeutic phages will have a marginal impact on non-target bacteria. We have discovered that lytic phage infection induces transcription of type VIIb secretion system (T7SS) genes in the pathobiont Enterococcus faecalis. Membrane damage during phage infection induces T7SS gene expression resulting in cell contact dependent antagonism of different Gram positive bystander bacteria. Deletion of essB, a T7SS structural component, abrogates phage-mediated killing of bystanders. A predicted immunity gene confers protection against T7SS mediated inhibition, and disruption of its upstream LXG toxin gene rescues growth of E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus bystanders. Phage induction of T7SS gene expression and bystander inhibition requires IreK, a serine/threonine kinase, and OG1RF_11099, a predicted GntR-family transcription factor. Additionally, sub-lethal doses of membrane targeting and DNA damaging antibiotics activated T7SS expression independent of phage infection, triggering T7SS antibacterial activity against bystander bacteria. Our findings highlight how phage infection and antibiotic exposure of a target bacterium can affect non-target bystander bacteria and implies that therapies beyond antibiotics, such as phage therapy, could impose collateral damage to polymicrobial communities.\n\nAuthor SummaryRenewed interest in phages as alternative therapeutics to combat multi-drug resistant bacterial infections, highlights the importance of understanding the consequences of phage-bacteria interactions in the context of microbial communities. Although it is well established that phages are highly specific for their host bacterium, there is no clear consensus on whether or not phage infection (and thus phage therapy) would impose collateral damage to non-target bacteria in polymicrobial communities. Here we provide direct evidence of how phage infection of a clinically relevant pathogen triggers an intrinsic type VII secretion system (T7SS) antibacterial response that consequently restricts the growth of neighboring bacterial cells that are not susceptible to phage infection. Phage induction of T7SS activity is a stress response and in addition to phages, T7SS antagonism can be induced using sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics that facilitate membrane or DNA damage. Together these data show that a bacterial pathogen responds to diverse stressors to induce T7SS activity which manifests through the antagonism of neighboring non-kin bystander bacterial cells.",

We found that it displayed higher sensitivity towards lysocin E, a menaquinone (MK) targeting antibiotic, compared to other S. aureus strains. Therefore, we further explored the mechanism of this hypersensitivity.\n\nMethodsMK production was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis. S. aureus Smith genome sequence was completed using a hybrid assembly approach, and the MK biosynthetic genes were compared with other S. aureus strains. The hepT gene was cloned and introduced into S. aureus RN4220 strain using phage mediated recombination, and lysocin E sensitivity was analyzed by the measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration and colony-forming units.\n\nResultsWe found that Smith strain produced MKs with the length of the side chain ranging between 8 - 10, as opposed to other S. aureus strains that produce MKs 7 - 9. We revealed that Smith strain possessed the classical pathway for MK biosynthesis like the other S. aureus. HepT, a polyprenyl diphosphate synthase involved in chain elongation of isoprenoid, in Smith strain was unique with a Q25P substitution. Introduction of hepT from Smith to RN4220 led to the production of MK-10 and an increased sensitivity towards lysocin E.\n\nConclusionsWe found that HepT was responsible for the definition of isoprenoid chain length of MKs and antibiotic sensitivity.",
