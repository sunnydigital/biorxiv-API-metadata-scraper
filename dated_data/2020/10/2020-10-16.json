    "abstract": "SignificanceIdentification of causal variants and genes underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci is essential to understanding the biology of alcohol use disorder (AUD).\n\nMethodsIntegration of \"multi-omics\" data is often necessary to nominate candidate causal variants and genes and prioritize them for follow up studies. Here, we used Mendelian randomization to integrate AUD and drinks per week (DPW) GWAS summary statistics with the gene expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (eQTLs and mQTLs) in the largest brain and myeloid datasets. We also used AUD-related single cell epigenetic data to nominate candidate causal variants and genes associated with DPW and AUD.\n\nResultsOur multi-omics integration analyses prioritized unique as well as shared genes and pathways among AUD and DPW. The GWAS variants associated with both AUD and DPW showed significant enrichment in the promoter regions of fetal and adult brains. The integration of GWAS SNPs with mQTLs from fetal brain prioritized variants on chromosome 11 in both AUD and DPW GWASs. The co-localized variants were found to be overlapping with promoter marks for SPI1, specifically in human microglia, the myeloid cells of the brain. The co-localized SNPs were also strongly associated with SPI1 mRNA expression in myeloid cells from peripheral blood. The prioritized variant at this locus is predicted to alter the binding site for a transcription factor, RXRA, a key player in the regulation of myeloid cell function. Our analysis also identified MAPT as a candidate causal gene specifically associated with DPW. mRNA expression of MAPT was also correlated with daily amounts of alcohol intake in post-mortem brains (frontal cortex) from alcoholics and controls (N = 92). Results may be queried and visualized in an online public resource of these integrative analysis (https://lcad.shinyapps.io/alc_multiomics/). These results highlight overlap between causal genes for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol use disorder and alcohol consumption.\n\nIn conclusionintegrating GWAS summary statistics with multi-omics datasets from multiple sources identified biological similarities and differences between typical alcohol intake and disordered drinking highlighting molecular heterogeneity that might inform future targeted functional and cross-species studies. Interestingly, overlap was also observed with causal genes for neurodegenerative diseases.",

This malleability of binding makes antibodies an important class of biological drugs and biomarkers. In this article, we propose a method to identify which amino acid residues of an antibody directly interact with its associated antigen based on the features from sequence and structure. Our algorithm uses convolution neural networks (CNNs) linked with graph convolution networks (GCNs) to make use of information from both sequential and spatial neighbors to understand more about the local environment of target amino acid residue.

To dissect core promoter function, we carried out a comprehensive structure-function analysis to measure synthetic promoters activities, with and without an external stimulus (hormonal activation). By using robotics and a dual-luciferase reporter assay, we tested [~]3000 mutational variants representing 19 different Drosophila melanogaster promoter architectures. We explored the impact of different types of mutations, including knockout of individual sequence motifs and motif combinations, variations of motif strength, positioning, and flanking sequences. We observe strong effects of the mutations on activity, and a linear combination of the individual motif features can largely account for the combinatorial effects on core promoter activity.

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with prominent autonomic and motor features. Different disease subtypes are distinguished by their predominant parkinsonian or cerebellar signs. The pathognomonic feature of MSA is the presence of -synuclein (Syn) protein deposits in glial cells of the central and peripheral nervous system. It is unclear why MSA, that invariably presents with Syn pathology, is clinically so heterogeneous, why it progresses at varying rates and how neuroinflammation affects disease progression. Recently, it was shown that different strains of Syn can assemble in unique disease environments but also that a variety of strains might exist in the brain of MSA patients. We therefore investigated if different Syn strains might influence MSA disease progression. To this aim, we injected two recombinant strains of Syn in MSA transgenic mice and found that they significantly impact MSA disease progression in a strain-dependent way via oligodendroglial, neurotoxic and immune-related mechanisms. Neurodegeneration and brain atrophy were accompanied by unique microglial and astroglial responses and the recruitment of central and peripheral immune cells. The differential activation of microglial cells correlated with the structural features of Syn strains both in vitro and in vivo. By injecting Syn strains in MSA mice we could more closely mimic a comprehensive MSA phenotype in an experimental setting. This study therefore shows that i) MSA phenotype is governed by both the Syn strain nature and the host environment and ii) Syn strains can directly trigger a detrimental immune response related to disease progression in MSA.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication timing and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation occur across large domains associated with distinct epigenome patterns to functionally compartmentalise genome regulation. However, it is still unclear if alternations in the epigenome, in particular cancer-related DNA hypomethylation, can directly result in alterations to cancer higher order genome architecture. Here, we use Hi-C and single cell Repli-Seq, in the colorectal cancer DNMT1 and DNMT3B DNA methyltransferases double knockout model, to determine the impact of DNA hypomethylation on replication timing and 3D genome organisation. First, we find that the hypomethylated cells show a striking loss of replication timing precision with gain of cell-to-cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of 3D genome compartmentalisation. Second, hypomethylated regions that undergo a large change in replication timing also show loss of allelic replication timing, including at cancer-related genes. Finally, we observe the formation of broad ectopic H3K4me3-H3K9me3 domains across hypomethylated regions where late replication is maintained, that potentially prevent aberrant transcription and loss of genome organisation after DNA demethylation. Together, our results highlight a previously underappreciated role for DNA methylation in maintenance of 3D genome architecture.",

    "abstract": "The hypophysis functions as a central gland of the neuroendocrine system for regulating fundamental body physiology. Upon aging, several hormones produced by the endocrine system are dramatically altered. Recently, Nothobranchius furzeri (the turquoise killifish) has become a popular model for aging studies because of its short lifespan and highly conserved aging phenotypes. However, the anatomical details of the major neuroendocrine system of the killifish have not been investigated so far. In this study, we have identified the pituitary and pineal glands of the turquoise killifish, which are critical components of the brain endocrine system. These two neuroendocrine glands were weakly attached to the main body of the killifish brain. The pineal gland was located on the dorsal part of the brain, while the pituitary gland was located on the ventral part. Brain sections containing pineal and pituitary glands were performed and revealed that cells in both the pituitary and pineal glands are densely placed than any other regions of brain. Further, three-dimensional images both in pineal and pituitary glands were uncovered their distinctive cellular arrangements. Vasopressin intestinal peptide (VIP) was strongly expressed in the neurohypophysis of the pituitary gland. Glial cells were found inside the pineal gland, while astrocytes covered the outside. These findings illustrate basic features of the neuroendocrine system of Nothobranchius furzeri.",

Nevertheless, some studies have shown relatively low predictive power for these floral trait combinations. This discrepancy may be caused by changes in the importance of specific floral traits for shaping interactions under different environmental conditions and for different pollinator groups. To test this, we studied pollination systems and floral traits along an elevational gradient on Mount Cameroon during wet and dry seasons. Using Random Forest models, allowing the ranking of traits by significance, we demonstrated that some floral traits are more important than others in shaping interactions and that these traits predict pollinators relatively well. However, the distribution and importance of traits varies under different environmental conditions. Our results imply the need to improve our trait-based understanding of plant-pollinator interactions to better inform the debate surrounding pollination syndrome hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite its high prevalence and extensive efforts to develop neuroprotective therapies, effective treatments for TBI are still limited. Among important neuronal damages, TBI induces structural and functional alterations of astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain. Injured astrocytes respond in diverse mechanisms that result in reactive astrogliosis and are involved in the physiopathological mechanisms of TBI in an extensive and sophisticated manner. The establishment of effective neuroprotective treatments for TBI requires to better understand the complex biochemical interactions between activated astrocytes and neurons that contribute to the secondary injury. To address this challenge, we studied in vitro the role of mechanically injured astrocytes on the growth and synaptic connections of cortical neuronal networks of controlled architectures grown on well-defined protein micropatterns. Astrocytes were cultivated on elastic membranes and mechanically activated by stretching cycles. The culture media of healthy or activated astrocytes was then introduced on neuronal networks. We analyzed the neuronal viability, the neurite growth and the synaptic density of neuronal networks to understand the role of the inflammatory molecules secreted by mechanically activated astrocytes. Furthermore, we cultivated neuronal networks during 13 days with different doses of TNF- in order to decipher its individual contribution among the other cytokines. Here we show that the ratio of tubulin to synapsin area was significantly higher in neuronal networks treated with either 4 or 2 doses of TNF-, suggesting that TNF- can promote the tubulin polymerization process. Assuming that TNF- can bind to either TNFR1 or TNFR2 receptors, which lead respectively to the cell survival or the cell apoptosis, we studied the modulation of the both TNF- receptors in response to the medium of mechanically activated astrocytes and different doses of TNF-. Our findings indicate that the amount of both receptors increases with the maturation of the network. In addition, we observed a significant modulation of the amount of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in response to the media of injured astrocytes that leads to a large imbalance between both receptors, suggesting an important role for TNF-signaling in the physiopathological mechanisms of TBI.",

    "abstract": "Female chemical signals underlie the advertising of sexual receptivity and fertility. Whether the body odor of a pregnant woman also has a signaling function with respect to male behavior is yet to be conclusively established. This study examines how the body odors of ovulating and pregnant women differentially affect the behavior of heterosexual men.\n\nBody odor samples were collected from 5 pregnant women and 5 matched controls during ovulation. In a double-blind functional magnetic resonance imaging design, 18 heterosexual men were exposed to female body odors during ovulation (OV) and pregnancy (PRG) while being required to indicate the attractiveness of concurrently presented female portrait images. The participants were also required to indicate whether they assumed a depicted woman was pregnant.\n\nWhile neither OV nor PRG altered the perceived attractiveness of a presented face, the men tended to identify the women as pregnant while exposed to a PRG body odor. On the neural level, OV activated a network of the frontotemporal and limbic regions, while PRG activated the superior medial frontal gyrus.\n\nThe results suggest that the detection of sexual availability activates the male brain regions associated with face processing and reward/motivation, whereas sensing pregnancy activates a region responsible for empathy and prosocial behavior. Thus, the female body odor during pregnancy likely helps foster circumstances conducive to the future care of offspring while the body odor advertising sexual availability promotes mating behavior. The brains of heterosexual men may be capable of unconsciously discriminating between these two types of olfactory stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), applied to two brain sites with different phase lags, has been shown to modulate stimulation-outlasting functional EEG connectivity between the targeted regions. Given the lack of knowledge on mechanisms of tACS aftereffects, it is difficult to further enhance effect sizes and reduce variability in experiments. In this computational study, we tested if spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can explain stimulation-outlasting connectivity modulation by dual-site tACS and explored the effects of tACS parameter choices. Two populations of spiking neurons were coupled with synapses subject to STDP, and results were validated via a re-analysis of EEG data. Our simulations showed stimulation-outlasting connectivity changes between in- and anti-phase tACS, dependent on both tACS frequency and synaptic conduction delays. Importantly, both a simple network entraining to a wide range of tACS frequencies as well as a more realistic network that spontaneously oscillated at alpha frequency predicted that the largest effects would occur for short conduction delays between the stimulated regions. This finding agreed with experimental EEG connectivity modulation by 10 Hz tACS, showing a clear negative correlation of tACS effects with estimated conduction delays between regions. In conclusion, STDP can explain connectivity aftereffects of dual-site tACS. However, not all combinations of tACS frequency and application sites are expected to effectively modulate connectivity via STDP. We therefore suggest using appropriate computational models and/or EEG analysis for planning and interpretation of dual-site tACS studies relying on aftereffects.\n\nHighlightsO_LINetwork model with STDP explains EEG connectivity change after dual-site tACS\nC_LIO_LIEffects are predicted to depend on tACS frequency and conduction delays\nC_LIO_LIEEG data confirm dependence on conduction delays between regions\nC_LIO_LIModel can be used to estimate and maximize experimental effects\nC_LI",

However, knowledge of their hosts is limited because only a few NCLDVs have been isolated so far. Taking advantage of the recent large-scale marine metagenomics census, in silico host prediction approaches are expected to fill the gap and further expand our knowledge of virus-host relationships for unknown NCLDVs. In this study, we built co-occurrence networks of NCLDVs and eukaryotic taxa to predict virus-host interactions using Tara Oceans sequencing data. Using the positive likelihood ratio to assess the performance of host prediction for NCLDVs, we benchmarked several co-occurrence approaches and demonstrated an increase in the odds ratio of predicting true positive relationships four-fold compared with random host predictions. To further refine host predictions from high-dimensional co-occurrence networks, we developed a phylogeny-informed filtering method, Taxon Interaction Mapper, and showed it further improved the prediction performance by twelve-fold. Finally, we inferred virophage - NCLDV networks to corroborate that co-occurrence approaches are effective for predicting interacting partners of NCLDVs in marine environments.\n\nImportanceNCLDVs can infect a wide range of eukaryotes although their life cycle is less dependent on hosts compared with other viruses. However, our understanding of NCLDV- host systems is highly limited because few of these viruses have been isolated so far. Co-occurrence information has been assumed to be useful to predict virus-host interactions. In this study, we quantitatively show the effectiveness of co-occurrence inference for NCLDV host prediction. We also improve the prediction performance with a phylogeny-guided method, which leads to a concise list of candidate host lineages for three NCLDV families. Our results underpin the usage of co-occurrence approach for metagenomic exploration of the ecology of this diverse group of viruses.",

The method was tested on a large-scale benchmark set of proteins containing up to twelve continuous and discontinuous domains with medium-to-low-resolution density maps, where DEMO-EM produced models with correct inter-domain orientations (TM-score >0.5) for 98% of cases and significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. DEMO-EM was applied to SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus genome and generated models with average TM-score/RMSD of 0.97/1.4[A] to the deposited structures. These results demonstrated an efficient pipeline that enables automated and reliable large-scale multi-domain protein structure modeling with atomic-level accuracy from cryo-EM maps.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "We developed a global peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that addresses the dual challenges of heterogeneity in the immune responses of different individuals and potential heterogeneity of the infecting virus. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 is a polypeptide vaccine containing nine 30-mer peptides derived from all four major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents blood investigated, 1-5 months after symptom onset. The PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific T cell repertoire used for recovery from COVID-19 was extremely diverse: donors had an average of seven different peptide-specific T cells, against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins; 87% of donors had multiple targets against at least three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 53% against all four. In addition, PEPIs determined based on the complete HLA class I genotype of the convalescent donors were validated, with 84% accuracy, to predict PEPI-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured for the individuals. Extrapolation of the above findings to a US bone marrow donor cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities (n=1,000 each ethnic group) suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination in a general population will likely elicit broad, multi-antigenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity, including Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) cohorts.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly virus that is causing the global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our immune system plays a critical role in preventing, clearing, and treating the virus, but aberrant immune responses can contribute to deleterious symptoms and mortality. Many aspects of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated, but little is known about immune responses to carbohydrates. Since the surface of the virus is heavily glycosylated, pre-existing antibodies to glycans could potentially recognize the virus and influence disease progression. Furthermore, antibody responses to carbohydrates could be induced, affecting disease severity and clinical outcome. In this study, we used a carbohydrate antigen microarray with over 800 individual components to profile serum anti-glycan antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy control subjects. In COVID-19 patients, we observed abnormally high IgG and IgM antibodies to numerous self-glycans, including gangliosides, N-linked glycans, LacNAc-containing glycans, blood group H, and sialyl Lewis X. Some of these anti-glycan antibodies are known to play roles in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, which may help explain some of the unusual and prolonged symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies to self-glycans has important implications for using convalescent serum to treat patients, developing safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and understanding the risks of infection. In addition, this study provides new insight into the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates the importance of including host and viral carbohydrate antigens when studying immune responses to viruses.",

    "abstract": "Effective methods for predicting COVID-19 disease trajectories are urgently needed. Here, ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis mapped antibody epitopes in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n = 86) experiencing a wide-range of disease states. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including admission to the ICU, requirement for ventilators, or death. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within six days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate with various comorbidities and hallmarks of immune hyperactivity. We introduce a simple-to-calculate, disease risk factor score to quantitate each patients comorbidities and age. For patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies, scores above 3.0 predict more severe disease outcomes with a 13.42 Likelihood Ratio (96.7% specificity). The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 prognostic to allow early identification and triage of high-risk patients. Such information could guide more effective therapeutic intervention.\n\nSignificance statementThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide. Despite efforts to fight the virus, the disease continues to overwhelm hospitals with severely ill patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is readily accomplished through a multitude of reliable testing platforms; however, prognostic prediction remains elusive. To this end, we identified a short epitope from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and also a disease risk factor score based upon comorbidities and age. The presence of antibodies specifically binding to this epitope plus a score cutoff can predict severe COVID-19 outcomes with 96.7% specificity.",

    "abstract": "The first mitosis of the mammalian embryo must partition the parental genomes contained in two pronuclei. In rodent zygotes, sperm centrosomes are degraded and, instead, acentriolar microtubule organizing centers and microtubule self-organization guide the assembly of two separate spindles around the genomes. In non-rodent mammals, including human or bovine, centrosomes are inherited from the sperm and have been widely assumed to be active. Whether non-rodent zygotes assemble a single centrosomal spindle around both genomes, or follow the dual spindle self-assembly pathway is unclear. To address this, we investigated spindle assembly in bovine zygotes by systematic immunofluorescence and real-time light-sheet microscopy. We show that two independent spindles form around the parental genomes despite the presence of centrosomes, which had little effect on spindle structure and were only loosely connected to the two spindles. We conclude that the dual spindle assembly pathway is conserved in non-rodent mammals. This could explain whole parental genome loss frequently observed in blastomeres of human IVF embryos.\n\nSummaryThis study investigates spindle assembly during the first embryonic division in bovine zygotes that, like human, inherit centrosomes from the sperm.

Here we resolved this issue by developing a de novo lipid labeling method for major lipid species, including glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and cholesterol esters by using a single fluorescent probe. The method not only allowed us to probe the precise subcellular distribution and trafficking of individual lipid species in live cells, but also uncovered some unexpected biological functions of previously reported lipid metabolic enzymes that were not possible by conventional biochemical methods.

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been considered to deliver biological cargos between cells and mediate intercellular communication. However, the mechanisms that underlie the biological process of EV uptake and cytoplasmic cargo release in recipient cells are largely unknown. Quantitative and real-time assays for assessment of the cargo delivery efficiency inside recipient cells have not been feasible. In this study, we developed an EV cargo delivery (EVCD) assay using a split luciferase called the NanoBiT system. Recipient cells expressing LgBiT, a large subunit of luciferase, emit luminescence when the EV cargo proteins fused with a small luminescence tag (HiBiT tag) that can complement LgBiT are delivered to the cytoplasm of recipient cells. Using the EVCD assay, the cargo delivery efficiency of EVs could be quantitatively measured in real time. This assay was highly sensitive in detecting a single event of cargo delivery per cell. We found that modification of EVs with a virus-derived fusogenic protein significantly enhanced the cytoplasmic cargo delivery; however, in the absence of a fusogenic protein, the cargo delivery efficiency of EVs was below the threshold of the assay. The EVCD assay could assess the effect of entry inhibitors on EV cargo delivery. Furthermore, using a luminescence microscope, the cytoplasmic cargo delivery of EVs was directly visualized in living cells. This assay could reveal the biological mechanism of the cargo delivery processes of EVs.",

    "abstract": "Due to the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for reliable high-throughput serological assays in order to evaluate the immunological responses against SARS-COV-2 virus and to enable population screening, as well as vaccines and drugs efficacy testing. Several serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are now becoming available in the market. However, it has also become extremely important to have well-established assays with desirable high sensitivity and specificity. To date, the micro-neutralization (MN) assay, is currently considered the gold-standard being capable of evaluating and detecting, functional neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Several protocols exist for microneutralization assays which vary in several steps of the protocol: cell seeding conditions, number of cells seeded, virus amount used in the infection step, virus-serum-cells incubation period etc. These potential differences account for a high degree of variability and inconsistency of the results and using a harmonized protocol for the micro-neutralization assay could potentially solve this.\n\nGiven this situation, the main aim of our study was to carry out SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus MN assay in order to investigate which optimal tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) infective dose in use is the most adequate choice for implementation in terms of reproducibility, standardization possibilities and comparability of results. Therefore, we assessed the MN by using two different viral infective doses: a standard dose of 100 TCID50/well and a lower dose of 25 TCID50/well. The results obtained, yielded by MN on using the lower infective dose (25 TCID50), were in line with those obtained with the standard infective dose; in some cases, however, we detected a titre that was one or two dilution steps higher, which maintained all negative samples negative. This suggesting that the lower dose can potentially have a positive impact on the detection and estimation of neutralizing antibodies present in a given sample, showing higher sensitivity but similar specificity and therefore, it would require a more accurate assessment and cross-laboratories standardisation especially when MN is employed as serological assay of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate mammals express a protein called Ki-67 which is most widely known as a clinically useful marker of highly proliferative cells. Previous studies of human cells indicated that acute depletion of Ki-67 can elicit a delay at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle, dependent on induction of the checkpoint protein p21. Consistent with those observations, we show here that acute Ki-67 depletion causes hallmarks of DNA damage, and the damage occurs even in the absence of checkpoint signaling. This damage is not observed in cells traversing S phase but is instead robustly detected in mitotic cells. The C-terminal chromatin binding domain of Ki-67 is necessary and sufficient to protect cells from this damage. We also observe synergistic effects when Ki-67 and p53 are simultaneously depleted, resulting in increased levels of chromosome bridges at anaphase, followed by the appearance of micronuclei. Therefore, these studies identify the C-terminus of Ki-67 as an important module for genome stability.",

    "abstract": "Evolution and diversification of cell types has contributed to animal evolution. However, gene regulatory mechanisms underlying cell fate acquisition during development remains largely uncharacterized in spiralians. Here we use a whole-organism, single-cell transcriptomic approach to map larval cell types in the annelid Capitella teleta at 24- and 48-hours post gastrulation (stages 4 and 5). We identified eight unique cell clusters (undifferentiated precursors, ectoderm, muscle, ciliary-band, gut, neurons, neurosecretory cells and protonephridia), thus helping to identify previously uncharacterized molecular signatures such as novel neurosecretory cell markers. Analysis of coregulatory programs in individual clusters revealed gene interactions that can be used for comparisons of cell types across taxa. We examined the neural and neurosecretory clusters more deeply and characterized a differentiation trajectory starting from dividing precursors to neurons using Monocle3 and velocyto. Pseudotime analysis along this trajectory identified temporally-distinct cell states undergoing progressive gene expression changes over time. Our data revealed two potentially distinct neural differentiation trajectories including an early trajectory for brain neurosecretory cells. This work provides a valuable resource for future functional investigations to better understanding neurogenesis and the transitions from neural precursors to neurons in an annelid.",

    "abstract": "Calcium is a ubiquitous and versatile second messenger that plays a central role in the development and function of a wide range of cell types, tissues and organs. Despite significant recent progress in the understanding of calcium (Ca2+) signalling in organs such as the developing and adult brain, we have relatively little knowledge of the contribution of Ca2+ to the development of tubes, structures widely present in multicellular organisms. Here we image Ca2+ dynamics in the developing notochord of Ciona intestinalis. We show that notochord cells exhibit distinct Ca2+ dynamics during specific morphogenetic events such as cell intercalation, cell elongation and tubulogenesis. We used an optogenetically controlled Ca2+ actuator to show that sequestration of Ca2+ results in defective notochord cell intercalation, and pharmacological inhibition to reveal that stretch-activated ion channels (SACs), inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) signalling, Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE), Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and gap junctions are required for regulating notochord Ca2+ activity during tubulogenesis. Cytoskeletal rearrangements drive the cell shape changes that accompany tubulogenesis. In line with this, we show that Ca2+ signalling modulates reorganization of the cytoskeletal network across the morphogenetic events leading up to and during tubulogenesis of the notochord. We additionally demonstrate that perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton drastically remodels Ca2+ dynamics, suggesting a feedback mechanism between actin dynamics and Ca2+ signalling during notochord development. This work provides a framework to quantitatively define how Ca2+ signalling regulates tubulogenesis using the notochord as model organ, a defining structure of all chordates.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACTIn a previous work, we showed that favipiravir, a promising drug with antiviral activity against a number of RNA viruses, led to the extinction of RVFV from infected cell cultures. Nevertheless, certain drug concentrations allowed the recovery of a virus variant showing increased resistance to favipiravir. In this work, we characterized this novel resistant variant both at genomic and phenotypic level in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the resistant virus displayed reduced growth rates in insect cells and was highly attenuated but still immunogenic in vivo. Some amino acid substitutions were identified in the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene and in the encoded IFN antagonist NSs gene, in catalytic core motifs and nuclear localization associated positions respectively. These data may help to characterize novel potential virulence markers, offering additional strategies for further safety improvements of RVF live attenuated vaccine candidates.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLive attenuated virus vaccines usually provide long lasting immune responses upon administration. These vaccines are not recommended for use in immune compromised hosts, due to the presence of uncontrolled residual virulence. Cell culture virus propagation in the presence of mutagenic drugs often results in weakened virus lacking virulence as well as limited spreading capabilities. Here, we have characterized a mutagen-induced RVFV variant (40F-p8) that is not virulent in a highly sensitive mouse strain lacking antiviral response. The observed lack of virulence correlates with the presence of specific mutations along key residues in the viral genome, unveiling potential virulence determinants. Thus, 40F-p8 constitutes the basis for a novel RVFV vaccine strain with additional safety features.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding depression is a key factor in the evolution of mating strategies and breeding systems across the eukaryotic tree of life. Yet its potential impact in partially asexual species has only received little attention. We studied inbreeding depression in the cyclical parthenogen Daphnia magna by following mixtures of inbred and outbred genotypes from an early embryonic stage through hatching to adulthood and then across several asexual generations. We found that, across asexual generations, the frequency of inbred genotypes strongly and constantly decreased, until the experimental populations were almost entirely made up of outbred genotypes. The resulting estimate of inbreeding depression across the entire life cycle was almost 100 %, much higher than previous estimates for this and other similar species. Our results illustrate that the magnitude of inbreeding depression may be severely underestimated in studies that use fitness components or proxies instead of compound fitness estimates across the entire life, as well as in experimental studies with substantial pre-experimental mortality. More generally, our results suggest that inbreeding depression may play an important role in the evolution of partially asexual life cycles because clonal reproduction maintains inbreeding levels, and hence the negative effects of inbreeding accumulate across subsequent asexual generations.",

A comprehensive understanding of the distributions of different genetic variants is important for insights into genetic functions and disorders.\n\nMethodsHerein, a sliding-window scan of regional densities of eight kinds of germline genetic variants, including single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) and four size-classes of copy-number-variations (CNVs) in the human genome has been performed.\n\nResultsThe study has identified 44,379 hotspots with high genetic-variant densities, and 1,135 hotspot clusters comprising more than one type of hotspots, accounting for 3.1% and 0.2% of the genome respectively. The hotspots and clusters are found to co-localize with different functional genomic features, as exemplified by the associations of hotspots of middle-size CNVs with histone-modification sites, work with balancing and positive selections to meet the need for diversity in immune proteins, and facilitate the development of sensory-perception and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways in the function-sparse late-replicating genomic sequences. Genetic variants of different lengths co-localize with retrotransposons of different ages on a  long-with-young and  short-with-all basis. Hotspots and clusters are highly associated with tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes (p < 10-10), and enriched with somatic tumour CNVs and the trait- and disease-associated SNPs identified by genome-wise association studies, exceeding tenfold enrichment in clusters comprising SNPs and extra-long CNVs.\n\nConclusionsIn conclusion, the genetic-variant hotspots and clusters represent two-edged swords that spearhead both positive and negative genomic changes. Their strong associations with complex traits and diseases also open up a potential  Common Disease-Hotspot Variant approach to the missing heritability problem.",

    "abstract": "Genetic testing is widely used in evaluating a patients predisposition for developing a malignancy. In the case of cancer, when a functionally impactful inherited mutation (i.e. genetic variant) is identified in a disease-relevant gene, the patient is at elevated risk of developing a lesion in their lifetime. Unfortunately, as the rate and coverage of genetic testing has accelerated, our ability to make informed assessments regarding the functional status of the variants has lagged. Currently, there are two main strategies for assessing variant functions: in silico predictions or in vitro testing. The first approach is to build generalist computational prediction software using theoretical parameters such as amino acid conservation as feature inputs. These types of software can classify any variant of any gene. Although versatile, their non-specific design and theoretical assumptions result in different models frequently producing conflicting classifications. The second approach is to develop gene-specific assays. Although each assay is tailored to the physiological function of the gene, this approach requires significant investments. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more practical, streamlined and cost-effective methods. To directly address these issues, we designed a new approach of using alterations in protein subcellular localization as a key indicator of loss of function. Thus, new variants can be rapidly functionalized by using high-content microscopy. To facilitate the analysis of large amounts of image data, we developed a new software, named MAPS for machine-assisted phenotype scoring, that utilizes deep learning (DL) techniques to extract and classify cell-level phenotypes. This new Python-based toolkit helps users leverage commercial cloud-based DL services that are easy to train and deploy to fit varying experimental conditions. Model training is entirely code-free and can be done with limited number of images. Users simply input the trained endpoints into MAPS to accomplish cell detection, phenotype discovery and phenotype classification. Thus, MAPS allows cell biologists to easily apply DL to accelerate their image analysis workflow.",

Here, we report a medium-throughput drug-screening platform (METPlatform) based on organotypic cultures that allows to evaluate inhibitors against metastases growing in situ. By applying this approach to brain metastasis, we identified several hits from a library of FDA approved inhibitors and others being tested in clinical trials. A blood-brain barrier permeable HSP90 inhibitor showed high potency against mouse and human brain metastases at clinically relevant stages of the disease, including a novel model of local relapse after neurosurgery. Furthermore, in situ proteomic analysis applied to organotypic cultures with metastases treated with the chaperone inhibitor revealed novel biomarkers in human brain metastasis and actionable mechanisms of resistance. Our work validates METPlatform as a potent resource for metastasis research integrating drug-screening and unbiased omic approaches that is fully compatible with human samples. We envision that METPlatform could be established as a clinically relevant strategy to personalize the management of metastatic disease in the brain and elsewhere.\n\nSummarySystemic spread of cancer continues to be the key aspect associated with lethality.

The ErbB TKIs decreased DRA expression through an ERK/Elk-1/CREB/AP-1 dependent pathway. The blockade of ERK phosphorylation by ErbB TKIs decreased the phosphorylation of Elk-1 and the amount of total and p-CREB, and reduced the expression of C-Fos, which is part of the AP-1 complex that maintain DRA expression. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that ErbB TKIs decrease expression and activity of DRA, which occurs over the time frame that these drugs clinically cause diarrhea, and since DRA is part of the intestinal neutral NaCl absorptive process, the reduced absorption is likely to represent a major contributor to the ErbB TKI-associated diarrhea.",

In a chemotherapeutic-induced neuropathy pain model SR-17018 is more potent and efficacious than morphine or oxycodone, moreover, this efficacy is retained upon repeated dosing of SR-17018.

    "abstract": "To understand the molecular basis of environment-induced and genotype-dependent chalkiness, six rice genotypes showing variable chalk levels were subjected to gene expression analysis during reproductive stages. In the high chalk genotypes, the peak expressions of ADP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) Large Subunit 4 (AGPL4) occurred in the stages before grain filling commenced, creating a temporal gap with the upregulation of Granule Bound Starch Synthase I (GBSSI) and Starch Synthase IIA (SSIIA). Whereas, in the low chalk genotypes, AGPL4 expression generally occurred in later stages, close to the upregulation of GBSSI and SSIIA. However, heat treatment altered the expression pattern and created a gap between the expression peaks of AGPL4, and GBSS1 and SSIIA. This change was accompanied by transformed granular morphology, increased protein content, and chalkiness in the grains. AGPL4 expression pattern may partially explain chalkiness as it contributes to the pool of ADP-Glucose for producing amylose and amylopectin, the major components of the starch. Down-regulation of AGPase during grain filling stages could result in a limited pool of ADP-Glucose leading to inefficient grain filling and air pockets that contribute to chalkiness. The study suggests a mechanism of grain chalkiness based on the coordination of the three starch biosynthesis genes in rice.\n\nSignificance statementGenotype-dependent and heat-induced grain chalkiness in rice is partially based on the increased gap between the upregulation AGPase and that of GBSSI and SSIIA through reproductive stages. This temporal gap could limit starch accumulation and alter granular morphology, eventually leading to grain chalkiness.",

    "abstract": "The ability to adjust movements to changes in the environment declines with aging. This age-related decline is caused by the decline of explicit adjustments. However, automatic adjustment of movement, or internal model recalibration, remains intact and might even be increased with aging. Since somatosensory information appears to be required for internal model recalibration, it might well be that an age-related decline in somatosensory acuity is linked to the increase of internal model recalibration. One possible explanation for an increased internal model recalibration is that age-related somatosensory deficits could lead to altered sensory integration with an increased weighting of the visual sensory-prediction error. Another possibility is that reduced somatosensory acuity results in an increased reliance on predicted sensory feedback. Both these explanations led to our preregistered hypothesis: we expect a relation between the decline of somatosensation and the increased internal model recalibration with aging. However, we failed to support this hypothesis. Our results question the existence of reliability-based integration of visual and somatosensory signals during motor adaptation.\n\nNew & NoteworthyIs somatosensory acuity linked to implicit motor adaptation? The latter is larger in old compared to younger people? In light of reliability-based sensory integration, we hypothesized that this larger implicit adaptation was linked to an age-related lower reliability of somatosensation. Over two experiments and 130 participants, we failed to find any evidence for this. We discuss alternative explanations for the increase in implicit adaptation with age and the validity of our somatosensory assessment.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery has been shown to dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with various motor dysfunctions, such as those afflicted with Parkinsons disease (PD), dystonia, and essential tremor (ET), by relieving motor symptoms associated with such pathologies. The success of DBS procedures is directly related to the proper placement of the electrodes, which requires the ability to accurately detect and identify relevant target structures within the subcortical basal ganglia region. In particular, accurate and reliable segmentation of the globus pallidus (GP) interna is of great interest for DBS surgery for PD and dystonia. In this work, we present a deep-learning based neural network, which we term GP-net, for the automatic segmentation of both the external and internal segments of the globus pallidus. High resolution 7 Tesla images from 101 subjects were used in this study; GP-net is trained on a cohort of 58 subjects, containing patients with movement disorders as well as healthy control subjects. GP-net performs 3D inference in a patient-specific manner, alleviating the need for atlas-based segmentation. GP-net was extensively validated, both quantitatively and qualitatively over 43 test subjects including patients with movement disorders and healthy control and is shown to consistently produce improved segmentation results compared with state-of-the-art atlas-based segmentations. We also demonstrate a post-operative lead location assessment with respect to a segmented globus pallidus obtained by GP-net.",

    "abstract": "Gene editing is now routine in all prokaryotic and metazoan cells but has not received much attention in immune cells when the CRISPR-Cas9 technology was introduced in the field of mammalian cell biology less than ten years ago. This versatile technology has been successfully adapted for gene modifications in human myeloid cells and T cells, among others, but applications to human primary B cells have been scarce and limited to activated B cells. This limitation has precluded conclusive studies into cell activation, differentiation or cell cycle control in this cell type. We report on highly efficient, simple and rapid genome engineering in primary resting human B cells using nucleofection of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. We provide proof-of-principle of gene editing in quiescent human B cells using two model genes: CD46 and CDKN2A. The latter encodes the cell cycle regulator p16INK4a which is an important target of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Infection of B cells carrying a knockout of CDKN2A with wildtype and EBNA3 oncoprotein mutant strains of EBV allowed us to conclude that EBNA3C controls CDKN2A, the only barrier to B cell proliferation in EBV infected cells. Together, this approach enables efficient targeting of specific gene loci in quiescent human B cells supporting basic research as well as immunotherapeutic strategies.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman hematopoietic stem cells and their derivatives of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages are important targets for gene correction or modifications using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Among others, this approach can support site-specific insertion of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors (TCRs) into primary T cells. Their subsequent adoptive transfer to patient donors is a promising immunotherapeutic concept that may control chronic infection or certain types of cancer. Human B cells have a similar potential but, in contrast to T cells, they are very sensitive, difficult to handle, and short-lived ex vivo precluding their genetic modification. Here, we provide means to manipulate primary human B cells genetically using in vitro assembled Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes and electroporation for their delivery. Our study demonstrates near-to-complete loss of a model target gene and provides examples to evaluate a cellular gene with a critical role during infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).",

We screened a total of 1,227 bacterial isolates for antifungal activity against these pathogens using detached-leaf methods and identified 72 isolates with robust activity against one or both of these pathogens. These bacterial isolates represent a diverse set of five phyla, 14 genera and 22 species, including taxa for which this is the first observation of fungal disease suppression. We identified biosynthetic gene clusters associated with activity against each pathogen.

Machine-learning improved the discovery rate of our screen by 3-fold.

    "abstract": "Bacteria communicate by small-molecule chemicals that facilitate intra- and inter-species interactions. These extracellular signaling molecules mediate diverse processes including virulence, bioluminescence, biofilm formation, motility, and specialized metabolism. The signaling molecules produced by members of the phylum Actinobacteria are generally comprised of {gamma}-butyrolactones, {gamma}-butenolides, and furans. The best known actinomycete {gamma}-butyrolactone is A-factor, which triggers specialized metabolism and morphological differentiation in the genus Streptomyces. Salinipostins A-K are unique {gamma}-butyrolactone molecules with rare phosphotriester moieties that were recently characterized from the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora. The production of these compounds has been linked to the 9-gene biosynthetic gene cluster spt. Critical to salinipostin assembly is the {gamma}-butyrolactone synthase encoded by spt9. Here, we report the global distribution of spt9 among sequenced bacterial genomes, revealing a surprising diversity of gene homologs across 12 bacterial phyla, the majority of which are not known to produce {gamma}-butyrolactones. Further analyses uncovered a large group of spt-like gene clusters outside of the genus Salinispora, suggesting the production of new salinipostin-like diversity. These gene clusters show evidence of horizontal transfer between many bacterial taxa and location specific homologous recombination exchange among Salinispora strains. The results suggest that {gamma}-butyrolactone production may be more widespread than previously recognized. The identification of new {gamma}-butyrolactone biosynthetic gene clusters is the first step towards understanding the regulatory roles of the encoded small molecules in Actinobacteria.\n\nImportanceSignaling molecules orchestrate a wide variety of bacterial behaviors. Among Actinobacteria, {gamma}-butyrolactones mediate morphological changes and regulate specialized metabolism. Despite their importance, few {gamma}-butyrolactones have been linked to their cognate biosynthetic gene clusters. A new series of {gamma}-butyrolactones called the salinipostins was recently identified from the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora and linked to the spt biosynthetic gene cluster. Here we report the detection of spt-like gene clusters in diverse bacterial families not known for the production of this class of compounds. This finding expands the taxonomic range of bacteria that may employ this class of compounds and provides opportunities to discover new compounds associated with chemical communication.",

    "abstract": "During the past decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to successfully identify tens of thousands of genetic variants associated with complex traits included in humans, animals, and plants. All common genome-wide association (GWA) methods rely on population structure correction to avoid false genotype and phenotype associations. However, population structure correction is a stringent penalization, which also impedes the identification of real associations. Here, we used recent statistical advances and proposed iterative screen regression (ISR), which enables simultaneous multiple marker associations and shown to appropriately correction population stratification and cryptic relatedness in GWAS. Results from analyses of simulated suggest that the proposed ISR method performed well in terms of power (sensitivity) versus FDR (False Discovery Rate) and specificity, also less bias (higher accuracy) in effect (PVE) estimation than the existing multi-loci (mixed) model and the single-locus (mixed) model. We also show the practicality of our approach by applying it to rice, outbred mice, and A.thaliana datasets. It identified several new causal loci that other methods did not detect. Our ISR provides an alternative for multi-loci GWAS, and the implementation was computationally efficient, analyzing large datasets practicable (n>100,000).",

    "abstract": "Force-sensitive arrest peptides regulate protein biosynthesis by stalling the ribosome as they are translated. Synthesis can be resumed when the nascent arrest peptide experiences a pulling force of sufficient magnitude to break the stall. Efficient stalling is dependent on the specific identity of a large number of amino acids, including amino acids which are tens of angstroms away from the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). The mechanism of force-induced restart and the role of these essential amino acids far from the PTC is currently unknown. We use hundreds of independent molecular dynamics trajectories spanning over 120 s in combination with kinetic analysis to characterize the barriers along the force-induced restarting pathway for the arrest peptide SecM. We find that the essential amino acids far from the PTC play a major role in controlling the transduction of applied force. In successive states along the stall-breaking pathway, the applied force propagates up the nascent chain until it reaches the C-terminus of SecM and the PTC, inducing conformational changes that allow for restart of translation. A similar mechanism of force propagation through multiple states is observed in the VemP stall-breaking pathway, but secondary structure in VemP allows for heterogeneity in the order of transitions through intermediate states. Results from both arrest peptides explain how residues that are tens of angstroms away from the catalytic center of the ribosome impact stalling efficiency by mediating the response to an applied force and shielding the amino acids responsible for maintaining the stalled state of the PTC.\n\nSignificance StatementAs nascent proteins are synthesized by the ribosome, their interactions with the environment can create pulling forces on the nascent protein that can be transmitted to the ribosomes catalytic center. These forces can affect the rate and even the outcome of translation. We use simulations to characterize the pathway of force transduction along arrest peptides and discover how secondary structure in the nascent protein and its interactions with the ribosome exit tunnel impede force propagation. This explains how amino acids in arrest peptides that are tens of angstroms away from the ribosomes catalytic center contribute to stalling, and, more broadly, suggests how structural features in the nascent protein dictate the ribosomes ability to functionally respond to its environment.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimers disease (AD), a central role is given to the extracellular deposition of A{beta} peptides, remotely produced by the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This contrasts with other neurodegenerative diseases which are characterized by the intraneuronal aggregation of full-length proteins such as huntingtin, -synuclein or TDP-43. Importantly, the distribution of APP around amyloid plaques is poorly characterized. Here, we combined an extensive set of methodological and analytical tools to investigate neuropathological features of APP in the human AD hippocampus and in two mouse models of AD. We report that APP remarkably accumulates in the surrounding of dense-core amyloid plaques together with the secretases necessary to produce A{beta} peptides. In addition, the Nter domain, but not the Cter domain of APP is enriched in the core of amyloid plaques uncovering a potential pathological role of the secreted APP-Nter in dense-core plaques. To investigate the subcellular compartment in which APP accumulates, we labelled neuritic and synaptic markers and report an enrichment in presynaptic proteins (Syt1, VAMP2) and phosphorylated-Tau. Ultrastructural analysis of APP accumulations reveals abundant multivesicular bodies containing presynaptic vesicles proteins and autophagosomal built-up of APP. Altogether, our data supports a role of presynaptic APP in AD pathology and highlights APP accumulations as a potential source of A{beta} and Nter peptides to fuel amyloid plaques.",

    "abstract": "Selecting hand actions to manipulate an object is affected both by perceptual factors and by action goals. Affordances are associated with the automatic potentiation of motor representations to an object, independent of the goal of the actor. In previous studies, we have demonstrated an influence of the congruency between hand and object orientations on response times when reaching to turn an object, such as a cup. In this study, we investigated how the representation of hand postures triggered by planning to turn a cup were influenced by this congruency effect, in an fMRI scanning environment. Healthy participants were asked to reach and turn a real cup that was placed in front of them either in an upright orientation or upside down. They were instructed to use a hand orientation that was either congruent or incongruent with the cup orientation. As expected, the motor responses were faster when the hand and cup orientations were congruent. There was increased activity in a network of brain regions involving object-directed actions during action planning, which included bilateral primary and extrastriate visual, medial and superior temporal areas, as well as superior parietal, primary motor and premotor areas in the left hemisphere. Specific activation of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) was associated with hand-object orientation congruency during planning, and prior to any action taking place. Activity in that area and its connectivity with the lateral occipito-temporal cortex (LOTC) increased when planning incongruent actions. The increased activity in premotor areas in trials where the orientation of the hand was incongruent to that of the object suggests a role in eliciting competing representations specified by hand postures in LOTC.",

    "abstract": "Systemic inflammation is associated with alterations in complex brain functions such as learning and memory. However, diagnostic approaches to functionally assess and quantify inflammation-associated alterations in synaptic plasticity are not well-established. In previous work, we demonstrated that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation alters the ability of hippocampal neurons to express synaptic plasticity, i.e., the long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory neurotransmission. Here, we tested whether synaptic plasticity induced by repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique used in clinical practice, is affected by LPS-induced inflammation. Specifically, we explored brain tissue cultures to learn more about the direct effects of LPS on neural tissue, and we tested for the plasticity-restoring effects of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL10). As shown previously, 10 Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS) of organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures induced a robust increase in excitatory neurotransmission onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, LPS-treated tissue cultures did not express rMS-induced synaptic plasticity. Live-cell microscopy in tissue cultures prepared from a novel transgenic reporter mouse line [C57BL6-Tg(TNFa-eGFP)] confirms that ex vivo LPS administration triggers microglial tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) expression, which is ameliorated in the presence of IL10. Consistent with this observation, IL10 hampers the LPS-induced increase in TNF, IL6, IL1{beta}, and IFN{gamma} and restores the ability of neurons to express rMS-induced synaptic plasticity in the presence of LPS. These findings establish organotypic tissue cultures as a suitable model for studying inflammation-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity, thus providing a biological basis for the diagnostic use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the context of brain inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in climate research have discovered that permafrost is particularly vulnerable to the changes occurring in the atmosphere and climate, especially in Alaska where 85% of the land is underlain by mostly discontinuous permafrost. As permafrost thaws, research has shown that natural and anthropogenic soil disturbance causes microbial communities to undergo shifts in membership composition and biomass, as well as in functional diversity. Boreal forests are home to many plants that are integral to the subsistence diets of many Alaska Native communities. Yet, it is unclear how the observed shifts in soil microbes can affect above ground plant communities that are relied on as a major source of food. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial communities associated with permafrost thaw affect plant growth by growing five plant species found in Boreal forests and Tundra ecosystems, including low-bush cranberry and bog blueberry, with microbial communities from the active layer soils of a permafrost thaw gradient. We found that plant growth was significantly affected by the microbial soil inoculants. Plants inoculated with communities from above thawing permafrost showed decreased growth compared to plants inoculated with microbes from undisturbed soils. We used metagenomic sequencing to determine that microbial communities from disturbed soils above thawing permafrost have differences in taxonomy from microbial communities in undisturbed soils above intact permafrost. The combination of these results indicates that a decrease in plant growth can be linked to soil disturbance driven changes in microbial community membership and abundance. These data contribute to an understanding of how microbial communities can be affected by soil disturbance and climate change, and how those community shifts can further influence plant growth in Boreal forests and more broadly, ecosystem health.",

Post-translational modifications (PTM) of core histones seem to be involved in chromatin structural transitions, but how remains unclear.\n\nTo explore this, we used ChIP-seq and two cell types, HeLa and lymphoblastoid (LCL) to define how changes in chromatin packaging through the cell cycle influence the distributions of three transcription-associated histone modifications, H3K9ac, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3.\n\nResultsChromosome regions (bands) of 10-50Mb, detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy of metaphase (M) chromosomes, are also present in G1 and G2. We show that they comprise 1-5Mb sub-bands that differ between HeLa and LCL but remain consistent through the cell cycle. The same sub-bands are defined by H3K9ac and H3K4me3, while H3K27me3 spreads more widely.\n\nWe found little change between cell cycle phases, whether compared by 5Kb rolling windows or when analysis was restricted to functional elements such as transcription start sites and topologically associating domains.\n\nOnly a small number of genes showed cell-cycle related changes: at genes encoding proteins involved in mitosis, H3K9 became highly acetylated in G2M, possibly because of ongoing transcription.\n\nConclusionsModified histone isoforms H3K9ac, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 exhibit a characteristic genomic distribution at resolutions of 1Mb and below that differs between HeLa and lymphoblastoid cells but remains remarkably consistent through the cell cycle. We suggest that this cell-type-specific chromosomal bar-code is part of a homeostatic mechanism by which cells retain their characteristic gene expression patterns, and hence their identity, through multiple mitoses.",

    "abstract": "As asthma worsens, occlusion of airways with mucus significantly contributes to airflow obstruction and reduced lung function. Recent evidence from clinical studies has shown mucus obtained from adults and children with asthma possesses altered mucin composition. However, how these changes alter the functional properties of the mucus gel is not yet fully understood. To study this, we have engineered a synthetic mucus biomaterial to closely mimic the properties of native mucus in health and disease. We demonstrate this model possesses comparable biophysical and transport properties to native mucus ex vivo collected from human subjects and in vitro isolated from human airway epithelial (HAE) tissue cultures. We found by systematically varying mucin composition that mucus gel viscoelasticity is enhanced when predominantly composed of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), as is observed in asthma. As a result, asthma-like synthetic mucus gels are more slowly transported on the surface of HAE tissue cultures and at a similar rate to native mucus produced by HAE cultures stimulated with the type 2 cytokine IL-13, known to contribute to airway inflammation and MUC5AC hypersecretion in asthma. We also discovered the barrier function of asthma-like synthetic mucus towards influenza A virus was impaired as evidenced by the increased frequency of infection in MUC5AC-rich hydrogel coated HAE cultures. Together, this work establishes a biomaterial-based approach to understand airway dysfunction in asthma and related muco-obstructive lung diseases.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=190 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/342766v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bed446org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@626c28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aabb6borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f69081_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "MotivationBacterial genomes are composed by a core and an accessory genome. The first composed of housekeeping and essential genes, while the second is composed, in its majority, of mobile genetic elements, including transposable elements (TEs). Insertion sequences (ISs), the smallest TEs, have an important role in genome evolution, and contribute to bacterial genome plasticity and adaptability. ISs can spread in a genome, presenting different locations in nearly related strains, and producing phenotypic variations. Few tools are available which can identify differentially located ISs (DLIS) on assembled genomes.\n\nResultsWe developed ISCompare to profile IS mobilization events in related bacterial strains using complete or draft genome assemblies. ISCompare was validated using artificial genomes with simulated random IS insertions and real sequences, achieving the same or better results than other available tools, with the advantage that ISCompare can analyse multiple ISs at the same time and outputs a list of candidate DLIS. We think that ISCompare provides an easy and straightforward approach to look for differentially located ISs on bacterial genomes.\n\nAvailability and implementationISCompare was implemented in python3 and its source code is freely available for download at https://github.com/maurijlozano/ISCompare.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at https://github.com/maurijlozano/ISCompare.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease without a cure. If untreated, increased pulmonary vascular resistance kills patients within several years due to right heart failure. Even with the currently available therapies, survival durations remain short. By the time patients are diagnosed with this disease, the damage to the right ventricle (RV) has already developed. Therefore, agents that repair the damaged RV have therapeutic potential. We previously reported that cardiac fibrosis that occurs in the RV of adult Sprague-Dawley rats with PAH could naturally be reversed. We herein investigated the mechanism of this remarkable cardiac repair process. Counting of cardiomyocytes showed that the elimination of cardiac fibrosis is associated with the increased RV myocyte number, suggesting that new cardiomyocytes were generated. Immunohistochemistry showed the expression of -smooth muscle actin and Sox-2 in RV myocytes of rats with PAH. Transmission electron microscopy detected the structure that resembles maturing cardiomyocytes in both the RV of PAH rats and cultured cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. We propose that the damaged RV in PAH can be repaired by activating the cell reprogramming mechanism that converts resident cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "IL-1{beta} and TNF- are canonical immune response mediators that play key regulatory roles in a wide range of inflammatory responses to both chronic and acute conditions. Here we employ an automated microscopy platform for the analysis of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of IL-1{beta} and TNF- at the single-cell level. The amount of IL-1{beta} and TNF- mRNA expressed in a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) is visualized and counted using single-molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization (smFISH) following exposure of the cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an outer-membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria. We show that the small molecule inhibitors MG132 (a 26S proteasome inhibitor used to block NF-{kappa}B signaling) and U0126 (a MAPK Kinase inhibitor used to block CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins C/EBP) successfully block IL-1{beta} and TNF- mRNA expression. Based upon this single-cell mRNA expression data, we screened 36 different mathematical models of gene expression, and found two similar models that capture the effects by which the drugs U0126 and MG132 affect the rates at which the genes transition into highly activated states. When their parameters were informed by the action of each drug independently, both models were able to predict the effects of the combined drug treatment. From our data and models, we postulate that IL-1{beta} is activated by both NF-{kappa}B and C/EBP, while TNF- is predominantly activated by NF-{kappa}B. Our combined single-cell experimental modeling efforts shows the interconnection between these two genes and demonstrates how the single-cell responses, including the distribution shapes, mean expression, and kinetics of gene expression, change with inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Originally applied to alpha oscillations in the 1970s, MS analysis has since been used to decompose mainly broadband EEG signals (e.g. 1-40 Hz). We hypothesized that MS decomposition within separate, narrow frequency bands could provide more fine-grained information for capturing the spatio-temporal complexity of multichannel EEG. In this study using a large open-access dataset (n=203), we decomposed EEG recordings into 4 classical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta) in order to compare their individual MS segmentations using mutual information as well as traditional MS measures (e.g. mean duration, time coverage). Firstly, we confirmed that MS topographies were spatially equivalent across all frequencies, matching the canonical broadband maps (A, B, C, D). Interestingly however, we observed strong informational independence of MS temporal sequences between spectral bands, together with significant divergence in traditional MS measures. For example, relative to broadband, alpha/beta band dynamics displayed greater time coverage of maps A & B, while map D was more prevalent in delta/theta bands. Moreover, by using a frequency-specificMS taxonomy (e.g. {theta}A, C), we were able to predict the eyes-open vs closed-behavioural state significantly better using alpha-band MS features compared with broadband ones (80% vs 73% accuracy). Overall, our findings demonstrate the value and validity of spectrally-specific MS analyses, which may prove useful for identifying new neural mechanisms in fundamental research and/or for biomarker discovery in clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "Food restriction (FR) evokes running, which may promote adaptive foraging in times of food scarcity, but can become lethal if energy expenditure exceeds caloric availability. Here, we demonstrate that chemogenetic activation of either the general medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal cell population, or the subpopulation projecting to dorsal striatum (DS) drives running specifically during hours preceding limited food availability, and not during ad libitum food availability. Conversely, suppression of mPFC pyramidal cells generally, or targeting mPFC-to-DS cells, reduced wheel running specifically during FR and not during ad libitum food access. Post-mortem c-Fos analysis and electron microscopy of mPFC layer 5 revealed distinguishing characteristics of mPFC-to-DS cells, when compared to neighboring non-DS projecting pyramidal cells: 1) greater recruitment of GABAergic activity and 2) less axo-somatic GABAergic innervation. Together, these attributes position the mPFC-to-DS subset of pyramidal cells to dominate mPFC excitatory outflow, particularly during FR, revealing a specific and causal role for mPFC-to-DS control of the decision to run during food scarcity. Individual differences in GABAergic activity correlate with running response to further support this interpretation. FR enhancement of PFC-to-DS activity may influence neural circuits both in studies using FR to motivate animal behavior and in human conditions hallmarked by FR.",

    "abstract": "Environmental conditions affect virus inactivation rate and transmission potential. Understanding those effects is critical for anticipating and mitigating epidemic spread. Ambient temperature and humidity strongly affect the inactivation rate of enveloped viruses, but a mechanistic, quantitative theory of those effects has been elusive. We measure the stability of the enveloped respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life is over 24 hours at 10 {degrees}C and 40 % RH, but approximately 1.5 hours at 27 {degrees}C and 65 % RH. Our mechanistic model uses simple chemistry to explain the increase in virus inactivation rate with increased temperature and the U-shaped dependence of inactivation rate on relative humidity. The model accurately predicts quantitative measurements from existing studies of five different human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that shared mechanisms may determine environmental stability for many enveloped viruses. Our results indicate scenarios of particular transmission risk, point to pandemic mitigation strategies, and open new frontiers in the mechanistic study of virus transmission.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data showing increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in men suggests a potential role for androgen in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse and human cells. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. Further, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens, or Camostat attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cellular entry. Together, our data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of TMPRSS2 inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy/androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with antiviral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent COVID-19 progression.",

Here we introduce a novel hypergraph-based formalism that fully captures the structure of coexistence in multispecies systems. Our formalism uncovers that, below its limits, coexistence in ecological systems has ubiquitous discontinuities that we call \"coexistence holes.\" These coexistence holes do not occur arbitrarily but tend to obey patterns that make them predictable. We provide direct evidence showing that the biotic and abiotic constraints of empirical systems produce an over-representation of coexistence holes. By highlighting discontinuities in the form of coexistence holes, our work provides a new platform to uncover the order and structure of the assembly and disassembly of ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "Early-life conditions have profound effects on many life-history traits. In particular, early-life diet affects both juvenile development, and adult survival and reproduction. Early-life diet also has consequences for the ability of adults to withstand stressors such as starvation, temperature and desiccation. However, it is less well known how early-life diet influences the ability of adults to respond to infection. Here we test whether varying the larval diet of female Drosophila melanogaster (through altering protein to carbohydrate ratio, P:C) influences the long-term response to injury and infection with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila. Given previous work manipulating adult dietary P:C, we predicted that adults from larvae raised on higher P:C diets would be more likely to survive infection and have increased reproduction, but shorter lifespans and an increased rate of ageing. For larval development, we predicted that low P:C would lead to a longer development time and lower viability. We found that early-life and lifetime egg production were highest at intermediate to high larval P:C diets, but there was no effect of larval P:C on adult survival. Larval diet had no effect on survival or reproduction post-infection. Larval development was quickest on intermediate P:C and egg-to-pupae and egg-to-adult viability were higher on higher P:C. Overall, despite larval P:C affecting several traits measured in this study, we saw no evidence that larval P:C altered the consequence of infection or injury for adult survival and early-life and lifetime reproduction. Taken together, these data suggest that larval diets appear to have a limited impact on adult response to infection.",

A high-throughput solution that covers all aspects is necessary to study the complex life of mRNA on the single cell level. The Nanopore platform offers long read sequencing and can be integrated with the popular single cell sequencing method on the 10x Chromium platform. However, the high error-rate of Nanopore reads poses a challenge in downstream processing (e.g. for cell barcode assignment). We propose a solution to this particular problem by using a hybrid sequencing approach on Nanopore and Illumina platforms. Our software ScNapBar enables cell barcode assignment with high accuracy, especially if sequencing saturation is low. ScNapBar uses unique molecular identifier (UMI) or Naive Bayes probabilistic approaches in the barcode assignment, depending on the available Illumina sequencing depth. We have benchmarked the two approaches on simulated and real Nanopore datasets. We further applied ScNapBar to pools of cells with an active or a silenced non-sense mediated RNA decay pathway. Our Nanopore read assignment distinguishes the respective cell populations and reveals characteristic nonsense-mediated mRNA decay events depending on cell status.",

In contrast, the tryptophan catabolism rate limiting enzymes, IDO1 and TDO2, were highly overexpressed in stroma, suggesting that kynurenine-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity is predominantly constrained by the stroma. Oxidative phosphorylation was unexpectedly the most upregulated metabolic process in cancer cells compared to both stromal cells and a large atlas of cancer cell lines, suggesting that the Warburg effect may be less pronounced in cancer cells in vivo. Overall, our analysis highlights fundamental differences in metabolic states of cancer and stromal cells inside tumors and establishes a pan-cancer resource to interrogate tumor metabolism.",

Association data were drawn from two large-scale genome-wide association studies (UK Biobank and COGENT) on accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and average physical activity (N = 91,084) and cognitive functioning (N = 257,841). After Bonferroni correction, we observed significant LHC-MR associations suggesting that increased fraction of both moderate (b = 0.32, CI95% = [0.17,0.47], P = 2.89e-05) and vigorous physical activity (b = 0.22, CI95% = [0.06,0.37], P = 0.007) lead to increased cognitive functioning. In contrast, we found no evidence of a causal effect of average physical activity on cognitive functioning, and no evidence of a reverse causal effect (cognitive functioning on any physical activity measures). These findings provide new evidence supporting a beneficial role of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on cognitive functioning.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion creates various patterns of optic flow on the retina, which provide the observer with information about their movement relative to the environment. However, it is unclear how these optic flow patterns are encoded by the cortex. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice to systematically map monocular and binocular responses to horizontal motion in four areas of the visual cortex. We find that neurons selective to translational or rotational optic flow are abundant in higher visual areas, whereas neurons suppressed by binocular motion are more common in the primary visual cortex. Disruption of retinal direction selectivity in Frmd7 mutant mice reduces the number of translation-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex, and translation- and rotation-selective neurons as well as binocular direction-selective neurons in the rostrolateral and anterior visual cortex, blurring the functional distinction between primary and higher visual areas. Thus, optic flow representations in specific areas of the visual cortex rely on binocular integration of motion information from the retina.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster is an important model for antiviral immunity in arthropods, but very few DNA viruses have been described from the family Drosophilidae. This deficiency limits our opportunity to use natural host-pathogen combinations in experimental studies, and may bias our understanding of the Drosophila virome. Here we report fourteen DNA viruses detected in a metagenomic analysis of approximately 6500 pool-sequenced Drosophila, sampled from 47 European locations between 2014 and 2016. These include three new Nudiviruses, a new and divergent Entomopox virus, a virus related to Leptopilina boulardi filamentous virus, and a virus related to Musca domestica salivary gland hypertrophy virus. We also find an endogenous genomic copy of Galbut virus, a dsRNA Partitivirus, segregating at very low frequency. Remarkably, we find that Drosophila Vesanto virus, a small DNA virus previously described as a Bidnavirus, may be composed of up to 12 segments and represent a new lineage of segmented DNA viruses. Two of the DNA viruses, Drosophila Kallithea nudivirus and Drosophila Vesanto virus are relatively common, found in 2% or more of wild flies. The others are rare, with many likely to be represented by a single infected fly. We find that virus prevalence in Europe reflects the prevalence seen in publicly-available datasets, with Drosophila Kallithea nudivirus and Drosophila Vesanto virus the only ones commonly detectable in public data from wild-caught flies and large population cages, and the other viruses being rare or absent. These analyses suggest that DNA viruses are at lower prevalence than RNA viruses in D. melanogaster, and may be less likely to persist in laboratory cultures. Our findings go some way to redressing an earlier bias toward RNA virus studies in Drosophila, and lay the foundation needed to harness the power of Drosophila as a model system for the study of DNA viruses.",

Specific pairs of symbionts have been associated with adelgid lineages specialized on different secondary host conifers. Using a metagenomic approach, we investigated the symbiosis of the Adelges laricis/tardus species complex containing betaproteobacterial (  Candidatus Vallotia tarda) and gammaproteobacterial ( Candidatus Profftia tarda) symbionts. Genomic characteristics and metabolic pathway reconstructions revealed that Vallotia and Profftia are evolutionary young endosymbionts, which complement each others role in essential amino acid production. Phylogenomic analyses and a high level of genomic synteny indicate an origin of the betaproteobacterial symbiont from endosymbionts of Rhizopus fungi. This evolutionary transition was accompanied with substantial loss of functions related to transcription regulation, secondary metabolite production, bacterial defense mechanisms, host infection and manipulation. The transition from fungus to insect endosymbionts extends our current framework about evolutionary trajectories of host-associated microbes.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus are vectors of many pathogens that greatly affect humankind. The maintenance of these mosquitoes in laboratory permit different studies that can help understanding their biology, as well as the vector-pathogen interaction. In addition to sugar meals, the blood feeding is essential for maintenance of the reproductive cycle in several vectors. The main blood sources for many mosquito colonies are direct feeding on live animal or the use of human/animal blood through artificial feeders. However, this latter process has some disadvantages, as artificial feeders can be very laborious for assembly and decontamination. Based on these observations, a simplified technique for feeding and artificial infection was developed with cotton-pads soaked (CS) and blood or blood and viral supernatant to simulate an artificial infection. The efficiency of the CS technique was investigated through the number of mosquitoes fed/infected, when compared to their respective control group. The CS technique, with blood at room temperature, promoted a feeding rate of 61.4% for Ae. albopictus, 70.8% for Cx. quinquefasciatus and 17% for Ae. aegypti. The control group (Hemotec-feeding) presented 47.9%, 16.5% and 59.1% of feeding success, respectively. To improve the CS technique for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, the procedure was then performed with blood at 38{degrees}C, which was possible to observe a feeding rate of 47.3%, in comparison to 53.2% for the control group (Hemotec). When using the CS technique for artificial infection with Mayaro virus, more than 80% of infection was observed for Ae. aegypti and 100% for Ae. albopictus. In the traditional infection technique (glass feeder), the infection rate was 90% (Ae. aegypti) and 96.6% (Ae. albopictus). For Cx. quinquefasciatus, the infection was positive only with the CS technique, resulting in 1 (5%) mosquito infected with Mayaro virus. Our results suggest that this simplified technique of low-cost feeding and easy assembly, offers good results for feeding (maintenance of colonies) and artificial infection of different species of mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "Stereum is an exceedingly common but taxonomically confounding genus of basidiomycete fungus with a cosmopolitan distribution. Lack of consensus about morphological and geographic boundaries of many Stereum species has resulted in a lack of consistency in identification of physical specimens, a problem that cascades to their associated published DNA sequences. A critical initial step towards addressing these issues is determining the scope of the problem. Here, we first use integrative taxonomy to delimit species in the North American Stereum ostrea complex. We use morphological and ecological characters, alongside ITS rDNA sequences of specimens from midwestern and eastern North America to show that \"Stereum ostrea\" in this region is a complex of at least three reproductively isolated sister species: S. lobatum, S. fasciatum, and S. subtomentosum. We then extend lessons from this case study to a set of publicly available Stereum ITS sequences to assess the accuracy of species names represented by existing sequence data. ASAP species delimitation successfully discriminates among the three newly revealed species in the S. ostrea species complex, but also reveals considerable cryptic diversity across global Stereum and widespread inconsistency in application of species names. Though ITS alone should not be used to delimit species or describe evolutionary relationships, its application here helps direct new hypotheses and suggests several areas of Stereum taxonomy that require revision. The critical future work of disentangling Stereum taxonomy and evolution should combine a multilocus genetic approach with morphology, ecology, and a global sampling strategy.",

This fold is a common topology for enzymes and can harbor many diverse reactions. The recently published de novo design of a four-fold symmetric TIM barrel provides a well understood minimal scaffold for potential enzyme designs. Here we explore opportunities to extend and diversify this scaffold by adding a short de novo helix on top of the barrel. Due to the size of the protein we developed a design pipeline based on computational ab initio folding that solves a less complex sub-problem focused around the helix and its vicinity and adapt it to the entire protein. We provide biochemical characterization and a high-resolution X-ray structure for one variant and compare it to our design model. The successful extension of this robust TIM-barrel scaffold opens opportunities to diversify it towards more pocket like arrangements and as such can be considered a building block for future design of binding or catalytic sites.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is an essential component of executive functions which depend on maintaining task-related information online for brief periods in both the presence and absence of interfering stimuli. Active maintenance occurs during the WM delay period, the time between stimulus encoding and subsequent retrieval. Previous studies have extensively documented prefrontal (PFC) and posterior parietal (PPC) cortex activity during the WM delay period, but the role of subcortical structures including the thalamus remains to be fully elucidated, especially in humans. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI, we investigated the role of the thalamus during the WM delay period following low and high memory load encoding. During the delay, participants passively viewed scrambled images containing similar color and spatial frequency to serve as a perceptual baseline. Using individual fMRI-weighted source analyses centered around delay period onset, the effects of increased and decreased memory load on maintenance were observed bilaterally in thalamus with higher source activity evoked during low compared to high load maintenance. The main finding that thalamic activation was attenuated during high compared to low load maintenance suggesting a sensory filtering role for thalamus during consolidation of stimuli in WM where the highest evoked activity occurs when fewer stimuli need to be maintained in the presence of interfering perceptual stimuli during the delay. The results support the idea that the thalamus plays a role in short-term memory maintenance by regulating processing of interfering stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a critical structure in the flexible control of value-based behaviours. OFC dysfunction is typically only detected when task or environmental contingencies change, against a backdrop of apparently intact initial acquisition and behaviour. While intact acquisition following OFC lesions in simple Pavlovian cue-outcome conditioning is often predicted by models of OFC function, this predicted null effect has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we test the effects of lesions and temporary muscimol inactivation of the rodent lateral OFC on the acquisition of a simple single cue-outcome relationship. Surprisingly, pre-training lesions significantly enhanced acquisition after over-training whereas post-training lesions and inactivation significantly impaired acquisition. This impaired acquisition to the cue reflects a disruption of behavioural control and not learning since the cue could also act as an effective blocking stimulus in an associative blocking procedure. These findings suggest that even simple cue-outcome representations acquired in the absence of OFC function are impoverished. Therefore, while OFC function is often associated with flexible behavioural control in complex environments, it is also involved in very simple Pavlovian acquisition where complex cue-outcome relationships are irrelevant to task performance.",

    "abstract": "Shigella infections remain a major public health issue in developing countries. One model of Shigella pathogenesis suggests that the microfold epithelial cells in the small intestine are the preferred initial site of infection. However, a growing body of evidence supports an alternative model whereby Shigella primarily infects a much wider range of epithelial cells that reside primarily within the colon. Here, we investigated whether the luminal pH difference between the small intestine and colon could provide evidence in support of either model of Shigella flexneri pathogenesis. As virulence factors leading to cellular invasion are linked to biofilms in S. flexneri, we examined the effect of pH on S. flexneris ability to form and maintain adherent biofilms when induced by deoxycholate. We showed that a basic pH inhibited formation and dispersed pre-assembled mature biofilms while an acidic pH (similar to the colonic environment) did not have either of these effects. To further elucidate this phenomenon at the molecular level, we probed the transcriptomes of biofilms and S. flexneri grown in different pH conditions. We identified specific amino acid metabolic pathways (cysteine and arginine) that were enriched in the bacteria that formed the biofilms, but decreased upon pH increase. We then utilized a type III secretion system reporter strain to show that increasing pH reduced deoxycholate-induced virulence of S. flexneri in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, these experiments support a model whereby Shigella infection is favored in the colon because of the local pH differences in these organs.",

Here we show that LPS mediated activation of the non-canonical inflammasome also induces cellular senescence and the activation of tumour suppressor stress responses in human diploid fibroblasts. Interestingly, this LPS-induced senescence is dependent on caspase-4, the pyroptotic effector protein gasdermin-D and the tumour suppressor protein p53. Also, experiments with a catalytically deficient mutant suggest that caspase-4 proteolytic activity is not necessary for its role in senescence. Furthermore, we found that the caspase-4 non-canonical inflammasome is induced and assembled during Ras-mediated oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Moreover, targeting caspase-4 in OIS showed that the non-canonical inflammasome is critical for SASP activation and contributes to reinforcing the cell cycle arrest in OIS. Finally, we observed that caspase-4 induction occurs in vivo in models of tumour suppression and ageing. Altogether, we are unveiling that cellular senescence is induced by cytoplasmic microbial LPS recognition by the caspase-4 non-canonical inflammasome and that this pathway is conserved in the senescence program induced by oncogenic stress.",

    "abstract": "The lymphatics are essential for the maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis. Accordingly, lymphatic dysfunction contributes to lymphedema. In development, lymphangiogenesis often requires lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) lineage specification from the venous ECs and subsequent LEC proliferation and migration, all of which are regulated by the VEGFC/VEGFR3 signaling. Cholesterol is essential for proper cell functions and organ development, yet the molecular mechanism by which cholesterol metabolism controls lymphangiogenesis is unknown. We show that the secreted protein, ApoA1 binding protein (AIBP), dictates lymphatic vessel formation by accelerating cholesterol efflux. Loss of Aibp2, the human paralog in zebrafish, impairs LEC progenitor specification and impedes lymphangiogenesis. Mechanistically, we found that caveolin-1 (CAV-1) suppresses VEGFR3 activation in LECs, and that AIBP-regulated cholesterol efflux disrupts lipid rafts/caveolae and reduces CAV-1 bioavailability, which abolishes the CAV-1 inhibition of VEGFR3 signaling, thereby augmenting VEGFR3 activation and increasing lymphangiogenesis. Enhancement of cholesterol efflux with ApoA1 overexpression or inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis using atorvastatin restores proper lymphangiogenesis in Aibp2 mutant zebrafish. Loss of Cav-1 increases LEC progenitor specification in zebrafish, and rescues lymphangiogenesis in Aibp2-deficient animals. Recombinant AIBP supplement confers profound LEC fate commitment in the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) to LEC differentiation model. Furthermore, enhancement of AIBP-CAV-1-VEGFR3 signaling axis promotes VEGFC-engaged adult lymphangiogenesis in mice. Consistent with these data, AIBP expression is reduced in the epidermis of human lymphedematous skin. These studies identify that AIBP-mediated cholesterol efflux is a critical contributor for lymphangiogenesis.

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are inter-connected systems of incredible complexity and dynamism that play crucial roles in health, energy, and the environment. To better understand microbial communities and how they respond to change, it is important to know which microbes are present and their relative abundances at the greatest taxonomic resolution possible. Here, we describe a novel protocol (RoC-ITS) that uses the single-molecule Nanopore sequencing platform to assay the composition of microbial communities in unprecedented detail. This methodology produces long-read sequences including multiple copies of the same complete 16S ribosomal gene and its neighboring internally transcribed spacer (ITS) using rolling-circle amplification. The ribosomal 16S gene provides phylogenetic information down to the species-level, while the much less conserved ITS region contains strain-level information. When linked together, this combination of markers allows for the identification of individual ribosomal units within a specific organism, the assessment of their relative stoichiometry, and the ability to monitor subtle shifts in microbial community composition with a single generic assay. We applied RoC-ITS to a mock microbial community that was also sequenced using the Illumina platform, demonstrating its accuracy in quantifying the relative abundance and identity of each species.",

    "abstract": "Structure-function relationships are fundamental to studies of neural systems, yet the mechanistic underpinnings of how structural networks shape hemispheric lateralization remain elusive. For instance, the asymmetric neuroanatomic embedding of primary auditory cortices was shown when connectivity with all other brain areas were considered. Concomitantly, functional lateralization e.g., left hemispheric dominance of speech processing and right hemispheric dominance of music perception, is widely acknowledged. The present article provides a parsimonious mechanistic explanation based on computational modelling and empirical recordings to demonstrate emergence of hemispheric lateralization of brain function. For validation of the model, empirical EEG recordings of auditory steady state responses (ASSR) were undertaken, and empirical findings suggest right hemispheric dominance at the level of cortical sources in binaural and monaural hearing conditions. Subsequently, we demonstrate the entrainment and phase of oscillations in connected brain regions based on a neurodynamic model constrained by empirically derived structural connectivity matrix from diffusion data. For relevance, we have taken into consideration time-delays in neural communication stemming from fibre distances and neuronal coupling arising from fibre densities. Based on relevant network parameters, we could demonstrate the emergence of right hemispheric dominance of ASSR in binaural and monaural hearing conditions when auditory cortical areas were chosen as triggers of entrained phase oscillators. Furthermore, we discovered emergence of left-lateralized functional response when bilateral Brocas area replaced auditory areas as triggers. Hence, a single unified mechanism based on entrainment of phase oscillators in a large-scale brain network could explain both emergence of right and left hemispheric laterality.\n\nSignificance statementThe origin of hemispheric specialization of sensory processing is a fundamental question in neuroscience. For instance, speech and language are predominantly processed in the left hemispheric regions, while the right hemisphere is specialized for processing rhythmic, tonal, and melodic stimuli. Identification of the network mechanisms that give rise to such functional lateralization from structural constraints remains elusive. In the present study, we simulate neural activity observed during human EEG recordings of auditory steady-state responses from a biophysically realistic large-scale model constrained by underlying structural connectivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate how hemispheric lateralization of brain responses to sensory stimuli emerge from the time-delayed interactions among whole-brain neuronal ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Of over 200 different identified Vibrio cholerae serogroups only the O1 serogroup is consistently associated with endemic and epidemic cholera disease. The O1 serogroup has two serologically distinguishable variants, the Ogawa and Inaba serotypes, which differ only by a methyl group present on the terminal sugar of the Ogawa O-antigen but absent from Inaba strains. This methylation is catalyzed by a methyltransferase encoded by the wbeT gene, which in Inaba strains is disrupted by mutation. It is currently thought that there is little difference between the two serotypes. However, here we show, using isogenic pairs of O1 El Tor V. cholerae, that Inaba strains show significantly different patterns of gene expression and are significantly less able than the corresponding Ogawa strains to cause cholera in an infant mouse infection model. Our results suggest that changes in gene expression resulting from the loss of the wbeT gene lead to reduced virulence and possibly also reduced survival fitness outside the human host.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe bacterium Vibrio cholerae causes the pandemic diarrheal disease cholera. Despite many identified serotypes of V. cholerae only one, O1, causes pandemic cholera. The O1 serotype of pandemic V. cholerae has two distinguishable variants (called Ogawa and Inaba) long considered to be clinically and epidemiologically equivalent. Cholera outbreaks consist only of one the two variants at any time. In general, Ogawa strains cause the majority of outbreaks with relatively short-lived Inaba outbreaks occurring sporadically. We have suggested earlier that Inaba outbreaks occur during periods of environmental selective pressure against the Ogawa serotype. We demonstrate here that the two variants are not clinically equivalent. The Ogawa serotype is better able to respond to infection in an animal model by up regulating the expression of virulence genes essential for disease development. We suggest that this phenomenon is the result of wider ranging differences in gene expression resulting from the mutation that converts Ogawa into Inaba strains, and may help to explain the dominance of the Ogawa serotype in nature.",

In mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same individuals, we show to what extent mitochondrial measures are confounded by both cell type distributions and contaminating platelets. Cell subtype-specific measures among women and men spanning 4 decades of life indicate potential age- and sex-related differences, including an age-related elevation in mtDNAcn, which are masked or blunted in mixed PBMCs. Finally, a proof-of-concept, repeated-measures study in a single individual validates cell type differences and also reveals week-to-week changes in mitochondrial activities. Larger studies are required to validate and mechanistically extend these findings. These mitochondrial phenotyping data build upon established immunometabolic differences among leukocyte sub-populations, and provide foundational quantitative knowledge to develop interpretable blood-based assays of mitochondrial health.",

    "abstract": "Populations of European honeybee subspecies, Apis mellifera, have the ability to adapt naturally to the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. It is possible that a tolerance to mite-vectored viruses may contribute to colony survival. If this is the case, surviving populations should show lower virus titers and prevalence compared to susceptible populations. Here, we investigated the prevalence and titers of 10 viruses, some known to be associated with V. destructor, in adult workers and pupae as well as mites. Samples were collected from both a mite-surviving and mite-susceptible honeybee population in Norway. Surviving colonies had a lower prevalence of a key virus (DWV-A) associated with V. destructor in individual adult bees sampled, and generally lower titers of this virus in mite infested pupae and mites within the colonies when compared to sympatric, susceptible controls. However, these surviving colonies also displayed higher prevalence and titers of two viruses not associated with V. destructor (BQCV & LSV1). The results of this study therefore suggest that general tolerance to virus infections is unlikely to be a key mechanism for natural colony survival in Norway, but evidence may point to mite control as a predominant mechanism.",

The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in the brain and related to nervous system development. A polygenic score constructed from our results captures variation in a broad range of behavioral and medical outcomes that were not part of our genome-wide analyses, including traits that until now lacked well-performing polygenic scores, such as opioid use disorder, suicide, HIV infections, criminal convictions, and unemployment.

    "abstract": "Artificial insemination in pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) breeding involves the evaluation of the semen quality of breeding boars. Ejaculates that fulfill predefined quality requirements are processed, diluted and used for inseminations. Within short time, eight Swiss Large White boars producing immotile sperm that had multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella were noticed at a semen collection center. The eight boars were inbred on a common ancestor suggesting that the novel sperm flagella defect is a recessive trait. Transmission electron microscopy cross-sections revealed that the immotile sperm had disorganized flagellar axonemes. Haplotype-based association testing involving microarray-derived genotypes at 41,094 SNPs of six affected and 100 fertile boars yielded strong association (P=4.22 x 10-15) at chromosome 12. Autozygosity mapping enabled us to pinpoint the causal mutation on a 1.11 Mb haplotype located between 3,473,632 and 4,587,759 bp. The haplotype carries an intronic 13-bp deletion (Chr12:3,556,401-3,556,414 bp) that is compatible with recessive inheritance. The 13-bp deletion excises the polypyrimidine tract upstream exon 56 of DNAH17 (XM_021066525.1:c.8510-17_8510-5del) encoding dynein axonemal heavy chain 17. Transcriptome analysis of the testis of two affected boars revealed that the loss of the polypyrimidine tract causes exon skipping which results in the in-frame loss of 89 amino acids from DNAH17. Disruption of DNAH17 impairs the assembly of the flagellar axoneme and manifests in multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella. Direct gene testing may now be implemented to monitor the defective allele in the Swiss Large White population and prevent the frequent manifestation of a sterilizing sperm tail disorder in breeding boars.",

    "abstract": "Acute diarrheal illness and gastroenteritis caused by Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) infection remain significant public health risks in developing countries with substantial mortality and morbidity in humans, particularly in children under the age of five. Despite improved global awareness in sanitation and hygiene practices, including food safety measures, C. jejuni infections continue to rise even across the developed nations and no vaccine is currently available for humans. Genetic diversities among C. jejuni strains as well as limited understanding of immunological correlates of host protection remain primary impediments for developing an effective vaccine against C. jejuni. Given the role of bacterial outer membrane-associated proteins in intestinal adherence and invasion as well as modulating dynamic interplay between host and pathogens, bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have emerged as potential vaccine platforms against a number of enteric pathogens, including C. jejuni. In the present study, we describe a mucosal vaccine strategy using chitosan (CS) coated OMVs (CS-OMVs) to induce specific immune responses against C. jejuni in mice. However, considering the challenges of mucosal delivery of OMVs in terms of exposure to variable pH, risk of enzymatic degradation, rapid gut transit, and low permeability across the intestinal epithelium, we preferentially used CS as a non-toxic, mucoadhesive polymer to coat OMVs. Mucosal administration of CS-OMVs induced high titre of systemic (IgG) and local (secretory IgA) antibodies in mice. The neutralizing ability of secretory IgA (sIgA) produced in the intestine was confirmed by in vitro inhibition of cell adherence and invasion of C. jejuni while in vivo challenge study in OMVs immunized mice showed a significant reduction in cecal colonization of C. jejuni. Moreover, to investigate the immunological correlates of the observed protection, present data suggest OMVs driven T cell proliferation with an increased population of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition to antibody isotype profile, significant upregulation of IFN-{gamma} and IL-6 gene expression in mesenteric lymph nodes collected from OMVs immunized mice further suggests that mucosal delivery of OMVs promotes a Th1/Th2 mixed type immune responses. Together, we provide strong experimental evidence that as an acellular and non-replicating canonical end product of bacterial secretion, mucosal delivery of OMVs may represent a promising platform for developing an effective vaccine against C. jejuni.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite the loss of 7.5 million disability-adjusted life years, which is over and above any other globally prevalent enteric or enterotoxigenic pathogens, C. jejuni remains a neglected foodborne pathogen, particularly in tropical countries. Even with the improved global awareness in sanitation and hygiene practices, including food safety measures C. jejuni infections continue to rise globally and no vaccine is currently available for humans. In light of the importance of the diverse cargo selection by bacterial OMVs, the present study describes a mucosal vaccine strategy using chitosan-coated OMVs to induce specific immune responses against C. jejuni in mice. We provide here strong experimental evidence that as a non-replicating canonical end product of bacterial secretion, mucosal delivery of OMVs represents an attractive vaccine platform against C. jejuni.",

    "abstract": "With an estimated 440,000 active cases occurring each year, medical device associated infections pose a significant burden on the US healthcare system, costing about $9.8 billion in 2013. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common cause of these device-associated infections, which typically involve isolates that are multi-drug resistant and possess multiple virulence factors. S. epidermidis is also frequently a benign contaminant of otherwise sterile blood cultures. Therefore, tests that distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic isolates would improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prevent overuse/misuse of antibiotics. Attempts to use multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) with machine learning for this purpose had poor accuracy (~73%). In this study we sought to improve the diagnostic accuracy of predicting pathogenicity by focusing on phenotypic markers (i.e., antibiotic resistance, growth fitness in human plasma, and biofilm forming capacity) and the presence of specific virulence genes (i.e., mecA, ses1, and sdrF). Commensal isolates from healthy individuals (n=23), blood culture contaminants (n=21), and pathogenic isolates considered true bacteremia (n=54) were used. Multiple machine learning approaches were applied to characterize strains as pathogenic vs non-pathogenic. The combination of phenotypic markers and virulence genes improved the diagnostic accuracy to 82.4% (sensitivity: 84.9% and specificity: 80.9%). Oxacillin resistance was the most important variable followed by growth rate in plasma. This work shows promise for the addition of phenotypic testing in clinical diagnostic applications.",
