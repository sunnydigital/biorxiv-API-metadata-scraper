    "abstract": "The extraction of electrophysiological features that reliably forecast the occurrence of seizures is one of the most challenging goals in epilepsy research. Among possible approaches to tackle this problem is the use of active probing paradigms in which responses to stimuli are used to detect underlying system changes leading up to seizures. This work evaluates the theoretical and mechanistic underpinnings of this strategy using a well-studied seizure-generating neural mass model with two coupled populations. Different simulations are done by shifting parameters (excitability, slow inhibition, and coupling gains) towards ictal states while low-frequency probing stimuli are applied to either one or both populations. The correlation between the extracted features and the shifted parameter indicates if the impending transition to the ictal state may be identified in advance. Results show that not only can the response to the probing stimuli forecast seizures but this is true regardless of the altered ictogenic parameter. That is, similar feature changes are highlighted by probing stimuli responses in advance of the seizure including: increased response variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, decreased skewness, and increased mutual information between the outputs of both model subsets. These changes were restricted to the stimulated population, showing a local effect of this perturbational approach. The transition latencies from normal activity to sustained discharges of spikes were not affected, suggesting that stimuli had no pro-ictal effects. However, stimuli were found to elicit interictal-like spikes just before the transition to the ictal state. Furthermore, the observed feature changes highlighted by probing the neuronal populations may reflect the phenomenon of critical slowing down, where increased recovery times from perturbations may signal the loss of a systems resilience and are common hallmarks of an impending critical transition. These results provide more evidence that active probing approaches highlight information about underlying system changes involved in ictogenesis and may be able to play a role in assisting seizure forecasting methods which can be incorporated into early-warning systems that ultimately enable closing the loop for targeted seizure-controlling interventions.\n\nAuthor summaryEpilepsy is characterized by spontaneous and recurrent seizures. Developing a method to forecast the occurrence of these events would ease part of the burden to patients by providing warning systems and identifying critical periods for closed-loop seizure suppressing methods. However, this task is far from trivial and doing this in a clinical setting has been a challenge that is not yet solved. A possible way to achieve this is by using active probing paradigms, in which stimuli are used to highlight otherwise hidden changes in brain dynamics that may lead to seizures. In this work, this approach is tested in a computational model with two coupled neuronal populations. Active probing responses highlighted underlying model parameter changes that led neuronal activity closer to seizures, something that was not detected with the passive observation in most evaluated model settings. Observed feature changes revealed higher excitability, longer recovery times from stimuli, and increased synchrony between populations as the threshold to seizure-like activity approached. This indicates that low frequency stimuli may be used to reveal early-warning signs and assist in seizure forecasting methods.",

    "abstract": "The development of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging was followed by a large volume of human neuroimaging studies of mental processes, mechanisms, and diseases. Due to the high volume of studies and the large number of journals, it is increasingly challenging for neuroscientists to review existing scholarly journals and find the most suitable journal to publish their studies. Therefore, this paper proposes a scholarly journal recommendation model for human neuroimaging studies called brain activation-based filtering (BAF). Based on the collective matrix factorization technique, BAF recommends journals relevant to the activated brain regions that are described in a given neuroimaging study. For instance, if  social brain regions such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and temporoparietal junction are activated in a study, BAF recommends relevant social neuroscience journals (e.g., Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience). Five-fold cross-validation shows that BAF predicts journals with a reliable area under the curve score of 0.855. Furthermore, an interactive Google Colab notebook is offered to recommend relevant journals for a novel human neuroimaging study (https://github.com/JunsolKim/brain-activation-based-filtering).",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causal agent for Acquired I Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the worlds greatest severe public health and development contest. Since the beginning of the epidemic, 38 million of people are living with HIV/AIDS and 1.7 million people newly infected with HIV. Increased availability and accessibility of ART has essentially improved the survival rate, through lowering the incidence of OIs among peoples living with HIV/AIDS. Risk of developing Opportunistic infections in HIV patients depend on experience to potential pathogens, virulence of pathogens, degree of host immunity and the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis. In Ethiopia, however remarkable decline of new infection (81%) for decades, since 2008 HIV incidence rate began to rise by 10% and number of new infection diagnosed each year increased by 36% among all ages and doubled among adult. There is a limited studies describing the spectrum of opportunistic infection and associated factors in the study settings. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the spectrum of Opportunistic infections in the study area.\n\nMethodsA Facility based retrospective cross-sectional study was employed from 2015-2019 G.C. The sample size was computed using single population proportion formula. Accordingly, four hundred ninety seven (497) medical records of study participants were reviewed. Simple random sampling technique was used to select the participants included in this study. Data were extracted from the ART follow up data-base and medical records of the patients by using a standardized check list, which was adapted from Federal ministry Of Health HIV ART. The contents of check list include: Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical informations. Data had entered Epi data version and analyzed using SPSS version 5.3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Bivariate analysis with p-value <0.2 was done to see the association between outcome variable & independent variables. Variables with p < 0.2 in bivariate analysis were entered for multiple logistic regressions. At 95% confidence interval, explanatory variables with P <0.05 in multiple logistic regression analysis were considered as significantly association.\n\nResultThe study found that, an overall prevalence of OIs was 62%. The finding of our study documented, from deferent HIV related OIs among patients on ART follow up at Nekemte Specialized Hospital ART clinic, the common types of OIs were; Pulmonary Tuberculosis (15.7%), Oral candidiasis (14.3%), Herpes Zoster (11.3%), Cryptococcus meningitides (5.9%), upper respiratory infection (5.8%, Persistent diarrhea (5.2%), and Extra pulmonary tuberculosis (3.8%). The occurrence of OIs on adult PLHIV patients who were with baseline WHO stage of I were 53% lower as compared to those who were with advanced baseline WHO stage of II and more {AOR: 0.468, 95 % CI (0.305-0.716). Moreover, Participants of Urban residents were 1.6 times more likely to develop OIs than those rural residents. Baseline WHO clinical staging and residence were identified as independent predictors of OIs among adult HIV infected patients.\n\nConclusionAn overall prevalence of OIs was 62%. The prevalence of OIs is still high namely Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Oral candidiasis and Herpes Zoster are leading OIs among adult HIV infected patients. Baseline WHO clinical staging and residence were identified as independent predictors of OIs among adult HIV infected patients\n\nRecommendationsHaving skilled health professionals, early diagnosis of OIs among HIV infected patients and having equipped laboratory diagnostic setup are mandatory to be able to deal with specific diagnosis and management of OIs. Further study is recommended to determine the relationship between residence and developing OIs among HIV patients on ART follow",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening intestinal disease, is becoming a larger proportionate cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. To date, therapeutic options remain elusive. Based on recent cell therapy studies, we investigated the effect of a human placental-derived stem cell (hPSC) therapy on intestinal damage in an experimental NEC rat pup model. NEC was induced in newborn Sprague-Dawley rat pups for 4 days via formula feeding, hypoxia, and LPS. NEC pups received intraperitoneal (ip) injections of either saline or hPSC (NEC-hPSC) at 32 and 56 hours into NEC induction. At 4 days, intestinal macroscopic and histological damage, epithelial cell composition, and inflammatory marker expression of the ileum was assessed. Breastfed (BF) littermates were used as controls. NEC pups developed significant bowel dilation and fragility in the ileum. Further, NEC induced loss of normal villi-crypt morphology, disruption of epithelial proliferation and apoptosis, and loss of Paneth cells and LGR5+ stem cells in the crypt. hPSC treatment improved macroscopic intestinal health with reduced ileal dilation and fragility. Histologically, hPSC administration had a significant reparative effect on the villi-crypt morphology and epithelium. In addition to a trend of decreased inflammatory marker expression, hPSC-NEC pups had increased epithelial proliferation and decreased apoptosis when compared to NEC littermates. Further, the intestinal stem cell niche of Paneth cells and LGR5+ stem cells was increased with hPSC therapy. Together, these data demonstrate hPSC can promote epithelial healing of NEC intestinal damage in part through support of the intestinal stem cell niche.\n\nNew and NoteworthyThese studies demonstrate a human placental-derived stem cell (hPSC) therapeutic strategy for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In an experimental model of NEC, hPSC administration improved macroscopic intestinal health, ameliorated epithelial morphology, and supported the intestinal stem cell niche. Our data suggest that hPSC are a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate established intestinal NEC damage. Further, we show hPSC are a novel research tool that can now be utilized to elucidate critical neonatal repair mechanisms to overcome NEC disease.",

    "abstract": "Protein clusters and condensates are pervasive in mammalian signaling. Yet how the signaling capacity of higher-order assemblies differs from simpler forms of molecular organization is still poorly understood. Here, we present an optogenetic approach to switch between light-induced clusters and simple protein heterodimers with a single point mutation. We apply this system to study how clustering affects signaling from the kinase Zap70 and its substrate LAT, proteins that normally form membrane-localized clusters during T cell activation. We find that light-induced clusters of LAT and Zap70 trigger potent activation of downstream signaling pathways even in non-T cells, whereas one-to-one dimers do not. We provide evidence that clusters harbor a local positive feedback loop between three components: Zap70, LAT, and Src-family kinases that bind to phosphorylated LAT and further activate Zap70. Overall, our study provides evidence for a specific role of protein condensates in cell signaling, and identifies a simple biochemical circuit that can robustly sense protein oligomerization state.\n\nHighlights- A general system for studying the role of protein clusters versus dimers.\n- Membrane clusters of the kinase Zap70 and its substrate LAT trigger potent downstream signaling.\n- Clustering Zap70 with LAT is required for full activation of Zap70 kinase activity.\n- A positive feedback loop connects phosphorylated LAT to Zap70 activation via Src-family kinases.",

    "abstract": "The phosphorylation of mitotic proteins is bistable, which contributes to the decisiveness of the transitions into and out of M phase. The bistability in substrate phosphorylation has been attributed to bistability in the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. However, more recently it has been suggested that bistability also arises from positive feedback in the regulation of the Cdk1-counteracting phosphatase, PP2A-B55. Here, we demonstrate biochemically using Xenopus laevis egg extracts that the Cdk1-counteracting phosphatase PP2A-B55 functions as a bistable switch, even when the bistability of Cdk1 activation is suppressed. In addition, Cdk1 regulates PP2A-B55 in a biphasic manner; low concentrations of Cdk1 activate PP2A-B55 and high concentrations inactivate it. As a consequence of this incoherent feedforward regulation, PP2A-B55 activity rises concurrently with Cdk1 activity during interphase and suppresses substrate phosphorylation. PP2A-B55 activity is then sharply downregulated at the onset of mitosis. During mitotic exit Cdk1 activity initially falls with no obvious change in substrate phosphorylation; dephosphorylation then commences once PP2A-B55 spikes in activity. These findings suggest that changes in Cdk1 activity are permissive for mitotic entry and exit, but the changes in PP2A-B55 activity are the ultimate trigger.",

APEX, an ascorbate peroxidase, has proven to be one of the most versatile and robust genetic tags for ultrastructural localization by electron microscopy.

The method increases the signal to noise ratio for EM detection, providing unambiguous detection of the tagged protein, and creates a readily quantifiable particulate signal. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this method for detection of membrane proteins, cytoplasmic proteins and cytoskeletal proteins. The method can be combined with different electron microscopic techniques including fast freezing and freeze substitution, focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopy, and electron tomography. The method allows detection of endogenously expressed proteins in genome-edited cells. We make use of a cell-free expression system to generate membrane particles with a defined quantum of an APEX-fusion protein.

    "abstract": "PurposePrevious studies in our lab found that expression of R345W-Fibulin-3 induces retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The purpose of the current study was to investigate the size, cargo and function of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from RPE cells expressing wild-type (WT)-Fibulin-3 compared to RPE cells expressing the R345W-Fibulin-3 mutation, and to determine the role of these EVs in regulating RPE cell dysfunction.\n\nMethodsARPE-19 cells were infected with luciferase-tagged wild-type Fibulin-3 (WT)- or luciferase-tagged R345W-Fibulin-3 (mutant) using lentivirus. EVs were isolated from the media of ARPE-19 cells by conventional ultracentrifugation or density gradient ultracentrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) were performed to study the morphology of the EVs. The amount and size distribution of EVs were determined by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). EV protein concentrations were quantified using the DCTM Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). EV cargo were analyzed by unbiased proteomics using LC-MS/MS with subsequent pathway analysis (Advaita). The EV-associated transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-{beta}1) protein was measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The EV transplant study was conducted and migration ability was evaluated in ARPE-19 cells with or without exposure to EVs by conducting scratch assays.\n\nResultsTEM imaging revealed concave-appearing vesicles, and cryo-EM imaging showed spherical vesicles with two subpopulations of EVs: a small group with diameters around 30nm and a large group with diameters around 100nm. Imaging also indicated a greater number of small EVs (~30 nm) in the mutant group compared to the WT group. This result was further confirmed by NTA showing that, in the mutant group, the particle size distributions were smaller than those of the WT EVs. There were no significant differences in EV protein concentrations per EV between WT and mutant groups. Proteomic studies showed that EVs derived from ARPE-19 cells expressing WT-Fibulin-3 contain critical members of sonic hedgehog signaling (SHH) signaling and ciliary tip components, whereas EVs derived from RPE cells expressing R345W-Fibulin-3 contain EMT mediators, including TGF-{beta}-induced protein (TGFBI), vimentin, and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4), indicating that the EV cargo reflects the phenotypic status of their parental cells. Subsequent studies revealed enhanced activity of TGF-{beta}1 associated with mutant EVs compared to WT EVs. Critically, EV transplant studies showed that treatment of recipient RPE cells with mutant RPE cell-derived EVs was sufficient to induce an enhanced migration ability and elevated EMT marker expression of RPE cells.\n\nConclusionsThe expression of R345W-Fibulin-3 alters the size, cargo and autocrine function of EVs. Notably, EVs derived from RPE cells expressing R345W-Fibulin-3 are sufficient to induce EMT in uninfected RPE cells.",

Our lab demonstrated that the alternatively spliced CPEB2A isoform of CPEB2 is a repressor of translation, while the CPEB2B isoform is a translational activator of HIF1 during hypoxia, suggesting a major regulatory role for CPEB2 AS in the pulmonary hypoxic response. Although it is well established that during hypoxia, HIF1 levels are dramatically upregulated due to a decrease in the degradation of this factor, we propose that during chronic hypoxia, the expression of HIF1 is maintained via a translational mechanism, likely alongside a decrease in proteolytic degradation. In this study we demonstrate that depletion of the CPEB2B splice isoform has an inhibitory effect on the translation of nascent HIF1 protein during chronic hypoxia, but not the acute phase. We further demonstrate this pathway is dependent on the initiation factor eIF3H. Finally, we show data that indicate CPEB2A and CPEB2B bind differentially to cytoplasmic polyadenylation element consensus sequences depending on the surrounding sequence context. These findings are important since they provide evidence for the potential of CPEB2 to act as a therapeutic target for treating chronic hypoxia-related pulmonary diseases.",
