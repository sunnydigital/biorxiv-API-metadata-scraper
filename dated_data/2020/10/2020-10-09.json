    "abstract": "Slow neurobiological rhythms, such as the circadian secretion of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones, modulate a wide variety of body functions. Whether and how such endocrine fluctuations also exert an influence on perceptual abilities is largely uncharted. Here, we show that phasic, moderate increases in GC availability prove beneficial to auditory discrimination. In an age-varying sample of N = 68 healthy human participants, we characterise the covariation of saliva cortisol with perceptual sensitivity in an auditory pitch-discrimination task at five time points across the sleep--wake cycle. First, momentary saliva cortisol levels were captured well by the time relative to wake-up and overall sleep duration. Second, within individuals, higher cortisol level just prior to behavioural testing predicted better pitch discrimination ability, expressed as a steepened psychometric curve. This effect of glucocorticoids held under a set of statistical control models. Our results pave the way for more in-depth studies on neuroendocrinological determinants of sensory encoding and perception.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with genetic and environmental risk contributing to its development. Graph theoretical analyses of brain networks constructed from structural and functional MRI measurements have identified connectivity changes in AD and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, brain connectivity in asymptomatic individuals at risk of AD remains poorly understood.\n\nMethodsWe analysed diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data from 160 asymptomatic individuals (38-71 years) from the Cardiff Ageing and Risk of Dementia Study (CARDS). We calculated white matter tracts and constructed whole-brain, default-mode-network and visual structural brain networks that incorporate multiple structural metrics as edge weights. We then calculated the relationship of three AD risk factors, namely Apolipoprotein-E {varepsilon}4 genotype (APOE4), family history (FH) of dementia, and central obesity, on graph theoretical measures and hubs.\n\nResultsWe observed no risk-related differences in clustering coefficients, characteristic path lengths, eccentricity, diameter and radius across the whole-brain, default-mode-network or visual system. However, a hub in the right paracentral lobule was present in all high-risk groups (FH, APOE4, obese) but absent in low-risk groups (no FH, APOE4-ve, healthy weight).\n\nDiscussionWe identified no risk-related effects on graph theoretical metrics in the structural brain networks of cognitively healthy individuals. However, high-risk was associated with a hub in the right paracentral lobule, an area with motor and sensory functions related to the lower limb. If this phenotype is shown to predict symptom development in longitudinal studies, it could be used as an early biomarker of AD.\n\nImpact StatementAlzheimers Disease is a common form of dementia which to date has no cure. Identifying early biomarkers will aid the discovery and development of treatments that may slow AD progression in the future. In this paper we report that asymptomatic individuals at heightened risk of dementia due to their family history, Apolipoprotein-E {varepsilon}4 genotype and body adiposity have a hub in the right paracentral lobule which is absent in low-risk groups. If this phenotype were to predict the development of symptoms in a longitudinal study of the same cohort, it could provide an early biomarker of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Synaptic dysfunction is an established early symptom, which correlates strongly with cognitive decline, and is hypothesised to mediate the diverse neuronal network abnormalities observed in AD. However, how synaptic dysfunction contributes to network pathology and cognitive impairment in AD remains elusive. Here, we present a grid-cell-to-place-cell transformation model of long-term CA1 place cell dynamics to interrogate the effect of synaptic loss on network function and environmental representation. Synapse loss modelled after experimental observations in the APP/PS1 mouse model was found to induce firing rate alterations and place cell abnormalities that have previously been observed in AD mouse models, including enlarged place fields and lower across-session stability of place fields. Our results support the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits, and demonstrate how impaired environmental representation may arise in the early stages of AD. We further propose that dysfunction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells may cause distinct impairments in place cell function, namely reduced stability and place map resolution.\n\nAuthor SummaryCognitive decline in Alzheimers Disease (AD) correlates most strongly with dysfunction and loss of synapses in affected brain regions. While synaptic dysfunction is a well-established early symptom of AD, how impaired synaptic transmission may lead to progressive cognitive decline, remains subject to active research. In this study, we examine the effect of synapse loss on neuronal network function using a computational model of place cells in the hippocampal network. Place cells encode a cognitive map of an animals environment, enabling navigation and spatial memory. This provides a useful indicator of cognitive function, as place cell function is well characterized and abnormalities in place cell firing have been shown to underlie navigational deficits in rodents. We find that synapse loss in our network is sufficient to produce progressive impairments in place cell function, which resemble those observed in mouse models of the disease, supporting the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction may underlie the cognitive impairment in AD. Furthermore, we observe that loss of excitatory and inhibitory synapses produce distinct spatial impairments. Future experiments investigating the relative contribution of different synaptic inputs may thus allow new insights into the neuronal network alterations in AD and potentially enable the identification of new therapeutic targets.",

Although there exist a plethora of both network alignment algorithms and measures of topological similarity, currently no \"gold standard\" exists for evaluating how well either is able to uncover functionally similar regions. Here we propose a formal, mathematically and statistically rigorous method for evaluating the statistical significance of shared GO terms in a global, 1-to-1 alignment between two PPI networks. We use combinatorics to precisely count the number of possible network alignments in which k proteins share a particular GO term. When divided by the number of all possible network alignments, this provides an explicit, exact p-value for a network alignment with respect to a particular GO term.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species can have major disruptions on native food webs, yet the impact of species introductions and whether they will become invasive appears to be context-dependent. Rainbow smelt and alewife co-exist as invasive species in the Laurentian Great Lakes and as native species on the Atlantic coast of North America, but in Lake Champlain rainbow smelt is the dominant native forage fish and alewife are invasive. Alewife became abundant by 2007, providing an opportunity to explore the dynamics of these two species in a system where only one is invasive. We used data from a 31-year forage fish survey to compare demographics of rainbow smelt populations in three basins of Lake Champlain with different pelagic volumes, nutrient levels, and predator abundances. Rainbow smelt catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) remained constant in the large, deep Main Lake before and after alewife invaded, but decreased in the two smaller basins. Declines were primarily a result of increased age-0 and age-1 mortality. Predation by top piscivores, system productivity, and resource competition alone could not explain the patterns in CPUE across the basins. The mechanisms that allow alewife and rainbow smelt to co-exist could be related to system volume and oxythermal habitat availability, and may explain why the two species do not negatively affect each other in other systems. Summer hypoxia in the smaller basins could force individuals into smaller habitat volumes with higher densities of competitors and cannibalistic adult smelt. Our findings suggest that habitat size mediates the impact of invasive alewife on native rainbow smelt.",

    "abstract": "With carbon dioxide (CO2) levels rising dramatically, climate change threatens marine environments. Due to increasing CO2 concentrations in the ocean, pH levels are expected to drop by 0.4 units by the end of the century. There is an urgent need to understand the impact of ocean acidification on chemical-ecological processes. To date, the extent and mechanisms by which the decreasing ocean pH influences chemical communication are unclear. Combining behaviour assays with computational chemistry, we explore the function of the predator related cue 2-phenylethylamine (PEA) for hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus) in current and end-of-the-century oceanic pH. We demonstrate that this dietary predator cue for mammals and sea lampreys is an attractant for hermit crabs. Furthermore, we show that the potency of the cue increases at pH levels expected for the year 2100. In order to explain this increased potency, we assess changes to PEAs conformational and charge-related properties as one potential mechanistic pathway. Using quantum chemical calculations validated by NMR spectroscopy, we characterise the different protonation states of PEA in water. We show how protonation of PEA could affect receptor-ligand binding, using a possible model receptor for PEA (human TAAR1). Investigating potential mechanisms of pH dependent effects on olfactory perception of PEA and the respective behavioural response, our study advances the understanding of how ocean acidification interferes with the sense of smell and thereby might impact essential ecological interactions in marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Gene transfer agents (GTAs) are virus-like particles encoded and produced by many bacteria and archaea. Unlike viruses, GTAs package fragments of the host genome instead of the genes that encode the components of the GTA itself. As a result of this non-specific DNA packaging, GTAs can transfer genes within bacterial and archaeal communities. GTAs clearly evolved from viruses and are thought to have been maintained in prokaryotic genomes due to the advantages associated with their DNA transfer capacity. The most-studied GTA is produced by the alphaproteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (RcGTA), which packages random portions of the host genome at a lower DNA density than usually observed in tailed bacterial viruses. How the DNA packaging properties of RcGTA evolved from those of the ancestral virus remains unknown. To address this question, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the large subunit of the terminase (TerL), a highly conserved enzyme used by viruses and GTAs to package DNA. We found that RcGTA-like TerLs grouped within viruses that employ the headful packaging strategy. Because distinct mechanisms of viral DNA packaging correspond to differences in the TerL amino acid sequence, our finding suggests that RcGTA evolved from a headful packaging virus. Headful packaging is the least sequence-specific mode of DNA packaging, which would facilitate the switch from packaging of the viral genome to packaging random pieces of the host genome during GTA evolution.",

    "abstract": "The pigeon louse Columbicola columbae is a longstanding and important model for studies of ectoparasitism and host-parasite coevolution. However, a deeper understanding of its evolution and capacity for rapid adaptation is limited by a lack of genomic resources. Here, we present a high-quality draft assembly of the C. columbae genome, produced using a combination of Oxford Nanopore, Illumina, and Hi-C technologies. The final assembly is 208 Mb in length, with 12 chromosome-size scaffolds representing 98.1% of the assembly. For gene model prediction, we used a novel clustering method (wavy_choose) for Oxford Nanopore RNA-seq reads to feed into the MAKER annotation pipeline. High recovery of conserved single-copy orthologs (BUSCOs) suggests that our assembly and annotation are both highly complete and highly accurate. Consistent with the results of the only other assembled louse genome, Pediculus humanus, we find that C. columbae has a relatively low density of repetitive elements, the majority of which are DNA transposons. Also similar to P. humanus, we find a reduced number of genes encoding opsins, G protein-coupled receptors, odorant receptors, insulin signaling pathway components, and detoxification proteins in the C. columbae genome, relative to other insects. We propose that such losses might characterize the genomes of obligate, permanent ectoparasites with predictable habitats, limited foraging complexity, and simple dietary regimes. The sequencing and analysis for this genome were relatively low-cost, and took advantage of a new clustering technique for Oxford Nanopore RNAseq reads that will be useful to future genome projects.",

The results indicated that albeit revealing the same adsorption mechanism, the organic calcium (i.e., Ca(CH3COO)2) proposed in this study is more beneficial and environmentally friendly than the inorganic calcium (i.e., CaCl2) in terms of the adsorption of bacteria onto the Na-MMT surface, which can be ascribed to the formation of the denser aggregates in the Na-MMT with Ca(CH3COO)2. Meanwhile, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir Equation for both two calcium sources. Meanwhile, the adsorption bands of the water molecules on the minerals were observed to shift significantly after the bacterial adsorption, showing that the hydrogen bonding on the Na-MMT surface played an important role during this process. A value of {Delta}H0 > 0 indicated that the bacterial adsorption was affected by van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction. Finally, the negative zeta potentials of the Na-MMT increased with the addition of Ca2+ ions, and the experimental data also showed that the adsorption of bacteria onto the Na-MMT was mainly determined by the electrostatic and non-electrostatic forces.",

    "abstract": "Industrial microalgae are promising photosynthetic cell factories, yet tools for targeted genome engineering are limited. Here for the model industrial oleaginous microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica we established a method to precisely and serially delete large genome fragments of ~100 kb from its 30.01-Mb nuclear genome. We started by identifying the \"non-essential\" chromosomal regions (i.e., low-expression region or LER) based on minimal gene expression under N-replete and N-depleted conditions. The largest such LER (LER1) is ~98 kb in size, located near the telomere of the 502.09 kb-long Chromosome 30 (Chr 30). We deleted 81 kb and further distal and proximal deletions of up to 110 kb (21.9% of Chr 30) in LER1 by dual targeting the boundaries with the episome-based CRISPR/Cas9 system. The telomere-deletion mutants showed normal telomeres consisting of CCCTAA repeats, revealing telomere regeneration capability after losing distal part of Chr 30. Interestingly, the deletions caused no significant alteration in growth, lipid production or photosynthesis (transcript-abundance change for < 3% genes under N depletion). We also performed double-deletion of both LER1 and LER2 (from Chr 9) that totals ~214 kb, and phenotypes are essentially normal. Therefore, loss of the large yet \"non-essential\" regions does not necessarily sacrifice important traits. Such serial targeted deletions of large genomic regions have not been reported in plants or microalgae, and will accelerate crafting minimal genomes as chassis for photosynthetic production.",

    "abstract": "Overfertilization with nitrogen fertilizers has damaged the environment and health of soil; yields are declining, while the population continues to rise. Soil is a complex, living organism which is constantly evolving, physically, chemically and biologically. Standard laboratory testing of soil to determine the levels of nitrogen (mainly NH4+ and NO3-) is infrequent as it is expensive and slow and levels of nitrogen vary on short timescales. Current testing practices, therefore, are not useful to guide fertilization. We demonstrate that Point-of-Use (PoU) measurements of NH4+, when combined with soil conductivity, pH, easily accessible weather (in this study, we simulated weather in the laboratory) and timing data (i.e. days passed since fertilization), allow instantaneous prediction of levels of NO3- in soil with of R2=0.70 using a machine learning (ML) model (the use of higher-precision laboratory measurements instead of PoU measurements increase R2 to 0.87 for the same model). We also show that a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model can be used to predict levels of NH4+ and NO3- up to 12 days into the future from a single measurement at day one, with R2NH4+ = 0.64 and R2NO3- = 0.70, for unseen weather conditions. To measure NH4+ in soil at the PoU easily and inexpensively, we also developed a new sensor that uses chemically functionalized near  zero-cost paper-based electrical gas sensors. This new technology can detect the concentration of NH4+ in soil down to 3{+/-}1ppm (R2=0.85). Gas-phase sensing provides a robust method of sensing NH4+ due to the reduced complexity of the gas-phase sample. Our machine learning-based approach eliminates the need of using dedicated, expensive sensing instruments to determine the levels of NO3- in soil which is difficult to measure reliably with inexpensive technologies; furthermore, crucial nitrogenous soil nutrients can be determined and predicted with enough accuracy to forecast the impact of climate on fertilization planning, and tune timing for crop requirements, reducing overfertilization while improving crop yields.",

Therefore, it is essential to develop targeted oxygenation alternatives to weaken tumor hypoxia as novel approaches to cancer immunotherapies. Herein, we report on injectable oxygen-generating cryogels (O2-cryogels) to reverse tumor-induced hypoxia. These macroporous biomaterials were designed to locally deliver oxygen, inhibit the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes in hypoxic melanoma cells, and reduce the accumulation of immunosuppressive extracellular adenosine. O2-cryogels enhance T cell-mediated secretion of cytotoxic proteins, restoring the killing ability of tumor-specific CTLs, both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, O2-cryogels provide a unique and safe platform to supply oxygen as a co-adjuvant in hypoxic tumors and improve cancer immunotherapies.",

However, the influence of postharvest handling on DNA methylation in relation to fruit quality is unclear. This work aimed to clarify these issues by analyzing DNA methylation using methyl-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP), semi-quantitative transcriptional analysis of marker genes for fruit quality (RIN; RIPENING INHIBITOR) and DNA methylation (SlDML2; Solanum lycopersicum L. DNA demethylase 2), and, fruit biochemical quality biomarkers. Multivariate analysis of these data supported the view that DNA methylation of fruit was influenced more by postharvest handling than ripening stage, however, fruit quality was influenced mainly by ripening. Fruit chilled postharvest were distinct in their DNA methylation state and quality characteristics, which implied that these three phenomena i.e., chilling, methylation, and quality are highly connected. In addition, different postharvest handling methods modulated SlDML2 transcript levels but had little effect on the level of RIN transcripts in fruit that reached the Turning stage after early harvest, and cold storage. These data collectively helped to advance our interpretation of tomato fruit ripening. In conclusion, our findings revealed that postharvest-induced variation in fruit quality is in relation to DNA methylation. Long-term this work will help better connect physiological changes in tomato fruit to events happening at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "In breeding programs, the selection of cultivars with the highest yield potential consisted in the selection of the yield per se, which resulted in cultivars with a higher grain number per spike (GN) and occasionally higher grain weight (GW) (main numerical components of the yield). This task could be facilitated with the use of molecular markers such us single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for GW, GN and spike fertility traits related to GN determination were mapped using two double haploid (DH) populations (Baguette Premium 11 x BioINTA 2002 and Baguette 19 x BioINTA 2002, BP11xB2002 and B19xB2002). Both populations were genotyped with the iSelect 90K SNP array and evaluated in four (BP11xB19) or five (B19xB2002) environments. We identify a total of 305 QTL for 14 traits, however 28 QTL for 12 traits were considered significant with an R2 > 10% and stable for being present at least in three environments. There were detected eight hotspot regions on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 3A, 5A, 5B, 7A and 7B were at least two major QTL sheared confident intervals. QTL on two of these regions have previously been described, but the other six regions were never observed, suggesting that these regions would be novel. The R5A1 (QSL.perg-5A, QCN.perg-5A,QGN.perg-5A) and R5A.2 (QFFTS.perg-5A, QGW.perg-5A) regions together with the QGW.perg-6B resulted in a final higher yield suggesting them to have high relevance as candidates to be used in MAS to improve yield.\n\nAuthor contribution statement\n\nKey message28 stable and major QTL for 12 traits associated to spike fertility, GN and GW were detected.

    "abstract": "Reliable paradigms and imaging measures of individual-level brain activity are paramount when reaching from group-level research studies to clinical assessment of individual patients. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides a direct, non-invasive measure of cortical processing with high spatiotemporal accuracy, and is thus well suited for assessment of functional brain damage in patients with language difficulties. This MEG study aimed to identify, in a picture naming paradigm, source-localized evoked activity and modulations of cortical oscillations that show high test-retest reliability across measurement days in healthy individuals, demonstrating their applicability in clinical settings. For patients with a severe language disorder picture naming can be a challenging task. Therefore, we also determined whether a semantic judgement task ( is this item living) with a spoken response ( yes/no) would suffice to induce comparably consistent activity within brain regions related to language production. The MEG data was collected from 19 healthy participants on two separate days. In picture naming, evoked activity was consistent across measurement days (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)>0.4) in the left frontal (400-800 ms after image onset), sensorimotor (200-800 ms), parietal (200-600 ms), temporal (200-800 ms), occipital (400-800 ms) and cingulate (600-800 ms) regions, as well as the right temporal (600-800 ms) region. In the semantic judgement task, consistent evoked activity was spatially more limited, occurring in the left temporal (200-800 ms), sensorimotor (400-800 ms), occipital (400-600 ms) and subparietal (600-800 ms) regions, and the right supramarginal cortex (600-800 ms). The naming task showed typical beta oscillatory suppression in premotor and sensorimotor regions (800-1200 ms) but other consistent modulations of oscillatory activity were mostly observed in posterior cortical regions that have not typically been associated with language processing. The high test-retest consistency of MEG evoked activity in the picture naming task testifies to its applicability in clinical evaluations of language function, as well as in longitudinal MEG studies of language production in clinical and healthy populations.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) often results in balance impairment, increasing the risk of falls, and the chances of further injuries. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of postural control after TBI are not well understood. To this end, we conducted a pilot study with a multimodal approach of EEG, MRI, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to explore the neural mechanisms of unpredictable balance perturbations in 17 chronic TBI participants and 15 matched Healthy Controls (HC). As quantitative measures of the functional integration and segregation of the brain networks during the postural task, we computed the global graph-theoretic network measures (global efficiency and modularity) of brain functional connectivity derived from source-space EEG in different frequency bands. We observed that the TBI group showed a lower balance performance as measured by the Center of Pressure (COP) displacement during the task, and the Berg Balance Scale. They also showed altered brain activation and connectivity during the balance task. In particular, the task modulation of brain network segregation in alpha-band was reduced in TBI. Moreover, the DTI findings revealed that the structural damage is associated with reduced network connectivity and integration. In terms of the neural correlates, we observed a distinct role played by different frequency bands; greater theta-band modularity during the task was strongly correlated with the BBS in TBI group; alpha-band and beta-band graph-theoretic measures were associated with the measures of white matter structural integrity. Our future studies will focus on how postural training will modulate the functional brain networks in TBI.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is essential but incompatible with other behaviors, and thus sleep drive competes with other motivations. We previously showed Drosophila males balance sleep and courtship via octopaminergic neurons that act upstream of courtship-regulating P1 neurons (Machado et al., 2017). Here we show nutrition modulates the sleep-courtship balance and identify sleep-regulatory neurons downstream of P1 neurons. Yeast-deprived males exhibited attenuated female-induced nighttime sleep loss yet normal daytime courtship, which suggests male flies consider nutritional status in deciding whether the potential benefit of pursuing female partners outweighs the cost of losing sleep. Trans-synaptic tracing and calcium imaging identified dopaminergic neurons projecting to the protocerebral bridge (DA-PB) as postsynaptic partners of P1 neurons. Activation of DA-PB neurons led to reduced sleep in normally fed but not yeast-deprived males. Additional PB-projecting neurons regulated male sleep, suggesting several groups of PB-projecting neurons act downstream of P1 neurons to mediate nutritional modulation of the sleep-courtship balance.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a form of motor neuron disease (MND) that is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons within the spinal cord, brainstem and motor cortex. Although ALS clinically manifests as a heterogeneous disease, with varying disease onset and survival, a unifying feature is the presence of ubiquitinated cytoplasmic protein inclusion aggregates containing TDP-43. However, the precise mechanisms linking protein inclusions and aggregation to neuronal loss are currently poorly understood.\n\nBimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) takes advantage the association of fluorophore fragments (non-fluorescent on their own) that are attached to an aggregation prone protein of interest. Interaction of the proteins of interest allows for the fluorescent reporter protein to fold into its native state and emit a fluorescent signal. Here, we combined the power of BiFC with the advantages of the zebrafish system to validate, optimize and visualize of the formation of ALS-linked aggregates in real time in a vertebrate model. We further provide in vivo validation of the selectivity of this technique and demonstrate reduced spontaneous self-assembly of the non-fluorescent fragments in vivo by introducing a fluorophore mutation. Additionally, we report preliminary findings on the dynamic aggregation of the ALS-linked hallmark proteins Fus and TDP-43 in their corresponding nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments using BiFC.\n\nOverall, our data demonstrates the suitability of this BiFC approach to study and characterize ALS-linked aggregate formation in vivo. Importantly, the same principle can be applied in the context of other neurodegenerative diseases and has therefore critical implications to advance our understanding of pathologies that underlie aberrant protein aggregation.",

    "abstract": "The causality and mechanism of dietary effects on brain aging are still unclear due to the long time scales of aging. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has contributed to aging research because of its short lifespan and easy genetic manipulation. When fed the standard laboratory diet, Escherichia coli, C. elegans experiences an age-dependent decline in temperature-food associative learning, called thermotaxis. To address if diet affects this decline, we screened 35 lactic acid bacteria as alternative diets and found that animals maintained high thermotaxis ability when fed a clade of Lactobacilli enriched with heterofermentative bacteria. Among them, Lactobacillus reuteri maintained the thermotaxis of aged animals without affecting their lifespan and motility. The effect of Lb. reuteri depends on the DAF-16 transcription factor functioning in neurons. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes between aged animals fed different bacteria were enriched with DAF-16 targets. Our results demonstrate that diet can impact brain aging in a daf-16 dependent manner without changing the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "To cope with the lack of highly skilled professionals, machine learning with proper signal processing is key for establishing automated diagnostic-aid technologies with which to conduct epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) testing. In particular, frequency filtering with the appropriate passbands is essential for enhancing the biomarkers--such as epileptic spike waves--that are noted in the EEG. This paper introduces a novel class of neural networks (NNs) that have a bank of linear-phase finite impulse response filters at the first layer as a preprocessor that can behave as bandpass filters that extract biomarkers without destroying waveforms because of a linear-phase condition. Besides, the parameters of the filters are also data-driven. The proposed NNs were trained with a large amount of clinical EEG data, including 15,833 epileptic spike waveforms recorded from 50 patients, and their labels were annotated by specialists. In the experiments, we compared three scenarios for the first layer: no preprocessing, discrete wavelet transform, and the proposed data-driven filters. The experimental results show that the trained data-driven filter bank with supervised learning behaves like multiple bandpass filters. In particular, the trained filter passed a frequency band of approximately 10-30 Hz. Moreover, the proposed method detected epileptic spikes, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.967 in the mean of 50 intersubject validations.",

    "abstract": "Background and purposePost-ischemic inflammation contributes to worsening of ischemic brain injury and in this process, the inflammasomes play a key role. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes which upon assembly activate the maturation and secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta} and IL-18. However, participation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in ischemic stroke remains controversial. Our aims were to determine the role of NLRP3 in ischemia and to explore the mechanism involved in the potential protective effect of the neurovascular unit.\n\nMethodsWT and NLRP3 knock-out mice were subjected to ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion (60 minutes) with or without treatment with MCC950 at different time points post-stroke. Brain injury was measured histologically with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining.\n\nResultsWe identified a time-dependent dual effect of NLRP3. While neither the pre-treatment with MCC950 nor the genetic approach (NLRP3 KO) proved to be neuroprotective, post-reperfusion treatment with MCC950 significantly reduced the infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, MCC950 improved the neuro-motor function and reduced the expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1{beta}, TNF-), NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, pro-caspase-1), protease expression (MMP9) and endothelial adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM). We observed a marked protection of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which was also reflected in the recovery of the tight junctions proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-5). Additionally, MCC950 produced a reduction of the CCL2 chemokine in blood serum and in brain tissue, which lead to a reduction in the immune cell infiltration.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that post-reperfusion NLRP3 inhibition may be an effective acute therapy for protecting the blood-brain barrier in cerebral ischemia with potential clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of protection against cholera afforded by previous illness or vaccination is currently unknown. We have recently shown that antibodies targeting O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholerae correlate highly with protection against cholera. V. cholerae is highly motile and possesses a flagellum sheathed in O-specific polysaccharide (OSP), and motility of V. cholerae correlates with virulence. Using high speed video microscopy, and building upon previous animal-related work, we demonstrate that sera, polyclonal antibody fractions, and OSP-specific monoclonal antibodies recovered from humans surviving cholera block V. cholerae motility at both subagglutinating and agglutinating concentrations. This anti-motility effect is reversed by pre-adsorbing sera and polyclonal antibody fractions with purified OSP; and is associated with OSP-specific but not flagellin-specific monoclonal antibodies. F[ab] fragments of OSP-specific polyclonal antibodies do not inhibit motility, suggesting a requirement for antibody-mediated crosslinking in motility inhibition. We show that OSP-specific antibodies do not directly affect V. cholerae viability, but that OSP-specific monoclonal antibody highly protects against death in the murine cholera model. We used in vivo competitive index studies to demonstrate that OSP-specific antibodies impede colonization and survival of V. cholerae in intestinal tissues, and that this impact is motility-dependent. Our findings suggest that the impedance of motility by antibodies targeting V. cholerae OSP contributes to protection against cholera.\n\nIMPORTANCECholera is a severe dehydrating illness of humans caused by Vibrio cholerae. V. cholerae is a highly motile bacterium that has a single flagellum covered in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) displaying O-specific polysaccharide (OSP), and V. cholerae motility correlates with its ability to cause disease. The mechanisms of protection against cholera are not well understood; however, since V. cholerae is a non-invasive intestinal pathogen, it is likely that antibodies that bind the pathogen or its products in the intestinal lumen contribute to protection from infection. Here, we demonstrate that OSP-specific antibodies isolated from humans surviving cholera in Bangladesh inhibit V. cholerae motility and are associated with protection against challenge in a motility-dependent manner.",

Furthermore, each of these approaches present significant off-target effects, clouding the outcomes. We set out to develop and examine an unbiased whole-genome screening approach using pooled CRISPR/Cas9 libraries for its ability to provide a robust and rapid approach to identify novel effectors of material uptake. Enabling this, we developed a methodology termed fast-library of inserts (FLI)-seq for library preparation and quantitative readout of pooled screens that shows improved technical reproducibility and is easier to perform than existing methods. In this proof-of-concept study we use FLI-seq to identify a solute carrier protein family member, SLC18B1, as a transporter for polymeric micellar nanoparticles, confirming the viability for this approach to yield novel insights into uptake mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is a promising sequencing technology that could generate relatively longer sequencing reads compared to the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The base calling process is very important for TGS. It translates the original electrical signals from the sequencer to the nucleotide sequence. By doing that, the base calling could significantly influence the accuracy of downstream analysis. Bonito is a recently developed basecaller based on deep neuron network, the neuron network architecture of which is composed of a single convolutional layer followed by three stacked bidirectional GRU layers. Although Bonito achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy, its speed is so slow that it is not likely to be used in production. We therefore implement Fast-Bonito, which introduces systematic optimization to speed up Bonito. Fast-Bonito archives 53.8% faster than the original version on NVIDIA V100 and could be further speed up by HUAWEI Ascend 910 NPU, achieving 565% faster than the original version. The accuracy of Fast-Bonito is also slightly higher than the original Bonito.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs the use of nanopore sequencing for metagenomic analysis increases, tools capable of performing long-read taxonomic classification in a fast and accurate manner are needed. Existing tools were either designed for short-read data (eg. Centrifuge) or take days to analyse modern sequencer outputs (eg. MetaMaps).\n\nResultsWe present BugSeq, a novel, highly accurate metagenomic classifier for nanopore reads. BugSeq (F1=0.91-0.95) offers better read classification than MetaMaps (F1=0.89-0.94) in a fraction of the time. BugSeq significantly improves on the accuracy of Centrifuge (F1=0.79-0.93) while offering competitive run times. We apply BugSeq to metagenomic sequencing of 41 samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infections and show that it produces greater concordance with microbiological culture and qPCR compared with \"Whats In My Pot\" analysis.\n\nConclusionBugSeq is deployed to the cloud for easy and scalable long-read metagenomic analyses.

    "abstract": "The negative impacts of stress on reproduction have long been studied. A large focus of investigation has centered around the effects of the adrenal steroid hormone corticosterone (CORT) on a system of tissues vital for reproduction, the hypothalamus of the brain, the pituitary gland, and the gonads (the HPG axis). Investigations of the role of CORT on the HPG axis have predominated the stress and reproductive biology literature, potentially overshadowing other influential mediators. To gain a more complete understanding of how elevated CORT, characteristic of the stress response, affects the activity of the HPG axis, we experimentally examined its role at the level of the genome in both male and female rock doves (Columba livia). We exogenously administrated CORT to mimic circulating levels during the stress response, specifically 30 min of restraint stress, an experimental paradigm known to increase circulating corticosterone in vertebrates. We examined all changes in genomic transcription within the HPG axis as compared to both restraint-stressed birds and vehicle-injected controls, as well as between the sexes. We report causal and sex-specific effects of CORT on the HPG stress response at the level of the transcriptome. Restraint stress caused 1567 genes to uniquely differentially express while elevated circulating CORT was responsible for the differential expression of 304 genes. Only 108 genes in females and 8 in males differentially expressed in subjects who underwent restraint stress and those who were given exogenous CORT. In response to CORT elevation characteristic of the stress response, both sexes shared the differential expression of 5 genes, KCNJ5, CISH, PTGER3, CEBPD, and ZBTB16, all located in the pituitary. The known functions of these genes suggest potential influence of elevated CORT on immune function and prolactin synthesis. Gene expression unique to each sex indicated that elevated CORT affected more gene transcription in females than males (78 genes versus 3 genes, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first study to isolate the role of CORT in HPG genomic transcription during a stress response. These results provide novel targets for new lines of further investigation and therapy development. We present an extensive and openly accessible view of the role corticosterone in the HPG genomic stress response, offering novel gene targets to inspire new lines of investigation of stress-induced reproductive dysfunction. Because the HPG system is well-conserved across vertebrates, these data have the potential to inspire new therapeutic strategies for reproductive dysregulation in multiple vertebrate systems, including our own.",

    "abstract": "The use of scene context is a powerful way by which biological organisms guide and facilitate visual search. Although many studies have shown enhancements of target-related electroencephalographic activity (EEG) with synthetic cues, there have been fewer studies demonstrating such enhancements during search with scene context and objects in real world scenes. Here, observers covertly searched for a target in images of real scenes while we used EEG to measure the steady state visual evoked response to objects flickering at different frequencies. The target appeared in its typical contextual location or out of context while we controlled for low-level properties of the image including target saliency against the background and retinal eccentricity. A pattern classifier using EEG activity at the relevant modulated frequencies showed target detection accuracy increased when the target was in a contextually appropriate location. A control condition for which observers searched the same images for a different target orthogonal to the contextual manipulation, resulted in no effects of scene context on classifier performance, confirming that image properties cannot explain the contextual modulations of neural activity. Pattern classifier decisions for individual images was also related to the aggregated observer behavioral decisions for individual images. Together, these findings demonstrate target-related neural responses are modulated by scene context during visual search with real world scenes and can be related to behavioral search decisions.\n\nSignificance StatementContextual relationships among objects are fundamental for humans to find objects in real world scenes. Although there is a larger literature understanding the brain mechanisms when a target appears at a location indicated by a synthetic cue such as an arrow or box, less is known about how the scene context modulates target-related neural activity. Here we show how neural activity predictive of the presence of a searched object in cluttered real scenes increases when the target object appears at a contextual location and diminishes when it appears at a place that is out of context. The results increase our understanding of how the brain processes real scenes and how context modulates object processing.",

    "abstract": "Fast movements like saccadic eye movements that occur in the absence of sensory feedback are often thought to be under internal feedback control. In this framework, a desired input in the form of desired displacement signal is widely believed to be encoded in a spatial map of the superior colliculus (SC). This is then converted into a dynamic velocity signal that drives the oculomotor neurons. However, recent evidence has shown the presence of a dynamic signal within SC neurons, which correlates with saccade velocity. Hence, we used models based on optimal control theory to test whether saccadic execution could be achieved by a velocity based internal feedback controller. We compared the ability of a trajectory control model based on velocity to that of an endpoint control model based on final displacement to capture saccade behavior of modulation of peak saccade velocity by the hand movement, independent of the saccade amplitude. The trajectory control model tracking the desired velocity in optimal feedback control framework predicted this saccade velocity modulation better than an endpoint control model. These results suggest that the saccadic system has the flexibility to incorporate a velocity plan based internal feedback control that is imposed by task context.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYWe show that the saccade generation system may use an explicit velocity tracking controller when demand arises. Modulation of peak saccade velocity due to modulation of the velocity of the accompanying hand movement was better captured using a velocity tracking stochastic optimal control model compared to an endpoint model of saccade control. This is the first evidence of trajectory planning and control for the saccadic system based on optimal control theory.",

    "abstract": "Animals communicate using sounds in a wide range of contexts, and auditory systems must encode behaviorally relevant acoustic features to drive appropriate reactions. How feature detection emerges along auditory pathways has been difficult to solve due to challenges in mapping the underlying circuits and characterizing responses to behaviorally relevant features. Here, we study auditory activity in the Drosophila melanogaster brain and investigate feature selectivity for the two main modes of fly courtship song, sinusoids and pulse trains. We identify 24 new cell types of the intermediate layers of the auditory pathway, and using a new connectomic resource, FlyWire, we map all synaptic connections between these cell types, in addition to connections to known early and higher-order auditory neurons - this represents the first map of the auditory pathway. We additionally determine the sign (excitatory or inhibitory) of most synapses in this auditory connectome. We find that auditory neurons display a continuum of preferences for courtship song modes, and that neurons with different song mode preferences are highly interconnected in a network that lacks hierarchical structure. Among this network, frequency tuning is centered on the range of frequencies present in song, whereas pulse rate tuning extends to rates outside of song, suggesting that these neurons form a basis set for downstream processing. Our study provides new insights into the organization of auditory coding within the Drosophila brain.",

    "abstract": "During the prodromal phase of schizophrenia with its complex and insidious clinical picture, electroencephalographic recordings detect widespread oscillation disturbances (or oscillopathies). Neural oscillations are electro-biomarkers of the connectivity state within systems. A single systemic administration of ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, transiently reproduces the oscillopathies with a clinical picture reminiscent of the psychosis prodrome. This acute pharmacological model may help the research and development of innovative treatments against the psychotic transition. Transcranial electrical stimulation is recognized as an appropriate non-invasive therapeutic modality since it can increase cognitive performance and modulate neural oscillations with little or no side effects. Therefore, our objective was to set up, in the sedated adult rat, a stimulation method able to normalize the ketamine-induced oscillopathies. Unilateral transcranial frontoparietal anodal stimulation by direct current (<+1 mA) was applied in ketamine-treated rats. A concomitant electroencephalographic recording of the parietal cortex measured the stimulation effects on its spontaneously-occurring oscillations. A 5-min bipolar anodal tDCS immediately and quickly reduced, significantly with an intensity-effect relationship, the ketamine-induced oscillopathies at least in the bilateral parietal cortex. A duration effect was also recorded. These preliminary neurophysiological findings are promising for developing a therapeutic proof-of-concept against neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe input from the two eyes is combined in the brain. In this combination, the relative strength of the input from each eye is determined by the ocular dominance. Recent work has shown that this dominance can be temporarily shifted. Covering one eye with an eye patch for a few hours makes its contribution stronger. It has been proposed that this shift can be enhanced by exercise. Here, we test this hypothesis using a dichoptic surround suppression task, and with exercise performed according to American College of Sport Medicine guidelines. We measured detection thresholds for patches of sinusoidal grating shown to one eye. When an annular mask grating was shown simultaneously to the other eye, thresholds were elevated. The difference in the elevation found in each eye is our measure of relative eye dominance. We made these measurements before and after 120 minutes of monocular deprivation (with an eye patch). In the control condition, subjects rested during this time. For the exercise condition, 30 minutes of exercise were performed at the beginning of the patching period. This was followed by 90 minutes of rest. We find that patching results in a shift in ocular dominance that can be measured using dichoptic surround suppression. However, we find no effect of exercise on the magnitude of this shift. We further performed a meta-analysis on the four studies that have examined the effects of exercise on the dominance shift. Looking across these studies, we find no evidence for such an effect.",

    "abstract": "I.Cortical beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) reflect sensorimotor cortical activity, but have not been fully investigated in balance recovery behavior. We hypothesized that more challenging balance conditions would lead to greater recruitment of cortical sensorimotor brain regions for balance recovery. We predicted that beta power would be enhanced when balance recovery is more challenging, either due to more difficult perturbations or due to lower intrinsic balance ability. In 19 young adults, we measured beta power evoked over motor cortical areas (Cz electrode) during 3 magnitudes of backward support-surface translational perturbations using electroencephalography. Peak beta power was measured during early (50-150 ms), late (150-250 ms), and overall (0-400 ms) time bins, and wavelet-based analyses quantified the time course of evoked beta power and agonist and antagonist ankle muscle activity. We further assessed the relationship between individual balance ability measured in a challenging beam walking task and perturbation-evoked beta power within each time bin. In balance perturbations, cortical beta power increased [~]50 ms after perturbation onset, demonstrating greater increases with increasing perturbation magnitude. Balance ability was negatively associated with peak beta power in only the late (150-250 ms) time bin, with higher beta power in individuals who performed worse in the beam walking task. Additionally, the time course of cortical beta power followed a similar waveform as the evoked muscle activity, suggesting these evoked responses may be initially evoked by shared underlying mechanisms. These findings support the active role of sensorimotor cortex in balance recovery behavior, with greater recruitment of cortical resources under more challenging balance conditions. Cortical beta power may therefore provide a biomarker for engagement of sensorimotor cortical resources during reactive balance recovery and reflect the individual level of balance challenge.",

    "abstract": "Meningeal lymphatic vessels residing in the dural layer surrounding the dorsal regions of the brain, basal regions, and near the cribriform plate have all been implicated in the management of neuroinflammation and edema. Interestingly, only the lymphatic vessels near the cribriform plate undergo functional lymphangiogenesis in a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis, suggesting these particular lymphatics uniquely undergo dynamic changes in response to neuroinflammation and may have distinct access to pro-lymphangiogenic factors in the CNS. However, it is unknown if these newly formed lymphangiogenic vessels are functionally similar to steady-state or if they have any other functional changes during neuroinflammation. In this study, we generated a novel protocol to isolate lymphatic endothelial cells from the cribriform plate for single cell analysis. We demonstrate that neuroinflammation-induced lymphangiogenic vessels undergo unique changes, including the capture of CNS-derived antigens, upregulation of adhesion and immune-modulatory molecules to interact with dendritic cells, and display IFN-{gamma} dependent changes in response to the microenvironment. Single-cell trajectory analysis showed that cribriform plate lymphangiogenic vessels are post-proliferative and not generated from trans-differentiation of myeloid cells. Additionally, we show that these lymphangiogenic vessels have access to a CSF reservoir, express the water pore Aquaporin-1, and may have direct access to the CSF due to gaps in the arachnoid epithelial layer separating the dura from the subarachnoid space. These data characterize cribriform plate lymphatics and demonstrate that these vessels are dynamic structures that engage in leukocyte interactions, antigen sampling, and undergo expansion to drain excess fluid during neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation not only induces efficient drainage of CSF but also alters the functions of lymphatic vessels near the cribriform plate.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria alternate between being free-swimming and existing as members of sessile multicellular communities called biofilms. The biofilm lifecycle occurs in three stages: cell attachment, biofilm maturation, and biofilm dispersal. Vibrio cholerae biofilms are hyper-infectious and biofilm formation and dispersal are considered central to disease transmission. While biofilm formation is well-studied, almost nothing is known about biofilm dispersal. Here, we conduct an imaging screen for V. cholerae mutants that fail to disperse, revealing three classes of dispersal components: signal transduction proteins, matrix-degradation enzymes, and motility factors. Signaling proteins dominated the screen and among them, we focused on an uncharacterized two-component sensory system that we name DbfS/DbfR for Dispersal of Biofilm Sensor/Regulator. Phospho-DbfR represses biofilm dispersal. DbfS dephosphorylates and thereby inactivates DbfR, which permits dispersal. Matrix degradation requires two enzymes: LapG, which cleaves adhesins, and RbmB, which digests matrix polysaccharide. Reorientations in swimming direction, mediated by CheY3, are necessary for cells to escape from the porous biofilm matrix. We suggest that these components act sequentially: signaling launches dispersal by terminating matrix production and triggering matrix digestion and, subsequently, cell motility permits escape from biofilms. This study lays the groundwork for interventions that modulate V. cholerae biofilm dispersal to ameliorate disease.\n\nSignificance statementThe pathogen Vibrio cholerae alternates between the free-swimming state and existing in sessile multicellular communities known as biofilms. Transitioning between these lifestyles is key for disease transmission. V. cholerae biofilm formation is well studied, however, almost nothing is known about how V. cholerae cells disperse from biofilms, precluding understanding of a central pathogenicity step. Here, we conducted a high-content imaging screen for V. cholerae mutants that failed to disperse. Our screen revealed three classes of components required for dispersal: signal transduction, matrix degradation, and motility factors. We characterized these components to reveal the sequence of molecular events that choreograph V. cholerae biofilm dispersal. Our report provides a framework for developing strategies to modulate biofilm dispersal to prevent or treat disease.",

We herein use molecular and cellular markers to understand the growth and development of the juvenile sea urchin (echinoid) skeleton. We developed a detailed staging scheme based off of the first [~]four weeks of post-metamorphic life of the regular echinoid Paracentrotus lividus. We paired this scheme with immunohistochemical staining for neuronal, muscular, and skeletal tissues, and fluorescent assays of skeletal growth and cell proliferation to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying skeletal growth and development of the sea urchin body plan. Our experiments highlight the role of skeletogenic proteins in accretionary skeletal growth and cell proliferation in the addition of new metameric tissues. Furthermore, our work provides a framework for understanding the developmental evolution of sea urchin body plans on macroevolutionary timescales.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV; genus Hepacivirus) represents a major public health problem, infecting about 3 % of the human population ({+/-} 185,000,000 people). Because no plausible animal reservoir carrying closely related hepaciviruses has been identified, the zoonotic origins of HCV still remain elusive. Motivated by recent findings of divergent hepaciviruses in rodents and a plausible African origin of HCV genotypes, we have screened a comprehensive collection of small mammals samples from seven sub-Saharan African countries. Out of 4,303 samples screened, 80 were found positive for the presence of hepaciviruses in 29 different host species. We here report 56 novel genomes that considerably increase the diversity of three divergent rodent hepacivirus lineages, which previously were almost exclusively represented by New World and European hepaciviruses. Further-more, we provide undisputable evidence for hepacivirus co-infections in rodents, which remarkably, we exclusively but repeatedly found in four sampled species of brush-furred mice. We also point at hepacivirus co-infections indirectly in different animal hosts by demonstrating evidence for recombination within specific host lineages. Our study considerably expands the available hepacivirus genomic data and elucidates the relatively deep evolutionary history that these pathogens have in rodents compared to other mammalian hosts. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of rodents as a potential hepacivirus reservoir and as models for investigating HCV infection dynamics.",

Mammae number is hypothesized to coevolve with litter size, acting as a constraint on offspring survival. However, predicted canonical relations between mammae number and litter size (i.e., the  one-half and  identity rules) are untested across Mammalia. Here we analyze data for 2,301 species and show how these characters coevolve. In Mammalia, mammae number approximates the maximum reported litter size of a species, and mammae number explains more variation in litter size than other species-level traits (mass, gestation length, diet, and seasonality of contemporary geographic distribution). Clades show differences in these patterns, indicating that certain life history strategies might break the  rules of mammary evolution. Mammae number is an underappreciated constraint on fecundity that has influenced the radiation of mammals.",

The influence of host RBC variation on parasite replication is largely uncharted, aside from a handful of deleterious alleles like sickle cell. Here, we integrated analyses of exome sequencing, RBC phenotyping, and parasite fitness assays on blood from 122 individuals, most with African ancestry. In donors lacking alleles for hemoglobinopathies or G6PD deficiency, RBC phenotypes including size, deformability, and hydration status explained 21-38% of the variation in parasite growth rate. With the addition of non-pathogenic polymorphisms in 14 RBC proteins including SPTA1, PIEZO1, and ATP2B4, our model explained 73-82% of the variation in parasite growth rate. Interestingly, we observed little evidence for divergent selection on this variation between Africans and Europeans. These findings suggest a model in which widespread, non-pathogenic variation in a moderate number of genes strongly modulates P. falciparum fitness in RBCs.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition plays an important role in the development and progress of several health conditions, but the exact mechanism is often still unclear. Blood metabolites are likely candidates to be mediating these relationships, as their levels are strongly dependent on the frequency of consumption of several foods/drinks. Understanding the causal effect of food on metabolites is thus of extreme importance. To establish these effects we utilized Two-sample Mendelian randomization using the genetic variants associated with dietary traits as instrumental variables. The estimates of single-nucleotide polymorphisms effects on exposures were obtained from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 25 individual and 15 principal-component dietary traits, whereas the ones for outcomes were obtained from a GWAS of 123 blood metabolites measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We identified 417 potentially causal links between food and metabolites, replicating previous findings, such as the association between increased oily fish consumption and higher DHA, and highlighting several novel associations. Most of the associations were related to very-low-density, intermediate-density (IDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). For example, we found that constituents of IDL particles and large LDL particles were raised by coffee and alcohol while lowered by an overall healthier diet and fruit consumption. Our results represent one of the first examples of the estimates of long-term causal effects of diet on metabolites and start bridging the gap in the mechanistic understanding linking food consumption to its health consequences.",

    "abstract": "Rising atmospheric CO2 reduces seawater pH causing ocean acidification (OA). Understanding how resilient marine organisms respond to OA may help predict how community dynamics will shift as CO2 continues rising. The common slipper shell snail Crepidula fornicata is a resilient marine gastropod native to eastern North America, which has been a successful invader along the western European coastline and elsewhere. To examine its potential resilience to OA, we conducted two controlled laboratory experiments. First, we examined several phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression of C. fornicata in response to pH treatments (7.5, 7.6, 8.0) throughout the larval stage and then tested how conditions experienced as larvae influenced juvenile stages (i.e. carryover effects). Second, we examined genome-wide gene expression patterns of C. fornicata larvae in response to acute (4, 10, 24 and 48 hours) pH treatment (7.5, 8.0). Both C. fornicata larvae and juveniles exhibited resilience to OA and gene expression responses highlight the role of transcriptome plasticity in OA resilience. Larvae did not exhibit reduced growth under OA until they were at least 4 days old. These phenotypic effects were preceded by broad transcriptomic changes, which likely serve as an acclimation mechanism for combating reduced pH conditions frequently experienced in littoral zones. Delayed metamorphosis was observed for larvae reared at reduced pH. Although juvenile size reflected larval rearing pH conditions, no carryover effects in juvenile growth rates were observed. Transcriptomic analyses suggest increased metabolism under OA, which may indicate compensation in reduced pH environments. Time course transcriptomic analyses suggest energetic burdens experienced under OA eventually dissipate, allowing C. fornicata to reduce metabolic demands and acclimate to reduced pH. This study highlights the importance of assessing the effects of OA across life history stages and demonstrates how transcriptomic plasticity can allow highly resilient organisms, like C. fornicata, acclimate to reduced pH environments.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in biology is to understand how spatiotemporal patterns and structures arise during the development of an organism. An initial aggregate of spatially uniform cells develops and forms the differentiated structures of a fully developed organism. On the one hand, contact-dependent cell-cell signalling is responsible for generating a large number of complex, self-organized, spatial patterns in the distribution of the signalling molecules. On the other hand, the motility of cells coupled with their polarity can independently lead to collective motion patterns that depend on mechanical parameters influencing tissue deformation, such as cellular elasticity, cell-cell adhesion and active forces generated by actin and myosin dynamics. Although modelling efforts have, thus far, treated cell motility and cell-cell signalling separately, experiments in recent years suggest that these processes could be tightly coupled. Hence, in this paper, we study how the dynamics of cell polarity and migration influence the spatiotemporal patterning of signalling molecules. Such signalling interactions can occur only between cells that are in physical contact, either directly at the junctions of adjacent cells or through cellular protrusional contacts. We present a vertex model which accounts for contact-dependent signalling between adjacent cells and between non-adjacent neighbours through long protrusional contacts that occur along the orientation of cell polarization. We observe a rich variety of spatiotemporal patterns of signalling molecules that is influenced by polarity dynamics of the cells, relative strengths of adjacent and non-adjacent signalling interactions, range of polarized interaction, signalling activation threshold, relative time scales of signalling and polarity orientation, and cell motility. Though our results are developed in the context of Delta-Notch signalling, they are sufficiently general and can be extended to other contact dependent morpho-mechanical dynamics.",

Heterochromatic histone methylation controls nucleus and chromosome stiffness, but the contribution of heterochromatin protein HP1 (CBX5) is unknown. We used a novel HP1 auxin-inducible degron human cell line to rapidly degrade HP1. Degradation did not alter transcription, local chromatin compaction, or histone methylation, but did decrease chromatin stiffness. Single-nucleus micromanipulation reveals that HP1 is essential to chromatin-based mechanics and maintains nuclear morphology, separate from histone methylation. Further experiments with dimerization-deficient HP1I165E indicate that chromatin crosslinking via HP1 dimerization is critical, while polymer simulations demonstrate the importance of chromatin-chromatin crosslinkers in mechanics. In mitotic chromosomes, HP1 similarly bolsters stiffness while aiding in mitotic alignment and faithful segregation. HP1 is therefore a critical chromatin-crosslinking protein that provides mechanical strength to chromosomes and the nucleus throughout the cell cycle and supports cellular functions.",

Insects are trapped when they  aquaplane on the pitcher rim (peristome), a surface structured with macroscopic and microscopic radial ridges. What is the functional significance of this hierarchical surface topography? Here, we use insect pad friction measurements, photolithography, wetting experiments and physical modelling to demonstrate that the ridges enhance the traps efficacy by satisfying two functional demands on prey capture: Macroscopic ridges restrict lateral but enhance radial spreading of water, thereby creating continuous slippery tracks which facilitate prey capture when little water is present. Microscopic ridges, in turn, ensure that the water film between insect pad and peristome remains stable, causing insects to aquaplane. In combination, the hierarchical ridge structure hence renders the peristome wettable, and water films continuous, so avoiding the need for a strongly hydrophilic surface chemistry, which would compromise resistance to desiccation and attract detrimental contamination.",

CLAMP promotes transcription of genes involved in stemness, proliferation, and glial development and represses transcription of genes involved in neurogenesis and niche survival. Consistent with transcriptional changes, CLAMP promotes NSC proliferation and SG production. Furthermore, glial-specific knock-down of clamp causes similar phenotypes to clamp null mutants. CLAMP motifs are present at many target genes including the glial-determining gene, glial cells missing, and Notch, a key regulator of neurogenesis. Collectively, our results suggest that CLAMP regulates a transcriptional program which drives NSC proliferation and differentiation via cell-intrinsic and niche-dependent mechanisms that involve niche glia.",

Here, we investigated these two MAP3Ks in cerebellar Purkinje cells using loss- and gain-of function mouse models. While loss of each or both kinases does not cause discernible defects in Purkinje cells, activating DLK causes rapid death and activating LZK leads to slow degeneration. Each kinase induces JNK activation and caspase-mediated apoptosis independent of each other. Significantly, deleting CELF2, which regulates alternative splicing of Mkk7, strongly attenuates Purkinje cell degeneration induced by activation of LZK, but not DLK.

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are small, non-enveloped, and have a T=1 icosahedral capsid. They belong to the Parvoviridae, genus Dependoparvovirus. Interest in AAVs has grown over recent years as they have emerged as promising gene therapy vectors. The AAV capsid, encapsulating the transgene, consists, in total, of 60 subunits made up from three distinct viral proteins (VPs) originating from the same cap gene (VP1, VP2, and VP3), which vary only in their N-terminus. While all three VPs play a crucial and specific role in cell-entry and transduction, their exact stoichiometry and organization in AAV capsids has, despite the availability of several high-resolution structures remained elusive. Here we obtained a set of native mass spectra of intact AAV capsids (Mw {approx} 3.8 MDa) that display both highly resolved regions and regions wherein interferences occur. Through spectrum simulation we resolved and elucidated this spectral complexity, allowing us to directly assess the VP stoichiometries in a panel of serotypes from different production platforms. The data reveals an extremely heterogeneous population of capsids of variable composition. The relative abundance for each of the hundreds of co-occurring capsid compositions is accurately described by a model based upon stochastic assembly from a mixed pool of expressed VP1, VP2, and VP3. We show that even the single-most abundant VP stoichiometry represents only a few percent of the total AAV population. We estimate that virtually every AAV capsid in a particular preparation has a unique composition and arrangement, i.e. no particle is identical. The systematic scoring of the stochastic assembly model against experimental high-resolution native MS data offers a sensitive and accurate new method to characterize these exceptionally heterogeneous gene-delivery vectors.",

    "abstract": "Recombinantly produced proteins are indispensable tools for medical applications. Since the majority of them are glycoproteins, their N-glycosylation profiles are major determinants for their activity, structural properties and safety. For therapeutical applications, a glycosylation pattern adapted to product and treatment requirements is advantageous. Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens, moss) is able to perform highly homogeneous complex-type N-glycosylation. Additionally, it has been glyco-engineered to eliminate plant-specific sugar residues by knock-out of the {beta}1,2-xylosyltransferase and 1,3-fucosyltransferase genes ({Delta}xt/ft). Furthermore, P. patens meets wide-ranging biopharmaceutical requirements such as GMP compliance, product safety, scalability and outstanding possibilities for precise genome engineering. However, all plants, in contrast to mammals, lack the capability to perform N-glycan sialylation. Since sialic acids are a common terminal modification on human N-glycans, the property to perform N-glycan sialylation is highly desired within the plant-based biopharmaceutical sector. In this study, we present the successful achievement of protein N-glycan sialylation in stably transformed P. patens. The sialylation ability was achieved in a {Delta}xt/ft moss line by stable expression of six mammalian coding sequences combined with targeted organelle-specific localization of the encoded enzymes responsible for synthesis, activation, transport and transfer of sialic acid. Production of free and (CMP)-activated sialic acid was proven. The glycosidic anchor for the attachment of terminal sialic acid was generated by the introduction of a chimeric human {beta}1,4-galactosyltransferase gene under the simultaneous knock-out of the gene encoding the endogenous {beta}1,3-galactosyltransferase. Functional complex-type N-glycan sialylation was confirmed via mass spectrometric analysis of a stably co-expressed recombinant human protein.",

Mammalian cells express up to three isoforms termed NM IIA, B, and C. We used U2OS cells to create CRISPR/Cas9-based knockouts of all three isoforms and analyzed the phenotypes on homogeneous substrates, in collagen gels, and on micropatterned substrates. We find that NM IIA is essential to build up cellular tension during initial stages of force generation, while NM IIB is necessary to elastically stabilize NM IIA-generated tension. A scale-bridging mathematical model explains our observations by relating actin fiber stability to the molecular rates of the myosin crossbridge cycle. A dynamic cell stretch/release experiment confirms these predictions and in addition reveals a novel role for NM IIC, namely the ability to establish tensional homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Oncogene-induced metabolic reprograming supports cell growth and proliferation. Yet, it also links cancer cell survival to certain metabolic pathways and nutrients. In order to synthesise amino acids and nucleotides de novo for growth and proliferation, cancer cells depend on glycolysis, the cytoplasmic oxidation of glucose, which generates necessary metabolic intermediates and ATP. During glycolysis, NAD+ is used as the oxidizing agent and is thereby reduced into NADH. To ensure high glycolysis rates and maintain NADH/NAD+ homeostasis, cytoplasmic NAD+ has to be regenerated. The mitochondria are the major sites of NADH reoxidation into NAD+ where NADH-derived electrons enter the electron transport chain for ATP production. Since NADH/NAD+ cannot cross membranes, the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) or the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (GPS) are used as intermediate electron carriers. In addition, cytoplasmic NAD+ is generated by NADH-electron transfer to pyruvate, reducing it to lactate (the Warburg effect). NADH/NAD+ homeostasis plays a pivotal role in cancer cell survival, but our knowledge about the involved regulatory mechanisms is still limited. Here, we show that the proto-oncogenic transcription factor C/EBP{beta}-LIP stimulates both glycolysis and the MAS. Inhibition of glycolysis with ongoing C/EBP{beta}-LIP-induced MAS activity results in NADH depletion and apoptosis that can be rescued by inhibiting either the MAS or other NADH-consuming processes. Therefore, beyond the discovery of C/EBP{beta}-LIP as a dual activator of glycolysis and the MAS, this study indicates that simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and lowering of the NADH/NAD+ ratio may be considered to treat cancer.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic associations between animals and microorganisms are widespread and have a profound impact on the ecology, behaviour, physiology, and evolution of the host. Research on deep-sea mussels of the genus Bathymodiolus has revealed how chemosynthetic symbionts sustain their host with energy, allowing them to survive in the nutrient-poor environment of the deep ocean. However, to date, we know little about the initial symbiont colonization and how this is integrated into the early development of these mussels. Here we analysed the early developmental life stages of B. azoricus, \"B\". childressi and B. puteoserpentis and the changes that occur once the mussels are colonized by symbionts. We combined synchrotron-radiation based {micro}CT, correlative light and electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization to show that the symbiont colonization started when the animal settled on the sea floor and began its metamorphosis into an adult animal. Furthermore, we observed aposymbiotic life stages with a fully developed digestive system which was streamlined after symbiont acquisition. This suggests that bathymodiolin mussels change their nutritional strategy from initial filter-feeding to relying on the energy provided by their symbionts. After [~]35 years of research on bathymodiolin mussels, we are beginning to answer fundamental ecological questions concerning their life cycle and the establishment of symbiosis.",

Utilizing the mushroom body (MB), a major learning and memory center within the Drosophila brain, we demonstrate that KDM5 is specifically required within ganglion mother cells and immature neurons for proper neurodevelopment and cognitive function. Within this cellular subpopulation, we identify a core network of KDM5-regulated genes that are critical modulators of neurodevelopment. Significantly, we find that a majority of these genes are direct targets of Prospero (Pros), a transcription factor with well-established roles in neurodevelopment in other neuronal contexts. We demonstrate that Pros is essential for MB development and functions downstream of KDM5 to regulate MB morphology. We therefore provide evidence for a KDM5-Pros axis that orchestrates a transcriptional program critical for proper axonal development and cognitive function.",

Distinct subtypes of mDA neurons regulate these functions but the molecular mechanisms that drive the mDA circuit formation are largely unknown. Here we show that autophagy, the main recycling cellular pathway, is present in the growth cones of developing mDA neurons and its level changes dynamically in response to guidance cues. To characterize the role of autophagy in mDA axon growth/guidance, we knocked-out (KO) essential autophagy genes (Atg12, Atg5) in mice mDA neurons. Autophagy deficient mDA axons exhibit axonal swellings and decreased branching both in vitro and in vivo, likely due to aberrant microtubule looping. Strikingly, deletion of autophagy-related genes, blunted completely the response of mDA neurons to chemo-repulsive and chemo-attractive guidance cues. Our data demonstrate that autophagy plays a central role in regulating mDA neurons development, orchestrating axonal growth and guidance.",

We show that independently of telomerase, T cells elongate telomeres by acquiring telomere vesicles from antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Upon contact with T cells, APCs degraded shelterin to donate telomeres, which were cleaved by TZAP, and then transferred in extracellular vesicles (EVs) at the immunological synapse. Telomere vesicles retained the Rad51 recombination factor that enabled them to fuse with T cell chromosomal ends causing an average lengthening of [~]3000 base pairs.

Here, we show that C57Bl/6 neutrophils with genomic knock-in of a mutation that disables all RGS protein-Gi2 interactions (G184S) cannot properly balance chemoattractant receptor signaling, nor appropriately respond to inflammatory insults. Mutant neutrophils accumulate in bone marrow, spleen, lung, and liver; despite neutropenia and an intrinsic inability to properly mobilize from bone marrow. In vitro they rapidly adhere to ICAM-1 coated plates, but poorly adhere to blood vessel endotheliums in vivo. Those few neutrophils that cross endotheliums migrate haphazardly. Following Concanavalin-A administration fragmented G184S neutrophils accumulate in liver sinusoids leading to thrombo-inflammation and perivasculitis. Thus, neutrophil Gi2/RGS protein interactions limit and facilitate Gi2 signaling allowing normal neutrophil trafficking, aging, and clearance.",

    "abstract": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), the best characterized member of the Birnaviridae family, is a highly relevant avian pathogen causing both acute and persistent infections in different avian hosts. Here, we describe the establishment of clonal, long-term, productive persistent IBDV infections in DF-1 chicken embryonic fibroblasts. Although virus yields in persistently-infected cells are exceedingly lower than those detected in acutely infected cells, the replication fitness of viruses isolated from persistently-infected cells is higher than that of the parental virus. Persistently-infected DF-1 and IBDV-cured cell lines derived from them do not respond to type I interferon (IFN). High-throughput genome sequencing revealed that this defect is due to mutations affecting the IFN/{beta} receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) gene resulting in the expression of IFNAR2 polypeptides harbouring large C-terminal deletions that abolish the signalling capacity of IFN/{beta} receptor complex. Ectopic expression of a recombinant chicken IFNAR2 gene efficiently rescues IFN responsiveness. IBDV-cured cell lines derived from persistently infected cells exhibit a drastically enhanced proneness to establishing new persistent IBDV infections. Additionally, experiments carried out with human HeLa cells lacking the IFNAR2 gene fully recapitulate results obtained with DF-1 cells, exhibiting a highly enhanced capacity to both survive the acute IBDV infection phase and to support the establishment of persistent IBDV infections. Results presented here show that the inactivation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway significantly reduces the apoptotic response induced by the infection, hence facilitating the establishment and maintenance of IBDV persistent infections.\n\nIMPORTANCEMembers of the Birnaviridae family, including infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), exhibit a dual behaviour, causing acute infections that are often followed by the establishment of life-long persistent asymptomatic infections. Indeed, persistently infected specimens might act as efficient virus reservoirs, hence potentially contributing to virus dissemination. Despite the key importance of this biological trait, information about mechanisms triggering IBDV persistency is negligible. Our report evidences the capacity of IBDV, a highly relevant avian pathogen, to establishing long-term, productive, persistent infections in both avian and human cell lines. Data presented here provide novel and direct evidence about the crucial role of type I IFNs on the fate of IBDV-infected cells and their contribution to controlling the establishment of IBDV persistent infections. The use of cell lines unable to respond to type I IFNs opens a promising venue to unveiling additional factors contributing to IBDV persistency.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are important delivery platforms for therapeutic genome editing but are severely constrained by cargo limits, especially for large effectors like Cas9s. Simultaneous delivery of multiple vectors can limit dose and efficacy and increase safety risks. The use of compact effectors has enabled single-AAV delivery of Cas9s with 1-3 guides for edits that use end-joining repair pathways, but many precise edits that correct disease-causing mutations in vivo require homology-directed repair (HDR) templates. Here, we describe single-vector, [~]4.8-kb AAV platforms that express Nme2Cas9 and either two sgRNAs to produce segmental deletions, or a single sgRNA with an HDR template. We also examine the utility of Nme2Cas9 target sites in the vector for self-inactivation. We demonstrate that these platforms can effectively treat two disease models [type I hereditary tyrosinemia (HT-I) and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I)] in mice. These results will enable single-vector AAVs to achieve diverse therapeutic genome editing outcomes.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-Propellers are found in great variety across all kingdoms of life. They assume many cellular roles, primarily as scaffolds for macromolecular interactions and catalysis. Despite their diversity, most {beta}-propeller families clearly originated by amplification from the same ancient peptide - the {beta}-propeller blade. In cluster analyses, {beta}-propellers of the WD40 superfamily always formed the largest group, to which some important families, such as the -integrin, Asp-box, and glycoside hydrolase {beta}-propellers connected weakly. Motivated by the dramatic growth of sequence databases we revisited these connections, with a special focus on VCBS-like {beta}-propellers, which have not been analysed for their evolutionary relationships so far. We found that they form a supercluster with integrin-like {beta}-propellers and tachylectins, clearly delimited from the superclusters formed by WD40 and Asp-Box {beta}-propeller. Connections between the three superclusters are made mainly through PQQ-like {beta}-propeller. Our results present a new, greatly expanded view of the {beta}-propeller classification landscape.",

    "abstract": "The Polycomb repressive system plays a fundamental role in controlling gene expression during mammalian development. To achieve this, Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) bind target genes and use histone modification-dependent feedback mechanisms to form Polycomb chromatin domains and repress transcription. The interrelatedness of PRC1 and PRC2 activity at these sites has made it difficult to discover the specific components of Polycomb chromatin domains that drive gene repression and to understand mechanistically how this is achieved. Here, by exploiting rapid degron-based approaches and time-resolved genomics we kinetically dissect Polycomb-mediated repression and discover that PRC1 functions independently of PRC2 to counteract RNA polymerase II binding and transcription initiation. Using single-cell gene expression analysis, we reveal that PRC1 acts uniformly within the cell population, and that repression is achieved by controlling transcriptional burst frequency. These important new discoveries provide a mechanistic and conceptual framework for Polycomb-dependent transcriptional control.",

Here we find that its ubiquitously expressed paralog RBMX helps underpin human genome stability by preventing non-productive splicing. In particular, RBMX blocks selection of aberrant splice and polyadenylation sites within some ultra-long exons that would interfere with genes needed for normal replication fork activity. Target exons include within the ETAA1 (Ewings Tumour Associated 1) gene, where RBMX collaborates with its interaction partner Tra2{beta} to enable full-length exon inclusion by blocking selection of an aberrant 3 splice site. Our data reveal a novel group of RNA processing targets potently repressed by RBMX, and help explain why RBMX is associated with gene expression networks in cancer, replication and sensitivity to genotoxic drugs.",

    "abstract": "The pioneer transcription factor Pax7 contains two DNA binding domains (DBD), a paired and a homeo domain. Previous work on Pax7 and the related Pax3 had shown that each DBD can bind a cognate DNA sequence, thus defining two targets of binding and possibly modalities of action. Genomic targets of Pax7 pioneer action leading to chromatin opening are enriched for composite DNA target sites containing juxtaposed binding sites for both paired and homeo domains. The present work investigated the implication of both DBDs in pioneer action. We now show that the composite sequence is a higher affinity Pax7 binding site compared to either paired or homeo binding sites and that efficient binding to this site involves both DBDs. We also show that a Pax7 monomer binds composite sites and that methylation of cytosines within the binding site does not affect binding, which is consistent with pioneer action exerted at methylated DNA sites within nucleosomal heterochromatin. Finally, introduction of single amino acid mutations in either the paired or homeo domain that impair binding to cognate DNA sequences showed that both DBDs must be intact for pioneer action. In contrast, only the paired domain is required for low affinity binding of heterochromatin sites. Thus, Pax7 pioneer action on heterochromatin requires unique protein:DNA interactions that are more complex compared to its simpler DNA binding modalities at accessible enhancer target sites.\n\nSignificance StatementPioneer transcription factors have the unique ability to recognize DNA target sites within closed heterochromatin and to trigger chromatin opening. Only a fraction of the heterochromatin recruitment sites of pioneers are subject to chromatin opening. The molecular basis for this selectivity is unknown and the present work addressed the importance of DNA sequence affinity for selection of sites to open. The pioneering ability of the pioneer factor Pax7 is not strictly determined by affinity or DNA sequence of binding sites, nor by number or methylation status of DNA sites. Mutation analyses showed that recruitment to heterochromatin is primarily dependent on the Pax7 paired domain whereas the ability to open chromatin requires both paired and homeo DNA binding domains.",

Uncovering strategies used by mobile genetic elements to benefit host cells is crucial for understanding their stability and spread in populations. We describe a benefit that ICEBs1, an integrative and conjugative element of Bacillus subtilis, provides to its host cells. Activation of ICEBs1 conferred a frequency-dependent selective advantage to host cells during two different developmental processes: biofilm formation and sporulation. These benefits were due to inhibition of biofilm-associated gene expression and delayed sporulation by ICEBs1-containing cells, enabling them to exploit their neighbors and grow more prior to development. A single ICEBs1 gene, devI (formerly ydcO), was both necessary and sufficient for inhibition of development. Manipulation of host developmental programs allows ICEBs1 to increase host fitness, thereby increasing propagation of the element.",

Spacers are transcribed and processed to generate RNA guides used by CRISPR-associated nucleases to recognize and destroy the complementary nucleic acids of invaders. To counteract this defense, phages can produce small proteins that inhibit these nucleases. Here we demonstrate that the {Phi}AP1.1 temperate phage utilizes an alternate approach to antagonize the type II-A CRISPR response in Streptococcus pyogenes. Immediately after infection this phage expresses a canonical anti-CRISPR, AcrIIA23 that prevents Cas9 function, allowing {Phi}AP1.1 to integrate into the direct repeats of the CRISPR locus and neutralizing immunity. However, acrIIA23 is not transcribed during lysogeny and phage integration/excision cycles can result in the deletion and/or transfer of spacers, enabling a complex modulation of the type II-A CRISPR immune response.",

In songbirds, dopamine signaling guides song motor-production, variability, and motivation, but it is unclear how dopamine regulates fundamental auditory associations for learning new sounds. We hypothesized that dopamine regulates learning in the auditory pallium, in part by interacting with local neuroestradiol signaling. Here, we show that zebra finch auditory neurons frequently coexpress D1 receptor (D1R) protein, neuroestradiol-synthase, GABA, and parvalbumin. Auditory classical conditioning increased neuroplasticity gene induction in D1R-positive neurons. In vitro, D1R pharmacological activation reduced the amplitude of GABAergic and glutamatergic currents, and increased the latters frequency. In vivo, D1R activation reduced the firing of putative interneurons, increased the firing of putative excitatory neurons, and made both neuronal types unable to adapt to novel stimuli. Together, these data support the hypothesis that dopamine acting via D1Rs modulates learning and memory in the songbird sensory cortex.",

However, the molecular and cellular basis for ultrasonic hearing is not known yet. Here we show that knockout of the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO2 in cochlea disrupts the ultrasonic hearing but not the low-frequency hearing in mice, as shown by audiometry and acoustically-associative freezing behavior. Deletion of Piezo2 in the outer hair cells specifically abolishes the associative learning of the mice upon hearing the ultrasonic frequency. Ex vivo cochlear Ca2+ imaging revealed that the ultrasonic transduction requires both PIEZO2 and the hair-cell mechanotransduction channel. Together, our study demonstrates that the outer hair cells are the effector cells with PIEZO2 as an essential molecule for ultrasonic hearing in mice.\n\nSignificance StatementSome animals have evolved an incredible ability for vocalizing and hearing ultrasonic frequencies that is inaudible for humans (> 20 kHz). For many years, it has been considered that animals hear ultrasonic frequencies with their cochlear hair cells, using the identical set of mechanotransduction molecules in the hair bundles for hearing audible frequencies. Here, we show that the mice lacking the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO2 hardly hear ultrasonic frequencies, while can still be sensitive to audible frequencies.

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryAs the tools to simultaneously record electrophysiological signals from large numbers of neurons within and across brain regions become increasingly available, this opens up for the first time the possibility of establishing the details of causal relationships between monosynaptically connected neurons and the patterns of neural activation that underlie perception and behavior. Although recorded activity across synaptically connected neurons has served as the cornerstone for much of what we know about synaptic transmission and plasticity, this has largely been relegated to ex-vivo preparations that enable precise targeting under relatively well-controlled conditions. Analogous studies in-vivo, where image-guided targeting is often not yet possible, rely on indirect, data-driven measures, and as a result such studies have been sparse and the dependence upon important experimental parameters has not been well studied. Here, using in-vivo extracellular single unit recordings in the topographically aligned rodent thalamocortical pathway, we sought to establish a general experimental and computational framework for inferring synaptic connectivity. Specifically, attacking this problem within a statistical signal-detection framework utilizing experimentally recorded data in the ventral-posterior medial (VPm) region of the thalamus and the homologous region in layer 4 of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) revealed a trade-off between network activity levels needed for the data-driven inference and synchronization of nearby neurons within the population that result in masking of synaptic relationships. Taken together, we provide a framework for establishing connectivity in multi-site, multi-electrode recordings based on statistical inference, setting the stage for large-scale assessment of synaptic connectivity within and across brain structures.\n\nNew & NoteworthyDespite the fact that all brain function relies on the long-range transfer of information across different regions, the tools enabling us to measure connectivity across brain structures are lacking. Here, we provide a statistical framework for identifying and assessing potential monosynaptic connectivity across neuronal circuits from population spiking activity that generalizes to large-scale recording technologies that will help us to better understand the signaling within networks that underlies perception and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The exquisite capacity of primates to detect and recognize faces is crucial for social interactions. Although disentangling the neural basis of human face recognition remains a key goal in neuroscience, direct evidence at the single-neuron level is virtually nonexistent. We recorded from face-selective neurons in human visual cortex, in a region characterized by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations for faces compared to objects (i.e. the occipital face area, OFA). The majority of visually responsive neurons in this fMRI activation showed strong selectivity at short latencies for faces compared to objects. Feature scrambled faces and face-like objects could also drive these neurons, suggesting that the OFA is not tightly-tuned to the visual attributes that typically define whole human faces. These single-cell recordings within the human face processing system provide vital experimental evidence linking previous imaging studies in humans and invasive studies in animal models.",

    "abstract": "Replication of DNA is an essential process in all domains of life. A protein often involved without exception in replication is the sliding clamp. The sliding clamp encircles the DNA and helps replicative polymerase stay attached to the replication machinery increasing the processivity of the polymerase. In eukaryotes and archaea the sliding clamp is called the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and consists of two domains. This PCNA forms a trimer encircling the DNA as a hexamer. In bacteria, the structure of the sliding clamp is highly conserved, but the protein itself, called beta clamp, contains three domains, which dimerize to form a hexamer. The bulk of literature touts a conservation of the structure of the sliding clamp, but fails to recognize conservation of protein sequence among sliding clamps. In this paper we have used PSI blast to the second interation in NCBI to show a statistically significant sequence homology between Pyrococcus furiosus PCNA and Kallipyga gabonensis beta clamp. The last two domains of beta clamp align with the two domains of PCNA. This homology data demonstrates that PCNA and beta clamp arose from a common ancestor. In this paper, we have further used beta clamp and PCNA sequences from diverse bacteria, archaea and eukarya to build maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Most, but not all, species in different domains of life harbor one sliding clamp from vertical inheritance. Some of these species that have two or more sliding clamps have acquired them from gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer events.",

    "abstract": "Parents have large genetic and environmental influences on their childrens cognition, behavior, and brain. Previous studies have indicated intergenerational transfer of the behavior of reading. Despite a close coupling between brain and behavior however, the intergenerational transfer of reading-related structural brain networks have not been investigated. Therefore, we investigated its parent-child associations for the first time. We examined how white matter tracts i.e., Arcuate Fasciculus (AF) and Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus (IFOF), are associated with childrens early reading development from Kindergarten to Grade 3 in 33 families. First, we observed in our sample of children -who all had typical reading skills despite half of them having an increased risk for dyslexia- that fractional anisotropy in bilateral IFOF and right AF correlated with reading development. Second, parent-child correlations were observed for bilateral IFOF but not for AF. Finally, we demonstrated that the relation between childrens IFOF and reading development was largely explained by parental IFOF. The findings preliminarily suggest that white matter organization in IFOF represents a pre-existing protective factor in children at risk, as it is mainly determined by biological parental factors. Large-scale intergenerational, multi-level and longitudinal studies are needed to understand the dynamic interrelations between brain, environment and behavior.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disease that affects one in every 3000 individuals. This disease can present a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from skin abnormalities to severe vascular changes. Although little recognized, cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), often present since childhood and diagnosed late, may have clinical manifestations ranging from headache and cognitive deficits to aneurysm rupture causing death. Thus, the CVD play an important role in the clinical manifestations, the severity of the condition and the prognosis of patients with NF-1. This systematic review aims to summarize the body of evidence linking NF-1 and CVD the in children.\n\nMethodsTwo independent reviewers performed a systematic review on the PubMed and EMBASE search platforms, using the following key terms: \"neurofibromatosis type 1\", \"recklinghausen disease\", \"children\", \"adolescents\", \"stroke\", \"moyamoya disease\", \"vascular diseases\", \"cerebrovascular disorders\", \"aneurysm\" and \"congenital abnormalities\". Studies focused on assessing the development of CVD in children with NF-1 were included.\n\nResultsSeven studies met the inclusion criteria. Twelve different clinical manifestations have been associated with cerebrovascular changes in children with NF-1; 44,5% of diagnosed patients were asymptomatic.\n\nConclusionThe available evidence suggests that cerebrovascular diseases are related with the progression of NF-1, even in the absence of a clear clinical manifestation. In addition, better prognosis was observed when imaging tests were performed to screen for cerebrovascular changes. This generated early interventions and consequently more favorable outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are a highly heterogeneous subtype of Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about 25% of NHL [1]. Despite an increased progression-free survival upon therapy, 40-50% of patients develop relapse/refractory disease, therefore there remains an important medical need [2]. T cell recruiting therapies, such as the CD20xCD3 T cell bi-specific antibody CD20-TCB (RG6026 or glofitamab), represent a novel approach to target all stages of DLBCL, especially those that fail to respond to multiple lines of treatment [3, 4]. We aimed for a better understanding of the molecular features related to the mode of action (MoA) of CD20-TCB in inducing Target/T cell synapse formation and human T cell recruitment to the tumor. To directly evaluate the correlation between synapse, cytokine production and anti-tumor efficacy using CD20-TCB, we developed an innovative preclinical human DLBCL in vivo model that allowed tracking in vivo human T cell dynamics by multiphoton intravital microscopy (MP-IVM). By ex vivo and in vivo approaches, we revealed that CD20-TCB is inducing strong and stable synapses between human T cell and tumor cells, which are dependent on the dose of CD20-TCB and on LFA-1 activity but not on FAS-L. Moreover, despite CD20-TCB being a large molecule (194.342 kDa), we observed that intra-tumor CD20-TCB-mediated human T cell-tumor cell synapses occur within 1 hour upon CD20-TCB administration. These tight interactions, observed for at least 72 hours post TCB administration, result in tumor cell cytotoxicity, resident T cell proliferation and peripheral blood T cell recruitment into tumor. By blocking the IFN{gamma}-CXCL10 axis, the recruitment of peripheral T cells was abrogated, partially affecting the efficacy of CD20-TCB treatment which rely only on resident T cell proliferation. Altogether these data reveal that CD20-TCBs anti-tumor activity relies on a triple effect: i) fast formation of stable T cell-tumor cell synapses which induce tumor cytotoxicity and cytokine production, ii) resident T cell proliferation and iii) recruitment of fresh peripheral T cells to the tumor core to allow a positive enhancement of the anti-tumor effect.",

The aim of the study was to highlight the immunological events associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an emphasis on cells of innate immunity. Thirty COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate symptoms and 27 patients with severe/critically severe symptoms were recruited from the Clinical Center of Kragujevac during April 2020. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to reveal phenotypic and functional alterations of peripheral blood cells and to correlate them with the severity of the disease. In severe cases, the number of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and HLA-DR-expressing cells was drastically decreased. In the monocyte population proportion between certain subsets was disturbed and cells coexpressing markers of M1 and M2 monocytes were found in intermediate and non-classical subsets. In mild cases decline in lymphocyte number was less pronounced and innate immunity was preserved as indicated by an increased number of myeloid and activated dendritic cells, NK cells that expressed activation marker at the same level as in control and by low expression of M2 marker in monocyte population. In patients with severe disease, both innate and adoptive immunity are devastated, while in patients with mild symptoms decline in lymphocyte number is lesser, and the innate immunity is preserved.",

    "abstract": "Population decline and extinction risk of riverine cetaceans are primarily associated with flow alteration. Previous studies predominantly highlighted maintenance of adequate flow for low water seasons when habitats contract and the risk of local extinction escalates. Although riverine cetaceans are sensitive to reduction in river flow, no studies quantify the relationships between flow and ecology of riverine cetaceans to mitigate the potential adverse impacts of flow alteration. We quantify the relationships between flow and the ecology of river cetaceans with reference to Ganges River dolphins (GRD; Platanista gangetica gangetica) usable area availability (AWS) for the low water season at wider flows (50-575 m3/s) at finer spatial and temporal scales. This study reveals that distribution of usable area to GRD highly regulated by the adequate flow level as the interaction of appropriate velocity and depth at particular geomorphic that likely offer energetically efficient modes of locomotion to increase surfacing behavior efficiency, suggesting the hydro-physical environment as a major determinant of river cetaceans distribution and abundance. Flow and AWS relationships indicate that the flow during dry season negatively contributed to AWS, whereas that of pre-monsoon maximized the AWS, suggesting that modifying flow regimes does alter in-stream habitats at varying spatial scales and may influence life-history strategies. Substantial fragmentation in suitable pool availability and loss of longitudinal connectivity exhibited by dry season flow suggested a higher risk of adverse biological effects during the dry season, which may reduce population viability by reducing survivorship and reproduction failure. Owing to riverine cetaceans dependence on the attribute of freshwater flow, they can be expected to be more affected by flow regulations as interactive effects. Considering the seasonal effects and changes in the availability of usable areas by flow alteration, adopting effective habitat retention plans by water-based development projects appears critical to avoid further ecological risks in aquatic species conservation. Identifying priority riverscapes for river cetaceans and prioritizing investment opportunities is an essential first step towards effective riverine cetacean conservation.",

    "abstract": "Psittacula cyanocephala is a parakeet endemic to the Indian sub-continent, widespread in the illegal bird trade. Previous studies on Psittacula parakeets have highlighted taxonomic ambiguities, warranting further studies to resolve such issues. Since the mitochondrial genome provides useful information about a species concerning its evolution and phylogenetics, we sequenced the complete mitogenome of P. cyanocephala using NGS, validated 38.86% of the mitogenome using Sanger Sequencing and compared it with other available whole mitogenomes of Psittacula. The complete mitogenome of the species was 16814 bp in length with 54.08% AT composition. P. cyanocephala mitogenome comprises of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. P. cyanocephala mitogenome organization was consistent with other Psittacula mitogenomes. Comparative codon usage analysis indicated the role of natural selection on Psittacula mitogenomes. Strong purifying selection pressure was observed maximum on nad1 and nad4l genes. The mitochondrial control region of all Psittacula species displayed the ancestral avian CR gene order. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the Psittacula genus as paraphyletic nature, containing at least 4 groups of species within the same genus, suggesting its taxonomic reconsideration. Our results provide useful information for developing forensic tests to control the illegal trade of the species, scientific basis for phylogenetic revision of genus Psittacula.",

    "abstract": "Sponges produce distinct fatty acids (FAs) that (potentially) can be used as chemotaxonomic and ecological biomarkers to study endosymbiont-host interactions and the functional ecology of sponges. Here, we present FA profiles of five common habitat-building deep-sea sponges (class Demospongiae, order Tetractinellida), which are classified as high microbial abundance (HMA) species. Geodia hentscheli, G. parva, G. atlantica, G. barretti, and Stelletta rhaphidiophora were collected from boreal and Arctic sponge grounds in the North-Atlantic Ocean. Bacterial FAs dominated in all five species and particularly isomeric mixtures of mid-chain branched FAs (MBFAs, 8- and 9-Me-C16:0 and 10 and 11-Me-C18:0) were found in high abundance (together [&ge;] 20% of total FAs) aside more common bacterial markers. In addition, the sponges produced long-chain linear, mid- and a(i)-branched unsaturated FAs (LCFAs) with a chain length of 24-28 C atoms and had predominantly the typical {Delta}5,9 unsaturation, although also {Delta}9,19 and (yet undescribed) {Delta}11,21 unsaturations were identified. G. parva and S. rhaphidiophora each produced distinct LCFAs, while G. atlantica, G. barretti, and G. hentscheli produced similar LCFAs, but in different ratios. The different bacterial precursors varied in carbon isotopic composition ({delta}13C), with MBFAs being more enriched compared to other bacterial (linear and a(i)-branched) FAs. We propose biosynthetic pathways for different LCFAs from their bacterial precursors, that are consistent with small isotopic differences found in LCFAs. Indeed, FA profiles of deep-sea sponges can serve as chemotaxonomic markers and support the conception that sponges acquire building blocks from their endosymbiotic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) occurs due to inability of the body to produce sufficient amount of insulin to regulate blood glucose level (BGL) at normoglycemic range between 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L. Thus, T1DM patients require to do self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) via finger pricks and depend on exogenous insulin injection to maintain their BGL which is very painful and exasperating. Ongoing works on artificial pancreas device nowadays focus primarily on a computer algorithm which is programmed into the controller device. This study aims to simulate so-called improved equations from the Hovorka model using actual patients data through in-silico works and compare its findings with the clinical works.\n\nMethodsThe study mainly focuses on computer simulation in MATLAB using improved Hovorka equations in order to control the BGL in T1DM. The improved equations can be found in three subsystems namely; glucose, insulin and insulin action subsystems. CHO intakes were varied during breakfast, lunch and dinner times for three consecutive days. Simulated data are compared with the actual patients data from the clinical works.\n\nResultsResult revealed that when the patient took 36.0g CHO during breakfast and lunch, the insulin administered was 0.1U/min in order to maintain the blood glucose level (BGL) in the safe range after meal; while during dinner time, 0.083U/min to 0.1 U/min of insulins were administered in order to regulate 45.0g CHO taken during meal. The basal insulin was also injected at 0.066U/min upon waking up time in the early morning. The BGL was able to remain at normal range after each meal during in-silico works compared to clinical works.\n\nConclusionsThis study proved that the improved Hovorka equations via in-silico works can be employed to model the effect of meal disruptions on T1DM patients, as it demonstrated better control as compared to the clinical works.",

    "abstract": "Tumor cells tend to metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. One of the rate limiting enzymes of glycolysis is 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, which is allosterically activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate which in turn is produced by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2 or PFKFB). Mounting evidence suggests that cancerous tissues overexpress the PFKFB isoenzyme, PFKFB3, being causing enhanced proliferation of cancer cells.\n\nInitially, six PFKFB3 splice variants with different C-termini have been documented in humans. More recently, additional splice variants with varying N-termini were discovered the functions of which are to be uncovered.\n\nGlioblastoma is one of the deadliest forms of brain tumors. Up to now, the role of PFKFB3 splice variants in the progression and prognosis of glioblastomas is only partially understood. In this study, we first re-categorized the PFKFB3 splice variant repertoire to simplify the denomination. We investigated the impact of increased and decreased levels of PFKFB3-4 (former UBI2K4) and PFKFB3-5 (former variant 5) on the viability and proliferation rate of glioblastoma U87 and HEK-293 cells. The simultaneous knock-down of PFKFB3-4 and PFKFB3-5 led to a decrease in viability and proliferation of U87 and HEK-293 cells as well as a reduction in HEK-293 cell colony formation. Overexpression of PFKFB3-4 but not PFKFB3-5 resulted in increased cell viability and proliferation. This finding contrasts with the common notion that overexpression of PFKFB3 enhances tumor growth, but instead suggests splice variant-specific effects of PFKFB3, apparently with opposing effects on cell behaviour. Strikingly, in line with this result, we found that in human IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, the PFKFB3-4 to PFKFB3-5 ratio was significantly shifted towards PFKFB3-4 when compared to control brain samples. Our findings indicate that the expression level of distinct PFKFB3 splice variants impinges on tumorigenic properties of glioblastomas and that splice pattern may be of important diagnostic value for glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSince the first reports of COVID-19, decision-makers have been using traditional epidemiological models to predict the days to come. However, the enhancement of computational power, the demand for adaptable predictive frameworks, the short past of the disease, and uncertainties related to input data and prediction rules, also make other classical and machine learning techniques viable options.\n\nOBJECTIVEThis study investigates the efficiency of six models in forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases with 17 days ahead. We compare the models autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN), random trees regressor (RTR), seasonal linear regression with change-points (Prophet), and simple logistic regression (SLR).\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODSWe implement the models to data provided by the health surveillance secretary of Amapaa, a Brazilian state fully carved in the Amazon rainforest, which has been experiencing high infection rates. We evaluate the models according to their capacity to forecast in different historical scenarios of the COVID-19 progression, such as exponential increases, sudden decreases, and stability periods of daily cases. To do so, we use a rolling forward splitting approach for out-of-sample validation. We employ the metrics RMSE, R-squared, and sMAPE in evaluating the model in different cross-validation sections.\n\nFINDINGSAll models outperform SLG, especially Holt-Winters, that performs satisfactorily in all scenarios. SVR and ARIMA have better performances in isolated scenarios. To implement the comparisons, we have created a web application, which is available online.\n\nCONCLUSIONThis work represents an effort to assist the decision-makers of Amapa in future decisions to come, especially under scenarios of sudden variations in the number of confirmed cases of Amapa, which would be caused, for instance, by new contamination waves or vaccination. It is also an attempt to highlight alternative models that could be used in future epidemics.",
