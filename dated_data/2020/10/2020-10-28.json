    "abstract": "A growing body of work on the dynamics of eukaryotic flagella has noted that their oscillation frequencies are sufficiently high that the viscous penetration depth of unsteady Stokes flow is comparable to the scales over which flagella synchronize. Incorporating these effects into theories of synchronization requires an understanding of the global unsteady flows around oscillating bodies. Yet, there has been no precise experimental test on the microscale of the most basic aspects of such unsteady Stokes flow: the orbits of passive tracers and the position-dependent phase lag between the oscillating response of the fluid at a distant point and that of the driving particle. Here, we report the first such direct Lagrangian measurement of this unsteady flow. The method uses an array of 30 submicron tracer particles positioned by a time-shared optical trap at a range of distances and angular positions with respect to a larger, central particle, which is then driven by an oscillating optical trap at frequencies up to 400 Hz. In this microscale regime, the tracer dynamics is considerably simplified by the smallness of both inertial effects on particle motion and finite-frequency corrections to the Stokes drag law. The tracers are found to display elliptical Lissajous figures whose orientation and geometry are in agreement with a low-frequency expansion of the underlying dynamics, and the experimental phase shift between motion parallel and orthogonal to the oscillation axis exhibits a predicted scaling form in distance and angle. Possible implications of these results for synchronization dynamics are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Increased arterial stiffness is a cardiovascular disease risk factor in the setting of advancing age and high-fat (HF) diet induced obesity. Increases in large artery stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV), occur within 8 weeks of HF feeding in mice. Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1), a NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates cellular metabolic activity and activation of this protein has been associated with vasoprotection in aged mice. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effect of global Sirt1 overexpression (Sirttg) on HF diet-induced arterial stiffening. Sirt1 overexpression did not influence PWV in normal chow (NC) fed mice (Sirttg: 263 {+/-} 6 vs WT: 274 {+/-} 7, p=0.28). However, PWV was higher in wild-type (WT) mice (376 {+/-} 22, p<0.04), but not Sirttg (304 {+/-} 2 cm/s, p=0.07), after 12 weeks of HF diet. Despite no effect of Sirt1 overexpression on aortic collagen content in NC (p=0.71), aortic elastin content was higher in Sirttg mice compared with WT mice fed NC diet (P<0.05). Surprisingly, despite increased arterial stiffness, collagen content was lower (p<0.02) and elastin content was unchanged (p=0.05) in the aortas of WT mice after HF. Neither collagen (p=0.18) nor elastin content (p=0.56) were impacted by HF diet in the Sirttg mice. Likewise, there was no difference in wall thickness in NC (Sirttg: 40.7 {+/-} 2 vs WT: 41.6 {+/-} 2, p= 0.78). However, wall thickness was higher in mice WT mice fed a HF diet (51.7 {+/-} 2, p<0.01) and there was no difference in Sirttg mice after HF diet (p=0.66). Similarly, there was no difference in wall-to-lumen ratio in mice fed NC diet (Sirttg: 0.08 vs WT: 0.08, p=0.48) was higher in HF diet fed WT mice (p<0.01), though, HF diet was associated with a higher wall-to-lumen ratio in WT (0.11, p<0.01), but not different in Sirttg mice fed HF diet (0.08, p=0.59). These findings demonstrate a vasoprotective effect of Sirt1 overexpression that limits increases in arterial stiffness and protects against alterations in vessel morphology in response to HF feeding. As such, activation of Sirt1 may be a novel therapeutic target to prevent elevated CVD risk associated with HF-induced aortic stiffening.",

    "abstract": "Balance training aims to improve balance and transfer acquired skills to real-life tasks and conditions. How older adults adapt gait control to different conditions, and whether these adaptations are altered by balance training remains unclear. We investigated adaptations in neuromuscular control of gait in twenty-two older adults (72.6 {+/-} 4.2 years) between normal (NW) and narrow-base walking (NBW), and the effects of a standing balance training program shown to enhance unipedal balance control in the same participants. At baseline, after one session and after 3-weeks of training, kinematics and EMG of NW and NBW on a treadmill were measured. Gait parameters and temporal activation profiles of five synergies extracted from 11 muscles were compared between time-points and gait conditions. No effects of balance training or interactions between training and walking condition on gait parameters or synergies were found. Trunk center of mass (CoM) displacement and velocity (vCoM), and the local divergence exponent (LDE), were lower in NBW compared to NW. For synergies associated with stance of the non-dominant leg and weight acceptance of the dominant leg, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the activation profiles was smaller in NBW compared to NW. For the synergy associated with non-dominant heel strike, FWHM was greater in NBW compared to NW. The Center of Activation (CoA) of the activation profile associated with dominant leg stance occurred earlier in NBW compared to NW. CoAs of activation profile associated with non-dominant stance and non-dominant and dominant heel strikes were delayed in NBW compared to NW. The adaptations of synergies to NBW can be interpreted as related to a more cautious weight transfer to the new stance leg and enhanced control over CoM movement in the stance phase. However, control of mediolateral gait stability and these adaptations were not affected by balance training.",

    "abstract": "Being a significant protein L-glutaminases discovers potential applications in various divisions running from nourishment industry to restorative and cure. It is generally disseminated in microbes, actinomycetes, yeast and organisms. Glutaminase is the principal enzyme that changes glutamine to glutamate. The samples were gathered from soil of Taxila, Wah Cantt and Quetta, Pakistan for the isolation of glutaminase producing bacteria. After primary screening, subordinate screening was done which includes multiple testification such as purification, observation of morphological characters and biochemical testing of bacterial strains along with 16S rRNA sequence homology testing. Five bacterial strains were selected showing glutaminase positive test in screening, enzyme production via fermentation and enzymatic and protein assays. Taxonomical characterization of the isolates identified them as Bacillus subtilis U1, Achromobacter xylosoxidans G1, Bacillus subtilis Q2, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia U3 and Alcaligenes faecalis S3. The optimization of different effectors such as incubation time, inducers, carbon source, pH, and nitrogen source were also put under consideration. There was slight difference among incubation of bacterial culture, overall, 36 hours of incubation time was the best for glutaminase production by all the strains. Optimal pH was around 9 in Achromobacter xylosoxidans G1 and Alcaligenes faecalis S3, pH 6 in Bacillus subtilis U1, pH 8 in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia U3, pH 6-8 in Bacillus subtilis Q2. Best glutaminase production was obtained at 37{degrees}C by Bacillus subtilis U1and Bacillus subtilis Q2, 30{degrees}C for Achromobacter xylosoxidans G1, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia U3 and 25{degrees}C by Alcaligenes faecalis S3. The carbon sources put fluctuated effects on activity of enzyme in such a way that glucose was the best carbon source for Bacillus subtilis U1and Bacillus subtilis Q2, Sorbitol for Achromobacter xylosoxidans G1 and Alcaligenes faecalis S3 while xylose was the best for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia U3. Yeast extract and Trypton were among good nitrogen sources for Achromobacter xylosoxidans G1 and of Bacillus subtilis U1 respectively. Glutamine was the best inducer for Bacillus subtilis Q2, Alcaligenes faecalis S3 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia U3, while lysine for Achromobacter xylosoxidans G1 and glycine act as good inducer in case of Bacillus subtilis U1. After implementation of optimal conditions microbial L-glutaminase production can be achieved and the bacterial isolates have a great potential for production of glutaminase enzyme and their applications.",

    "abstract": "The process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is required for the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF). Ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4) can facilitate development of transforming growth factor, beta 1 (TGF-{beta}1) induced EMT in some cancer cells. However, the role of USP4 in EMT during RIF remains unknown. We aimed to explore the effect of USP4 on the EMT induced by TGF-{beta}1 of renal tubular epithelial cells and involved mechanism in RIF. In vivo, on the 7th and 14th day after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), the expression of USP4 protein in the obstructed kidneys was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot assay. In vitro, NRK-52E cells were stimulated with TGF-{beta}1 10ng/ml. The protein expressions of USP4, E-cadherin and alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA) were detected at different time points by Western blot. After transfected with USP4 siRNA, the cells were cultured with TGF-{beta}1 for additional 24 hours. The expressions of E-cadherin, -SMA, and TGF{beta} receptor type I (T{beta}RI) were detected by immunofluorescence. And the protein expressions of USP4, E-cadherin, -SMA and T{beta}RI were detected by Western blot assay. Compared with sham operation group, the expression of USP4 in UUO model group increased significantly with the prolongation of obstruction time. After NRK-52E was stimulated by TGF-{beta}1, the expression of USP4 protein increased gradually. At 6h, 12h, and 24h, the difference between the experimental group and the control group was statistically significant. At the same time, E-cadherin decreased significantly, while -SMA increased significantly. Compared with the TGF-{beta}1 group, the cells in USP4 siRNA transfection group restored E-cadherin and weakened -SMA expression. At the same time, protein expressions of USP4 and T{beta}RI were also significantly decreased. These data imply that USP4 is a harmful molecule induced by TGF-{beta}1, which plays an important role by upregulating the expression of T{beta}RI and promoting EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells, thereby facilitating renal interstitial fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The quantitative measurement of environmental DNA (eDNA) from field-collected water samples is gaining importance for the monitoring of fish communities and populations. The interpretation of these signal strengths depends, among other factors, on the amount of target eDNA shed into the water. However, shedding rates are presumably associated with species-specific traits such as physiology and behavior. Although such differences between juvenile and adult fish have been previously detected, the general impact of movement and energy use in a resting state on eDNA release into the surrounding water remains hardly addressed.\n\nIn an aquarium experiment, we compared eDNA shedding between seven fish species occurring in European freshwaters. The investigated salmonids, cyprinids, and sculpin exhibit distinct adaptions to microhabitats, diets, and either solitary or schooling behavior. The fish were housed in aquaria with constant water flow and their activity was measured by snapshots taken every 30 s. Water samples for eDNA analysis were taken every 3 h and energy use was determined in an intermittent flow respirometer. After controlling for the effect of fish mass, our results demonstrate a positive correlation between target eDNA quantities as measured with digital PCR, fish activity, and energy use, as well as species-specific differences. For cyprinids, the model based on data from individual fish was only partly transferable to groups, which exhibited lower activity and higher energy use.\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of fish physiology and behavior for the comparative interpretation of taxon-specific eDNA quantities. Species traits should therefore be incorporated into eDNA-based monitoring and conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Tissue mechanics is central to pregnancy, during which maternal anatomic structures undergo continuous remodeling to serve a dual function to first protect the fetus in utero while it develops and then facilitate its passage out. In this study of normal pregnancy using biomechanical solid modeling, we used standard clinical ultrasound images to obtain measurements of structural dimensions of the gravid uterus and cervix throughout gestation. 2-dimensional ultrasound images were acquired from the uterus and cervix in 30 pregnant subjects in supine and standing positions at four time points during pregnancy (8-14, 14-16, 22-24, and 32-34 weeks). Offline, three observers independently measured from the images of multiple anatomic regions. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate inter-observer variance, as well as effect of gestational age, gravity, and parity on maternal geometry. A parametric solid model developed in the Solidworks computer aided design (CAD) software was used to convert ultrasonic measurements to a 3-dimensional solid computer model, from which estimates of uterine and cervical volumes were made. This parametric model was compared against previous 3-dimensional solid models derived from magnetic resonance frequency images in pregnancy. In brief, we found several anatomic measurements easily derived from standard clinical imaging are reproducible and reliable, and provide sufficient information to allow biomechanical solid modeling. This structural dataset is the first, to our knowledge, to provide key variables to enable future computational calculations of tissue stress and stretch in pregnancy, making it possible to characterize the biomechanical milieu of normal pregnancy. This vital dataset will be the foundation to understand how the uterus and cervix malfunction in pregnancy leading to adverse perinatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Data-centric approaches have been utilized to develop predictive methods for elucidating uncharacterized aspects of proteins such as their functions, biophysical properties, subcellular locations and interactions. However, studies indicate that the performance of these methods should be further improved to effectively solve complex problems in biomedicine and biotechnology. A data representation method can be defined as an algorithm that calculates numerical feature vectors for samples in a dataset, to be later used in quantitative modelling tasks. Data representation learning methods do this by training and using a model that employs statistical and machine/deep learning algorithms. These novel methods mostly take inspiration from the data-driven language models that have yielded ground-breaking improvements in the field of natural language processing. Lately, these learned data representations have been applied to the field of protein informatics and have displayed highly promising results in terms of extracting complex traits of proteins regarding sequence-structure-function relations. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation over protein representation learning methods, by first categorizing and explaining each approach, and then conducting benchmark analyses on; (i) inferring semantic similarities between proteins, (ii) predicting ontology-based protein functions, and (iii) classifying drug target protein families. We examine the advantages and disadvantages of each representation approach over the benchmark results. Finally, we discuss current challenges and suggest future directions. We believe the conclusions of this study will help researchers in applying machine/deep learning-based representation techniques on protein data for various types of predictive tasks. Furthermore, we hope it will demonstrate the potential of machine learning-based data representations for protein science and inspire the development of novel methods/tools to be utilized in the fields of biomedicine and biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Tomato is a model crop, as well as important food worldwide. In the arid areas, aggravation of soil salinity has become the primary problem that threatens the high yield in tomato production. As a second messenger substance, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c-GMP) plays an indispensable role in plant response to salt stress through regulating cell processes to promote plant growth and development. However, this mechanism has not been fully explored in tomato seedlings. In this experiment, the tomato seeds were cultured in distilled water (CK), 20 M c-GMP (T1), 50 mM NaCl (T2), 20 M c-GMP + 50 mM NaCl (T3). The results show that 20 M c-GMP effectively alleviated the inhibition of 50 mM NaCl on tomato growth and development, inducing the expression of 1580 DEGs. 95 DEGs were up-regulated and 442 DEGs were down-regulated (CK vs T1), whereas in the T2 vs T3 comparison 271 DEGs were up-regulated and 772 DEGs were down-regulated. Based on KEGG analysis, the majority of DEGs were involved in metabolism; exogenous c-GMP induced significant enrichment of pathways associated with carbohydrates, phenylpropanoids and fatty acid metabolism. Most PMEs, acCoA, PAL, PODs, FADs, and AD were up-regulated, and GAPDHs, PL, PG, BXL4, and {beta}-G were down-regulated, which reduced susceptibility of tomato seedlings to salt and promoted their salt adaptation. The application of c-GMP promoted soluble sugar, flavonoids and lignin content, reduced accumulation of MDA, and enhanced the activity of POD. Thus, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with salt tolerance of tomato seedlings.",

This study was conducted to identify the determinant factors that affect Teff technology adoption and Teff productivity in Basso Liben district, East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design was conducted among 190 households. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were employed to identify the factors associated with Teff production and Teff technology adoption respectively. Of a total of 190 households considered in the study, 77.9% were Teff technology adopter. Household head gender (male) (OR=7.644), family size (OR=1.149), age of household head (OR=0.873), row planting (use)(OR=257.2), credit access (yes)(OR=3.141), manure(use)(OR=0.042) were significance associated with Teff technology adoption in the study area.

In this study, a low prevalence of agricultural technology adoption and Teff production and various associated agricultural technology adoption and Teff production factors have been identified in the study area. Thus, the concerned stockholders should intervene in agricultural technology adoption and Teff production via different extension service and by considering household size, community-based household head education, and efficient use landholding in hectare.",

    "abstract": "The extensive use of touchscreens for all manner of human-computer interactions has made them plausible instruments of touch-mediated disease transmission. To that end, we employ stochastic simulations to model human-fomite interaction with a distinct focus on touchscreen interfaces. The timings and frequency of interactions from within a closed population of infectious and susceptible individuals was modelled using a basic queuing network. A pseudo reproductive number (R) was used to compare outcomes under various parameter conditions. We also expanded the simulation to a specific real-world scenario; namely airport self check-in and baggage drop. Results revealed that the required rate of cleaning/disinfecting of screens to effectively mitigate R can be inordinately high. This suggests that revised or alternative methods should be considered.",
