    "abstract": "Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are a highly plastic stromal cell type which support cancer progression. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing of TAMs from a spontaneous murine model of mammary adenocarcinoma (MMTV-PyMT) we characterize a subset of these cells expressing lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (Lyve-1) which spatially reside proximal to blood vasculature. We demonstrate that Lyve-1+ TAMs support tumor growth and identify a pivotal role for these cells in maintaining a population of perivascular mesenchymal cells which express alpha-smooth muscle actin and phenotypically resemble pericytes. Using photolabeling techniques show that mesenchymal cells maintain their prevalence in the growing tumor through proliferation and uncover a role for Lyve-1+ TAMs in orchestrating a selective platelet-derived growth factor-CC-dependent expansion of the perivascular mesenchymal population, creating a pro-angiogenic niche. This study highlights the inter-reliance of the immune and non-immune stromal network which support cancer progression and provides therapeutic opportunities for tackling the disease.",

    "abstract": "Plants need to rapidly and flexibly adjust their metabolism to changes of their immediate environment. Since this necessity results from the sessile lifestyle of land plants, key mechanisms for orchestrating central metabolic acclimation are likely to have evolved early. Here, we explore the role of lysine acetylation as a posttranslational modification to directly modulate metabolic function. We generated a lysine acetylome of the moss Physcomitrium patens and identified 638 lysine acetylation sites, mostly found in mitochondrial and plastidial proteins. A comparison with available angiosperm data pinpointed lysine acetylation as a conserved regulatory strategy in land plants. Focusing on mitochondrial central metabolism, we functionally analyzed acetylation of malate dehydrogenase (mMDH), which acts as a hub of plant metabolic flexibility. In P. patens mMDH1, we detected a single acetylated lysine located next to one of the four acetylation sites detected in Arabidopsis thaliana mMDH1. We assessed the kinetic behavior of recombinant A. thaliana and P. patens mMDH1 with site-specifically incorporated acetyl-lysines. Acetylation of A. thaliana mMDH1 at K169, K170, and K334 decreases its oxaloacetate reduction activity, while acetylation of P. patens mMDH1 at K172 increases this activity. We found modulation of the malate oxidation activity only in A. thaliana mMDH1, where acetylation of K334 highly activated it. Comparative homology modelling of MDH proteins revealed that evolutionarily conserved lysines serve as hotspots of acetylation. Our combined analyses indicate lysine acetylation as a common strategy to fine-tune the activity of central metabolic enzymes with likely impact on plant acclimation capacity.\n\nSignificance statementWe explore the role of lysine acetylation as a mechanism to directly modulate mitochondrial metabolism in land plants by generating the lysine acetylome of the moss Physcomitrium patens and comparing with available angiosperm data. We found acetylation of evolutionarily conserved lysines as a strategy to fine-tune the activity of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase in a species-dependent molecular context.",

However, with tens of thousands of new biomedical articles published per week, manually mapping and monitoring changes in transparency is unrealistic. We present an open-source, automated approach to identify five indicators of transparency (data sharing, code sharing, conflicts of interest disclosures, funding disclosures and protocol registration) and apply it across the entire open access biomedical literature of 2.75 million articles on PubMed Central. Our results indicate remarkable improvements in some (e.g. conflict of interest disclosures, funding disclosures), but not other (e.g. protocol registration, code sharing) areas of transparency over time, and map transparency across fields of science, countries, journals and publishers. This work has enabled the creation of a large, integrated, and openly available database to expedite further efforts to monitor, understand and promote transparency and reproducibility in science.",

    "abstract": "People with Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 have a greatly increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease (AD). This is in part because of triplication of a chromosome 21 gene, APP. This gene encodes amyloid precursor protein, which is cleaved to form amyloid-{beta} that accumulates in the brains of people who have AD. Recent experimental results demonstrate that a gene or genes on chromosome 21, other than APP, when triplicated significantly accelerate amyloid pathology in a transgenic mouse model of amyloid-{beta} deposition. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that cysteine cathepsin activity influences APP cleavage and amyloid-{beta} accumulation. Located on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) is an endogenous inhibitor of cathepsin proteases, CYSTATIN B (CSTB) which is proposed to regulate cysteine cathepsin activity in vivo. Here we determined if three copies of the mouse gene Cstb is sufficient to modulate beta amyloid (A{beta}) accumulation and cathepsin activity in a transgenic APP mouse model. Duplication of Cstb resulted in an increase in transcriptional and translational levels of Cstb in the mouse cortex but had no effect on the deposition of insoluble A{beta} plaques or the levels of soluble or insoluble A{beta}42, A{beta}40, or A{beta}38 in 6-month old mice. In addition, the increased CSTB did not alter the activity of cathepsin B enzyme in the cortex of 3-month old mice. These results indicate that the single-gene duplication of Cstb is insufficient to elicit a disease-modifying phenotype in the dupCstb x tgAPP mice, underscoring the complexity of the genetic basis of AD-DS and the importance of multiple gene interactions in disease.",

    "abstract": "The rise of multi-antibiotics resistant bacteria represents an emergent threat to human health. Here, we investigate antibiotic resistance mechanisms in bacteria of several species isolated from an intensive care unit in Brazil. We used whole-genome analysis to identify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and plasmids in 35 strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including the first genomic description of Morganella morganii and Ralstonia mannitolilytica clinical isolates from South America. We identify a high abundance of beta-lactamase genes in highly resistant organisms, including seven extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamases shared between organisms from different species. Additionally, we identify several ARGs-carrying plasmids indicating the potential for fast transmission of resistance mechanism between bacterial strains, comprising a novel IncFII plasmid recently introduced in Brazil from Asia. Through comparative genomic analysis, we demonstrate that some pathogens identified here are very distantly related to other bacteria isolated worldwide, demonstrating the potential existence of endemic bacterial pathogens in Brazil. Also, we uncovered at least two couples of (near)-identical plasmids exhibiting multi-drug resistance, suggesting that plasmids were transmitted between bacteria of the same or different species in the hospital studied. Finally, since many highly resistant strains carry several different ARGs, we used functional genomics to investigate which of them were indeed functional. In this sense, for three bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and M. morganii), we identify six beta-lactamase genes out of 15 predicted in silico as the main responsible for the resistance mechanisms observed, corroborating the existence of redundant resistance mechanisms in these organisms.\n\nImportanceBig data and large-scale sequencing projects have revolutionized the field, achieving a greater understanding of ARGs identification and spreading at global level. However, given that microbiota and associated ARGs may fluctuate across geographic zones, hospital-associated infections within clinical units still remain underexplored in Brazil - the largest country in South America; 210 million inhabitants - and neighboring countries. This work highlighted the identification of several ARGs shared between species co-occurring simultaneously into a Brazilian hospital, some of them associated with large plasmids, mostly endowed with transposable elements. Also, genomic features of clinically underrepresented pathogens such M. morganii and B. cepacia were revealed. Taken together, our results demonstrate how structural and functional genomics can help to identify emerging mechanisms of shared antibiotic resistance in bacteria from clinical environments. Systematic studies as the one presented here should help to prevent outbreaks of novel multidrug resistance bacteria in healthcare facilities.",

We find that a haploid genome is maintained in PGCLCs with a high frequency indicating a substantially lower rate of diploidization than somatic cells. Characterization of the differentiating haploid ESCs reveals that Xist is activated from the single X chromosome. This observation suggests that X chromosome inactivation is initiated in haploid cells consistent with a model where autosomal blocking factors set a threshold for X-linked activators. The germline segregates from the epiblast and differs from somatic lineages in gene expression and epigenetic mechanisms. The ability of primordial germ cells for repressing Xist might contribute to the maintenance of a haploid genome.",

We collected the eDNA degradation rates and related factors, especially water temperature and fragment lengths of the measured DNA from 28 studies. Our results suggest that water temperature and fragment length are significantly related to the eDNA degradation rate. From the 95% quantile model simulation, we predicted the maximum eDNA degradation rate in various combinations of water temperature and fragment length.

    "abstract": "C2 domains facilitate protein-lipid interaction in cellular recognition and signalling processes. They possess a {beta}-sandwich structure, with either type I or type II topology. C2 domains can interact with anionic lipid bilayers in either a Ca2+-dependent or a Ca2+-independent manner. The mechanism of recognition of anionic lipids by Ca2+-independent C2 domains is incompletely understood. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the membrane interactions of six Ca2+- independent C2 domains, from KIBRA, PI3KC2, RIM2, PTEN, SHIP2, and Smurf2. In coarse grained MD simulations these C2 domains bound to lipid bilayers, forming transient interactions with zwitterionic (phosphatidylcholine, PC) bilayers compared to long lived interactions with anionic bilayers also containing either phosphatidylserine (PS) or PS and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2). Type I C2 domains bound non-canonically via the front, back or side of the {beta} sandwich, whereas type II C2 domains bound canonically, via the top loops (as is typically the case for Ca2+-dependent C2 domains). C2 domains interacted strongly (up to 120 kJ/mol) with membranes containing PIP2 causing the bound anionic lipids to clustered around the protein. The C2 domains bound less strongly to anionic membranes without PIP2 (<50 kJ/mol), and most weakly to neutral membranes (<33 kJ/mol). Productive binding modes were identified and further analysed in atomistic simulations. For PTEN and SHIP2, CG simulations were also performed of the intact enzymes (i.e. phosphatase domain plus C2 domain) with PIP2-contating bilayers and the roles of the two domains in membrane localization were compared. From a methodological perspective, these studies establish a multiscale simulation protocol for studying membrane binding/recognition proteins, capable of revealing binding modes alongside details of lipid binding affinity and specificity.",

Here we studied the mechanisms underlying duration perception by looking for a neural signature of subjective time distortion induced by motion adaptation. We recorded electroencephalographic signals in human participants while they were asked to discriminate the duration of visual stimuli after translational motion adaptation. Our results show that distortions of subjective time can be predicted by the amplitude of the N200 event-related potential and by the activity in the Beta band frequency spectrum. Both effects were observed from occipital electrodes contralateral to the adapted stimulus. Finally, a multivariate decoding analysis highlights the impact of motion adaptation throughout the visual stream. Overall, our findings show the crucial involvement of local and low-level perceptual processes in generating a subjective sense of time.",

Species face a range of stressors in human-dominated landscapes, often with contrasting effects. White-tailed deer (deer) are expanding in the northern part of their range following decreasing winter severity and increasing forage availability. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease affecting cervids, is likewise expanding and represents a major threat to deer and other cervids. We obtained tissue samples from free-ranging deer across their native range in Ontario, Canada which has yet to detect CWD in wild populations of cervids. We used high-throughput sequencing to assess neutral genomic variation, and variation in the PRNP gene that is partly responsible for the protein misfolding when deer contract CWD. Neutral variation revealed a high number of rare alleles and no population structure, and demographic models suggested a rapid historical population expansion. Allele frequencies of PRNP variants associated with CWD susceptibility and disease progression were evenly distributed across the landscape and consistent with deer populations not infected with CWD. We then estimated the selection coefficient of CWD, with simulations showing an observable and rapid shift in PRNP allele frequencies that coincides with the start of a novel CWD epidemic. Sustained surveillance of genomic and PRNP variation can be a useful tool for CWD-free regions where deer are managed for ecological and economic benefits.",

F-actin disruption produces aneuploid eggs, which are a leading cause of human embryo deaths, genetic disorders, and infertility. We found that oocytes regulate F-actin organisation and function by promptly transferring excess monomeric G-actin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Inside healthy oocyte nuclei, transferred monomers form dynamic F-actin structures, a conserved feature that significantly declines with maternal age. Monomer transfer must be controlled tightly. Blocked nuclear import of G-actin triggers assembly of a dense cytoplasmic F-actin network, while excess G-actin in the nucleus dramatically stabilises nuclear F-actin. Imbalances in either direction predispose oocytes to aneuploidy. The large oocyte nucleus is thus a homeostatic G-actin buffer that is used to maintain cytoplasmic F-actin form and function.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMammalian oocyte nuclei buffer cytosolic G-actin",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of age-related diseases and resulting healthcare insecurity and emotional burden require novel treatment approaches. Several promising strategies seek to limit nutrients and promote healthy aging. Unfortunately, the human desire to consume food means this strategy is not practical for most people but pharmacological approaches might be a viable alternative. We previously showed that myriocin, which impairs sphingolipid synthesis, increases lifespan in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by modulating signaling pathways including the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). Since TORC1 senses cellular amino acids, we analyses amino acid pools and identified 17 that are lowered by myriocin treatment. Studying the methionine transporter, Mup1, we found that newly synthesized Mup1 traffics to the plasma membrane and is stable for several hours but is inactive in drug-treated cells. Activity can be restored by adding phytosphingosine to culture medium thereby bypassing drug inhibition, thus confirming a sphingolipid requirement for Mup1 activity. Importantly, genetic analysis of myriocin-induced longevity revealed a requirement for the Gtr1/2 (mammalian Rags) and Vps34-Pib2 amino acid sensing pathways upstream of TORC1, consistent with a mechanism of action involving decreased amino acid availability. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of pharmacologically inducing a state resembling amino acid restriction to promote healthy aging.",

Our geodatabase harmonizes 48 different datasets of primary forests, and contains 18,411 individual patches (41.1 Mha) spread across 33 countries. When available, we provide information on each patch (name, location, naturalness, extent and dominant tree species) and the surrounding landscape (biogeographical regions, protection status, potential natural vegetation, current forest extent). To assess the robustness of our geodatabase, we checked each patch for forest disturbance events using Landsat satellite-image time series (1985-2018). We estimate that 94% of the patches in our database did not experience significant disturbances that would alter their primary forest status in the last 30 year. Our database is the most comprehensive dataset on primary forests in Europe, and will be useful for biogeographic and ecological studies, and conservation planning to safeguard these unique forests.",

Here, we report ten pre-Hispanic (plus two early colonial) genomes and 84 genome-wide profiles from seven groups presently living in Panama. Our analyses reveal that pre-Hispanic demographic changes and isolation events contributed to create the extensive genetic structure currently seen in the area, which is also characterized by a distinctive Isthmo-Colombian Indigenous component. This component drives these populations on a specific variability axis and derives from the local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin(s). Two of these ancestries were differentially associated to Pleistocene Indigenous groups that also moved into South America leaving heterogenous footprints. An additional Pleistocene ancestry was brought by UPopI, a still unsampled population that remained restricted to the Isthmian area, expanded locally during the early Holocene, and left genomic traces up to the present.",

    "abstract": "Hind-limb unloaded (HU) mouse is a well-recognized model of muscle atrophy; however the molecular changes in the skeletal muscle during unloading are poorly characterized. We have used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the structure and behavior of signature molecules involved in regulating muscle structural and functional health. The FTIR and the Raman spectroscopic analysis of gastrocnemius muscles was compared between 16-18 weeks old HU c57Bl/6J mice and ground-based controls. The molecular components of the samples were identified by using the FTIR spectra from the control and the unloaded samples. The Raman spectra showed that the signals for asparagine and glutamine were reduced in HU mice, possibly indicating increased catabolism. The peaks for hydroxyproline and proline were split, pointing towards molecular breakdown and reduced tendon repair. We also report a consistently increased intensity in > 1300 cm-1 range in the Raman spectra along with a shift towards higher frequencies in the HU mice, indicating activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stress during HU.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMouse model of hindlimb unloading recapitulates many features of disuse muscle atrophy due to spaceflight and prolonged bed rest. However, a thorough understanding of molecular changes underlying muscle detriment in disuse partly remains elusive. We have applied the spectroscopic and density functional techniques conjointly to characterize the molecular changes in the skeletal muscle of hindlimb unloaded mice. A number of conformational changes and the breakdown of the molecular bonds in the skeletal muscle are observed, which can potentially dictate loss of muscle mass and strength during mechanical unloading. Our reporting of the signature spectral changes in the unloaded skeletal muscle can be a useful step towards the therapeutic interventions targeting specific molecules.",

Calcineurin inhibitors have however unwanted side effect. NFAT transcription factors play crucial roles downstream of calcineurin during thymocyte development, T cell differentiation, activation and anergy. Here we elucidate NFAT functional relevance in T-ALL. Using murine T-ALL models in which Nfat genes can be inactivated either singly or in combination, we show that NFATs are required for T-ALL LIC potential and essential to survival, proliferation and migration of T-ALL cells. We also demonstrate that Nfat genes are functionally redundant in T-ALL and identified a node of genes commonly deregulated upon Cn or NFAT inactivation, which may serve as future candidate targets for T-ALL.",

    "abstract": "RASopathies represent a family of mostly autosomal dominant diseases that are caused by missense variants in the RAS/MAPK pathway. In aggregate, they are among the more common Mendelian disorders. They share overlapping pathologies that include structural birth and developmental defects that affect the heart, craniofacial and skeletal, lymphatic, and nervous systems. Variants in different genes--including those encoding KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, RAF1, and SHP2--are associated with overlapping but distinct phenotypes. Here, we report an analysis of 13 Drosophila transgenic lines, each expressing a different human disease isoform associated with a form of RASopathy. Similar to their human counterparts, each Drosophila line has common aspects but also important phenotypic distinctions including signaling pathways as well as response to therapeutics. For some lines, these differences represent activation of pathways outside the core RAS signaling pathway including the Hippo and SAPK/JNK signaling networks. We identified two classes of clinically relevant drugs, statins and histone deacetylase inhibitors, that improved viability across most RASopathy lines; in contrast, several canonical RAS pathway inhibitors proved poorly effective against, e.g., SHP2-expressing lines encoded by PTPN11. Our study provides a whole animal platform for comparison of a large number of RASopathy-associated variants. Among these variants we have identified differences in tissue phenotypes, in activation signaling pathways in biomarkers of disease progression and drug efficacy, and suggest drug classes that can be tolerated over long treatment periods for consideration in broad RASopathy trials.",

Global dynamics of promoter usage can reveal systemic changes in how genomic sequence is interpreted by the cell4 Here we report the first analysis of promoter dynamics and code switching in the mammalian germ line, characterising the full cycle of transitions from embryonic stem cells through germline, oogenesis, and zygotic genome activation. Using Super Low Input Carrier-CAGE5,6 (SLIC-CAGE) we show that mouse germline development starts with the somatic promoter code, followed by a prominent switch to the maternal code during follicular oogenesis. The sequence features underlying the shift from somatic to maternal code are conserved across vertebrates, despite large differences in promoter nucleotide compositions. In addition, we show that, prior to this major shift, the promoters of gonadal germ cells diverge from the canonical somatic transcription initiation. This divergence is distinct from the promoter code used later by developing oocytes and reveals genome-wide promoter remodelling associated with alternative nucleosome positioning during early female and male germline development. Collectively, our findings establish promoter-level regulatory transitions as a central, conserved feature of the vertebrate life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Protein engineering through directed evolution is an effective way to obtain proteins with novel functions with the potential applications as tools for diagnosis or therapeutics. Many natural proteins, largely antibodies as well as some non-antibody proteins, have undergone directed evolution in vitro in the test tubes in the laboratories around the world, resulted in the numerous protein variants with novel or enhanced functions. In this study, we constructed a Fyn SH2 variant library by randomizing the 8 variable residues in its phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding pocket. Selection of this library by a pTyr peptide from MidT antigen led to the identification of SH2 variants with enhanced affinities to the peptide, compared to the wild type SH2, by EC50 assay. Fluorescent polarization (FP) was then applied to quantify the binding affinity of the newly identified SH2 variants. As a result, three SH2 variants, named V3, V13 and V24, have comparable binding affinities with the previously identified SH2 triple-mutant superbinder (refer to Trm). Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) assay was employed to disclose the kinetics of the binding of these SH2 superbinders, in addition to the wild type SH2, to the phosphotyrosine peptide. The results indicated that all the SH2 superbinders have two-orders increase of the dissociation rate when binding the pTyr peptide while there was no significant change in their associate rates. The previously identified SH2 superbinder Trm as well as the V13 and V24 discovered in this study have cross-reactivity with the sulfotyrosine (sTyr) containing peptide while the wild type SH2 does not. Intriguingly, though binding the pTyr peptide with comparable affinity with other SH2 superbinders, the V3 does not bind to the sTyr peptide, implying it binds to the pTyr peptide with a different pattern from the other superbinders. The newly identified superbinders could be utilized as tools for the identification of pTyr-containing proteins from tissues under different physiological or pathophysiological conditions and may have the potential in the therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all human multi-exonic genes undergo alternative splicing (AS) via regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), but few studies have examined the temporal dynamics of AS and its regulation during cell differentiation in the bone niche. We sought to evaluate how AS, under the control of RBPs, affects cell fate commitment during induced osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived multipotent stem/stromal progenitor cells (MSPCs). We generated a time-course RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset representative of induced MSPC differentiation to osteoblasts. Our analysis revealed widespread AS changes, coordinated with differential RBP expression, at multiple time points, including many AS changes in non-differentially expressed genes. We also developed a computational approach to profile the dynamics and regulation of AS by RBPs using time-course RNA-seq data, by combining temporal patterns of exon skipping and RBP expression with RBP binding sites in the vicinity of regulated exons. In total we identified nine RBPs as potential key splicing regulators during MSPC osteogenic differentiation. Perturbation of one candidate, KHDRBS3, inhibited osteogenesis and bone formation in vitro, validating our computational prediction of \"driver\" RBPs. Overall, our work highlights a high degree of complexity in the splicing regulation of MSPC osteogenic differentiation. Our computational approach may be applied to other time-course data to explore dynamic AS changes and associated regulatory mechanisms in other biological processes or disease trajectories.",

High-throughput techniques now offer unprecedented details on this variability at a single-cell resolution. Yet, there is no current consensus about how EMP in tumors propagates to that in CTCs. To investigate the relationship between EMP associated heterogeneity of tumors and that of CTCs, we integrated transcriptomic analysis and biophysical modeling.\n\nMethodsWe apply three EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) scoring metrics to multiple tumor samples and CTC datasets from several cancer types. Moreover, we develop a biophysical model that couples EMT associated phenotypic switching in a primary tumor with cell migration. Finally, we integrate EMT transcriptomic analysis and in silico modeling to evaluate the predictive power of several measurements of tumor aggressiveness, including tumor EMT score, CTC EMT score, fraction of CTC clusters found in circulation, and CTC cluster size distribution.\n\nResultsAnalysis of high-throughput datasets reveals a pronounced heterogeneity without a well-defined relation between EMT traits in tumors and CTCs. Moreover, mathematical modeling predicts different phases where CTCs can be less, equally, or more mesenchymal than primary tumor depending on the dynamics of phenotypic transition and cell migration. Consistently, various datasets of CTC cluster size distribution from different cancer types are fitted onto different regimes of the model. By further constraining the model with experimental measurements of tumor EMT score, CTC EMT score, and fraction of CTC cluster in bloodstream, we show that none of these assays alone can provide sufficient information to predict the other variables.\n\nConclusionsBy integrating analysis of single cell gene expression and in silico modeling, we propose that the relationship between EMT progression in tumors and CTCs can be variable, and in general, predicting one from the other may not be as straightforward as tacitly assumed.",

Recent studies have shown that ARID1A deficiency induces global changes in the epigenetic landscape of enhancers and promoters. These broad and complex effects make it challenging to identify the driving mechanisms of ARID1A deficiency in promoting cancer progression. Here we identified the anti-senescence effect of ARID1A deficiency in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) by profiling the transcriptome of individual PanINs in the mouse model. Interestingly, we found that ARID1A deficiency upregulates the expression of Aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH1A1, which plays an essential role in attenuating the senescence induced by oncogenic KRAS. Despite that ALDH proteins have been commonly used as cancer stem cell markers, their effect in promoting attenuation of senescence is not known before. Therefore, ALDH proteins could be considered a potential adjuvant drug target in treating pancreatic cancer.",

Nevertheless, most recent observations also support that the GHSR is a constitutively active G protein-coupled receptor endowed of a sophisticated tuning involving a balance of endogenous ligands. Demonstrating the feasibility of shifting GHSR canonical signaling in vivo, we previously reported that a model with enhanced sensitivity to ghrelin (GhsrQ343X mutant rats) developed fat accumulation and glucose intolerance. Herein, we investigated the contribution of energy homeostasis to the onset of this phenotype, as well as behavioral responses to feeding or pharmacological challenges, by comparing GhsrM/M rats to wild-type littermate rats 1) as freely behaving animals using an automated system to monitor simultaneously energy intake and expenditure, respiratory exchanges and voluntary activity and 2) in feeding and locomotor paradigms. Herein, GhsrM/M rats showed enhanced locomotor response to a GHSR agonist while locomotor or anorexigenic responses to amphetamine or cabergoline (dopamine receptor 2 agonist), respectively, were preserved. Ad libitum fed GhsrM/M rats consumed and conditioned for sucrose similarly to littermate control rats. In calorie-restricted conditions, GhsrM/M rats retained food anticipatory activity and maintained better their body weight and glycemia. Finally, prior to fat accumulation GhsrM/M rats showed shifted fuel preference towards carbohydrates utilization without alterations of energy intake, energy expenditure or physical activity. Overall, the present study provides proof of concept that shifted GHSR signaling can operate a specific alteration in nutrient partitioning resulting in modified balance of carbohydrate/lipid utilization.",

    "abstract": "Microbial production of lipids is one of the promising alternatives to fossil fuels with increasing environmental and energy concern. Odd-chain fatty acids (OCFA), a type of unusual lipids, are recently gaining a lot of interest as target compounds in microbial production due to their diverse applications in the medical, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. In this study, we aimed to enhance the pool of precursors with three-carbon chain (propionyl-CoA) and five-carbon chain ({beta}-ketovaleryl-CoA) for the production of OCFAs in Yarrowia lipolytica. We evaluated different propionate-activating enzymes and the overexpression of propionyl-CoA transferase gene from Ralstonia eutropha increased the accumulation of OCFAs by 3.8 times over control strain, indicating propionate activation is the limiting step of OCFAs synthesis. It was shown that acetate supplement was necessary to restore growth and to produce a higher OCFA contents in total lipids, suggesting the balance of the precursors between acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA is crucial for OCFA accumulation. To improve {beta}-ketovaleryl-CoA pools for further increase of OCFA production, we co-expressed the bktB encoding {beta}-ketothiolase in the producing strain, and the OCFA production was increased by 33 % compared to control. Combining strain engineering and the optimization of the C/N ratio promoted the OCFA production up to 1.87 g/L representing 62% of total lipids, the highest recombinant OCFAs titer reported in yeast, up to date. This study provides a strong basis for the microbial production of OCFAs and its derivatives having high potentials in a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "SummarySevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the newly emergent causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has resulted in more than one million deaths worldwide since it was first detected in 2019. There is a critical global need for therapeutic intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by brilacidin--a de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of HDPs--on SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is primarily a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin has demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir. Collectively, our data demonstrate that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and thus supports brilacidin as a promising COVID-19 drug candidate.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBrilacidin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in an ACE2 positive human lung cell line.\nC_LIO_LIBrilacidin achieved a high Selectivity Index of 426 (CC50=241M/IC50=0.565M).\nC_LIO_LIBrilacidins main mechanism appears to disrupt viral integrity and impact viral entry.\nC_LIO_LIBrilacidin and remdesivir exhibit excellent synergistic activity against SARS-CoV-2.\nC_LI\n\nSignificance StatementSARS-CoV-2, the emergent novel coronavirus, has led to the current global COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by extreme contagiousness and high mortality rates. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that brilacidin, a synthetic small molecule with peptide-like properties, is capable of exerting potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with remdesivir, which is currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 exhibits significant experimental and clinical gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiac muscle tropisms responsible for local tissue-specific and systemic pathophysiology capriciously occurring in about half of COVID-19 patients. The underlying COVID-19 mechanisms engaged by these extra-pulmonary organ systems are largely unknown. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing that neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 (alternately called NBB, B, B0 in the literature) is a common denominator expressed nearly exclusively by three particular cell types: intestinal epithelia, renal proximal tubule epithelium, and cardiomyocytes. B0AT1 provides uptake of glutamine and tryptophan. The gut is the main depot expressing over 90% of the bodys entire pool of SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and B0AT1. Recent cryo-EM studies established that ACE2 forms a thermodynamically favored dimer-of-heterodimers complex with B0AT1 assembled in the form of a dimer of two ACE2:B0AT1 heterodimers anchored in plasma membranes. Prior epithelial cell studies demonstrated ACE2 chaperone trafficking of B0AT1. This contrasts with monomeric expression of ACE2 in lung pneumocytes, in which B0AT1 is undetectable. The cell types in question also express a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) known to cleave and shed the ectodomain of monomeric ACE2 from the cell surface, thereby relinquishing protection against unchecked renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) events of COVID-19. The present study employed molecular docking modeling to examine the interplaying assemblage of ACE2, ADAM17 and B0AT1. We report that in the monomer form of ACE2, neck region residues R652-N718 provide unimpeded access to ADAM17 active site pocket, but notably R708 and S709 remained >10-15 [A] distant. In contrast, interference of ADAM17 docking to ACE2 in a dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement was directly correlated with the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of the 2ACE2:2B0AT1] dimer of heterodimers, representing the expression pattern putatively exclusive to intestinal, renal and cardiomyocyte cell types. The monomer and dimer-of-heterodimers docking models were not influenced by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) complexed to ACE2. The results collectively provide the underpinnings for understanding the role of B0AT1 involvement in COVID-19 and the role of ADAM17 steering ACE2 events in intestinal and renal epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with implications useful for consideration in pandemic public hygiene policy and drug development.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic was a stark reminder that a barren global antiviral pipeline has grave humanitarian consequences. Pandemics could be prevented in principle by accessible, easily deployable broad-spectrum oral antivirals. Here we report the results of the COVID Moonshot, a fully open-science, crowd sourced, structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. We discovered a novel chemical series that is differentiated from current Mpro inhibitors in that it maintains a new non-covalent, non-peptidic scaffold with nanomolar potency. Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, high-throughput structural biology, machine learning, and exascale molecular simulations and high-throughput chemistry. In the process, we generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. In a first for a structure-based drug discovery campaign, all compound designs (>18,000 designs), crystallographic data (>840 ligand-bound X-ray structures), assay data (>10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (>2,400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich open and IP-free knowledgebase for future anti-coronavirus drug discovery.",

It is not known to what extent reinfection by these viruses is due to waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the viruses. Here, we address the influence of antigenic drift on immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence that at least two of these viruses, OC43 and 229E, are undergoing adaptive evolution in regions of the viral spike protein that are exposed to human humoral immunity. This suggests that reinfection may be due, in part, to positively-selected genetic changes in these viruses that enable them to escape recognition by the immune system. It is possible that, as with seasonal influenza, these adaptive changes in antigenic regions of the virus would necessitate continual reformulation of a vaccine made against them.",

We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing using DNA obtained from fecal samples representing gut microbiome before and after ten weeks-long metformin treatment.\n\nWe identified 100 metformin-related differentially abundant species in high-fat diet-fed mice before and after the treatment, with most of the species abundances increased. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in control diet-fed mice.We also observed sex-specific differences in response to metformin treatment. Males experienced more pronounced changes in metabolic markers, while, in females, the extent of changes in gut microbiome representatives was more marked, indicated by 53 differentially abundant species with more remarkable Log fold changes compared to the combined-sex analysis. Our results suggest that both sexes of animals should be included in future studies focusing on metformin effects on the gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Draft genome sequences of non-bilaterian species have provided important insights into the evolution of the metazoan gene repertoire. However, there is little information about the evolution of gene clusters, genome architectures and karyotypes during animal evolution. In this regard, slowly evolving anthozoan Cnidaria, the sister group of Bilateria, are particularly informative. Here we report chromosome-level genome assemblies of two related cnidarians, the sea anemones Nematostella vectensis and Scolanthus callimorphus. We find a robust set of 15 chromosomes with a clear one-to-one correspondence between the two species. Both sea anemone genomes show remarkable chromosomal conservation with other cnidarians, several bilaterians and the sponge Ephydatia muelleri, allowing us to reconstruct ancestral cnidarian and metazoan chromosomal blocks, consisting of at least 19 and 16 ancestral linkage groups, respectively. We show that, in contrast to Bilateria, the Hox and NK clusters of investigated cnidarians are largely disintegrated, despite the presence of staggered hox/gbx expression in Nematostella. This loss of microsynteny conservation may be facilitated by shorter distances between cis-regulatory sequences and their cognate transcriptional start sites. In line with that, we find no clear evidence for topologically associated domains, suggesting fundamental differences in long-range gene regulation compared to vertebrates. These data suggest that large sets of ancestral metazoan genes have been retained in ancestral linkage groups of some extant lineages, yet, higher order gene regulation with associated 3D architecture may have evolved only after the cnidarian-bilaterian split.",

    "abstract": "T cells discriminate between healthy and infected cells with remarkable sensitivity when mounting an immune response. It has been hypothesized that this efficient detection requires combining signals from discrete antigen-presenting cell interactions into a more potent response, requiring T cells to maintain a  memory of previous encounters. To quantify the magnitude of this phenomenon, we have developed an antigen receptor that is both optically and chemically tunable, providing control over the initiation, duration, and intensity of intracellular T-cell signaling within physiological cell conjugates. We observe very limited persistence within the T cell intracellular network on disruption of receptor input, with signals dissipating entirely in ~15 minutes, and directly confirm that sustained proximal receptor signaling is required to maintain active gene transcription. Our data suggests that T cells are largely incapable of integrating discrete antigen receptor signals but instead simply accumulate the output of gene expression. By engineering optical control in a clinically relevant chimeric antigen receptor, we show that this limited signal persistence can be exploited to increase the activation of primary T cells by ~3-fold by using pulsatile stimulation. Our results are likely to apply more generally to the signaling dynamics of other cellular networks.",

Here we generate extensive atomic level conformational ensembles of histone tails in the context of the full human nucleosome, totaling 26 microseconds of molecular dynamics simulations. We explore the histone tail binding with the nucleosomal and linker DNA and observe rapid conformational transitions between bound and unbound states allowing us to estimate kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the histone tail-DNA interactions. Different histone types exhibit distinct, although conformationally heterogeneous, binding modes and each histone type occludes specific DNA regions from the solvent. Using a comprehensive set of experimental data on nucleosome structural complexes, we find that majority of the studied nucleosome-binding proteins and histone tails target mutually exclusive regions on nucleosomal or linker DNA around the super-helical locations {+/-}1, {+/-}2, and {+/-}7. This finding is explained within the generalized competitive binding and tail displacement models of partners recruitment to nucleosomes. Finally, we demonstrate the crosstalk between different histone post-translational modifications, where charge-altering modifications and mutations typically suppress tail-DNA interactions and enhance histone tail dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The legalization of Cannabis sativa L. for recreational and medical purposes has been gaining global momentum, leading to a rise in interest in Cannabis tissue culture as growers look for large-scale solutions to germplasm storage and clean plant propagation. Mother plants used in commercial propagation are susceptible to insect pests and disease and require considerable space. While micropropagation can produce disease free starting material in less space, current published in vitro micropropagation methods are not robust and few report high multiplication rates. Further, these micropropagation methods rely on photoperiod-sensitive plants which can be maintained in a perpetual vegetative state. Current methods are not adaptable to long-term tissue culture of day-neutral cultivars, which cannot be maintained in perpetual vegetative growth. In this study, we chose to develop a micropropagation system which uses C. sativa inflorescences as starting materials. This study used two cannabis cultivars, two plant growth regulators (PGR; 6-benzylaminopurine and meta-topolin) at different concentrations, and two different numbers of florets. Here we show that floral reversion occurs from meristematic tissue in C. sativa florets and that it can be used to enhance multiplication rates compared to existing in vitro methods. Floret number was shown to have a significant impact on percent reversion, with pairs of florets reverting more frequently and producing healthier explants than single florets, while cultivar and PGR had no significant effect on percent reversion. Compared with our previously published nodal culture studies, the current floral reversion method produced up to eight times more explants per tissue culture cycle. Floral reversion provides a foundation for effective inflorescence-based micropropagation systems in C. sativa.",

    "abstract": "When we ask people to hold a color in working memory, what do they store? Do they remember colors as point estimates (e.g. a particular shade of red) or are memory representations richer, such as uncertainty distributions over feature space? We developed a novel paradigm (a betting game) to measure the nature of working memory representations. Participants were shown a set of colored circles and, after a brief memory delay, asked about one of the objects. Rather than reporting a single color, participants placed multiple bets to create distributions in color space. The dispersion of bets was correlated with performance, indicating that participants internal uncertainty guided bet placement. Furthermore, relative to the first response, memory performance improved when averaging across multiple bets, showing that memories contain more information than can be conveyed in a single response. Finally, information about the item in memory was present in subsequent responses even when the first response would generally be classified as a guess or report of an incorrect item, suggesting that such failures are not all-or-none. Thus, memory representations are more than noisy point estimates; they are surprisingly rich and probabilistic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies and steady progress is being made towards CAR-immunotherapies for solid tumours. Epidermal growth factor family receptors EGFR or HER2 are commonly overexpressed in cancer and represent proven targets for CAR-T therapy; given their expression in healthy tissues it is imperative that any targeting strategy consider the potential for on-target off-tumour toxicity.\n\nMethodsHerein, we utilize high-throughput CAR screening to identify novel camelid single-domain antibody CARs (sdCARs) with high EGFR-specific CAR-T response. To optimize antigenic sensitivity of this EGFR-sdCAR, we performed progressive N-terminal truncation of the human CD8 hinge domain used as a spacer in many CAR constructs. Hinge truncation resulted in decreased CAR sensitivity to EGFR and improved selectivity for EGFR-overexpressing cells over EGFR-low target cells or healthy donor derived EGFR-positive fibroblasts. To investigate the molecular mechanism of hinge truncation, we test hinge-truncated scFv-based CARs targeting membrane proximal or membrane distal domains of EGFR-family proteins, HER2 and EGFRvIII. Finally, we proceed to test hinge variant EGFR-sdCAR functionality through in vitro and in vivo assessments in primary T cells derived from multiple donors.\n\nResultsFor CARs targeting membrane-proximal epitopes, hinge truncation by even a single amino acid provided fine control of the antigenic sensitivity, whereas CARs targeting membrane distal domains were not sensitive to even complete hinge domain removal. Hinge-modified EGFR-sdCARs showed consistent and predictable responses in Jurkat-CAR cells and primary human CAR-T cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\nConclusionsOverall, these results indicate that membrane-proximal epitope targeting CARs can be modified through hinge length tuning for programmable antigenic sensitivity and improved tumour selectivity.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/360925v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f0db64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3ac43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d270faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f7614f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG O_LISingle amino acid truncations of CD8-hinge domain provide precise control of CAR antigen sensitivity\nC_LIO_LITruncated hinge CARs show enhanced selectivity for antigen overexpressing tumour cells and decreased activity towards healthy antigen-expressing cells\nC_LIO_LIEpitope location is a critical factor in determining hinge sensitivity for a CAR\nC_LIO_LIHinge tuning can modulate CAR-T antigenic sensivity in vitro and in vivo\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Viruses of prokaryotes greatly outnumber their hosts1 and impact microbial processes across scales, including community assembly, evolution, and metabolism1. Metagenomic discovery of novel viruses has greatly expanded viral sequence databases, but only rarely can viral sequences be linked to specific hosts. Here, we adapt proximity ligation methods to ligate ribosomal RNA to transcripts, including viral ones, during translation. We sequenced the resulting chimeras, directly linking marine viral gene expression to specific hosts by transcript association with rRNA sequences. With a sample from the San Pedro Ocean Time-series (SPOT), we found viral-host links to Cyanobacteria, SAR11, SAR116, SAR86, OM75, and Rhodobacteracae hosts, some being the first viruses reported for these groups. We used the SPOT viral and cellular DNA database to track abundances of multiple virus-host pairs monthly over 5 years, e.g. with Roseovarius phages tracking the host. Because the vast majority of proximity ligations should occur between an organisms ribosomes and its own transcripts, we validated our method by looking for self- vs non-self mRNA-rRNA chimeras, by read recruitment to marine single amplified genomes; verifiable non-self chimeras, suggesting off-target linkages, were very rare, indicating host-virus hits were very unlikely to occur by mistake. This approach in practice could link any transcript and its associated processes to specific microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Arginase is a metalloenzyme that plays a central role in Leishmania infection. Previously, rosmarinic and caffeic acids were described as antileishmanial and as a Leishmania amazonensis arginase inhibitor and now, we describe the inhibition of arginase in L. amazonensis by rosmarinic acid analogs (1-7) and new caffeic acids derived amides (8-10). Caffeic acid esters and amides were produced by means of the engineered synthesis in E. coli and tested against L. amazonensis arginase. New amides (8-10) were biosynthesized in E. coli cultured with 2 mM of different combinations of feeding substrates. The most potent arginase inhibitors showed Ki(s) between 2 - 5.7 M. Compounds 2-4 and 7 inhibited L-ARG through a noncompetitive mechanism, and 9 showed a competitive inhibition. By applying an in silico protocol we determined the binding mode of compound 9. The competitive inhibitor of L-ARG targets key residues within the binding site of the enzyme establishing a metal coordination bond with the metal ions as well as a series of hydrophobic and polar contacts supporting its micromolar inhibition of L-ARG. These results highlight that the dihydroxycinnamic-derived compounds can be used as the basis for the development of new drugs using a powerful tool based on the biosynthesis of arginase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnxiety, evoked by continuous inspiration of a 5 - 8% CO2 mixture, has been found to have an analgesic eLect on self-reported pain. The precise mechanism whereby this effect obtains remains unknown.\n\nMethodsThe present study tested whether temporal summation, the psychological counterpart of wind-up, is involved in hypercapnic analgesia. 21 healthy participants received painful transcutaneous electrical stimuli of varied intensity, during continuous inhalation of 7.5% CO2 mixture and medical air, presented in a single-blinded counterbalanced order. Continuous pain ratings were acquired to measure the temporal development of the pain response. Several points and events of interest that characterise the pain response profile were extracted from the continuous data.\n\nResultsMixed-eLects modelling demonstrated a reduction of all pain measures during inspiration of the anxiogenic mixture, but not air. This was accompanied by an increase in the psychological and physiological measures of anxiety. Analyses of the characteristic measures of temporal summation suggested that the hypercapnic mixture has an analgesic property evident from the start of the pain response. The same was true for the remainder of the response, the adaptation period, where pain ratings were also inhibited. The reduced pain ratings persisted during the remainder of the response. Anxiety was found to be a mediating factor for summative pain ratings but not the temporally sensitive TS measures, suggesting an overall, cumulative effect.\n\nConclusionsThe findings provide an explanation for the previously observed low self-reported pain during the inhalation of an anxiogenic hypercapnic mixture.",

    "abstract": "Geochemical evidence suggests methane was the predominant greenhouse gas in the Archean and early Proterozoic eons. Consequently, fluctuations in methane concentration in Earths atmosphere (i.e.,  methane hazes) would have contributed to climate change and influenced the flux of UV radiation reaching surface environments. If correct, understanding what factors (e.g., O2 and/or resource concentration) drove the biological methane cycle might shed light on the repetition of biological, atmospheric and climatic events preserved in the sedimentary rock record from ~2.8 to 2.0 BYA. To explore these interdependencies, we developed a novel dynamical model of microbial ecological interactions to investigate the conditions under which methane is preferentially released to the atmosphere. We found that the interplay between resource and O2 availability results in complex cyclic methane dynamics unrelated to the functional groups or efficiencies of microbial communities, to initial conditions, or to other model constraints. Based on these results, we propose that the cyclicity of methane haze events and glacial episodes in the Neoarchean and early Paleoproterozoic may have been linked to the progressive increase in oceanic and atmospheric O2 through the interval.",

    "abstract": "Given that plant nutrient content is both spatially and temporally dynamic (Lenhart et al., 2015; Deans et al., 2016, 2018), insect herbivores are exposed to an incredible amount of nutritional variability. This variability can constrain insects to feeding on sub-optimal resources, but it can also provide an opportunity for insects to regulate their intake of specific nutrients to obtain an optimal balance. Nutrient regulation has implications for pest control strategies in agricultural systems, as the nutritional state of pest species may impact their susceptibility to insecticides. Deans et al. (2017) showed that diet macronutrient balance has significant effects on the susceptibility of Helicoverpa zea larvae to Cry1Ac, an endotoxin expressed in transgenic Bt crops. This was demonstrated using a highly inbred laboratory strain of H. zea, limiting the applicability of these results to field populations that encompass greater genetic diversity. In this study, we assessed the impact of field-relevant macronutrient variability on the efficacy of two Bt endotoxins, Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac, using three field populations collected from different geographic regions. This was done to further understand the impact of nutritional variability on Bt susceptibility and also to determine the relevance of these effects in the field. While we saw limited differences in Cry susceptibility across populations, dietary effects were highly variable. Across populations there were distinct population-level differences in the interactions between Cry concentration and diet, the type of Cry toxin impacted by diet, and the treatment diet that produced optimal survival and performance. These results show that nutrition can have strong impacts on Bt susceptibility but also that these impacts are strongly affected by genetic background in H. zea. To accurately assess Bt susceptibility in the field, including resistance monitoring, bioassay methods should incorporate the appropriate nutritional parameters and be as localized as possible.",

In spite of its well-known hydrology and physico chemistry, this enormous water mass remains poorly studied at the microbial genomics level.\n\nResultsWe have sampled its different water masses and analyzed the microbiome by classic and genome-resolved metagenomics generating a large number of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from them. The oxic zone presents many similarities to the global ocean while the euxinic water mass has similarities to other similar aquatic environments of marine or freshwater (meromictic monimolimnion strata) origin. The MAG collection represents very well the different types of metabolisms expected in this kind of environments and includes Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus), photoheterotrophs (largely with marine relatives), facultative/microaerophilic microbes again largely marine, chemolithotrophs (N and S oxidizers) and a large number of anaerobes, mostly sulfate reducers but also a few methanogens and a large number of \"dark matter\" streamlined genomes of largely unpredictable ecology.\n\nConclusionsThe Black Sea presents a mixture of similarities to other water bodies. The photic zone has many microbes in common with that of the Mediterranean with the relevant exception of the absence of Prochlorococcus. The chemocline already presents very different characteristics with many examples of chemolithotrophic metabolism (Thioglobus) and facultatively anaerobic microbes. Finally the euxinic anaerobic zone presents, as expected, features in common with the bottom of meromictic lakes with a massive dominance of sulfate reduction as energy generating metabolism and a small but detectable methanogenesis.We are adding critical information about this unique and important ecosystem and its microbiome.",

However, the mechanisms that drive integrated musculoskeletal development and coordinated growth and differentiation of each of these tissues are still being uncovered. Epigenetic modifiers have emerged as critical regulators of cell fate differentiation, but so far almost nothing is known about their roles in tendon biology. Previous studies have shown that epigenetic modifications driven by Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a major histone methyltransferase, have significant roles in vertebrate development including skeletal patterning and bone formation. We now find that targeting Ezh2 through the limb mesenchyme also has significant effects on tendon and muscle patterning, likely reflecting the essential roles of early mesenchymal cues mediated by Ezh2 for coordinated patterning and development of all tissues of the musculoskeletal system. Conversely, loss of Ezh2 in the tendon cells did not disrupt the tendon cell fate suggesting that tenocyte differentiation and tendon maturation are independent of Ezh2 signaling.",
