    "abstract": "Genomic manipulation is a useful approach for elucidating the molecular pathways underlying aspects of development, physiology, and behaviour. However, a lack of gene-editing tools appropriated for use in reef fishes has meant the genetic underpinnings for many of their unique traits remain to be investigated. One iconic group of reef fishes ideal for applying this technique are anemonefishes (Amphiprioninae) as they are widely studied for their symbiosis with anemones, sequential hermaphroditism, complex social hierarchies, skin pattern development, and vision, and are raised relatively easily in aquaria. In this study, we developed a gene-editing protocol for applying the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the false clown anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris. Microinjection of eggs at the one-cell stage was used to demonstrate the successful use of our CRISPR/Cas9 approach at two separate target sites: the rhodopsin-like 2B opsin encoding gene (RH2B) involved in vision, and Tyrosinase-producing gene (tyr) involved in the production of melanin. Analysis of the sequenced target gene regions in A. ocellaris embryos showed that uptake was as high as 50% of injected eggs. Further analysis of the subcloned mutant gene sequences revealed that our approach had a 75% to 100% efficiency in producing biallelic mutations in G0 A. ocellaris embryos. Moreover, we clearly show a loss-of-function in tyr mutant embryos which exhibited typical hypomelanistic phenotypes. This protocol is intended as a useful resource for future experimental studies that aim to elucidate gene function in anemonefishes and reef fishes in general.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding is a central feature of most neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular chaperones can modulate the toxicity associated with protein misfolding, but it remains elusive which molecular chaperones and co-chaperones interact with specific misfolded proteins. TDP-43 misfolding and inclusion formation is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Using yeast and mammalian neuronal cells we find that Hsp90 and its co-chaperones have a strong capacity to alter TDP-43 misfolding, inclusion formation, aggregation, and cellular toxicity. Our data also demonstrate that impaired Hsp90 function sensitizes cells to TDP-43 toxicity. We further show that the co-chaperone Sti1 specifically interacts with and modulates TDP-43 toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized tie between Hsp90, Sti1, TDP-43 misfolding, and its cellular toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is a 520 dalton prosthetic group that is synthesized in all domains of life. In animals, four oxidases (among them sulfite oxidase) use Moco as a prosthetic group. Moco is essential in animals; humans with mutations in genes that encode Moco-biosynthetic enzymes display lethal neurological and developmental defects. Moco supplementation seems a logical therapy, however the instability of Moco has precluded biochemical and cell biological studies of Moco transport and bioavailability. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can take up Moco from its bacterial diet and transport it to cells and tissues that express Moco-requiring enzymes, suggesting a system for Moco uptake and distribution. Here we show that protein-bound Moco is the stable, bioavailable species of Moco taken up by C. elegans from its diet and is an effective dietary supplement, rescuing a C. elegans model of Moco deficiency. We demonstrate that diverse Moco:protein complexes are stable and bioavailable, suggesting a new strategy for the production and delivery of therapeutically active Moco to treat human Moco deficiency.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR knockout screens in hundreds of cancer cell lines have revealed a substantial number of context-specific essential genes that, when associated with a biomarker such as lineage or oncogenic mutation, offer candidate tumor-specific vulnerabilities for targeted therapies or novel drug development. Data-driven analysis of knockout fitness screens also yields many other functionally coherent modules that show emergent essentiality or, in rarer cases, the opposite phenotype of faster proliferation. We develop a systematic approach to classify these suppressors of proliferation, which are highly enriched for tumor suppressor genes, and define a network of 145 genes in 22 discrete modules. One surprising module contains several elements of the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway and operates exclusively in a subset of AML lines, which we call Fatty Acid Synthesis/Tumor Suppressor (FASTS) cells. The proliferation suppressor activity of genes involved in the synthesis of saturated fatty acids, coupled with a more severe fitness phenotype for the desaturation pathway, suggests that these cells operate at the limit of their carrying capacity for saturated fatty acids, which we confirmed biochemically. Overexpression of genes in this module is associated with a survival advantage in an age-matched cohort of AML patients, suggesting the gene cluster driving an in vitro phenotype may be associated with a novel, clinically relevant subtype.",

    "abstract": "Acrocomia (Arecaceae) is a genus widely distributed in tropical and subtropical America that has been achieving economic interest due to the great potential of oil production of some of its species. In particular A. aculeata, due to its vocation to supply oil with the same productive capacity as the oil palm even in areas with water deficit. Although eight species are recognized in the genus, the taxonomic classification based on morphology and geographic distribution is still controversial. Knowledge about the genetic diversity and population structure of the species is limited, which has limited the understanding of the genetic relationships and the orientation of management, conservation, and genetic improvement activities of species of the genus. In the present study, we analyzed the genomic diversity and population structure of seven species of Acrocomia including 117 samples of A. aculeata covering a wide geographical area of occurrence, using single nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers originated from Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS). The genetic structure of the Acrocomia species were partially congruent with the current taxonomic classification based on morphological characters, recovering the separation of the species A. aculeata, A. totai, A. crispa and A. intumescens as distinct taxonomic groups. However, the species A. media was attributed to the cluster of A. aculeata while A. hassleri and A. glauscescens were grouped together with A. totai. The species that showed the highest and lowest genetic diversity were A. totai and A. media, respectively. When analyzed separately, the species A. aculeata showed a strong genetic structure, forming two genetic groups, the first represented mainly by genotypes from Brazil and the second by accessions from Central and North American countries. Greater genetic diversity was found in Brazil when compared to the other countries. Our results on the genetic diversity of the genus are unprecedented, as is also establishes new insights on the genomic relationships between Acrocomia species. It is also the first study to provide a more global view of the genomic diversity of A. aculeata. We also highlight the applicability of genomic data as a reference for future studies on genetic diversity, taxonomy, evolution and phylogeny of the Acrocomia genus, as well as to support strategies for the conservation, exploration and breeding of Acrocomia species and in particular A. aculeata.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and represents the main cause of dementia. Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. In COVID-19, neurological manifestations have been reported to occur. The present study demonstrates that the protein expression level of ACE2 is upregulated in the brain of Alzheimers disease patients. The increased ACE2 expression is not age-dependent, suggesting the direct relationship between Alzheimers disease and the ACE2 expression. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease, and Alzheimers disease brains examined in this study also exhibited higher carbonylated proteins as well as increased thiol oxidation state of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6). The positive correlation was found between the increased ACE2 protein expression and oxidative stress in Alzheimers disease brain. Thus, the present study reveals the relationships between Alzheimers disease and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant monitoring Alzheimers disease patients with COVID-19 carefully for the possible higher viral load in the brain and long-term adverse neurological consequences.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection (marker gene selection) is widely believed to improve clustering accuracy, and is thus a key component of single cell clustering pipelines. However, we found that the performance of existing feature selection methods was inconsistent across benchmark datasets, and occasionally even worse than without feature selection. Moreover, existing methods ignored information contained in gene-gene correlations. We therefore developed DUBStepR (Determining the Underlying Basis using Stepwise Regression), a feature selection algorithm that leverages gene-gene correlations with a novel measure of inhomogeneity in feature space, termed the Density Index (DI). Despite selecting a relatively small number of genes, DUBStepR substantially outperformed existing single-cell feature selection methods across diverse clustering benchmarks. In a published scRNA-seq dataset from sorted monocytes, DUBStepR sensitively detected a rare and previously invisible population of contaminating basophils. DUBStepR is scalable to over a million cells, and can be straightforwardly applied to other data types such as single-cell ATAC-seq. We propose DUBStepR as a general-purpose feature selection solution for accurately clustering single-cell data.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an almost universally fatal malignancy and there is an urgent need for new therapeutic targets. PDAC cells harbor genetic alterations and display metabolic changes that render them vulnerable to perturbations in redox homeostasis. Peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4) supports redox homeostasis by metabolizing H2O2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Based on functional genomics, we found that PDAC cell lines are dependent on PRDX4 for their growth and survival. We validated this dependency in established and primary PDAC cells, as well as 3D models and orthotopic xenografts. Cell death induced by PRDX4 depletion was accompanied by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and a DNA-PKcs-governed DNA damage response. As such, PRDX4 depletion also sensitized cells and tumors to ionizing radiation. The source of ROS that created a dependency on PRDX4 was attributed to NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which localizes to the ER membrane. The functional requirement for PRDX4 was correlated with cellular NADPH levels across different models of PDAC and could be rescued by depletion of NOX4 or NADPH. As such, this study has identified NOX4 as a link between metabolic deregulation and ER-specific redox vulnerability in PDAC. Since PRDX4 is not an essential gene in normal tissues, our work also suggests that PRDX4 represents a novel therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer that may be particularly potent in combination with radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to their postsynaptic counterparts, the contributions of activity-dependent cytoskeletal signaling to presynaptic plasticity remain controversial and poorly understood. To identify and evaluate these signaling pathways, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the presynaptic cytomatrix using in vivo biotin identification (iBioID). The resultant proteome was heavily enriched for actin cytoskeleton regulators, including Rac1, a Rho GTPase that activates the Arp2/3 complex to nucleate branched actin filaments. Strikingly, we find Rac1 and Arp2/3 are closely associated with presynaptic vesicle membranes and negatively regulate synaptic vesicle replenishment at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Using optogenetics and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we show this pathway bidirectionally sculpts short-term synaptic depression and that its presynaptic activation is coupled to action potentials by voltage-gated calcium influx. Thus, this study provides a new proteomic framework for understanding presynaptic physiology and uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism of actin-regulated short-term presynaptic plasticity that is conserved across cell types.",

We employed partial correlations as a measure of the functional association strength between pairs of neurons to reconstruct a neuronal connectome. We demonstrated using gold standard datasets from the Neural Connectomics Challenge (NCC) that FARCI provides an accurate connectome and its performance is robust to network sizes, missing neurons, and noise levels. Moreover, FARCI is computationally efficient and highly scalable to large networks. In comparison to the best performing algorithm in the NCC, FARCI produces more accurate networks over different network sizes and subsampling, while providing over two orders of magnitude faster computational speed.",

Translating between the different modalities, however, requires imaging the same brain with each. Here, we imaged the same postmortem mouse brain over five orders of spatial resolution using MRI, whole brain micron-scale synchrotron x-ray tomography (CT), and large volume automated serial electron microscopy. Using this pipeline, we can track individual myelinated axons previously relegated to axon bundles in diffusion tensor MRI or arbitrarily trace neurons and their processes brain-wide and identify individual synapses on them. This pipeline provides both an unprecedented look across a single brains multi-scaled organization as well as a vehicle for studying the brains multi-scale pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Slot machines are a popular form of gambling, offering a tractable way to experimentally model reward processes. This study used a 3-reel slot paradigm to assess psychologically distinct phases of reward processing, reflecting anticipation, and early and late-stage outcome processing. EEG measures of winning, nearly missing (a losing outcome revealed at the final, third reel), and \"totally\" missing (a losing outcome revealed earlier, at the second reel) were collected from healthy adults (n=54). Condition effects were evaluated in: i) event-related potential (ERP) components reflecting anticipatory attention (stimulus preceding negativity, SPN) and outcome processing (reward positivity, RewP and late-positive potential, LPP) and ii) total power and phase synchrony of theta and delta band oscillations. Behaviorally, trial initiation was fastest after a near miss outcome and slowest after a winning outcome. As expected, a significant SPN was observed for possible wins (AA) vs. total misses (AB), consistent with reward anticipation. In addition, significantly larger win (AAA) vs. near miss (AAB) amplitudes were observed for the RewP and LPP to wins and LPP to near misses (vs. total misses) reflecting early and late-stage outcome processing effects. There was an effect of reel position on the RewP, with larger effects in the final reel (AAA-AAB) relative to the 2nd-reel locked difference waves (AA-AB). Across all outcomes, near misses elicited the largest and most phase-synchronized theta responses, while wins elicited larger and more phase-synchronized delta responses than total misses, with near misses not differing from wins or total misses. Phase locking measures contrasting win vs. near miss delta and theta synchronization, within time windows corresponding to ERP measurements, covaried with RewP, but not SPN or LPP, amplitude. Lastly, EEG measures showed differential relationships with age and self-reported consummatory pleasure. In the context of slot machine play, where reward anticipation and attainment place minimal demands on effort and skill, ERP and time-frequency methods capture distinct neurophysiological signatures of reward anticipation and outcome processing.",

    "abstract": "Disturbances to protein homeostasis (proteostasis) can lead to protein aggregation and inclusion formation, processes associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. DNAJBs are molecular chaperones previously identified as potent suppressors of disease-related protein aggregation. In this work, we over-expressed a destabilised isoform of firefly luciferase (R188Q/R261Q Fluc; FlucDM) in cells to assess the capacity of DNAJBs to inhibit inclusion formation. Co-expression of all DNAJBs tested significantly inhibited the intracellular aggregation of FlucDM. Moreover, we show that DNAJBs suppress aggregation by supporting the Hsp70-dependent degradation of FlucDM via the proteasome. The serine-rich stretch in DNAJB6 and DNAJB8, essential for preventing fibrillar aggregation, is not involved in the suppression of FlucDM inclusion formation. Conversely, deletion of the C-terminal TTK-LKS region in DNAJB8, a region not required to suppress polyQ aggregation, abolished its ability to inhibit inclusion formation by FlucDM. Thus, our data suggest that DNAJB6 and DNAJB8 possess two distinct domains involved in the inhibition of protein aggregation, one responsible for binding to {beta}-hairpins that form during amyloid formation and another that mediates the degradation of destabilised client proteins via the proteasome.\n\nSummary statementSpecialised DNAJB molecular chaperones are potent suppressors of protein aggregation and interact with different types of client proteins via distinct C-terminal regions",

    "abstract": "The GTPase Rab1 is a master regulator of both the early secretory pathway and autophagy. Rab1 activation is controlled by its GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), the multi-subunit TRAPPIII complex. The Trs85 regulatory subunit is critical for robust activation of Rab1 but its mechanistic role within the complex has remained unclear. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the intact yeast TRAPPIII complex bound to its substrate Rab1/Ypt1. The orientation of the Rab1/Ypt1 hypervariable domain when bound to the complex leads to a model for how TRAPPIII associates with and activates Rab1/Ypt1 at the membrane surface. We identify a conserved amphipathic -helix motif within Trs85 and demonstrate that this helix is required for stable membrane binding and Rab1/Ypt1 activation by TRAPPIII. Taken together, our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of the yeast TRAPPIII complex and reveal that the key function of Trs85 is to serve as a membrane anchor, via its amphipathic helix, for the entire TRAPPIII complex.",

    "abstract": "We take a data-driven approach to deducing the local volume changes accompanying early development of the fetal human brain. Our approach uses fetal brain atlas MRI data for the geometric changes in representative cases. Using a nonlinear continuum mechanics model of morphoelastic growth, we invert the deformation obtained from MRI registration to arrive at a field for the growth deformation gradient tensor. Our field inversion uses a combination of direct and adjoint methods for computing gradients of the objective function while constraining the optimization by the physics of morphoelastic growth. We thus infer a growth deformation gradient field that obeys the laws of morphoelastic growth. The errors between the MRI data and the forward displacement solution driven by the inverted growth deformation gradient field are found to be smaller than the reference displacement by well over an order of magnitude, and can be driven even lower. The results thus reproduce the three-dimensional growth during the early development of the fetal brain with controllable error. Our findings confirm that early growth is dominated by in plane cortical expansion rather than thickness increase.",

    "abstract": "Both Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establish the persistent, life-long infection primarily at the latent status, and contribute to certain types of tumors, including B cell lymphomas, especially in immuno-compromised individuals, such as people living with HIV (PLWH). Lytic reactivation of these viruses can be employed to kill tumor cells harboring latently infected viral episomes, through the viral cytopathic effects and the subsequent antiviral immune responses. In this study, we identified that polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is induced by KSHV de novo infection as well as lytic switch from KSHV latency. We further demonstrated that PLK1 depletion or inhibition facilitates KSHV reactivation and promotes cell death of KSHV-reactivated lymphoma cells. Mechanistically, PLK1 regulates Myc that is critical to both maintenance of KSHV latency and support of cell survival, and preferentially affects the level of H3K27me3 inactive mark both globally and at certain loci of KSHV viral episomes. Lastly, we recognized that PLK1 inhibition synergizes with STAT3 inhibition to efficiently induce KSHV reactivation. Furthermore, we also confirmed that PLK1 depletion or inhibition yields the similar effect on EBV reactivation and cell death of EBV-reactivated lymphoma cells. Additionally, we noticed the PLK1 in B cells is elevated in the context of HIV infection and by HIV Nef protein, which would favor KSHV/EBV latency. Above all, our findings illustrated that PLK1 is a novel host target that can be inhibited to benefit the viral oncolysis to eliminate KSHV/EBV-infected lymphoma cells, particularly for PLWH.",
