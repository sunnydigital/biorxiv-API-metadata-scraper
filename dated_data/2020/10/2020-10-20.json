    "abstract": "Early events in retrovirus transmission are determined by interactions between incoming viruses and frontline cells near entry sites. Despite their importance for retroviral pathogenesis, very little is known about these events. We developed a bioluminescence imaging (BLI)-guided multiscale imaging approach to study these events in vivo. Engineered murine leukemia reporter viruses allowed us to monitor individual stages of the retrovirus life cycle including virus particle flow, virus entry into cells, infection and spread for retroorbital, subcutaneous and oral routes. BLI permitted temporal tracking of orally administered retroviruses along the gastrointestinal tract as they traversed the lumen through Peyers Patch to reach the draining mesenteric sac. Importantly, capture and acquisition of lymph-, blood- and milk-borne retroviruses spanning three routes, was promoted by a common host factor, the I-type lectin CD169, expressed on sentinel macrophages. These results highlight how retroviruses co-opt the immune surveillance function of tissue resident sentinel macrophages for establishing infection.",

    "abstract": "Heterotrophic microbes initiate organic matter degradation using extracellular enzymes. Our understanding of differences in microbial enzymatic capabilities, especially among particle-associated taxa and in the deep ocean, is limited by a paucity of hydrolytic enzyme activity measurements. Here, we measured the activities of a broad range of hydrolytic enzymes (glucosidases, peptidases, polysaccharide hydrolases) in epipelagic to bathypelagic bulk water (non-size fractionated), and on particles ([&ge;] 3 m) along a 9,800 km latitudinal transect from 30{degrees}S in the South Pacific to 59{degrees}N in the Bering Sea. Individual enzyme activities showed heterogeneous latitudinal and depth-related patterns, with varying biotic and abiotic correlates. With increasing latitude and decreasing temperature, lower laminarinase activities sharply contrasted with higher leucine aminopeptidase (leu-AMP) and chondroitin sulfate hydrolase activities in bulk water. Endopeptidases (chymotrypsins, trypsins) exhibited patchy spatial patterns, and their activities can exceed rates of the widely-measured exopeptidase, leu-AMP. Compared to bulk water, particle-associated enzymatic profiles featured a greater relative importance of endopeptidases, a broader spectrum of polysaccharide hydrolases, and latitudinal and depth-related trends that paralleled variations in particle fluxes. As water depth increased, enzymatic spectra on particles and in bulk water became narrower, and diverged more from one another. These distinct latitudinal and depth-related gradients of enzymatic activities underscore the biogeochemical consequences of emerging global patterns of microbial community structure and function, from surface to deep waters, and among particle-associated taxa.",

    "abstract": "Aspartic proteases (E.C.3.4.23.) are endopeptidases with molecular masses ranging between 30-45 kDa. They depend on aspartic acid residues for their catalytic activity and show maximal activity at low pH. Thus the main objective of the present study was to purify and characterize aspartic protease from locally identified fungi by solid-state fermentation. The aspartic protease in the current study was obtained from A. oryzae DRDFS13 under SSF. The crude enzyme extract was purified by size-exclusion (SEC) and ion-exchange (IEC) chromatography. The protein contents of crude enzyme and IEC fractions were determined by BCA methods while the presence of N-glycosylation was checked using Endo-H. Inhibition studies were conducted using protease inhibitors. The milk-clotting activity (MCA), protease activity (PA); molecular weight and enzyme kinetics were determined using standard methods. Optimum temperature and stability, optimum pH and stability, and the effect of cations on MCA were assessed using standard methods. The maximum MCA (477.11 U/mL) was recorded from IEC fraction A8. The highest specific activity (183.50 U/mg), purification fold (6.20) and yield (9.2%) were also obtained from the same fraction (IEC A8). The molecular weight of 40 kDa was assigned for the purified enzyme (IEC A8). However, its molecular weight was decreased to 30 KDa upon deglycosylation assay which infers that the protein is glycosylated. Incubation of the pure enzyme (IEC A8) with pepstatin A caused a 94 % inhibition on MCA. The dialyzed enzyme showed a Km and Vmax values of 17.50 mM and 1369 U, respectively. The enzyme showed maximum MCA at 60 {degrees}C and pH 5.0 with stability at pH 4.5-6.5 and temperature 35-45 {degrees}C. Most cat-ions stimulate the activity of the enzyme; moreover, the highest MCA was detected at 50 mM of MnSO4. Furthermore, the results obtained in the present study confirmed that the aspartic protease enzyme produced from A. oryzae DRDFS13 and purified in ion-exchange chromatography could be used as a substitute source of rennet enzyme for cheese production.\n\nImportanceThe production of pure aspartic protease enzyme from local microbes which is useful to substitute shortage of calf rennet enzyme and valuable to diversify cheese production throughout the world.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus is emerging as a cause of recalcitrant chronic pulmonary infections, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Biofilm formation has been implicated in the pathology of this organism, however the role of biofilm formation in infection is unclear. Two colony-variants of M. abscessus are routinely isolated from CF samples, smooth (MaSm) and rough (MaRg). These two variants display distinct colony morphologies due to the presence (MaSm) or absence (MaRg) of cell wall glycopeptidolipids (GPLs). We hypothesized that MaSm and MaRg variant biofilms might have different biophysical and mechanical properties, including stiffness, viscosity and elasticity. To test this hypothesis, we performed uniaxial mechanical indentation, and shear rheometry on MaSm and MaRg colony-biofilms. We identified that MaRg biofilms were significantly stiffer than MaSm under a normal force, while MaSm biofilms were more pliant compared to MaRg, under both normal and shear forces. Furthermore, using theoretical indices of mucociliary and cough clearence, we identified that M. abscessus biofilms may be more resistant to mechanical forms of clearance from the lung, compared to other common pulmonary pathogens, such as P. aeruginosa. Thus, the mechanical properties of M. abscessus biofilms may contribute to the persistent nature of pulmonary infections caused by this organism.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the distribution and mobility of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil bacteria from diverse ecological niches is critical in assessing their impacts on the global spread of antibiotic resistance. In permafrost associated soils, climate and human driven forces augment near-surface thaw altering the overlying active layer. Physiochemical changes shift bacterial community composition and metabolic functioning, however, it is unknown if permafrost thaw will affect ARGs comprising the boreal soil resistome. To assess how thaw shifts the resistome, we performed susceptibility testing and whole genome sequencing on soil isolates from a disturbance-induced thaw gradient in Interior Alaska. We found resistance was widespread in the Alaskan isolates, with 87% of the 90 isolates resistant to at least one of the five antibiotics. We also observed positive trends in both the proportion of resistant isolates and the abundance of ARGs with permafrost thaw. However, the number of ARGs per genome and types of genes present were shown to cluster more strongly by bacterial taxa rather than thaw emphasizing the evolutionary origins of resistance and the role vertical gene transfer has in shaping the predominantly chromosomally encoded ARGs. The observed higher proportion of plasmid-borne and distinct ARGs in our isolates compared to RefSoil+ suggests local conditions affect the composition of the resistome along with selection for ARG mobility. Overall taxonomy and geography shape the resistome, suggesting that as microbial communities shift in response to permafrost thaw so will the ARGs in the boreal active layer.\n\nIMPORTANCEAs antibiotic resistance continues to emerge and rapidly spread in clinical settings, it is imperative to generate studies that build insight into the ecology of environmental resistance genes that pose a threat to human health. This study provides insight into the occurrence of diverse ARGs found in Alaskan soil bacteria which is suggestive of the potential to compromise health. The observed differences in ARG abundance with increasing permafrost thaw suggest the role of soil disturbance in driving the distribution of resistant determinants and the predominant taxa that shape the resistome. Moreover, the high-quality whole genome assemblies generated in this study are an extensive resource for microbial researchers interested in permafrost thaw and will provide a steppingstone for future research into ARG mobility and transmission risks.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic and noncytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte responses are essential for the control of HIV infection. Understanding the mechanisms underlying HIV control in elite controllers (ECs), who do not progress to AIDS for many years without treatment, may facilitate the development of new effective therapeutic strategies.\n\nWe performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional profiles of CD8+ cells from ECs and treated and untreated progressors using an original pipeline. Cluster analysis enabled the identification of five distinct groups (EC groups 1-5) of ECs based on their transcription profiles. Profiles of EC groups 2-4 were associated with different numbers of differentially expressed genes, but the corresponding genes shared the same cellular processes. These three groups were associated with increased metabolism, survival, proliferation, and the absence of an \"exhausted\" phenotype of CD8+ lymphocytes, compared to untreated progressors. The transcriptional profiles of EC group 1 were opposite to those of EC groups 2-4 and similar to those of the treated progressors. This group may be associated with residual dysfunction of T lymphocytes. The EC group 5 was indistinguishable from normal. EC groups 1 and 5 can have mechanisms of nonprogression unrelated to CD8+ cells.\n\nThe transcription changes in CD8+ lymphocytes from ECs may be attributable to the receptors that modulate the functional states of CD8+ cells. We identified 22 receptors, which are potential master regulators and may be responsible for the observed expression changes of CD8+ cells in ECs. These receptors can be considered potential targets of therapeutic intervention, which may decelerate disease progression.\n\nIMPORTANCEA small group of HIV-infected individuals, known as elite controllers (ECs), do not develop AIDS for many years, despite being untreated. Understanding the mechanisms governing HIV control in ECs may help develop new effective therapeutic strategies. Since CD8+ T lymphocytes seem to play a significant role in HIV control, we analyzed the large number of transcriptional profiles in total CD8+ cells from ECs, treated, and untreated progressors. We found distinct groups of ECs, which may have different mechanisms governing HIV nonprogression, and we identified related pathways and cellular processes that are dissimilar from those in progressors. We also identified master regulators, key proteins in the signaling network that can be responsible for observed transcriptional changes in CD8+ cells from ECs and may be essential for disease nonprogression.

We applied this method to diverse inbred and wild house mouse (genus Mus) genomes and uncover pronounced variation in centromere architecture between strains and populations. We show that patterns of centromere diversity do not mirror the known ancestry of inbred strains, revealing a remarkably rapid rate of centromere sequence evolution. We document increased satellite homogeneity and copy number in inbred compared to wild mice, suggesting that inbreeding remodels mouse centromere architecture. Our results highlight the power of k-mer based approaches for probing variation across repetitive regions and provide the first in-depth, phylogenetic portrait of centromere variation across Mus musculus.",

Here, we used ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, thioflavin T binding, and transmission electron microscopy to show that the synthetic BAX 9 peptide (9p) forms amyloid aggregates in solution and on the surfaces of anionic small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). Its inherent amyloidogenicity was predicted by sequence analysis, and 2D IR spectra reveal that SUVs modulate the {beta}-sheet structures of the resulting amyloid species.

    "abstract": "The analysis of membrane protein topography using fast photochemical oxidation of protein (FPOP) has been reported in recent years, but still underrepresented in literature. Based on the hydroxyl radical reactivity of lipids and other amphiphiles, it is believed that the membrane environment acts as a hydroxyl radical scavenger decreasing effective hydroxyl radical doses and resulting in less observed oxidation of proteins. Here, we investigated the effect of bulk hydroxyl radical scavenging in FPOP using both isolated cellular membranes as well as detergent micelles. We found no significant change in radical scavenging activity upon the addition of disrupted cellular membranes with the membrane concentration in the range of 0-25600 cell/L using an inline radical dosimeter. We confirmed the non-scavenging nature of the membrane with the FPOP results of a soluble model protein in the presence of cell membranes, which showed no significant difference in oxidation with or without membranes. The use of detergents revealed that, while soluble detergent below the critical micelle concentration acts as a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger as expected, additional detergent has little to no hydroxyl radical scavenging effect once the critical micelle concentration is reached. These results suggest that any scavenging effect of membranes or organized amphiphilic membrane mimetics in FPOP experiments are not due to bulk hydroxyl radical scavenging, but may be due to a localized scavenging phenomenon.",

One essential goal of these computational models is the generalization to new sets of observations. Extracting parameters that can reliably predict out-of-sample data can be difficult, however. The use of prior distributions to regularize parameter estimates has been shown to help remedy this issue. While previous research has suggested that empirical priors estimated from a separate dataset improve predictive accuracy, this paper outlines an alternate method for the derivation of empirical priors: hierarchical Bayesian modeling. We provide a detailed introduction to this method, and show that using hierarchical models to simultaneously extract and impose empirical priors leads to better out-of-sample prediction while being more data efficient.",

Thus, the extent to which a neural systems size versus organization underlies complex abilities remains unclear. The marmoset monkey is evolutionarily peculiar: it has a small brain, yet many cortical areas. We used this natural experiment to test organization as source of high-level visual abilities independent of size, via large-scale psychophysics comparing marmosets to different species on identical tasks. Marmosets far out--performed rats--a marmoset-sized rodent--on a simple visual recognition task. On another visual task, which is difficult for both humans and machines, marmosets achieved high performance. Strikingly, their image-by-image behavior revealed that they did so in a manner highly similar to humans--marmosets were nearly as human-like as were macaques. These results suggest a key role for brain organization--not simply size--in the evolution of sophisticated abilities.",

    "abstract": "BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen, with over 80% of adults worldwide persistently infected. BKPyV infection is usually asymptomatic in healthy people; however, it causes polyomavirus-associated nephropathy in renal transplant patients and hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant patients. BKPyV has a circular, double-stranded DNA genome that is divided genetically into three parts: an early region, a late region, and a non-coding control region (NCCR). The NCCR contains the viral DNA replication origin and cis-acting elements regulating viral early and late gene expression. It was previously shown that a BKPyV miRNA expressed from the late strand regulates viral large T antigen expression and limits the replication capacity of archetype BKPyV. A major unanswered question in the field is how expression of the viral miRNA is regulated. Typically, miRNA is expressed from introns in cellular genes but there is no intron readily apparent in the BKPyV from which the miRNA could derive. Here we provide evidence for primary RNA transcripts that circle the genome more than once and include the NCCR. We identified splice junctions resulting from splicing of primary transcripts circling the genome more than once, and Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR products indicates that there are viral transcripts that circle the genome up to four times. Our data suggest that the miRNA is expressed from the intron of these greater-than-genome size primary transcripts.",

    "abstract": "In biofilms, bacteria are embedded within a matrix of extracellular DNA (e-DNA). Since bacterial cells and e-DNA are both negatively-charged, a positively-charged substance must act like a  glue to allow bacteria to be embedded within the DNA matrix. Here we show that HU (a highly-abundant, histone-like, nucleoid-associated, DNA-binding protein) facilitates bacterium-bacterium and bacterium-DNA interactions by binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial outer membrane component. We demonstrate that LPS binds to both the canonical and non-canonical DNA-binding sites on HU. We propose that the hexose sugar-terminal phosphate moieties present in the lipid A head-group of LPS bind to the same lysine/arginine residues that are involved in binding of the pentose sugar-phosphate groups in DNA. Alternate binding of LPS and DNA by HUs DNA-binding sites could allow HU to bind to bacterial cells surfaces and thus elicit bacterium-bacterium and bacterium-DNA interactions in biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria often live in diverse communities where the spatial arrangement of strains and species is considered critical for their ecology, including whether strains can coexist, which are ecologically dominant, and how productive they are as a community1,2. However, a test of the importance of spatial structure requires manipulation at the fine scales at which this structure naturally occurs3-8. Here we develop a droplet-based printing method to arrange different bacterial genotypes across a sub-millimetre array. We use this to test the importance of fine-scale spatial structure by printing strains of the gut bacterium Escherichia coli that naturally compete with one another using protein toxins9,10. This reveals that the spatial arrangement of bacterial genotypes is important for ecological outcomes. Toxin-producing strains largely eliminate susceptible non-producers when genotypes are well-mixed. However, printing strains side-by-side creates an ecological refuge such that susceptible strains can coexist with toxin producers, even to the extent that a susceptible strain outnumbers the toxin producer. Head-to-head competitions between toxin producers also reveals strong effects, where spatial structure can make the difference between one strain winning and mutual destruction. Finally, we print different potential barriers between two competing strains to understand why space is so important. This reveals the importance of processes that limit the free diffusion of molecules. Specifically, we show that cells closest to a toxin producer bind to and capture toxin molecules, which creates a refuge for their clonemates. Our work provides a new method to generate customised bacterial communities with defined spatial distributions, and reveals that micron-scale changes in these distributions can drive major shifts in their ecology.",

    "abstract": "Historically, AAV defective interfering particles (DI) were known as abnormal virions arising from natural replication and encapsidation errors. Through single virion genome analysis, we revealed that a major category of DI particles contains a double stranded DNA genome in a \"snapback\" configuration (SBG). The 5-SBGs include the P5 promoters and partial rep gene sequences. The 3-SBGs contains the capsid region. The molecular configuration of 5-SBGs allowed double stranded RNA transcription in their dimer configuration, which in turn regulate AAV rep expression and may improve AAV packaging. In contrast, 3-SBGs at its dimer configuration increased levels of cap protein. The generation and accumulation of 5-SBGs and 3-SBGs appears to be coordinated to balance the viral gene expression level. Therefore, the functions of 5-SBGs and 3-SBGs may help maximize the yield of AAV progenies. We postulate that AAV virus population behaved as a colony and utilizes its subgenomic particles to overcome the size limit of viral genome and encodes additional essential functions.",

    "abstract": "The impact of climate change on diversity, functioning and biogeography of marine plankton remains a major unresolved issue. Here, niche theory is applied to plankton metagenomes of 6 size fractions, from viruses to meso-zooplankton, sampled during the Tara Oceans expedition. Niches are used to derive plankton size-dependent structuring of the oceans south of 60{degrees}N in climato-genomic provinces characterized by signature genomes. By 2090, assuming the RCP8.5 high warming scenario, provinces would be reorganized over half of the considered ocean area and quasi-systematically displaced poleward. Particularly, tropical provinces would expand at the expense of temperate ones. Sea surface temperature is identified as the main driver of changes (50%) followed by phosphate (11%) and salinity (10%). Compositional shifts among key planktonic groups suggest impacts on the nitrogen and carbon cycles. Provinces are linked to estimates of carbon export fluxes which are projected to decrease on average by 4% in response to biogeographical restructuring.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic islet {beta}-cell dysfunction is characterized by defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and is a predominant component of the pathophysiology of diabetes. Imeglimin, a novel first-in-class small molecule tetrahydrotriazine drug candidate, improves glycemia and GSIS in preclinical models and clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, the mechanism by which it restores {beta}-cell function is unknown. Here, we show that Imeglimin acutely and directly amplifies GSIS in islets isolated from rodents with Type 2 diabetes via a mode of action that is distinct from other known therapeutic approaches. The underlying mechanism involves increases in the cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) pool - potentially via the salvage pathway and induction of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) along with augmentation of glucose-induced ATP levels. Further, additional results suggest that NAD+ conversion to a second messenger, cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), via cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase (CD38) is required for Imeglimins effects in islets, thus representing a potential link between increased NAD+ and enhanced glucose-induced Ca2+ mobilization which - in turn - is known to drive insulin granule exocytosis. Collectively, these findings implicate a novel mode of action for Imeglimin that explains its ability to effectively restore {beta}-cell function and provides for a new approach to treat patients suffering from Type 2 diabetes.",

The phenotype of AAS leaves were observed and measured. In parallel, the photosynthetic physiological parameters were determined under different photosynthetically active radiations (PAR). The results suggested that the length, width, area and thickness of AAS leaves were less than normal seedings. Likewise, the net photosynthetic rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of AAS leaves were not susceptible to PAR in contrast to normal individuals. Furthermore, the transcriptome sequencing technology was performed to clarify the expression of genes related to photosynthesis. It is as expected that numerous down-regulated genes were found in the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments, as well as the pathways of photosynthesis - antenna proteins, photoreaction and carbon fixation reaction of AAS leaves. Compared to other albino plants, AAS have a longer life span and more stable phenotypic traits with larger leaves, which could provide ideal materials for investigating photosynthesis of woody plants.",

    "abstract": "How organisms are able to maintain robust homeostasis has in recent years received increased attention by the use of combined control engineering and kinetic concepts, which led to the discovery of robust controller motifs. While these motifs employ kinetic conditions showing integral feedback and homeostasis for step-wise perturbations, the motifs performance differ significantly when exposing them to time dependent perturbations. One type of controller motifs which are able to handle exponentially and even hyperbolically growing perturbations are based on derepression. In these controllers the compensatory reaction, which neutralizes the perturbation, is derepressed, i.e. its reaction rate is increased by the decrease of an inhibitor acting on the compensatory flux. While controllers in this category can deal well with different time-dependent perturbations they have the disadvantage that they break down once the concentration of the regulatory inhibitor becomes too low and the compensatory flux has gained its maximum value. We wondered whether it would be possible to bypass this restriction, while still keeping the advantages of derepression kinetics. In this paper we show how the inclusion of multisite inhibition and the presence of positive feedback loops lead to an amplified controller which is still based on derepression kinetics but without showing the breakdown due to low inhibitor concentrations. By searching for the amplified feedback motif in natural systems, we found it as a part of the plant circadian clock where it is highly interlocked with other feedback loops.",

    "abstract": "A mild isolate of Papaya ringspot virus type-P, abbreviated as PRSV-mild, from Ecuador was sequenced and characterized. The most distinguishing symptom induced by PRSV-mild was gray powder-like leaf spots radiating from secondary veins. In greenhouse experiments, PRSV-mild did not confer durable protection against a severe isolate of the virus (PRSV-sev), obtained from the same field. Furthermore, isolate specific detection in cross-protected plants showed that PRSV-sev becomes dominant in infections, rendering PRSV-mild undetectable at 90 - 120 days post superinfection. Virus testing using isolate-specific primers detected PRSV-mild in two out of five surveyed provinces, with 10% and 48% of incidence in Santo Domingo and Los Rios, respectively. Comparative genomics showed that PRSV-mild lacks two amino acids from the coat protein region, whereas amino acid determinants for asymptomatic phenotypes were not identified. Recombination events were not predicted in the genomes of the Ecuadorean isolates. Phylogenetic analyses placed both PRSV-mild and PRSV-sev in a clade that includes an additional PRSV isolate from Ecuador and others from South America.",

Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of T. gondii infection in college students at Anhui province, China. Moreover, growing studies demonstrated the association between T. gondii infection and host behavioral changes. We also studied the linkage between T. gondii and scores of college students.\n\nMethods2704 serum samples of medical school students attending physical education lessons were collected from September 2017 to September 2019 and evaluated for T. gondii IgG antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also analysed PE scores of T. gondii infected students and T. gondii uninfected students.\n\nResultsThe overall seroprevalence of T. gondii was 11.5%. The main risk factors related to T. gondii infections were cat in the household and gardening or agriculture activity. Furthermore, in basketball group and football group, scores of T. gondii seropositive students were significantly higher than that of seronegative students, while in other sports there is no difference between scores of T. gondii infected students and T. gondii uninfected students.\n\nConclusionThis is the first report of T. gondii seroprevalence in college students in Anhui province, China.",
