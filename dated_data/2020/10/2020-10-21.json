    "abstract": "Post-translational modification of a protein with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a conserved mechanism exists in all eukaryotes. Thus far, more than 150 human GPI anchored proteins have been discovered and about 30 enzymes have been reported to be involved in the biosynthesis and maturation of mammalian GPI. Phosphatidylinositol glycan biosynthesis class A protein (PIGA) catalyzes the very first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis. Patients carrying a mutation of the PIGA gene usually suffer from intractable epilepsy and intellectual developmental disorder. We generated three mouse models with PIGA deficits specifically in telencephalon excitatory neurons (Ex-M-cko), inhibitory neurons (In-M-cko), or thalamic neurons (Th-H-cko), respectively. Both Ex-M-cko and In-M-cko mice showed impaired long-term fear memory and were more susceptible to kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. In addition, In-M-cko demonstrated a severe limb-clasping phenotype. Hippocampal synapse changes were observed in Ex-M-cko mice. Our Piga conditional knockout mouse models provide powerful tools to understand the cell-type specific mechanisms underlying inherited GPI deficiency and to test different therapeutic modalities.",

The results indicated that both strains of mice when infected with HN878 exhibited significant protection in their lungs with BCG doses at 3x105 - 3000 CFU (BALB/c) and 3x105-300 CFU (CB6F1). Whereas, both strains of mice when infected with H37Rv, significant protection was seen in BCG doses at 3x105 - 300 CFU. Immunological evaluation revealed interesting results; i) both strains of mice demonstrated a significant increase in the frequencies of BCG-specific IFN{gamma}+ IL2+ TNF+ CD4 T cells in the BCG doses at 3x105 - 3000 CFU (BALB/c) and 3x105 - 300 CFU (CB6F1); ii) secretion of IL2 and IFN{gamma} were correlated with the bacterial burden in the lungs of HN878 infected CB6F1 mice. The study demonstrated a BCG dose at 3000 CFU (an equivalent single human dose in the mice by body weight index) is protective in both strains of mice and the use of a virulent clinical isolate in testing new tuberculosis vaccine/advancing research is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Live attenuated malaria sporozoites are promising vaccine candidates, however, their efficacy critically depends on their capability to reach and infect the host liver. Administration via mosquito inoculation is by far the most potent method for inducing immunity, but highly unpractical. Here, we observed that intradermal syringe-injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (syrSPZ) were three-fold less efficient in migrating to and infecting mouse liver compared to mosquito-inoculated sporozoites (msqSPZ). This was related to a clustered dermal distribution (2-fold decreased median distance between syrSPZ vs msqSPZ) and, more importantly, a 1.4-fold significantly slower and more erratic movement pattern. These erratic movement patterns were likely caused by alteration of dermal tissue morphology (>15 m intercellular gaps) due to injection pressure and may critically decrease sporozoite infectivity. These results suggest that novel microvolume-based administration technologies hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live attenuated sporozoite vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The mucin Muc2 is a major constituent of the mucus layer that covers the intestinal epithelium and creates a barrier between epithelial cells and luminal commensal or pathogenic microorganisms. The Gram-positive food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes can cause enteritis and also disseminate from the intestine to give rise to systemic disease. L. monocytogenes can bind to intestinal Muc2, but the influence of the Muc2 mucin barrier on L. monocytogenes intestinal colonization and systemic dissemination has not been explored. Here, we used an orogastric L. monocytogenes infection model to investigate the role of Muc2 in host defense against L. monocytogenes. Compared to wild-type mice, we found that Muc2-/- mice exhibited heightened susceptibility to orogastric challenge with L. monocytogenes, with higher mortality, elevated colonic pathology, and increased pathogen burdens in both the intestinal tract and distal organs. In contrast, L. monocytogenes burdens were equivalent in wild-type and Muc2-/- animals when the pathogen was administered intraperitoneally, suggesting that systemic immune defects do not explain the heightened pathogen dissemination observed with oral infection route. Using a barcoded L. monocytogenes library to measure intra-host pathogen population dynamics, we found that Muc2-/- animals had larger pathogen founding population sizes in the intestine and distal sites than observed in wild-type animals. Comparisons of barcode frequencies revealed that, in the absence of Muc2, the colon becomes the major source for seeding the internal organs. Together, our findings reveal that Muc2 limits L. monocytogenes dissemination from the intestinal tract and modulates its population dynamics during infection.",

    "abstract": "The invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida has spread from northeastern Asia to temperate coastal environments worldwide, with profound effects on colonized ecosystems. In this work, we analyzed the effect of exudates from U. pinnatifida on the chemical and microbial properties of seawater from a semi-enclosed gulf from Atlantic Patagonia. Exudates of U. pinnatifida, consisting mainly of carbohydrates, were released at a rate of 1.6 {+/-} 0.8 mg C g-1 algae day-1, affecting the quality and optical properties of seawater in experimental incubations. Parallel factor analysis based on excitation-emission matrices collected from exudates revealed the presence of two humic-like and one non-humic fluorescent components. Exudate release stimulated microbial growth and polysaccharide degrading activity in seawater. After a 7-day incubation of fresh seawater with the exudates, changes in microbial community structure were analyzed by large-scale 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Copiotrophic and fermentative genera such as Spirochaeta (Spirochaetes) and Propionigenium (Fusobacteria) increased in the incubations with algal exudates. Genomic potential prediction revealed that the selected bacterial community could have higher ribosome content - an indicator of the potential for reaching higher metabolic rates - and genes for the degradation of complex organic compounds such as polysaccharides and other carbohydrates present in the exudates. Nutrient addition triggered the emergence of other microbial populations with different ecophysiological niches: unclassified Flavobacteriales, unclassified bacteria related to the recently described Phylum Kiritimatiellaeota, as well as potential pathogens such as Vibrio (Gammaproteobacteria) and Arcobacter (Epsilonproteobacteria), suggesting potential synergistic effects between invasive macroalgae and human activities.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are some of the most prominent organic contaminants in human blood. Although the toxicological implications from human exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are well established, data on lesser-understood PFAS are limited. New approach methodologies (NAMs) that apply bioinformatic tools to high-throughput data are being increasingly considered to inform risk assessment for data-poor chemicals. The aim of this investigation was to identify biological response potencies (i.e., benchmark concentrations: BMCs) following PFAS exposures to inform read-across for risk assessment of data-poor PFAS. Gene expression changes were measured in primary human liver cell microtissues (i.e., 3D spheroids) after 1-day and 10-day exposures to increasing concentrations of 23 PFAS. The cells were treated with four subgroups of PFAS: carboxylates (PFCAs), sulfonates (PFSAs), fluorotelomers, and sulfonamides. An established pipeline to identify differentially expressed genes and transcriptomic BMCs was applied. We found that both PFCAs and PFSAs exhibited a trend toward increased transcriptional changes with carbon chain-length. Specifically, longer-chain compounds (7 to 10 carbons) were more likely to induce changes in gene expression, and have lower transcriptional BMCs. The combined high-throughput transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses supports the capability of NAMs to efficiently assess the effects of PFAS in liver microtissues. The data enable potency ranking of PFAS for human liver cell spheroid cytotoxicity and transcriptional changes, and assessment of in vitro transcriptomic points of departure. These data improve our understanding of the health effects of PFAS and will be used to inform read-across for human health risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "In many bacteria and in eukaryotes, replication fork establishment requires the controlled loading of hexameric, ring-shaped helicases around DNA by AAA+ ATPases. How loading factors use ATP to control helicase deposition is poorly understood. Here, we dissect how specific ATPase elements of E. coli DnaC, an archetypal loader for the bacterial DnaB helicase, play distinct roles in helicase loading and the activation of DNA unwinding. We identify a new element, the arginine-coupler, which regulates the switch-like behavior of DnaC to prevent futile ATPase cycling and maintains loader responsiveness to replication restart systems. Our data help explain how the ATPase cycle of a AAA+-family helicase loader is channeled into productive action on its target; comparative studies indicate elements analogous to the Arg-coupler are present in related, switch-like AAA+ proteins that control replicative helicase loading in eukaryotes, as well as polymerase clamp loading and certain classes of DNA transposases.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications to tubulin are important for many microtubule-based functions inside cells. A recently identified tubulin modification, methylation, occurs on mitotic spindle microtubules during cell division, and is enzymatically added to tubulin by the histone methyltransferase SETD2. We used a truncated version of human SETD2 (tSETD2) containing the catalytic SET and C-terminal Set2 Rpb1 interacting (SRI) domains to investigate the biochemical mechanism of tubulin methylation. We found that recombinant tSETD2 has a higher activity towards tubulin dimers than polymerized microtubules. Using recombinant single-isotype tubulin, we demonstrate that methylation is restricted to lysine 40 (K40) of -tubulin. We then introduced pathogenic mutations into tSETD2 to probe the recognition of histone and tubulin substrates. A mutation in the catalytic domain, R1625C, bound to tubulin but could not methylate it whereas a mutation in the SRI domain, R2510H, caused loss of both tubulin binding and methylation. We thus further probed a role for the SRI domain in substrate binding and found that mutations within this region had differential effects on the ability of tSETD2 to bind to tubulin versus RNA Polymerase II substrates, suggesting distinct mechanisms for tubulin and histone methylation by SETD2. Lastly, we found that substrate recognition also requires the negatively-charged C-terminal tail of -tubulin. Together, this work provides a framework for understanding how SETD2 serves as a dual methyltransferase for histone and tubulin methylation.",

    "abstract": "The glioblastoma multiform has some properties including rapid growth, invasion, treatment resistance, and recurrence. Therefore, new therapies need to be developed that can be approved for using in patients. The previous study showed Arsenic Trioxide inhibits aggressive behavior in glioblastoma cells. Also, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate prevents cellular proliferation, and invasion in multiple glioma cells. Resveratrol decreases cellular proliferation, induces cell death, and impaired the invasiveness of glioma cells. Combination therapy to inhibit cancer cells may have important clinical implications. Therefore, to assess the combination therapy of 2M Arsenic trioxide, 100M EGCG, and 100M Resveratrol, we examined the metabolic activity, colony formation, media pH, cell proliferation, Caspase 3 activity, and gene expression analysis of BCL2, Caspase 3, MMP2, MMP9, CA9, u-PA, u-PAR, and Cathepsin B genes in apoptosis and invasion by both quantitative PCR experiments and Western blot assay. Systems biology tools also were used to obtain, the related network, involved pathways, and identifying the key genes in our selected criteria. The results of the study confirmed that the combined therapy prevents cell proliferation and induces of apoptosis in the Brain tumor cell lines including: U87-MG, A-172, and 1321N1. Furthermore, over-expression of caspase-3 and down-regulation of BCL-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 confirmed that combination therapy leads to induces apoptosis and decreases invasion. Nevertheless, the lowering of pharmacological doses and improving therapeutic efficacy through combination therapy may provide advantages to treat resistance cancer cells with lower side effects. Finally, the results might suggest new modality for Glioblastoma treatment.",

Hepatoblast deletion of Yap1 led to no impairment in Notch-driven SOX9+ ductal plate formation, but prevented the formation of the abutting second layer of SOX9+ ductal cells, blocking the formation of a patent intrahepatic biliary tree. Intriguingly, the mice survived for 8 months with severe cholestatic injury and without any hepatocyte-to-biliary transdifferentiation. Ductular reaction in the perihilar region suggested extrahepatic biliary proliferation likely seeking the missing intrahepatic biliary network. Long-term survival of these mice occurred through hepatocyte adaptation via reduced metabolic and synthetic function including altered bile acid metabolism and transport.

Therefore, we generated a co-culture of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons and human primary mesoangioblast-derived myotubes in microfluidic devices. A chemotactic and volumetric gradient facilitated the growth of motor neuron neurites through microgrooves resulting in the interaction with myotubes and the formation of NMJs. We observed that ALS-causing FUS mutations resulted in a reduced neurite outgrowth and in a decreased NMJ number.

    "abstract": "Sequential membrane filtration as a pre-processing step for the isolation of microorganisms could provide good quality and integrity DNA that can be preserved and kept at ambient temperatures before community profiling through culture-independent molecular techniques, e.g., 16s rDNA amplicon sequencing. Here, we assessed the impact of pre-processing sediment samples by sequential membrane filtration (from 10, 5 to 0.22 m pore size membrane filters) for 16s rDNA-based community profiling of sediment-associated microorganisms. Specifically, we examined if there would be method-driven differences between non- and pre-processed sediment samples regarding the quality and quantity of extracted DNA, PCR amplicon, resulting high-throughput sequencing reads, microbial diversity, and community composition. We found no significant difference in the quality and quantity of extracted DNA and PCR amplicons between the two methods. Although we found a significant difference in raw and quality-filtered reads, read abundance after bioinformatics processing (i.e., denoising and the chimeric-read filtering steps) were not significantly different. These results suggest that read abundance after these read processing steps were not influenced by sediment processing or lack thereof. Although the non- and pre-processed sediment samples had more unique than shared amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we report that their shared ASVs accounted for 74% of both methods absolute read abundance. More so at the genus level, the final collection filter identified most of the genera (95% of the reads) captured from the non-processed samples, with a total of 51 false-negative (2%) and 59 false-positive genera (3%). Accordingly, the diversity estimates and community composition were not significantly different between the non- and pre-processed samples. We demonstrate that while there were differences in shared and unique taxa, both methods revealed comparable microbial diversity and community composition. We also suggest the inclusion of sequential filters (i.e., pre- and mid-filters) in the community profiling, given the additional taxa not detected from the non-processed and the final collection filter. Our observations highlight the feasibility of pre-processing sediment samples for community analysis and the need to further assess sampling strategies to help conceptualize appropriate study designs for sediment-associated microbial community profiling.",

    "abstract": "Hunchback (Hb) is considered a context-dependent transcription factor, able to activate or repress different enhancers during Drosophila embryo segmentation. The mechanism driving the contextdependent activity of Hb is however not well understood. Here we measure the activity of a large set of 20 synthetic enhancers that we design to elucidate the effect of Hb binding sites in Drosophila segmentation. We obtain quantitative data on the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity of all synthetic enhancers in-vivo, by using a quantitative and sensitive reporter system we recently developed. Our data reveal the dual role of Hb binding sites in segmentation enhancers: on the one hand, Hb act as a typical short range repressor by binding to its cognate sequences; on the other hand, we report a novel effect of a sequence containing multiple Hb binding sites, which is able to increase enhancer activity independently from Hb binding. This sequence, which contains multiple Poly-dA stretches, increases the activity of enhancers driven by different activators, possibly by disfavoring nucleosome occupancy.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe control of gene expression is a fundamental process that allows cells to respond to external stimuli and take on various identities in complex organisms. Enhancers are DNA sequences that play a key role in this process. In the simplest model of an enhancer, small parts of its sequence can be specifically bound by proteins called transcription factors and the occupancy pattern of these proteins on the enhancer determines the expression level of a specific gene. In this research work we have studied enhancers in the context of the development of a fruit fly embryo. We have built synthetic enhancer sequences containing binding sites for a few specific factors and measured their activity in living embryos using fluorescence microscopy. Our results revealed that binding sites for a particular protein, Hunchback, are able to influence the activity of the enhancer even independently from Hunchback binding to them. This discovery might help to explain the complex effects that have been observed when studying Hunchback binding sites in natural enhancers.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of PINK1 cause early-onset Parkinsons disease (PD) with selective neurodegeneration in humans. However,current PINK1 knockout mouse and pig models are unable to recapitulate the typical neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in PD patients, indicating that it is essential to generate PINK1 disease models in non-human primates (NHPs) that are highly close to humans, to investigate the unique function of PINK1 in primate brains. Paired single guide RNA (sgRNA)/Cas9-D10A nickases and truncated sgRNA/Cas9, both enabling the reduction of the off-target effect without apparently compromising the on-target editing, are two optimized strategies in applying the CRISPR/Cas9 system to establish disease animal models. Here, we combined the two strategies and injected Cas9-D10A mRNA and two truncated sgRNAs into one-cell-stage cynomolgus zygotes to target PINK1 gene. We show precise and efficient gene editing of the target site in the three new born cynomolgus monkeys. The frame shift mutations of PINK1 in mutant fibroblasts leaded to the reduction of the mRNA, However, western-blot and immunofluorescencestaining confirmed the PINK1 proteinlevels werecomparable to that in the wild-type fibroblasts. We further reprogramed mutant fibroblast into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and they show similar ability of differentiation into dopamine (DA) neurons. Taken together, our results showed that coinjection of Cas9-D10A nickase mRNA and sgRNA into one-cell-stage cynomolgus embryos enable the generation of human disease models in NHPs and the target editing by paired truncated sgRNA/Cas9-D10A in PINK1 gene exon 2 did not impact the protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian Randomization (MR) exploits genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of an \"exposure\" trait on an \"outcome\" trait from observational data. However, the validity of such studies is threatened by population stratification, batch effects, and horizontal pleiotropy. Although a variety of methods have been proposed to partially mitigate those problems, residual biases may still remain, leading to highly statistically significant false positives in large genetic databases. Here, we describe a suite of sensitivity analysis tools for MR that enables investigators to properly quantify the robustness of their findings against these (and other) unobserved validity threats. Specifically, we propose the routine reporting of sensitivity statistics that can be used to readily quantify the robustness of a MR result: (i) the partial R2 of the genetic instrument with the exposure and the outcome traits; and, (ii) the robustness value of both genetic associations. These statistics quantify the minimal strength of violations of the MR assumptions that would be necessary to explain away the MR causal effect estimate. We also provide intuitive displays to visualize the sensitivity of the MR estimate to any degree of violation, and formal methods to bound the worst-case bias caused by violations in terms of multiples of the observed strength of principal components, batch effects, as well as putative pleiotropic pathways. We demonstrate how these tools can aid researchers in distinguishing robust from fragile findings, by showing that the MR estimate of the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on diastolic blood pressure is relatively robust, whereas the MR estimate of the causal effect of BMI on Townsend deprivation index is relatively fragile.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have altered gait variability from the first step they take, well before the onset of claudication pain. The mechanisms underlying these gait alterations are poorly understood.\n\nAimsThis study sought to isolate the effect of reduced blood flow on gait variability by comparing healthy older controls and patients with PAD. We also determined the diagnostic value of gait variability parameters to identify the presence of PAD.\n\nMethodsThirty healthy older controls and thirty patients with PAD walked on a treadmill at their self-selected speed in rested (normal walking for controls; pain free for PAD) and reduced blood flow (post vascular occlusion with thigh tourniquet for controls; pain for PAD) conditions. Gait variability was assessed using the largest Lyapunov exponent, approximate entropy, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of ankle, knee, and hip joints range of motion. Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses of the rested condition were performed to determine the optimal cut-off values for separating individuals with PAD from those without PAD.\n\nResults and DiscussionPatients with PAD have increased amount of variability for knee and hip ranges of motion compared with healthy older group. Comparing for conditions, reduced blood flow demonstrated increased amount of variability compared with rested blood flow. Significant interactions between group and condition occurred at the ankle for Lyapunov exponent, approximate entropy, and coefficient of variation. A combination of gait variability parameters correctly identifies PAD disease 70% of the time or more.\n\nConclusionsGait variability is affected both by PAD and by the mechanical induction of reduced blood flow.",

    "abstract": "The discovery and development of novel pharmaceuticals is an area of active research mainly due to the large investments required and long payback times. As of 2016, the development of a novel drug candidate required up to $ USD 2.6 billion in investment for only 10% rate of approval by the FDA. To help decreasing the costs associated with the process, a number of in silico approaches have been developed with relatively low success due to limited predicting performance. Here, we introduced a machine learning-based algorithm as an alternative for a more accurate search of new pharmacological candidates, which takes advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for active molecule prediction within large databases. Our approach, termed PharmaNet was implemented here to search for ligands against specific cell receptors within 102 targets of the DUD-E database, which contains 22886 active molecules. PharmaNet comprises three main phases. First, a SMILES representation of the molecule is converted into a raw molecular image. Second, a convolutional encoder processes the data to obtain a fingerprint molecular image that is finally analyzed by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This approach enables precise predictions of the molecules target on the basis of the feature extraction, the sequence analysis and the relevant information filtered out throughout the process. Molecule Target prediction is a highly unbalanced detection problem and therefore, we propose that an adequate evaluation metric of performance is the area under the Normalized Average Precision (NAP) curve. PharmaNet largely surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method with 97.7% in the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and 65.5% in the NAP curve. We obtained a perfect performance for human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is a potential target for antimicrobial and anticancer treatments. We decided to test PharmaNet for activity prediction against FPPS by searching in the CHEMBL data set. We obtained three (3) potential inhibitors that were further validated through both molecular docking and in silico toxicity prediction. Most importantly, one of this candidates, CHEMBL2007613, was predicted as a potential antiviral due to its involvement on the PCDH17 pathway, which has been reported to be related to viral infections.",

We did a side-by-side comparison of the performances of Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue (BT) and ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep (ZB) kits. In general, samples extracted with the BT kit yielded higher concentrations of total DNA while those extracted with the ZB kit contained higher numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies per unit volume. Therefore, the samples were normalized to equal amounts of 16S rRNA gene copies prior to sequencing. For each sample type, all predominant taxa detected in samples extracted with one kit were present in replicate samples extracted with the other kit and did not show significant differences at the class level. Furthermore, between-kit differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics were statistically indistinguishable. Therefore, both kits perform similarly with regard to 16S rRNA gene-based poultry microbiome analysis.",

After successful transfection of these shRNA molecules into the chicken embryonic hepatocyte culture, expression of the target genes were monitored by real time PCR. Significant reduction (P<0.05) in the expression of SCD and SREBP1 genes with minimal activation of immune response genes in hepatocytes was observed after transfecting the shRNA molecules into them. The shRNA constructs against SCD gene showed the knock down efficiency ranged from 20.4% to 74.2%. In case of shRNA constructs against SREBP1 gene, they showed knock down efficiency ranging from 26.8% to 95.85%. These results clearly demonstrated the successful down regulation of the gene expression by designed shRNA molecules against both the target genes under in vitro condition. The shRNA2 molecule for SCD gene and the shRNA1 molecule for SREBP1 gene were found as the best among all the shRNA molecules used for silencing the target genes under cell culture system.

The EVQuant assay can detect individual immobilized EVs as small as 35 nm and determine their concentration in biofluids without extensive EV isolation or purification procedures. It can also identify specific EV subpopulations based on combinations of biomarkers and is used here to identify prostate-derived urinary EVs as CD9-/CD63+. Moreover, characterization of individual EVs allows analysis of their size distribution.

Static electron micrographs suggest a structural transition of straight protofilaments into curved ones occurring at the tips of disassembling microtubules. However, these structural transitions have never been observed and the process of microtubule disassembly thus remains unclear. Here, a label-free optical microscopy capable of selective imaging of the transient structural changes of protofilaments at the tip of a disassembling microtubule is introduced. Upon induced disassembly, the transition of ordered protofilaments into a disordered conformation is resolved at the tip of the microtubule. Imaging the unbinding of individual tubulin oligomers from the microtubule tip reveals transient pauses and relapses in the disassembly, concurrent with enrichment of ordered protofilament segments at the microtubule tip. These findings show that microtubule disassembly is a discrete process and suggest a mechanism of switching from the disassembly to the assembly phase.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the function of the nervous system necessitates mapping the spatial distributions of its constituent cells defined by function, anatomy or gene expression. Recently, developments in tissue preparation and microscopy allow cellular populations to be imaged throughout the entire rodent brain. How-ever, mapping these neurons manually is prone to bias and is often impractically time consuming. Here we present an opensource algorithm for fully automated 3D detection of neuronal somata in mouse whole-brain microscopy images using standard desktop computer hardware. We demonstrate the applicability and power of our approach by mapping the brain-wide locations of large populations of cells labeled with cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins expressed via retrograde trans-synaptic viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Structural neural changes following concussion are often not captured by standard imaging techniques. However, there is growing evidence that damage to white matter tracts and change in functional network connectivity may be observed following concussive injury. We investigated behavioural performance on a cognitive-motor integration (CMI) task in conjunction with alterations in resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in brain networks in a population of 30 female varsity athletes, with 16 having a previous history of concussion. Behavioural performance on accuracy, timing, and trajectory measures of a CMI task were assessed between the concussion history group and the control group. Rs-FC within the nodes of the Default Mode Network (DMN), Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), the Frontoparietal Network, and the Anterior Cerebellar Lobule Network, was assessed against performance scores on accuracy, timing, and trajectory measures. Main findings indicate no difference in behavioural performance between those with concussion history and those without, in contrast to previous findings in a group of primarily male varsity athletes. In addition, no difference in rs-FC was noted in correlation with behavioural performance scores on either accuracy, timing, or trajectory. These findings may suggest sex-related differences in performance on a CMI task, and a resiliency in both functional network connectivity and visuomotor skilled performance in varsity female athletes.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMolecular tip-dating of phylogenetic trees is a growing discipline that uses DNA sequences sampled at different points in time to co-estimate the timing of evolutionary events with rates of molecular evolution. Such inferences should only be performed when there is sufficient temporal signal within the analysed dataset. Hence, it is important for researchers to be able to test their dataset for the amount and consistency of temporal signal prior to any tip-dating inference. For this purpose, the most popular method considered to-date has been the \"root-to-tip regression\" which consist in fitting a linear regression of the number of substitutions accumulated from the root to the tips of a phylogenetic tree as a function of sampling times. The main limitation of the regression method, in its current implementation, relies in the fact that the temporal signal can only be tested at the whole-tree evolutionary scale.\nC_LIO_LITo fill this methodological gap, we introduce phylostems, a new graphical and user-friendly tool developed to investigate temporal signal at every evolutionary scale of a phylogenetic tree.\nC_LIO_LIPhylostems allows detecting without a priori whether any subset of a tree would contain sufficient temporal signal for tip-based inference to be performed. We provide a \"how to\" guide by running phylostems on empirical datasets and supply guidance for results interpretation. Phylostems is freely available at https://pvbmt-apps.cirad.fr/apps/phylostems.\nC_LIO_LIConsidering the impressive increase in availability and use of heterochronous datasets, we hope the new functionality provided by phylostems will help biologists to perform thorough tip-dating inferences.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Dolichols (Dols), ubiquitous components of living organisms, are indispensable for cell survival. In plants, as well as other eukaryotes, Dols are crucial for posttranslational protein glycosylation, aberration of which leads to fatal metabolic disorders in humans. Until now, the regulatory mechanisms underlying Dol accumulation remain elusive. In this report, we have analyzed the natural variation of the accumulation of Dols and six other isoprenoids between 120 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Subsequently, by combining QTL and GWAS approaches, we have identified several candidate genes involved in the accumulation of Dols, polyprenols, plastoquinone, and phytosterols. The role of two genes implicated in the accumulation of major Dols in Arabidopsis - the AT2G17570 gene encoding a long searched for cis-prenyltransferase (CPT3) and the AT1G52460 gene encoding an alpha-beta hydrolase (ABH) - is experimentally confirmed. These data will help to generate Dol-enriched plants which might serve as a remedy for Dol-deficiency in humans.",

    "abstract": "DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) is known as the major DNA ligase responsible for Okazaki fragment joining. Recent studies have implicated LIG3 complexed with XRCC1 as an alternative player in Okazaki fragment joining in cases where LIG1 is not functional, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, using a cell-free system derived from Xenopus egg extracts, we demonstrated the essential role of PARP1-HPF1 in LIG3-dependent Okazaki fragment joining. We found that Okazaki fragments were eventually ligated even in the absence of LIG1, employing in its place LIG3-XRCC1 which was recruited onto chromatins. Concomitantly, LIG1 deficiency induces ADP-ribosylation of histone H3 in a PARP1-HPF1-dependent manner. The depletion of PARP1 or HPF1 resulted in a failure to recruit LIG3 onto chromatin and a subsequent failure in Okazaki fragment joining in LIG1-depleted extracts. Importantly, Okazaki fragments were not ligated at all when LIG1 and XRCC1 were co-depleted. Our results suggest that a unique form of ADP-ribosylation signalling promotes the recruitment of LIG3 on chromatins and its mediation of Okazaki fragment joining as a backup system for LIG1 perturbation.",
