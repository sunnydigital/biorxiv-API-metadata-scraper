    "abstract": "Scene-selective regions of the human brain form allocentric representations of locations in our environment. These representations are independent of heading direction and allow us to know where we are regardless of our direction of travel. However, we know little about how these location-based representations are formed. Using fMRI representational similarity analysis and linear mixed-models, we tracked the emergence of location-based representations in scene-selective brain regions. We estimated patterns of activity for two distinct scenes, taken before and after participants learnt they were from the same location. During a learning phase, we presented participants with two types of panoramic videos: (1) an overlap video condition displaying two distinct scenes (0{degrees} and 180{degrees}) from the same location, and (2) a no-overlap video displaying two distinct scenes from different locations (that served as a control condition). In the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), representations of scenes from the same location became more similar to each other only after they had been shown in the overlap condition, suggesting the emergence of viewpoint-independent location-based representations. Whereas these representations emerged in the PHC regardless of task performance, RSC representations only emerged for locations where participants could behaviourally identify the two scenes as belonging to the same location. The results suggest that we can track the emergence of location-based representations in the PHC and RSC in a single fMRI experiment. Further, they support computational models that propose the RSC plays a key role in transforming viewpoint-independent representations into behaviourally-relevant representations of specific viewpoints.",

    "abstract": "Abstract cis and/or trans regulatory divergence within or between related taxa on a genome-wide scale has been largely unexamined in crops, more so, the effect of stress on cis/trans architecture. In this study, the indica genotypes IR64, an elite drought-susceptible lowland variety, and Apo (IR55423-01 or NSIC RC9), a moderate drought-tolerant upland genotype together with their hybrid (IR64 x Apo) were exposed to non- and water-stress conditions. Evidence of cis and/or trans regulatory differences was tested between these two indica rice genotypes. By sequencing (RNA-seq) the parents and their hybrid, we are able to map genes diverging in cis and/or trans factors between the two genotypes. Under non-stress conditions, cis dominantly explains (11.2%) regulatory differences, followed by trans (8.9%). Further analysis showed that water-limiting conditions largely affect trans and cis + trans factors. Between the two inbred lines, Apo appears to exhibit higher expression fold change of genes enriched in \"response to stress\" and \"photosynthesis\" under non- and water-stress conditions. On the molecular level, cis and/or trans regulatory divergence explains their genotypic differences and differential drought response. Parent-hybrid RNA-seq has the potential to identify genes diverging in cis and/or trans factors even between intra-sub-specifically related genotypes. By comparing cis/trans landscape under stressed and unstressed conditions, this approach has the ability to assess the impact of drought on gene expression. Computational analysis and association of several drought-yield QTL markers with cis-diverging genes provide converging evidences suggestive of a potential approach to identify trait-associated candidate genes using hybrids and their parents alone.\n\nKey Messagecis dominantly explains divergence of two indica rice genotypes, IR64 and Apo under normal conditions while trans and cis + trans regulatory factors are largely affected by drought",

    "abstract": "Individual animals perform tasks in different ways, yet the nature and origin of that variability is poorly understood. In the context of spatial memory tasks, variability is often interpreted as resulting from differences in memory ability, but the validity of this interpretation is seldom tested since we lack a systematic approach for identifying and understanding factors that make one animals behavior different than another. Here we identify such factors in the context of spatial alternation in rats, a task often described as relying solely on memory of past choices. We combine hypothesis-driven behavioral design and reinforcement learning modeling to identify spatial preferences that, when combined with memory, support learning of a spatial alternation task. Identifying these preferences allows us to capture differences among animals, including differences in overall learning ability. Our results show that to understand the complexity of behavior requires quantitative accounts of the preferences of each animal.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors that contain a homeodomain DNA-binding domain have crucial functions in most aspects of cellular function and embryonic development in both animals and plants. Hmx proteins are a sub-family of NK homeodomain-containing proteins that have fundamental roles in development of sensory structures such as the eye and the ear. However, Hmx functions in spinal cord development have not been analyzed. Here we show that zebrafish (Danio rerio) hmx2 and hmx3a are co-expressed in spinal dI2 and V1 interneurons, whereas hmx3b, hmx1 and hmx4 are not expressed in spinal cord. Using mutational analyses, we demonstrate that, in addition to its previously reported role in ear development, hmx3a is required for correct specification of a subset of spinal interneuron neurotransmitter phenotypes, as well as correct lateral line progression and survival to adulthood. Surprisingly, despite similar expression patterns of hmx2 and hmx3a during embryonic development, zebrafish hmx2 mutants are viable and have no obviously abnormal phenotypes in sensory structures or neurons that require hmx3a. In addition, embryos homozygous for deletions of both hmx2 and hmx3a have identical phenotypes to severe hmx3a single mutants. However, mutating hmx2 in hypomorphic hmx3a mutants that usually develop normally, results in abnormal ear and lateral line phenotypes. This suggests that while hmx2 cannot compensate for loss of hmx3a, it does function in these developmental processes, although to a much lesser extent than hmx3a. More surprisingly, our mutational analyses suggest that Hmx3a may not require its homeodomain DNA-binding domain for its roles in viability or embryonic development.",

This approach enables many benefits including reduced phototoxicity, freeing up of fluorescence channels, simplified sample preparation, and the ability to re-process legacy data for new insights. However, FRM can be complex to implement, and current FRM benchmarks are abstractions that are difficult to relate to how valuable or trustworthy a reconstruction is. Here, we relate the conventional benchmarks and demonstrations to practical and familiar cell biology analyses to demonstrate that FRM should be judged in context. We further demonstrate that it performs remarkably well even with lower-magnification microscopy data, as are often collected in screening and high content imaging.

    "abstract": "Spiking information of individual neurons is essential for functional and behavioral analysis in neuroscience research. Calcium imaging techniques are generally employed to obtain activities of neuronal populations. However, these techniques result in slowly-varying fluorescence signals with low temporal resolution. Estimating the temporal positions of the neuronal action potentials from these signals is a challenging problem. In the literature, several generative model-based and data-driven algorithms have been studied with varied levels of success. This article proposes a neural network-based signal-to-signal conversion approach, where it takes as input raw-fluorescence signal and learns to estimate the spike information in an end-to-end fashion. Theoretically, the proposed approach formulates the spike estimation as a single channel source separation problem with unknown mixing conditions. The source corresponding to the action potentials at a lower resolution is estimated at the output. Experimental studies on the spikefinder challenge dataset show that the proposed signal-to-signal conversion approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art-methods in terms of Pearsons correlation coefficient and Spearmans rank correlation coefficient and yields comparable performance for the area under the receiver operating characteristics measure. We also show that the resulting system: (a) has low complexity with respect to existing supervised approaches and is reproducible; (b) is layer-wise interpretable; and (c) has the capability to generalize across different calcium indicators.\n\nAuthor summaryInformation processing by a population of neurons is studied using two-photon calcium imaging techniques. A neuronal spike results in an increased intracellular calcium concentration. Fluorescent calcium indicators change their brightness upon a change in the calcium concentration, and this change is captured in the imaging technique. The task of estimating the actual spike positions from the brightness variations is formally referred to as spike estimation. Several signal processing and machine learning-based algorithms have been proposed in the past to solve this problem. However, the task is still far from being solved. Here we present a novel neural network-based data-driven algorithm for spike estimation. Our method takes the fluorescence recording as the input and synthesizes the spike information signal, which is well-correlated with the actual spike positions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard evaluation framework. We further analyze different components of the model and discuss its benefits.",

Using machine learning models trained on microbiome data, we predict human traits with high accuracy across continents. Subsampling our cohort to smaller cohort sizes yielded highly variable models and thus sensitivity to the selected cohort, underscoring the utility of large cohorts and possibly explaining the source of discrepancies across studies.

    "abstract": "Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a poxvirus that causes severe disease in cattle, has in the last few years rapidly extended its distribution from Africa and the Middle East into Europe, Russia, and across Asia. LSDV is believed to be primarily spread mechanically by blood-feeding arthropods, however the exact mode of arthropod transmission, the relative ability of different arthropod species to acquire and retain the virus, as well as their comparative importance for LSDV transmission, remain poorly characterised. Since the vector-borne nature of LSDV transmission is believed to have enabled the rapid geographic expansion of this virus, the lack of quantitative evidence on LSDV transmission has impeded effective control of the disease during the current epidemic. Obtaining high quality data on virus transmission by arthropods is challenging, and practical limitations often result in inadequate arthropod numbers or model hosts, limiting the transferability of experimental findings to the natural transmission scenario.\n\nWe have addressed these limitations in this study. Using a highly representative bovine experimental model of lumpy skin disease we allowed four representative vector species (Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Stomoxys calcitrans and Culicoides nubeculosus) to blood-feed on LSDV-inoculated cattle in order to examine the acquisition and retention of LSDV by these species in unprecedented detail. We found the probability of LSDV transmission from clinical cattle to vector correlated with disease severity. Subclinical disease was more common than clinical disease in the inoculated cattle, however the probability of vectors acquiring LSDV from subclinical animals was very low.\n\nAll four potential vector species studied had a similar rate of acquisition of LSDV after feeding on the host, but Aedes aegypti and Stomoxys calcitrans retained the virus for a longer time, up to 8 days. There was no evidence of virus replication in the vector, consistent with mechanical rather than biological transmission. The parameters obtained in the in-vivo transmission experiments subsequently enabled enhanced modelling approaches to determine the basic reproduction number of LSDV in cattle mediated by each of the insect species. This was highest for Stomoxys calcitrans (19.1), C. nubeculosus (7.4), and Ae. aegypti (2.4), surprisingly indicating these three species are all potentially efficient transmitters of LSDV. These results reveal that currently applied LSDV control measures such as stamping out of all cattle on affected premises or insect control measures targeting single species need to be urgently reconsidered. Overall our studies have highlighted that the combination of highly relevant in-vivo experiments and mathematical modelling can be directly applied to devise evidence-based proportionate and targeted control programmes.",

When required to choose between two snacks, each differing in two attributes (pleasure and nutrition), peoples assessments of value shifted from pre- to post-choice in the direction that spread the alternatives further apart so as to favor the winner, thereby increasing confidence in the choice. This shift was observed not only for ratings of overall value, but also for each of the two individual attributes. The magnitude of the coherence shift increased with choice difficulty as measured by the difference in initial ratings of overall value for the two options, as well as with a measure of attribute disparity (the degree to which individual attributes \"disagree\" with one another as to which option is superior). In Experiments 2-5, tasks other than explicit choice generated the same qualitative pattern of value changes, confidence, and response time. These findings support the hypothesis that active consideration of options, whether or not explicitly related to value, automatically refines the mental value representations for the options, which in turn allows them to be more precisely distinguished when later included in a value-based choice set.",

    "abstract": "Gardnerella spp. are considered a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis, a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome. There are four cpn60 sequence-based subgroups within the genus (A, B, C, and D), and thirteen genome species have been defined recently. Gardnerella spp. co-occur in the vaginal microbiome with varying abundance, and these patterns are shaped by a resource-dependent, exploitative competition, which affects the growth rate of subgroup A, B, and C negatively. The growth rate of rarely abundant subgroup D, however, increases with the increasing number of competitors, negatively affecting the growth rate of others. We hypothesized that a nutritional generalist lifestyle and minimal niche overlap with the other, more abundant Gardnerella spp. facilitate the maintenance of subgroup D in the vaginal microbiome through negative-frequency dependent selection. Using 40 whole genome sequences from isolates representing all four subgroups we found that they could be distinguished based on content of their predicted proteomes. Proteins associated with carbohydrate and amino acid uptake and metabolism were significant contributors to the separation of subgroups. Subgroup D isolates had significantly more of their proteins assigned to amino acid metabolism than the other subgroups. Subgroup D isolates were also significantly different from others in terms of number and type of carbon sources utilized in a phenotypic assay, while the other three could not be distinguished. Overall, the results suggest that a generalist lifestyle and lack of niche overlap with other Gardnerella spp. leads to subgroup D being favoured by negative-frequency dependent selection in the vaginal microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a satellite virus that requires hepadnavirus envelope proteins for its transmission. Although recent studies identified HDV-related deltaviruses in certain animals, the evolution of deltaviruses, such as the origin of HDV and the mechanism of its coevolution with its helper viruses, is unknown, mainly because of the phylogenetic gaps among deltaviruses. Here we identified novel deltaviruses of passerine birds, woodchucks, and white-tailed deer by extensive database searches and molecular surveillance. Phylogenetic and molecular epidemiological analyses suggest that HDV originated from mammalian deltaviruses and the past interspecies transmission of mammalian and passerine deltaviruses. Further, metaviromic and experimental analyses suggest that the satellite-helper relationship between HDV and hepadnavirus was established after the divergence of the HDV lineage from non-HDV mammalian deltaviruses. Our findings enhance our understanding of deltavirus evolution, diversity, and transmission, indicating the importance of further surveillance for deltaviruses.",

    "abstract": "BOLD fMRI studies have provided compelling evidence that the human brain demonstrates substantial moment-to-moment fluctuations in both activity and functional connectivity patterns. While the role of brain signal variability in fostering cognitive adaptation to ongoing environmental demands is well-documented, the relevance of moment-to-moment changes in functional brain architecture is still debated. To probe the role of architectural variability in naturalistic information processing, we used neuroimaging and behavioural data collected during movie watching by the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (N = 642, 326 women) and the Human Connectome Project (N = 176, 106 women). Both moment-to-moment and contextual change-evoked architectural variability increased from young to older adulthood. However, coupling between moment-to-moment changes in functional brain architecture and concrete environmental features was stronger at younger ages. Architectural variability (both momentary and context-evoked) was associated with age-distinct profiles of network communication, specifically, greater functional integration of the default mode network in older adulthood, but greater informational flow across neural networks implicated in environmentally driven attention and control (cingulo-opercular, salience, ventral attention) in younger adulthood. Whole-brain communication pathways anchored in default mode regions relevant to episodic and semantic context creation (i.e., angular and middle temporal gyri) contributed to greater brain reconfiguration in response to narrative context changes, as well as stronger coupling between moment-to-moment changes in functional brain architecture and changes in concrete environmental features. Cognitive adaptation was directly linked to levels of brain-environment alignment, but only indirectly associated with levels of architectural variability. Specifically, stronger coupling between moment-to-moment variability in brain architecture and concrete environmental features predicted poorer cognitive adaptation (i.e., fluid IQ) and greater affectively driven environmental vigilance. Complementarily, across the adult lifespan, higher fluid (but not crystallized) IQ was related to stronger expression of the network communication profile underlying momentary and context-based architectural variability during youth. Our results indicate that the adaptiveness of dynamic brain reconfiguration during naturalistic information processing changes across the lifespan due to the associated network communication profiles. Moreover, our findings on brain-environment alignment complement the existing literature on the beneficial consequences of modulating brain signal variability in response to environmental complexity. Specifically, they imply that coupling between moment-to-moment variability in functional brain architecture and concrete environmental features may index a bias towards perceptually-bound, rather than conceptual processing, which hinders affective functioning and strategic engagement with the external environment.",

    "abstract": "Bones in the vertebrate cranial base and limb skeleton grow by endochondral ossification, under the control of growth plates. Mechanisms of endochondral ossification are conserved across growth plates, which increases covariation in size and shape among bones, and in turn may lead to correlated changes in skeletal traits not under direct selection. We used micro-CT and geometric morphometrics to characterize shape changes in the cranium of the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for longer tibiae. We show that Longshanks skulls became longer, flatter, and narrower in a stepwise process. Moreover, we show that these morphological changes likely resulted from developmental changes in the growth plates of the Longshanks cranial base, mirroring changes observed in its tibia. Thus, indirect and non-adaptive morphological changes can occur due to developmental overlap among distant skeletal elements, with important implications for interpreting the evolutionary history of vertebrate skeletal form.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), applied to two brain sites with different phase lags, has been shown to modulate stimulation-outlasting functional EEG connectivity between the targeted regions. Given the lack of knowledge on mechanisms of tACS aftereffects, it is difficult to further enhance effect sizes and reduce variability in experiments. In this computational study, we tested if spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can explain stimulation-outlasting connectivity modulation by dual-site tACS and explored the effects of tACS parameter choices. Two populations of spiking neurons were coupled with synapses subject to STDP, and results were validated via a re-analysis of EEG data. Our simulations showed stimulation-outlasting connectivity changes between in- and anti-phase tACS, dependent on both tACS frequency and synaptic conduction delays. Importantly, both a simple network entraining to a wide range of tACS frequencies as well as a more realistic network that spontaneously oscillated at alpha frequency predicted that the largest effects would occur for short conduction delays between the stimulated regions. This finding agreed with experimental EEG connectivity modulation by 10 Hz tACS, showing a clear negative correlation of tACS effects with estimated conduction delays between regions. In conclusion, STDP can explain connectivity aftereffects of dual-site tACS. However, not all combinations of tACS frequency and application sites are expected to effectively modulate connectivity via STDP. We therefore suggest using appropriate computational models and/or EEG analysis for planning and interpretation of dual-site tACS studies relying on aftereffects.\n\nHighlightsO_LINetwork model with STDP explains EEG connectivity change after dual-site tACS\nC_LIO_LIEffects are predicted to depend on tACS frequency and conduction delays\nC_LIO_LIEEG data confirm dependence on conduction delays between regions\nC_LIO_LIModel can be used to estimate and maximize experimental effects\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Soundscape studies aim to consider the holistic human perception of a sound environment, including both the physical phenomena and how these are mediated by internal factors: the mechanisms underpinning the interactions between these two aspects are not well understood. This study aims to assess the influence of psychological well-being and demographic factors including age, gender, occupation status, and education levels on the dimensions of the soundscape circumplex, i.e., Pleasantness and Eventfulness. Data was collected in eleven urban locations in London through a large-scale (N=1134) soundscape survey according to the ISO 12913-2 technical specifications and incorporating the WHO-5 well-being index. Linear mixed-effects modelling applying backwards-step feature selection was used to model the interactions between internal factors including psychological well-being, age, gender, occupation status, education levels and the soundscape Pleasantness and Eventfulness, while accounting for the random effects of the survey location. The findings suggest that internal factors account for approximately 1.4% of the variance for Pleasantness and 3.9% for Eventfulness, while the influence of the locations accounted for approximately 34% and 14%, respectively. Psychological well-being is positively associated with perceived Pleasantness, while there is a negative association with Eventfulness only for males. Occupation status, in particular retirement as a proxy of age and gender, was identified as a significant factor for both dimensions. These findings offer empirical grounds for developing theories of the interaction between internal factors and soundscape formation whilst highlighting the importance of the location, namely: the context.",

To address this, we undertook multi-omic data profiling of chromatin and expression dynamics across epidermal differentiation to identify 40,103 dynamic CREs associated with 3,609 dynamically expressed genes, then applied an interpretable deep learning framework to model the cis-regulatory logic of chromatin accessibility. This identified cooperative DNA sequence rules in dynamic CREs regulating synchronous gene modules with diverse roles in skin differentiation. Massively parallel reporter analysis validated temporal dynamics and cooperative cis-regulatory logic. Variants linked to human polygenic skin disease were enriched in these time-dependent combinatorial motif rules.

    "abstract": "The relationship between alcohol consumption, circulating proteins, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has not been well studied. We performed association analyses of alcohol consumption with three CVD risk factors and 71 CVD-related circulating proteins measured in 6,745 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age, 49 years; 53% women). We found that an increase in alcohol consumption was associated with a higher risk of incident hypertension (P=7.2E-3) but a lower risk of incident obesity (P=5.7E-4) and type 2 diabetes (P=1.4E-5) in a 14-year of follow-up. Using independent discovery (n=4,348) and validation (n=2,397) samples, we identified 20 alcohol-associated proteins (FDR<0.05 in discovery and P<0.05/n in validation), with majority (18 of 20 proteins) inversely associated with alcohol consumption. The alcohol-protein associations remained similar after removing heavy drinkers. Four proteins demonstrated consistent triangular relationships, as expected, with alcohol consumption and CVD risk factors. For example, a greater level of APOA1, which was associated with a higher alcohol consumption (P=1.2E-65), was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (P=3.1E-5). However, several others showed inconsistent triangular relationships, e.g., a greater level of GDF15, which was associated with a lower alcohol consumption (P=1.0E-13), was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (P=2.4E-4). In conclusion, we identified 20 alcohol-associated proteins and demonstrated complex relationships between alcohol consumption, circulating proteins and CVD risk factors. Future studies with integration of more proteomic markers and larger sample size are warranted to unravel the complex relationship between alcohol consumption and CVD risk.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide protein-protein interaction (PPI) determination remains a significant unsolved problem in structural biology. The difficulty is twofold since high-throughput experiments (HTEs) have often a high false-positive rate in assigning PPIs, and PPI quaternary structures are more difficult to solve than tertiary structures using traditional structural biology techniques. We proposed a uniform pipeline to address both problems, which first recognizes PPIs by combining multi-chain threading alignments with HTE results using naive Bayesian classifiers, where the quaternary complex structures are then constructed by mapping the monomer models with the dimeric threading frameworks through interface-specific structural alignments. The pipeline was applied to the Escherichia coli genome and created 35,125 confident PPIs which is 4.5-fold higher than HTE alone. Graphic analyses of the PPI networks revealed a scale-free cluster size distribution, which was found critical to the robustness of genome evolution and the centrality of functionally important proteins that are essential to E. coli survival. Furthermore, complex structure models were constructed for all predicted E. coli PPIs based on the quaternary threading alignments, where 6,771 of them were found to have a high confidence score that corresponds to the correct fold of the complexes with a TM-score >0.5 and 93 showed a close consistency with the later released experimental structures with an average TM-score=0.73. These results demonstrated the significant usefulness of threading-based homologous modeling in both genome-wide PPI network detection and complex structural construction.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in Ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2), a ubiquitin-binding shuttle protein involved in several protein quality control processes, can lead to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously found that wild-type UBQLN2 forms dynamic, membraneless biomolecular condensates upon cellular stress, and undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. However, the impact of ALS-linked mutations on UBQLN2 condensate formation in cells is unknown. Here, we employ live-cell imaging with photokinetic analysis to investigate how five patient-derived ALS-linked mutations in UBQLN2 impact stress-induced UBQLN2 condensate assembly and condensate material properties. Both wild-type and mutant UBQLN2 condensates are generally cytoplasmic and liquid-like. However, cells transfected with mutant UBQLN2 contain fewer stress-induced UBQLN2 condensates than those with wild-type UBQLN2. Most strikingly, ectopically expressed P506T UBQLN2 forms the lowest number of stress-induced condensates of all UBQLN2 mutants, and these condensates are significantly smaller than those of wild-type UBQLN2. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis of UBQLN2 condensates revealed higher immobile fractions for UBQLN2 mutants, especially P506T. P497S and P497H mutations differentially impact condensate properties, demonstrating that the effects of ALS-linked mutations are both position- and amino acid-dependent. Collectively, our data show that disease mutations hinder assembly and alter viscoelastic properties of stress-induced UBQLN2 condensates, potentially leading to aggregates commonly observed in ALS.",

Aberrations in this assembly of Cxs are observed in several genetic diseases as well as in cancers. Hence it becomes imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying such assembly defect. The polarized cells in the epithelia express Connexin32 (Cx32). The carboxyl-terminal tail (CT) of Cx32 orchestrates several aspects of GJ dynamics, function and growth. The study here was aimed at determining if post-translational modifications, specifically, palmitoylation of cysteine residues, present in the CT of Cx32, has any effect on GJ assembly. The CT of Cx32 was found to harbor three cysteine residues, which are likely to be modified by palmitoylation. The study here has revealed for the first time that Cx32 is palmitoylated at cysteine 217 (C217). However, it was found that mutating C217 to alanine affected neither the trafficking nor the ability of Cx32 to assemble into GJs. Intriguingly, it was discovered that mutating cysteine 280 and 283 in combination, blocked the transport of Cx32 from the Golgi to the cell surface. Overall, the findings reveal the importance of the two terminal cysteine residues of Cx32 in regulating its trafficking and stability and hence is ability to assemble into GJs, possibly as being part of a CAAX motif in its CT.",

    "abstract": "The formation of spatial structures lies at the heart of developmental processes. However, many of the underlying gene regulatory and biochemical processes remain poorly understood. Turing patterns constitute a main candidate to explain such processes, but they appear sensitive to fluctuations and variations in kinetic parameters, raising the question of how they may be adopted and realised in naturally evolved systems. The vast majority of mathematical studies of Turing patterns have used continuous models specified in terms of partial differential equations. Here, we complement this work by studying Turing patterns using discrete cellular automata models. We perform a large-scale study on all possible two-species networks and find the same Turing pattern producing networks as in the continuous framework. In contrast to continuous models, however, we find these Turing pattern topologies to be substantially more robust to changes in the parameters of the model. We also find that diffusion-driven instabilities are substantially weaker predictors for Turing patterns in the discrete modelling framework in comparison to the continuous case, and show that a more refined criterion constitutes a stronger predictor. The similarity of the results for the two modelling frameworks suggests a deeper underlying principle of Turing mechanisms in nature. Together with the larger robustness in the discrete case this suggests that Turing patterns may be more robust than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, causes widespread damage in the lungs in the setting of an overzealous immune response whose origin remains unclear. We present a scalable, propagable, personalized, cost-effective adult stem cell-derived human lung organoid model that is complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia. Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived alveolar type-II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19. Infected ALO-monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection, whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2[-&gt;]AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both. Findings validate a human lung model of COVID-19, which can be immediately utilized to investigate COVID-19 pathogenesis and vet new therapies and vaccines.\n\nGRAPHIC ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=176 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344002v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d1507aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@faa17forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@80ceb1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81d61c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIHuman lung organoids with mixed proximodistal epithelia are created\nC_LIO_LIProximal airway cells are critical for viral infectivity\nC_LIO_LIDistal alveolar cells are important for emulating host response\nC_LIO_LIBoth are required for the overzealous response in severe COVID-19\nC_LI\n\nIN BRIEFAn integrated stem cell-based disease modeling and computational approach demonstrate how both proximal airway epithelium is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, but distal differentiation of alveolar pneumocytes is critical for simulating the overzealous host response in fatal COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The Middle East is an important region to understand human evolution and migrations, but is underrepresented in genetic studies. We generated and analysed 137 high-coverage physically-phased genome sequences from eight Middle Eastern populations using linked-read sequencing. We found no genetic traces of early expansions out-of-Africa in present-day populations, but find Arabians have elevated Basal Eurasian ancestry that dilutes their Neanderthal ancestry. A divergence in population size within the region starts before the Neolithic, when Levantines expanded while Arabians maintained small populations that could have derived ancestry from local epipaleolithic hunter-gatherers. All populations suffered a bottleneck overlapping documented aridification events, while regional migrations increased genetic structure, and may have contributed to the spread of the Semitic languages. We identify new variants that show evidence of selection, some dating from the onset of the desert climate in the region. Our results thus provide detailed insights into the genomic and selective histories of the Middle East.",

    "abstract": "Human skin enables interaction with diverse materials every day and at all times. The ability to grasp objects, feel textures, and perceive the environment depends on the mechanical behavior, complex structure, and microscale topography of human skin. At the same time, abrasive interactions, such as sometimes occur with prostheses or textiles, can damage the skin and impair its function. Previous theoretical and computational efforts have shown that skins surface topography or microrelief, is crucial for its tribological behavior. However, current understanding is limited to adult surface profiles and simplified two-dimensional simulations. Yet, the skin has a rich set of features in three dimensions, and the geometry of skin is known to change with aging. Here we create a numerical model of a dynamic indentation test to elucidate the effect of changes in microscale topography with aging on the skins response under indentation and sliding contact with a spherical indenter. We create three different microrelief geometries representative of different ages based on experimental reports from the literature. We perform the indentation and sliding steps, and calculate the normal and tangential forces on the indenter as it moves in three distinct directions based on the characteristic skin lines. The model also evaluates the effect of varying the material parameters. Our results show that the microscale topography of the skin in three dimensions, together with the mechanical behavior of the skin layers, lead to distinctive trends on the stress and strain distribution. The major finding is the increasing role of anisotropy which emerges from the geometric changes seen with aging.",

Here, we unravel the basics of such inactivation mechanism over the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by executing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Both the closed down and open up states, which determine the accessibility to the receptor binding domain, were considered. Results suggest that the spike undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bond network while salt bridges are mainly preserved. Reorganization in the hydrogen bonds structure produces conformational variations in the receptor binding subunit and explain the thermal inactivation of the virus. Conversely, the macrostructure of the spike is preserved at high temperature because of the retained salt bridges. The proposed mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

    "abstract": "Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a homo-dimeric enzyme has been widely used in various bioassays as disease markers and enzyme probes. Recent advancements of digital bioassay revolutionized ALP-based diagnostic assays as seen in rapid growth of digital ELISA and the emerging multiplex profiling of single-molecule ALP isomers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity found among ALP molecules hampers the ALP-based quantitative digital bioassays. This study aims quantitative analysis of single-molecule activities of ALP from Escherichia coli and reveals the static heterogeneity in catalytic activity of ALP with two distinct populations: half-active and fully active portions. Digital assays with serial buffer exchange uncovered single-molecule Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ALP; half-active molecules have halved values of the catalytic turnover rate, kcat, and the rate constant of productive binding, kon, of the fully active molecules. These findings suggest that half-active ALP molecules are heterogenic dimers composed of inactive and active monomer units, while fully active ALP molecules comprise two active units. Static heterogeneity was also observed for ALP with other origins: calf intestine or shrimp, showing how the findings can be generalized across species. Cell-free expression of ALP with disulfide bond enhancer and spiked zinc ion resulted in homogenous population of ALP of full activity, revealing that inactive monomer units of ALP are deficient in disulfide bond formation and zinc ion coordination, and also offering the way to prepare homogenous and active populations of ALP for quantitative digital bioassays of ALP.",

    "abstract": "The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates host cell entry by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and is considered the major target for drug and vaccine development. We previously built fully-glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple s-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of S protein, and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of RBD, and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of a commonly-used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibody. Overall, our observations offer structural and dynamic insight into SARS-CoV-2 S protein and potentialize for guiding the design of effective antiviral therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis remains an unsolved clinical challenge. Two crucial features of metastasizing cancer cells are a) their ability to dynamically move along the epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal spectrum and b) their tumor-initiation potential or stemness. With increasing functional characterization of hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotypes along the spectrum, recent in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested an increasing association of hybrid E/M phenotypes with stemness. However, the mechanistic underpinnings enabling this association remain unclear. Here, we develop a mechanism-based mathematical modeling framework that interrogates the emergent nonlinear dynamics of the coupled network modules regulating E/M plasticity (miR-200/ZEB) and stemness (LIN28/let-7). Simulating the dynamics of this coupled network across a large ensemble of parameter sets, we observe that hybrid E/M phenotype(s) are more likely to acquire stemness relative to  pure epithelial or mesenchymal states. We also integrate multiple  phenotypic stability factors (PSFs) that have been shown to stabilize hybrid E/M phenotypes both in silico and in vitro - such as OVOL1/2, GRHL2, and NRF2 - with this network, and demonstrate that the enrichment of hybrid E/M phenotype(s) with stemness is largely conserved in the presence of these PSFs. Thus, our results offer mechanistic insights into recent experimental observations of hybrid E/M phenotype(s) being essential for tumor-initiation and highlight how this feature is embedded in the underlying topology of interconnected EMT and stemness networks.",

    "abstract": "Amphicarphic species produce both aboveground and belowground seeds; the belowground seeds have been proposed to be an adaptation to disturbed sites because they are protected belowground, enabling them to persist and recolonize a site after disturbance. However, it is unknown whether such seeds indeed serve as the main colonizers after a disturbance. The amphicarpic species Polygala lewtonii is endemic to fire-prone Florida sandhill and scrub and is among only a few species with three flower types (aboveground chasmogamous flowers and both above and belowground cleistogamous flowers). The goal of this study was to understand whether recolonization of sites by P. lewtonii was accomplished primarily through germination of belowground seed. First, we quantified the outcrossing rate in seeds produced by aboveground chasmogamous flowers to determine whether we could detect differences in colonization of between seeds produced aboveground vs. belowground. Approximately 25% of seeds from aboveground chasmogamous flowers showed evidence of cross pollination and the seeds showed greater heterozygosity and lower inbreeding coefficients than pure selfing, indicating that it is possible to differentiate between selfed and non-selfed seed types in postfire colonization. Second, we analyzed genetic diversity, inbreeding, and genetic structure of the populations before and after a prescribed fire. If heterozygosity and admixture increased, and spatial population genetic structure and inbreeding decreased, this would indicate that fire promoted germination of outcrossed seed from aboveground flowers. However, inbreeding increased and spatial genetic structure and admixture decreased after fire, suggesting that selfed seed produced by belowground flowers predominantly recolonized the site after fire. Thus, amphicarpy is a powerful adaptation to fire-maintained environments by producing seeds that are well suited to the range of conditions presented by a highly variable, disturbance prone habitat.",

We investigated the impact of changing temperatures on gene expression levels during the time series and detected a correlation between increased temperatures and a high expression level of genes encoding heat-shock proteins. The data set also allowed the exemplary investigation of expression patterns of genes from three transcription factor (TF) gene families, namely MADS-box, WRKY, and R2R3-MYB genes. Inspection of the expression profiles from all three TF gene families indicated that a switch in the developmental program takes place in July which coincides with increased expression of the bud dormancy marker gene VviDRM1.",

    "abstract": "Action is a medium of collecting sensory information about the environment, which in turn is shaped by architectural affordances. Affordances characterize the fit between the physical structure of the body and capacities for movement and interaction with the environment, thus relying on sensorimotor processes associated with exploring the surroundings. Central to sensorimotor brain dynamics, the attentional mechanisms directing the gating function of sensory signals share neuronal resources with motor-related processes necessary to inferring the external causes of sensory signals. Such a predictive coding approach suggests that sensorimotor dynamics are sensitive to architectural affordances that support or suppress specific kinds of actions for an individual. However, how architectural affordances relate to the attentional mechanisms underlying the gating function for sensory signals remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that event-related desynchronization of alpha-band oscillations in parieto-occipital and medio-temporal regions covary with the architectural affordances. Source-level time-frequency analysis of data recorded in a motor-priming Mobile Brain/Body Imaging experiment revealed strong event-related desynchronization of the alpha band to originate from the posterior cingulate complex and bilateral parahippocampal areas. Our results firstly contribute to the understanding of how the brain resolves architectural affordances relevant to behaviour. Second, our results indicate that the alpha-band originating from the posterior cingulate complex covaries with the architectural affordances before participants interact with the environment. During the interaction, the bilateral parahippocampal areas dynamically reflect the affordable behaviour as perceived through the visual system. We conclude that the sensorimotor dynamics are developed for processing behaviour-relevant features in the designed environment.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal place cell system in rodents has provided a major paradigm for the scientific investigation of memory function and dysfunction. Place cells have been observed in area CA1 of the hippocampus of both freely moving animals, and of head-fixed animals navigating in virtual reality environments. However, spatial coding in virtual reality preparations has been observed to be impaired. Here we show that the use of a real-world environment system for head-fixed mice, consisting of a track floating on air, provides some advantages over virtual reality systems for the study of spatial memory. We imaged the hippocampus of head-fixed mice injected with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s while they navigated circularly constrained or open environments on the floating platform. We observed consistent place tuning in a substantial fraction of cells with place fields remapping when animals entered a different environment. When animals re-entered the same environment, place fields typically remapped over a time period of multiple days, faster than in freely moving preparations, but comparable with virtual reality. Spatial information rates were within the range observed in freely moving mice. Manifold analysis indicated that spatial information could be extracted from a low-dimensional subspace of the neural population dynamics. This is the first demonstration of place cells in head-fixed mice navigating on an air-lifted real-world platform, validating its use for the study of brain circuits involved in memory and affected by neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "When organisms face crises, such as starvation, every individual should adapt to environmental changes (1, 2), or the community alters their behaviour (3-5). Because a stressful environment reduces the carrying capacity (6), the population size of unicellular organisms shrinks in such conditions (7, 8). However, the uniform stress response of the cell community may lead to overall extinction or severely damage their entire fitness. How microbial communities accommodate this dilemma remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an elaborate strategy of the yeast community against glucose starvation, named the voluntary triage. During starvation, yeast cells release some autotoxins, such as leucic acid and L-2keto-3methylvalerate, which can even kill the cells producing them. Although it may look like mass suicide at first glance, cells use epigenetic \"tags\" to adapt to the autotoxin inheritably. If non-tagged latecomers, regardless of whether they are closely related, try to invade the habitat, autotoxins kill them and inhibit their growth, but the tagged cells can selectively survive. Phylogenetically distant fission and budding yeast (9) share this strategy using the same autotoxins, which implies that the universal system of voluntary triage may be relevant to the major evolutional transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms (10).",

    "abstract": "A wide range of hemocyte types exist in insects but a full definition of the different subclasses is not yet established. The current knowledge of the classification of silkworm hemocytes mainly comes from morphology rather than specific markers, so our understanding of the detailed classification, hemocyte lineage and functions of silkworm hemocytes is very incomplete. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a representative member of the baculoviruses, which are a major pathogens that specifically infects silkworms and cause serious loss in sericulture industry. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of silkworm hemocytes in BmNPV and mock-infected larvae to comprehensively identify silkworm hemocyte subsets and determined specific molecular and cellular characteristics in each hemocyte subset before and after viral infection. A total of 19 cell clusters and their potential marker genes were identified in silkworm hemocytes. Among these hemocyte clusters, clusters 0, 1, 2, 5 and 9 might be granulocytes (GR); clusters 14 and 17 were predicted as plasmatocytes (PL); cluster 18 was tentatively identified as spherulocytes (SP); and clusters 7 and 11 could possibly correspond to oenocytoids (OE). In addition, all of the hemocyte clusters were infected by BmNPV and some infected cells carried high viral-load in silkworm larvae at 3 day post infection (dpi). Interestingly, BmNPV infection can cause severe and diverse changes in gene expression in hemocytes. Cells belonging to the infection group mainly located at the early stage of the pseudotime trajectories. Furthermore, we found that BmNPV infection suppresses the immune response in the major hemocyte types. In summary, our scRNA-seq analysis revealed the diversity of silkworm hemocytes and provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions in the uninfected condition and as a response to BmNPV.",

    "abstract": "In the developing nervous system, progenitors first generate neurons before making astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. We previously showed that increased Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in dorsal forebrain progenitors is important for their production of oligodendrocytes as neurogenesis winds down. Here, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to better understand how Shh controls this neuron-to-oligodendrocyte switch in the neocortex. We first identified Shh-responding progenitors using a dataset in which Shh was overexpressed in the mouse dorsal forebrain. Pseudotime trajectory inferences revealed a subpopulation committed to the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) lineage. Genes upregulated along this lineage defined a pre-OPC state, as cells transitioned from progenitors to OPCs. Using several datasets from wild-type mouse and human embryos at different ages, we confirmed a pre-OPC state preceding OPC emergence during normal development. Finally, we show that pre-OPCs are enriched for a gene regulatory network involving the transcription factor Ascl1. Genetic lineage-tracing demonstrated Ascl1+ dorsal progenitors primarily make oligodendrocytes. We propose a model in which Shh shifts the balance between opposing transcriptional networks toward an Ascl1 lineage, thereby facilitating the switch between neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dramatic change in cellular physiology during development and metastasis which involves coordination between cell signaling, adhesion, and membrane protrusions. These processes all involve dynamic changes in the plasma membrane, yet how membrane lipid content regulates membrane function during developmental EMT remains incompletely understood. By screening for differential expression of lipid-modifying genes over the course of EMT in avian neural crest, we have identified the ceramide-producing enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) as a critical regulator of a developmental EMT. nSMase2 expression begins at the onset of EMT, and in vivo knockdown experiments demonstrate that nSMase2 is necessary for neural crest migration. Further, we find that nSMase2 promotes Wnt and BMP signaling, and is required to activate the mesenchymal gene expression program. Mechanistically, we show that nSMase2 is sufficient to induce endocytosis, and that inhibition of endocytosis mimics nSMase2 knockdown. Our results support a model in which nSMase2 is expressed at the onset of neural crest EMT to produce ceramide and induce membrane curvature, thus increasing endocytosis of Wnt and BMP signaling complexes and activating pro-migratory gene expression. These results highlight the critical role of plasma membrane lipid metabolism in regulating transcriptional changes during developmental EMT programs.",

    "abstract": "Food limitation can dampen survival and growth of fish during early development. To investigate prey diversity important to the planktivorous larval longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) from the San Francisco Estuary, we used DNA metabarcoding analysis of the cytochrome oxidase I gene on the guts of these fishes and on environmental zooplankton samples. Differential abundance analysis suggested that both species consumed the most abundant zooplankton at a lower rate than their availability in the environment. Both fish consumed the prey that were commonly available and relatively abundant. Prey taxa substantially overlapped between the two species (Schoeners index = 0.66), and alpha diversity analysis suggested high variability in the content of individual guts. Abundant prey taxa in both fish species included the copepods Eurytemora carolleeae, Acanthocyclops americanus, and A. robustus; the Acanthocyclops spp. are difficult to identify morphologically. A few uncommon prey in the diets hint at variable feeding strategies, such as herring (presumably egg) DNA in the longfin smelt diets, which suggests feeding near substrates. Herring consumed the small (<0.5 mm) copepod Limnoithona tetraspina more frequently (30%) than did smelt (2%), possibly indicating differences in foraging behavior or sensory abilities. Among the unexpected prey found in the diets was the cnidarian Hydra oligactis, the polychaete Dasybranchus sp., and a newly identified species Mesocyclops pehpeiensis. \"Unknown\" DNA was in 56% of longfin smelt diets and 57% of herring diets, and made up 17% and 21% of the relative read abundance in the two species, respectively. Our results suggest that these two fishes, which overlap in nursery habitat, also largely overlap in food resources necessary for larval survival.",

Empirical studies relating threats and traits are needed, but data are scarce, making simulations useful. We implemented an eco-evolutionary model to analyse how five threat types influence the extinction risk of virtual organisms differing in body size, maturity age, fecundity, and dispersal ability. Results show that direct killing mostly affected slow-living and low dispersal organisms. Habitat loss and fragmentation both affected larger and less fecund organisms, but drove contrasting responses according to dispersal ability. Habitat degradation and the introduction of invasive competitors had similar effects, mostly affecting large, fast-living, and highly fecund organisms.

    "abstract": "In many animal species, parents provide care for their offspring, but the parental roles of the two sexes differ considerably between and within species. Here, we use an individual-based simulation approach to investigate the evolutionary emergence and stability of parental roles. Our conclusions are in striking contrast to the results of analytical models. In the absence of initial differences between the sexes, our simulations do not predict the evolution of egalitarian care, but either female-biased or male-biased care. When the sexes differ in their pre-mating investment, the sex with the highest investment tends to evolve a higher level of parental care; this outcome does not depend on non-random mating or uncertainty of paternity. If parental investment evolves jointly with sexual selection strategies, evolution results in either the combination of female-biased care and female choosiness or in male-biased care and the absence of female preferences. The simulations suggest that the parental care pattern drives sexual selection, and not vice versa. Finally, our model reveals that a population can rapidly switch from one type of equilibrium to another one, suggesting that parental sex roles are evolutionarily labile. By combining simulation results with fitness calculations, we argue that all these results are caused by the emergence of individual variation in parental care strategies, a factor that was hitherto largely neglected in sex-role evolution theory.",

    "abstract": "The total strength of sexual selection on males depends on the relationship between various components of pre- and post-copulatory fitness. Misalignment between male and female interests creates inter-locus sexual conflict, where the fitness of one sex is increased at the expense of the other. Although rarely considered, mating behaviours can also be genetically correlated between males and females, creating intra-locus sexual conflict, where beneficial alleles in one sex are costly when expressed in the other sex. How inter- and intra-locus sexual conflicts operate on the expression of mating behaviours remains little understood. Here, we study male attractiveness, mating latency and copulation duration in two populations of the polyandrous Drosophila serrata. Univariate analyses show little genetic variance in mating latency, and that males, but not females, contribute to copulation duration genetic variance. Further, multivariate analyses revealed little covariance between the studied traits. However, analyses considering male and female contribution in a single framework supported genetic contributions from both sexes for mating behaviours and complex patterns of between sexes correlations. Finally, our study did not find any association between those mating behaviours and fitness component, specifically (i) no phenotypic covariance between male attractiveness and mating latency and, (ii) longer copulations did not result in the production of more offspring. With no detectable fitness benefits in any sexes for shorter mating latency or longer copulation duration, our results do not support the presence of inter-nor intra-locus sexual conflict for these mating traits.",

    "abstract": "Accounting for 10-20% of breast cancer cases, TNBC is associated with a disproportionate number of breast cancer deaths. Despite recent progress, many patients fail to respond to current targeted therapies. Responses to chemotherapy are variable, and the tumor characteristics that determine response are poorly understood. One challenge in studying TNBC is its genomic profile: outside of TP53 loss, most cases are characterized by copy number alterations (CNAs), making modeling the disease in whole animals challenging. We analyzed 186 previously identified CNA regions in breast cancer to rank genes within each region by likelihood of acting as a tumor driver. We characterized a Drosophila p53-Myc model of TNBC, demonstrating aspects of transformation. We then used this model to assess highly ranked genes, identifying 48 as functional drivers. To demonstrate the utility of this functional database, we combined six of these drivers with p53-Myc to generate six 3-hit genotypes. These 3-hit models showed increased aspects of transformation as well as resistance to the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drug fluorouracil. Our work provides a functional database of CNA-associated TNBC drivers, and uses this database to support the model that increased genetic complexity leads to increased therapeutic resistance. Further, we provide a template for an integrated computational/whole animal approach to identify functional drivers of transformation and drug resistance within CNAs for other tumor types.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy endemic to East Asia and is caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-mediated cancerous transformation of epithelial cells. The standard of care treatment for NPC involves radiation and chemotherapy. While treatment outcomes continue to improve, up to 50% of patients can be expected to recur by five years, and additional innovative treatment options are needed. We posit that a potential way to do this is by targeting the underlying cause of malignant transformation, namely EBV. One method by which EBV escapes immune surveillance is by undergoing latent phase replication, during which EBV expression of immunogenic proteins is reduced. However, chemoradiation is known to drive conversion of EBV from a latent to a lytic phase. This creates an opportunity for the targeting of EBV-infected cells utilizing anti-viral drugs. Indeed, we found that combining acyclovir with cisplatin and radiation significantly decreases the viability of the EBV-infected C666-1 cell line. Western blot quantification revealed a resultant increase of thymidine kinase (TK) and apoptosis-inducing mediators, cleaved PARP (cPARP) and phosphorylated ERK (pERK). These studies suggest that the addition of anti-viral drugs to frontline chemoradiation may improve outcomes in patients treated for EBV-related NPC and future in vivo and clinical studies are needed.",

Here, we seek to quantitatively understand this relationship across a collection of Escherichia coli proteomic data covering {approx} 4000 proteins and 36 growth rates. We estimate the basic requirements for steady-state growth by considering key processes in nutrient transport, cell envelope biogenesis, energy generation, and the central dogma. From these estimates, ribosome biogenesis emerges as a primary determinant of growth rate. We expand on this assessment by exploring a model of proteomic regulation as a function of the nutrient supply, revealing a mechanism that ties cell size and growth rate to ribosomal content.",

    "abstract": "Triatomine assassin bugs comprise hematophagous insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the Chagas disease. Although the microbiome of these species has been investigated to some extent, only one virus infecting Triatoma infestans has been identified to date. Here, we describe for the first time seven (+) single-strand RNA viruses (RpV1-7) infecting Rhodnius prolixus, a primary vector of the Chagas disease in Central and South America. We show that the RpVs belong to the Picorna-Calici, Permutotetra and Luteo-Sobemo clades and are vertically transmitted from the mothers to the progeny via transovarial transmission. Consistent with this, all the RpVs, except RpV2 that is related to the entomopathogenic Slow bee paralysis virus, established persistent infections in our R. prolixus colony. Furthermore, we show that R. prolixus ovaries express 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs (vsiRNAs), but not viral piRNAs, that originate from the processing of dsRNA intermediates during viral replication of the RpVs. Interestingly, the Permutotetra and Luteo-Sobemo viruses display shared pools of visRNAs that might provide the basis for a cross-immunity system. The vsiRNAs are maternally deposited in the eggs, where they likely contribute to reduce the viral load and protect the developing embryos. Our results unveil for the first time a complex core virome in R. prolixus and begin to shed light on the RNAi-based antiviral defenses in triatomines.\n\nAuthor summaryRhodnius prolixus is a triatomine insect and a primary vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of the Chagas disease, in Central and South America. Despite the medical relevance, very little is known about the viruses that infect these so-called assassin bugs. In this study, we show for the first time that triatomines can support the concomitant infection of a variety of RNA viruses belonging to distantly related viral families. Remarkably, we show that the viruses are vertically transmitted from the mothers to the progeny via transovarial transmission. The detection of 22-nucleotide viral small interfering RNAs in mature eggs strongly suggests that RNAi mechanisms contribute to reduce the viral load during oogenesis and embryogenesis in R. prolixus, thus safeguarding the development of embryos and nymphs. In agreement with these findings, all the viruses, except one, could establish persistent infections in our colony. Our results substantially expand the knowledge of the virus complexity in triatomine species. This viral toolkit might be harnessed to develop novel insect population control strategies to reduce the diffusion of the Chagas disease.",

Anciently parasitic lineages, like apicomplexans, lose core metabolic pathways over time, as they evolve less costly scavenging mechanisms. The recent description of a mutualistic apicomplexan, Nephromyces, from deep within this parasitic group, opened the possibility of an evolutionary innovation that allowed an escape from a parasitic lifestyle. Nuclear genome data from Nephromyces, as well as the three bacterial symbionts that live within this species complex, demonstrate that the bacteria within Nephromyces contribute essential cofactors and amino acids that have enabled Nephromyces to abandon a parasitic lifestyle. Among these, bacterial lipoic acid appears to be a key cofactor for the reduction of virulence in Nephromyces. However, whereas we use FISH microscopy to reveal that each individual Nephromyces harbors no more than one endosymbiont type, no single bacterial endosymbiont can account for all missing metabolites. Based on the unique habitat of Nephromyces, as well as genomic, culturing, and wild population data, we conclude that Nephromyces has evolved as an extraordinary clade of codependent species, unlike any previously described.",

    "abstract": "DNA repair deficiencies have become an increasingly promising target for novel therapeutics within the realm of clinical oncology. Recently, several inhibitors of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases (PARPs) have received approval for the treatment of cancers primarily with deleterious mutations in the homologous recombination (HR) proteins, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Despite numerous clinical trials which have been completed or are currently ongoing, the mechanism of action by which PARP inhibitors selectively kill tumor cells is poorly understood. While many believe \"trapping\" of PARP proteins to DNA at sites of damage is the most important determinant driving cytotoxicity by these drugs, clinically effective inhibitors exist with a diverse range of PARP-trapping qualities. These findings suggest that characterization of inhibitors as strong versus weak trappers does not properly capture the intra-class characteristics of these drugs. Here, we use a novel, targeted DNA damage response (DDR) CRISPR/Cas9 screening library to reveal heterogenous genetic dependencies on the base excision repair (BER) pathway for PARP inhibitors, which is not correlated with PARP trapping ability or catalytic inhibition of PARP. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of PARylation and induction of PARP trapping are not the only factors contributing to distinct biological activity for different PARP inhibitors, and they provide insight into the optimal choice of PARP inhibitors for use in the setting of specific DDR defects.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTargeted cancer therapies rely on our general understanding of which genetic mutations are involved in both sensitivity and resistance to such anticancer agents. In this study, we describe the use of functional genetic screening to evaluate the role of various DNA repair proteins in response to inhibitors of PARP, a quintessential example of targeted therapy. While PARP inhibitors are best known for their utility in cancers with homologous recombination defects, we show that some inhibitors within this class may have additional functionality in cancers with deficient base excision repair. These findings highlight not only the importance of PARP inhibitor selection in the appropriate context, but also the mechanistic differences that exist within this class of inhibitors. It is our hope that our findings will inspire future work evaluating the use of specific PARP inhibitor selection in designing clinical trials to further expand the use of PARP inhibitors beyond tumors with homologous recombination deficiencies.",

    "abstract": "Only two de novo biosynthetic routes to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) have been described, both of which start from a proteinogenic amino acid and are tightly controlled. Here we establish a C3N pathway starting from chorismate in Escherichia coli as a third NAD+ de novo biosynthesis pathway. Significantly, the C3N pathway yielded extremely high cellular concentrations of NAD(H) in E. coli. Its utility in cofactor engineering was demonstrated by introducing the four-gene C3N module to cell factories to achieve higher production of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and develop an efficient C3N-based whole-cell bioconversion system for preparing chiral amines. The wide distribution and abundance of chorismate in most kingdoms of life implies a general utility of the C3N pathway for modulating cellular levels of NAD(H) in versatile organisms.",
