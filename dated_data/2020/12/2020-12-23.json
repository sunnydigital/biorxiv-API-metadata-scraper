    "abstract": "The extent to which faces and written words share neural circuitry in the human brain is actively debated. Here we compared face-selective and word-selective responses in a large group of patients (N = 37) implanted with intracerebral depth electrodes in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC). Both face-selective (i.e., significantly different responses to faces vs. nonface visual objects) and word-selective (i.e., significantly different responses to words vs. pseudofonts) neural activity is isolated through frequency-tagging. Critically, this sensitive approach allows to objectively quantify category-selective neural responses and disentangle them from general visual responses. About 70% of significant contacts show either only face-selectivity or only word-selectivity, with the expected right and left hemispheric dominance, respectively. Spatial dissociations are also found within core regions of face and word processing, with a medio-lateral dissociation in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and surrounding sulci, while a postero-anterior dissociation is found in the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG). Only 30% of the significant contacts show both face- and word-selective responses. Critically, in these contacts, across the VOTC or in the FG and surrounding sulci, between-category selective-amplitudes (faces vs. words) showed no-to-weak correlations, despite strong correlations in both the within-category selective amplitudes (face-face, word-word) and the general visual responses to words and faces. Overall, we conclude that category-selectivity for faces and written words is largely dissociated in the human VOTC.\n\nSignificance StatementIn modern human societies, faces and written words have become arguably the most significant stimuli of the visual environment. Despite extensive research in neuropsychology, electroencephalography and neuroimaging over the past three decades, whether these two types of visual signals are recognized by similar or dissociated processes and neural networks remains unclear. Here we provide an original contribution to this outstanding scientific issue by directly comparing frequency-tagged face- and word-selective neural responses in a large group of epileptic patients implanted with intracerebral electrodes covering the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. While general visual responses to words and faces show significant overlap, the respective category-selective responses are neatly dissociated in spatial location and magnitude, pointing to largely dissociated processes and neural networks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearchers have been focused on perceptual characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in terms of sensory hyperreactivity. Previously, we demonstrated that temporal resolution, which is the accuracy in differentiating the order of two successive vibrotactile stimuli, is associated with the severity of sensory hyperreactivity (Ide et al. 2019). Herein, we examined whether an increase in the perceptual intensity of a tactile stimulus, despite its short duration, is derived from high temporal resolution and a high frequency of sensory temporal summation.\n\nMethodSixteen participants with ASD and fifteen typically developing (TD) participants performed two psychophysical experimental tasks, and we evaluated the detectable duration of vibrotactile stimuli with the same amplitude and temporal resolution. Sensory hyperreactivity was estimated using a self-reported questionnaire.\n\nResultsThere was no relationship between temporal resolution and the duration of detectable stimuli in either group. However, the ASD group showed more severe sensory hyperreactivity in daily life than the TD group did, and ASD participants with severe sensory hyperreactivity tended to have high temporal resolution but not high sensitivity for detectable duration.\n\nConclusionContrary to our hypothesis, there might be different processing between temporal resolution and sensitivity for stimulus detection. Sensory reactivity in daily life would not be based on sensitivity for stimulus detection measured in an experimental task, and we suggest that atypical temporal processing would affect sensory reactivity in ASD.

    "abstract": "Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic drug with pleiotropic effects known to modulate the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). With the annotation of many novel lncRNAs, it is imperative to employ a more comprehensive approach to identify cisplatin-mediated changes in the expression of lncRNAs. Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based profiling of total RNAs from cisplatin-treated HeLa cells identified 3489 expressed lncRNAs, of which 1930 and 1051 were up- and downregulated upon cisplatin treatment, respectively. For functional analyses, we selected one of the cisplatin inducible lncRNAs situated antisense to the death receptor 5 and thus named death receptor 5 antisense lncRNA (DR5-AS). Knock-down of DR5-AS lncRNA caused a morphological change in cell shape without inducing any cell death. A second round of NGS-based profiling of total RNAs from DR5-AS-silenced cells revealed differential expression of genes associated with the immune system and cell cycle. Further analyses showed that DR5-AS reduces cell proliferation and causes a cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases. These results suggest that cisplatin-mediated reduction in cell proliferation and cell cycle may be mediated by long non-coding RNAs.\n\nSignificanceCisplatin is known to induce DNA-damage-induced cell death, which is used in combination chemotherapies in various cancer types. However, many patients develop resistance to cisplatin, which involves both protein-coding and noncoding genes. Although a number of long noncoding RNAs are linked to cisplatin resistance, a more comprehensive study is required. In this study, we took advantage of next-generation-sequencing based lncRNA profiling to unveil the extent of cisplatin inducible lncRNAs in HeLa cells. Additionally, we functionally characterized one of the cisplatin-inducible lncRNA, death receptor 5 antisense. Interestingly, this spesific lncRNA modulates cell morphology, proliferation and cell cycle without affecting cell death.",

    "abstract": "Male germ cell production is a metabolically-driven and apoptosis-prone process. Here we show that the glucose-sensing transcription factor MLX, and its binding partner MondoA, are both required for male fertility in the mouse, as well as survival of human tumor cells derived from the male germ line. Loss of Mlx results in altered metabolism as well as activation of multiple stress pathways and germ cell apoptosis in the testes. This is concomitant with dysregulation of the expression of male-specific germ cell transcripts and proteins, manifesting as oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT). Our genomic and functional analyses identify loci directly bound by MLX involved in these processes, including metabolic targets, apoptotic effectors and obligate components of male-specific germ cell development. These in vivo and in vitro studies implicate MLX and other members of the proximal MYC network, such as MNT, in regulation of metabolism and differentiation, as well as in suppression of intrinsic and extrinsic death signaling pathways in both spermatogenesis and male germ cell tumors.\n\nHighlights- The MAX-like bHLHLZ protein MLX is required for male fertility, but not embryonic development.\n- MLX and its heterodimeric partner MondoA are each required for both male fertility and survival of male germ cell tumors.\n- Genomic analysis identifies direct MLX targets associated with metabolism, stress and male germ cell development.\n- Loss of MLX alters MYC network genome occupancy and transcriptional output.",

    "abstract": "Loss of oscillatory insulin secretion is an early marker of type II diabetes. In an individual beta-cell, insulin secretion is triggered by glucose metabolism, which leads to membrane depolarization and calcium influx. Islet {beta}-cells display coordinated secretion; however, it is unclear how the heterogeneous population of insulin-secreting beta cells coordinate their response to glucose. The mechanisms underlying both electrical and calcium synchronicity are well explored. Even so, the mechanism governing metabolic coordination is unclear given key glycolytic enzymes heterogeneous expression. To understand how islet cells coordinate their metabolic activity, a microfluidic applicator delivered glucose stimulation to spatially defined areas of isolated mouse islets. We measured metabolic responses using NADH/NADPH (or NAD(P)H) autofluorescence and calcium changes using Fluo-4 fluorescence. Glucose stimulated a rise in NAD(P)H even in islet areas unexposed to the treatment, suggesting metabolic coordination. A gap junction inhibitor blocked the coordinated NAD(P)H rise in the low-glucose areas. Additionally, metabolic communication did not occur in immortalized {beta}-cell clusters known to lack gap junctions, demonstrating their importance for metabolic coupling. Metabolic communication also preceded glucose-stimulated rises in intracellular calcium. Further, pharmacological blockade of calcium influx did not disrupt NAD(P)H rises in untreated regions. These data suggest that metabolic coordination between islet beta-cells relies on gap-junctional activity and precedes synchronous electrical and calcium activity.",

    "abstract": "Functional membrane proteins in the plasma membrane are suggested to have specific membrane environments that play important roles to maintain and regulate the function of proteins. However, the local membrane environments of membrane proteins remain largely unexplored due to the lack of techniques allowing to monitor them in living cells. We have developed a method to probe the local membrane environment surrounding a membrane protein in the plasma membrane by covalently tethering a solvatochromic, environment-sensitive dye, Nile red, to a membrane protein via a flexible linker. Our direct imaging reported on the spatio-temporal properties of membrane fluidity of the local environment surrounding the insulin receptor. The local environment was distinct from the average plasma membrane fluidity and was quite dynamic and heterogeneous. Upon addition of insulin, the local membrane environment surrounding the receptor increased in fluidity in an insulin receptor-kinase dependent manner. This new technology should allow researchers to examine changes in membrane properties caused by receptor activation and devise ways to address the role of these changes in physiological processes.",

Here, we study the impact of DHA-PLs on the dynamics of transendothelial cell macroapertures (TEMs) tunnels triggered by the RhoA GTPase inhibitory exotoxin C3 from Clostridium botulinum. Through lipidomic analyses, we show that primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) subjected to DHA-diet undergo a 6-fold DHA-PLs enrichment in plasma membrane at the expense of monounsaturated OA-PLs. In contrast, OA-diet had almost no effect on PLs composition. Consequently, DHA treatment increases the nucleation rate of TEMs by 2-fold that we ascribe to a reduction of cell thickness. We reveal that the global transcellular area of cells remains conserved through a reduction of the width and lifetime of TEMs. Altogether, we reveal a homeostasis between plasma membrane DHA-PLs content and large-scale membrane dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Erythroblastic islands are a specialized niche that contain a central macrophage surrounded by erythroid cells at various stages of maturation. However, identifying the precise genetic and transcriptional control mechanisms in the island macrophage remains difficult due to macrophage heterogeneity. Using unbiased global sequencing and directed genetic approaches focused on early mammalian development, we find that fetal liver macrophage exhibit a unique expression signature that differentiates them from erythroid and adult macrophage cells. The importance of EKLF/KLF1 in this identity is shown by expression analyses in EKLF-/- and in EKLF-marked macrophage cells. Single cell sequence analysis simplifies heterogeneity and identifies clusters of genes important for EKLF-dependent macrophage function and novel cell surface biomarkers. Remarkably, this singular set of macrophage island cells appears transiently during embryogenesis. Together these studies provide a detailed perspective on the importance of EKLF in establishment of the dynamic gene expression network within erythroblastic islands in the developing embryo and provide the means for their efficient isolation.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt signalling network regulates cell proliferation and cell differentiation as well as migration and polarity in development of multicellular organisms. However, it is still unclear how distribution of Wnt ligands is precisely controlled to fulfil all of these different functions. Here, we show that the four-pass transmembrane protein Vangl2 occupies a central role in determining the distribution of Wnt by cytonemes in vertebrate tissue. In zebrafish epiblast cells, mouse intestinal telocytes and human gastric cancer cells, activation of Vangl2 leads to the generation of fewer but extremely long cytonemes, which start to branch and deliver Wnt protein to multiple cells. The Vangl2-activated cytonemes increase Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling in the surrounding cells. Concordantly, inhibition of Vangl2 function leads to the formation of shorter cytonemes and reduced paracrine Wnt/{beta}-catenin signal activation. A mathematical model simulating the observed Vangl2 functions on cytonemes in zebrafish gastrulation predicts an anterior shift of the morphogenetic signalling gradient, altered tissue patterning, and a loss of the sharpness of tissue domains. We confirmed these predictions during anteroposterior patterning in the zebrafish neural plate. In summary, we show that Vangl2 - a core member of the PCP signalling component - is fundamental to paracrine Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling by controlling cytoneme behaviour in vertebrate development and tissue homeostasis.",

In this study, we combined a series of recently developed computational tools to identify transcriptional regulatory networks involved in the response of epithelial cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and particularly regulatory mechanisms that are specific to this virus. In addition, using network-guided analyses, we identified signaling pathways that are associated with these networks and kinases that may regulate them. The results identified classical antiviral response pathways including Interferon response factors (IRFs), interferons (IFNs), and JAK-STAT signaling as key elements upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to mock-treated cells. In addition, comparing SARS-Cov-2 infection of airway epithelial cells to other respiratory viruses identified pathways associated with regulation of inflammation (MAPK14) and immunity (BTK, MBX) that may contribute to exacerbate organ damage linked with complications of COVID-19. The regulatory networks identified herein reflect a combination of experimentally validated hits and novel pathways supporting the computational pipeline to quickly narrow down promising avenue of investigations when facing an emerging and novel disease such as COVID-19.",

However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in human macrophages. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome replication only occurs in the presence of a co-infecting helper virus such as adenovirus type 5 (AdV5) or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). AdV5-supported replication of the AAV genome has been described to occur in a strand-displacement rolling hairpin replication (RHR) mechanism initiated at the AAV 3 inverted terminal repeat (ITR) end. It has been assumed that the same mechanism applies to HSV-1-supported AAV genome replication. Using nanopore sequencing as a novel, high-throughput approach to study viral genome replication we demonstrate the formation of double-stranded head-to-tail concatemers of AAV genomes in the presence of HSV-1, thus providing evidence for an unequivocal rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism. This stands in contrast to the textbook model of AAV genome replication when HSV-1 is the helper virus.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEEfficient adeno-associated virus (AAV) replication requires the presence of helper factors, which can be provided by co-infecting helper viruses such as adenoviruses or herpesviruses. AAV replication has been described to occur as a rolling hairpin replication mechanism. However, we show that during a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) supported replication, AAV rolling circle-like replication intermediates are formed. Thus, this study stands in contrast to the textbook model of AAV genome replication. Additionally, we introduce nanopore sequencing as a novel, high-throughput approach to study viral genome replication in unprecedented detail.",

    "abstract": "Membrane Vesicles (MVs) are membrane-bound spherical nanostructures that prevail in all three domains of life. In Gram-negative bacteria, MVs are thought to be produced through blebbing of the outer membrane and are often referred to as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). We have recently described another mechanism of MV biogenesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that involves explosive cell lysis events which shatters cellular membranes into fragments that rapidly anneal into MVs. Interestingly, MVs are often observed within preparations of lytic bacteriophage, however the source of these MVs and their association with bacteriophage infection has not been explored. In this study we aimed to determine if MV biogenesis is associated with lytic bacteriophage infection. Live super-resolution microscopy demonstrated that explosive cell lysis of E. coli cells infected with either bacteriophage T4 or T7, produced MVs derived from shattered membrane fragments. Infection by either bacteriophage was also associated with the formation of membrane blebs on intact bacteria. TEM revealed multiple classes of MVs within phage lysates, consistent with multiple mechanisms of MV biogenesis. These findings suggest that bacteriophage infection may be a major contributor to the abundance of bacterial MVs in nature.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) that spread through human populations worldwide in early 2020. CoVs rely on host cell proteases for activation and infection. The trypsin-like protease TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, cathepsin L in endolysosomes, and furin in the Golgi have all been implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic processing. Whether SARS-CoV-2 depends on endocytosis internalization and vacuolar acidification for infectious entry remains unclear. Here, we examined the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 activation during the cell entry process in tissue culture. Using four cell lines representative of lung, colon, and kidney epithelial tissues, we found that TMPRSS2 determines the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. In TMPRSS2-positive cells, infection was sensitive to aprotinin, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, but not to SB412515, a drug that impairs cathepsin L. Infectious penetration was marginally dependent on endosomal acidification, and the virus passed the protease-sensitive step within 10 min. In a marked contrast, in TMPRSS2-negative cells cathepsin L and low pH were required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The cathepsin L-activated penetration occurred within 40-60 min after internalization and required intact endolysosomal functions. Importantly, pre-activation of the virus allowed it to bypass the need for endosomal acidification for viral fusion and productive entry. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other CoVs a strategy of differential use of host cell proteases for activation and infectious penetration. This study also highlights the importance of TMPRSS2 in dictating the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSignificancePreventing SARS-CoV-2 spread requires approaches affecting early virus-host cell interactions before the virus enters and infects target cells. Host cell proteases are critical for coronavirus activation and infectious entry. Here, we reconcile apparent contradictory observations from recent reports on endosomal acidification and the role of furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L in the productive entry and fusion process of SARS-CoV-2. Investigating authentic virus in various cell types, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 developed the ability to use different entry pathways, depending on the proteases expressed by the target cell. Our results have strong implications for future research on the apparent broad tropism of the virus in vivo. This study also provides a handle to develop novel antiviral strategies aiming to block virus entry, as illustrated with the several drugs that we identified to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, some with low IC50.",

Nevertheless, the dearth of information regarding the antiviral mechanism of this family of proteins necessitates further examination. In this study, using both the human MARCH proteins and their mouse homologues, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the antiretroviral mechanism of this family of proteins.

    "abstract": "Newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic leading to severe respiratory disease in humans. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe respiratory dysfunction that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may effectively reduce airway barrier damage and mitigate virus spread.",

Pupa adhesion has evolved multiple times in insects and is thought to maintain the animal in a place where it is not detectable by predators. Here, we investigate whether pupa adhesion in Drosophila can also protect the animal by preventing potential predators from detaching the pupa. We measured the adhesion of Drosophila species sampled from the same area and found that pupa adhesion varies among species, which can be explained by different glue production strategies. Then, we compared attached and manually detached pupae in both field and laboratory assays to investigate the role of pupa adhesion to prevent predation. First, we found that attached pupae remain on site 30 % more than detached pupae in the field after three days, probably because they are less predated. Second, we observed that attached pupae are less efficiently predated by ants in the laboratory: they are not carried back to the ant nest and more ants are needed to consume them onsite. Our results show that pupa adhesion can prevent the animal from being taken away by predators and is crucial for Drosophila fly survival.",

Revealing remarkable convergence on the molecular hallmarks of natural viruses, the accompanying changes reorganized the protein building blocks into an interlaced 240-subunit icosahedral capsid impermeable to nucleases, while emergence of a robust RNA stem-loop packaging cassette ensured high encapsidation yields and specificity.

    "abstract": "The ribosome is a molecular machine that adopts at least two global states during translation. Two main steps of translation, peptidyl transfer and translocation, are accompanied by counterclockwise and clockwise rotations of the two ribosomal subunits. However, when and why the ribosome alternates between these states remains unclear, with two well supported but conflicting hypotheses. Ribosomes may undergo a single cycle of forward and backward rotations per codon read. Alternatively, in addition to rotations caused by peptidyl transfer and translocation, ribosomes may undergo multiple full spontaneous rotations, with these rotations playing a critical role in elongation and specifically in translocation mechanism. We applied high-speed single-molecule TIRF microscopy to follow translation in real-time. Actively translating ribosomes undergo partial spontaneous rotations between three different rotational states. Spontaneous rotations are restricted prior to A-site tRNA decoding. Peptidyl transfer unlocks spontaneous rotations. Consequently, translocation proceeds via a novel rotational state induced by EF-G. Our results bridge both models and provide a coherent view of ribosome dynamics during translation.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The dimeric form of the viral main protease is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein in 11 sites, including its own N and C-terminus. Although several mechanisms of self-cleavage had been proposed for SARS-CoV, the lack of structural information for each step is a setback to the understanding of this process. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography to characterize an immature form of the main protease, which revealed major conformational changes in the positioning of domain-three over the active site, hampering the dimerization and diminishing its activity. We propose that this form preludes the cis-cleavage of N-terminal residues within the dimer, leading to the mature active site. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the main protease bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during the formation of the tetramer. This quaternary form is also present in solution, suggesting a transitional state during the C-terminal trans-cleavage. This data sheds light in the structural modifications of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease during maturation, which can guide the development of new inhibitors targeting its intermediary states.",

We identified six high affinity molecules with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (15-550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could be used as an affinity reagent to detect spike protein in solution by ELISA, and the co-crystal structure of this molecule bound to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site, displacing a {beta}-strand near the C-terminus.

As an alternative to direct pharmacological inhibition of Ras, we looked for sensitivities in RAS mutant cells. Using a small molecule screen in cell lines with mutations in Ras and its effector Raf, we discovered 249C as a Ras-mutant selective cytotoxic agent against a spectrum of RAS-mutant cancers. By combining CRISPR chemical-genetic screening, comparative profiling and chemoproteomics, we identified that 249C binds to a unique subunit on vacuolar (V)-ATPase with nanomolar affinity, inhibiting its biochemical activity and, unexpectedly, altering V-ATPase translocation in Ras-induced macropinocytosis. Via binding to V-ATPase, 249C prevents lysosomal acidification and inhibits autophagy and macropinocytosis pathways that several Ras-driven cancers rely on for survival. In characterizing 249Cs mechanism, we show that potency varies with the identity of the RAS driver mutation highlighting a mutant-specific dependence on autophagy and macropinocytosis. Indeed, 249C potently inhibits tumor growth without adverse side effects in a mouse xenograft model of KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting V-ATPase as a way to indirectly target specific Ras mutants, and provide a fundamental link between V-ATPase localization and specific Ras mutant tumor-related activity.",

Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Despite the progress observed in recent years, women are still underrepresented in science worldwide, especially at top positions. Many factors contribute to women progressively leaving academia at different stages of their career, including motherhood, harassment and conscious and unconscious discrimination. Implicit bias plays a major negative role in recognition, promotions and career advancement of female scientists. Recently, a rank on the most influential scientists in the world was created based on several metrics, including the number of published papers and citations. Here, we analyzed the representation of Brazilian scientists in this rank, focusing on gender. Female Brazilian scientists are greatly underrepresented in the rank (11% in the Top 100,000; 18% in the Top 2%). Male scientists have more self-citation than female scientists and positions in the rank varied when self-citations were included, suggesting that self-citation by male scientists increases their visibility. Moreover, male scientists had more papers never cited than female scientists. Possible reasons for this observed scenario are related to the metrics used to rank scientists, since these metrics reproduce and amplify the well-known implicit bias in peer-review and citations. Discussions on the repercussions of such ranks are pivotal to avoid deepening the gender gap in science.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of microbial metabolism is an effective strategy to improve chemical production in fermentations. While dynamic control is most often implemented using chemical inducers, optogenetics offers an attractive alternative due to the high tunability and reversibility afforded by light. However, a major concern of applying optogenetics in metabolic engineering is the risk of insufficient light penetration at high cell densities, especially in large bioreactors. Here, we present a new series of optogenetic circuits we call OptoAMP, which amplify the transcriptional response to blue light by as much as 21.8-fold compared to the basal circuit (OptoEXP). These circuits show as much as a 41-fold induction between dark and light conditions, efficient activation at light doses as low as ~1%, and strong homogeneous light-induction in bioreactors of at least 5L, with limited illumination at cell densities above 40 OD600. We demonstrate the ability of OptoAMP circuits to control engineered metabolic pathways in novel three-phase fermentations using different light schedules to control enzyme expression and improve production of lactic acid, isobutanol, and naringenin. These circuits expand the applicability of optogenetics to metabolic engineering.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe {beta}-amyloid peptide (A{beta}) plays a key role in Alzheimers disease. After its production by catabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the action of presenilin 1 (PS1)- or presenilin 2 (PS2)-dependent {gamma}-secretases, monomeric A{beta} can assemble in oligomers. In a pathological context, this eventually leads to the formation of fibrils, which deposit in senile plaques. Many studies suggest that A{beta} toxicity is related to its soluble oligomeric intermediates. Among these, our interest focuses on hexameric A{beta}, which acts as a nucleus for A{beta} self-assembly.\n\nMethodsBiochemical analyses were used to identify hexameric A{beta} in a wide range of models; cell lines, cerebrospinal fluid from cognitively impaired patients and transgenic mice exhibiting human A{beta} pathology (5xFAD). We isolated this assembly and assessed both its effect on primary neuron viability in vitro, and its contribution to amyloid deposition in vivo following intracerebral injection. In both cases, we used wild-type mice (C57BL/6) to mimic an environment where hexameric A{beta} is present alone and 5xFAD mice to incubate hexameric A{beta} in a context where human A{beta} species are pre-existing. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we produced stable knockdown human cell lines for either PS1 or PS2 to elucidate their contribution to the formation of hexameric A{beta}.\n\nResultsIn WT mice, we found that neither in vitro or in vivo exposure to hexameric A{beta} was sufficient to induce cytotoxic effects or amyloid deposition. In 5xFAD mice, we observed a significant increase in neuronal death in vitro following exposure to 5M hexameric A{beta}, as well as a 1.47-fold aggravation of amyloid deposition in vivo. At the cellular level, we found hexameric A{beta} in extracellular vesicles and observed a strong decrease in its excretion when PS2 was knocked down by 60%.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate the absence of cytotoxic effects of cell-derived hexameric A{beta} by itself, but its capacity to aggravate amyloid deposition by seeding other A{beta} species. We propose an important role for PS2 in the formation of this particular assembly in vesicular entities, in line with previous reports linking the restricted location of PS2 in acidic compartments to the production of more aggregation-prone A{beta}.",

    "abstract": "Retinal photoreceptors undergo daily renewal of their distal outer segments, a process indispensable for maintaining retinal health. Photoreceptor Outer Segment (POS) phagocytosis occurs as a daily peak, roughly about one hour after light onset. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms which initiate this process are still unknown. Here we show that, under constant darkness, mice deficient for core circadian clock genes (Per1 and Per2), lack a daily peak in POS phagocytosis. By qPCR analysis we found that core clock genes were rhythmic over 24h in both WT and Per1, Per2 double mutant whole retinas. More precise transcriptomics analysis of laser capture microdissected WT photoreceptors revealed no differentially, expressed genes between time-points preceding and during the peak of POS phagocytosis. By contrast, we found that microdissected WT retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) had a number of genes that were differentially expressed at the peak phagocytic time-point compared to adjacent ones. We also found a number of differentially expressed genes in Per1, Per2 double mutant RPE compared to WT ones at the peak phagocytic time-point. Finally, based on STRING analysis we found a group of interacting genes which potentially drive POS phagocytosis in the RPE. This potential pathway consists of genes such as: Pacsin1, Syp, Camk2b and Camk2d among others. Our findings indicate that Per1 and Per2 are necessary clock components for driving POS phagocytosis and suggest that this process is transcriptionally driven by the RPE.\n\nDeclarationsO_ST_ABSFundingC_ST_ABSThis project has been funded with support from the NeuroTime Erasmus+ grant (European Union), Rotterdamse Stichting Blindenbelangen (Netherlands), Nelly Reef fund (Netherlands), Stichting voor Ooglijders (Netherlands), Stichting tot Verbetering van het Lot der Blinden (Netherlands) and Retina France (France).\n\nConflicts of interest/Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\nAvailability of data and materialData supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article and are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\n\nCode availabilityThe R code for analysis is available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\n\nEthics approvalAll experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement on Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, as well as with the European Union Directive (2010/63/EU).\n\nConsent to participateNot applicable\n\nConsent for publicationAll authors read and approve of the contents of this manuscript.\n\nAuthor contributionsN.M. performed experiments, analysis, prepared figures, wrote the manuscript and obtained funding.

    "abstract": "The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines to meet a worldwide need. mRNA-based vaccines are the most promising technology for rapid and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and production. We have designed CVnCoV, a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated, sequence optimised mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that encodes for full length, pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein. Unlike other mRNA-based approaches, CVnCoV exclusively consists of non-chemically modified nucleotides and can be applied at comparatively low doses. Here we demonstrate that CVnCoV induces robust humoral and cellular responses in non-human primates (NHPs). Animals vaccinated with 8 g of CVnCoV were protected from challenge infection with SARS-CoV-2. Comprehensive analyses of pathological changes in challenged animals via lung histopathology and Computed Tomography (CT) scans gave no indication of enhanced disease upon CVnCoV vaccination. These results demonstrate safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of CVnCoV in NHPs that extend our previously published preclinical data and provide strong support for further clinical testing in ongoing phase 2b/3 efficacy studies.",

However, the antibody persistence over 3 months post immunization and the long-term memory have been rarely reported.

Significantly higher number of memory B cells were maintained and a significantly higher level of recall response was induced upon antigen challenge.

    "abstract": "Use of high-throughput sequencing is widespread in efforts to understand the microbial communities in natural and engineered systems. Many built ecosystems, in particular those used for engineered wastewater treatment, have harnessed the metabolic capacity of complex microbial communities for the effective removal and recovery of organic pollutants. Recent efforts to better understand and precisely engineer such systems have increasingly used high-throughput sequencing to map the structure and function of wastewater treatment microbiomes. An enormous amount of data is readily available on online repositories such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information Short Read Archive (NCBI SRA). Here, we describe and provide an optimised meta-analysis workflow to utilise this resource to collate heterogenous studies together for anaerobic digestion research. We analysed 16S rRNA gene Illumina Miseq amplicon sequencing data from 31 anaerobic digestion studies (from high-rate digesters), including >1,300 samples. Additionally, we compare several methodological choices: extraction method, v-region, taxonomical database, and the classifier. We demonstrate that collation of data from multiple v-regions can be achieved by using only the taxa for which sequences are available in the reference databases, without losses in diversity trends. This is made possible by focusing on alternative strategies for taxonomic assignments, namely, bayesian lowest common ancestor (BLCA) algorithm which offers increased resolution to the traditional naive bayesian classifier (NBC). While we demonstrate this using an anaerobic digestion wastewater treatment dataset, this methodology can be translated to perform meta-analysis on amplicon sequences in any field. These findings not only provide a roadmap for meta-analysis in any field, but additionally provide an opportunity to reuse extensive data resources to ultimately advance knowledge of wastewater treatment systems.\n\nImportanceIn this study, we have combined sequencing data from 31 individual studies with the purpose of identifying a meta-analysis workflow which can accurately collate data derived from sequencing different v-regions with minimal data loss and more accurate diversity patterns. While we have used Anaerobic Digestion (AD) communities for our proof-of-concept, our workflow (Fig 1) can be translated to any Illumina MiSeq meta-analysis study, in any field. Thereby, we provide the foundation for intensive data mining of existing amplicon sequencing resources. Such data-mining can provide a global perspective on complex microbial communities.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/424166v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11fe518org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f9a6eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3e5af0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c45734_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Overview of the meta-analysis workflow to assess the protocols used in the analysis of AD microbiomes.\n\nC_FIG Graphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/424166v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1392216org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecd922org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a35894org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7fc0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Measles virus (MeV) is resurgent and caused >200,000 deaths in 2019. MeV infection can establish a chronic latent infection of the brain that can recrudesce months to years after recovery from the primary infection. Recrudescent MeV leads to fatal subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) or measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) as the virus spreads across multiple brain regions. Most clinical isolates of SSPE/MIBE strains show mutations in the fusion (F) gene that result in a hyperfusogenic phenotype in vitro and allow for efficient spread in primary human neurons. Wild-type MeV receptor binding protein (RBP) is indispensable for manifesting these mutant F phenotypes, even though neurons lack canonical MeV receptors (CD150/SLAMF1 or Nectin-4). How such hyperfusogenic F mutants are selected for, and whether they confer a fitness advantage for efficient neuronal spread is unresolved. To better understand the fitness landscape that allows for the selection of such hyperfusogenic F mutants, we conducted a screen of [&ge;]3.1x105 MeV-F point mutants in their genomic context. We rescued and amplified our genomic MeV-F mutant libraries in BSR-T7 cells under conditions where MeV-F-T461I (a known SSPE mutant), but not wild-type MeV can spread. We recovered known SSPE mutants but also characterized at least 15 novel hyperfusogenic F mutations with a SSPE phenotype. Structural mapping of these mutants onto the pre-fusion MeV-F trimer confirm and extend our understanding of the fusion regulatory domains in MeV-F. Our list of hyperfusogenic F mutants is a valuable resource for future studies into MeV neuropathogenesis and the regulation of paramyxovirus fusion.\n\nSignificanceMeasles remains a major cause of infant death globally. On rare occasions, measles virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to a fatal progressive inflammation of the brain many years after the initial infection. MeV isolates from such CNS infections harbor fusion (F) protein mutations that result in a hyperfusogenic phenotype. The small number of hyperfusogenic MeV-F mutants identified thus far limits our ability to understand how these mutations are selected in the context of CNS infections. We performed a saturating mutagenesis screen of MeV-F to identify a large set of mutants that would mimic the hyperfusogenic phenotype of MeV-F in CNS infection. Characterization of these mutants shed light on other paramyxoviruses known to establish chronic CNS infections.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection causes broad-spectrum immunopathological disease, exacerbated by inflammatory co-morbidities. A better understanding of mechanisms underpinning virus-associated inflammation is required to develop effective therapeutics. Here we discover that SARS-CoV-2 replicates rapidly in lung epithelial cells despite triggering a robust innate immune response through activation of cytoplasmic RNA-ensors RIG-I and MDA5. The inflammatory mediators produced during epithelial cell infection can stimulate primary human macrophages to enhance cytokine production and drive cellular activation. Critically, this can be limited by abrogating RNA sensing, or by inhibiting downstream signalling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 further exacerbates the local inflammatory environment when macrophages or epithelial cells are primed with exogenous inflammatory stimuli. We propose that RNA sensing of SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelium is a key driver of inflammation, the extent of which is influenced by the inflammatory state of the local environment, and that specific inhibition of innate immune pathways may beneficially mitigate inflammation-associated COVID-19.\n\nHighlightsO_LISARS-CoV-2 activates RNA sensors and consequent inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial RNA sensing responses drive pro-inflammatory macrophage activation\nC_LIO_LIExogenous inflammatory stimuli exacerbate responses to SARS-CoV-2 in both eplithelial cells and macrophages\nC_LIO_LIImmunomodulators inhibit RNA sensing responses and consequent macrophage inflammation\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/424169v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (65K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b07adborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@51ddf7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c38f9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@108db57_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Brucella ovis is an ovine intracellular pathogen with tropism for the male genital tract. To establish and maintain infection, B. ovis must survive stressful conditions inside host cells, including low pH, nutrient limitation, and reactive oxygen species. These same conditions are often encountered in axenic cultures during stationary phase. Studies of stationary phase may thus inform understanding of Brucella infection biology, yet the genes and pathways that are important in Brucella stationary phase physiology remain poorly defined. We measured fitness of a barcoded pool of B. ovis Tn-himar mutants as a function of growth phase and identified cysE as a determinant of fitness in stationary phase. CysE catalyzes the first step in cysteine biosynthesis from serine, and we provide genetic evidence that two related enzymes, CysK1 and CysK2, function redundantly to catalyze cysteine synthesis at steps downstream of CysE. Deleting either cysE ({Delta}cysE) or both cysK1 and cysK2 ({Delta}cysK1 {Delta}cysK2) results in premature entry into stationary phase, reduced culture yield and sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These phenotypes can be chemically complemented by cysteine or glutathione. {Delta}cysE and {Delta}cysK1 {Delta}cysK2 strains have no defect in host cell entry in vitro but have significantly diminished intracellular fitness between 2 and 24 hours post infection. Our study has uncovered unexpected redundancy at the CysK step of cysteine biosynthesis in B. ovis, and demonstrates that cysteine anabolism is a determinant of peroxide stress survival and fitness in the intracellular niche.",

    "abstract": "Timely development of vaccines and antiviral drugs is critical to control the COVID-19 pandemic 1-6. Current methods for quantifying vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies involve the use of pseudoviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) pseudotyped lentivirus7-14. However, these pseudoviruses contain structural proteins foreign to SARS-CoV-2, and require days to infect and express reporter genes15. Here we describe the development of a new hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 (Ha-CoV-2) particle for rapid and accurate quantification of neutralization antibodies and viral variants. Ha-CoV-2 is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle, composed of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a RNA genome derived from a fast expressing alphavirus vector 16. We demonstrated that Ha-CoV-2 can rapidly and robustly express reporter genes in target cells within 3-6 hours. We further validated Ha-CoV-2 for rapid quantification of neutralization antibodies, viral variants, and antiviral drugs. In addition, as a proof-of-concept, we assembled and compared the relative infectivity of a panel of 10 Ha-CoV-2 variant isolates (D614G, P.1, B.1.1.207, B.1.351, B.1.1.7, B.1.429, B.1.258, B.1.494, B.1.2, B.1.1298), and demonstrated that these variants in general are 2-10 fold more infectious. Furthermore, we quantified the anti-serum from an infected and vaccinated individual; the one dose vaccination with Moderna mRNA-1273 has greatly increased the anti-serum titer for approximately 6 fold. The post-vaccination serum has also demonstrated various neutralizing activities against all 9 variants tested. These results demonstrated that Ha-CoV-2 can be used as a robust platform for rapid quantification of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosinases from both a commercial semi-purified Agaricus bisporus protein extract and directly isolated from white mushroom have been demonstrated to show antiviral activity against the Hepatitis C virus for the first time. The well-known tyrosinase from A. bisporus (TyrAB) of 45kDa and a newly discovered 50-kDa isoform from this tyrosinase (Tyr50kDa) have been tested. Cell toxicity and antiviral activity of tyrosinases in cultured Huh 5-2 liver tumor cells transfected with a replicon system (a plasmid that includes all non-structural Hepatitis C virus proteins and replicates autonomously) was determined. Native TyrAB was able to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus without inducing toxicity in liver cells. In addition, the post-translational isoform of Tyr50kDa showed higher antiviral capacity than the former (up to 10 times greater), also exhibiting 10 times higher activity than the commercial drug Ribavirin(R). This antiviral activity was directly proportional to the enzymatic activity of tyrosinases, since no antiviral capacity was observed for the inactive enzymes. The tyrosinases approach could represent a new antiviral inhibition mechanism, through a catalytic mechanism of selective hydroxylation of key role tyrosine residues in viral proteases. The tyrosinases directly extracted from fresh mushrooms (containing both tyrosinases) showed similar antiviral activity and, therefore, might provide low-cost drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C.",

    "abstract": "Crop-associated microbiota are key factors affecting host health and productivity. Most crops are grown within heterogeneous landscapes, and interactions between management practices and landscape context often affect plant and animal biodiversity in agroecosystems. However, whether these same factors typically affect crop-associated microbiota is less clear. Here, we assessed whether orchard management strategies and landscape context affected bacterial and fungal communities in pear (Pyrus communis) flowers. We found that bacteria and fungi responded differently to management schemes. Organically-certified orchards had higher fungal diversity in flowers than conventional or bio-based integrated pest management (IPM) orchards, but organic orchards had the lowest bacterial diversity. Orchard management scheme also best predicted the distribution of several important bacterial and fungal genera that either cause or suppress disease, with organic and bio-based IPM best explaining the distributions of bacterial and fungal genera, respectively. Moreover, patterns of bacterial and fungal diversity were affected by interactions between management, landscape context, and climate. When examining the similarity of bacterial and fungal communities across sites, both abundance- and taxa-related turnover were mediated primarily by orchard management scheme and landscape context, and specifically the amount of land in cultivation. Our study reveals local- and landscape-level drivers of floral microbiome structure in a major fruit crop, providing insights that can inform microbiome management to promote host health and high-yielding quality fruit.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn tree fruits, proper crop management during bloom is essential for producing disease-free fruit. Tree fruits are often grown in heterogeneous landscapes; however, few studies have assessed whether landscape context and crop management affect the floral microbiome, which plays a critical role in shaping plant health and disease tolerance. Such work is key for identification of tactics and/or contexts where beneficial microbes proliferate, and pathogenic microbes are limited. Here, we characterize the floral microbiome of pear crops in Washington State, USA, where major production occurs in inter-mountain valleys and basins with variable elevation and microclimates. Our results show that both local (crop management) and landscape (habitat types and climate) level factors affect floral microbiota, but in disparate ways for each kingdom, suggesting a need for unique management strategies for each group. More broadly, these findings can potentially inform microbiome management in orchards for promotion of host health and high-quality yields.",

    "abstract": "We recently identified a new cellular structure in yeast, called the Mitochondrial-Derived Compartment (MDC), that forms on mitochondria in response to amino acid excess. While emerging evidence supports an important function for MDCs in protecting cells from metabolic stress, whether this system exists beyond yeast remains unclear. Here, we show that MDCs are conserved in mammals, and like their yeast counterparts, are responsive to the intracellular amino acid content. Specifically, we find that inhibition of protein translation stimulates formation of dynamic, micron-sized compartments that associate with the mitochondrial network. These compartments are enriched for the carrier receptor Tomm70A and other select mitochondrial outer and inner membrane cargo, associate with the ER membrane, and require the conserved GTPase Miro1 for formation. Mammalian MDCs are responsive to changes in amino acid levels during translation inhibition, and are not activated by other common cellular stressors. Thus, MDCs represent an evolutionarily conserved nutrient-responsive mitochondrial remodeling system.",

    "abstract": "Plant cells are surrounded by a cell wall, a rigid structure that is not only important for cell and organ shape, but crucial for intercellular communication and interactions with the environment. In the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the 17 members of the Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) receptor kinase family are involved in a multitude of physiological and developmental processes, making it difficult to assess their primary or ancestral function. To reduce genetic complexity, we characterized the single CrRLK1L gene of Marchantia polymorpha, MpFERONIA (MpFER). Plants with reduced MpFER levels show defects in vegetative development, i.e., rhizoid formation and cell expansion, and have reduced male fertility. In contrast, Mpfer null mutants and overexpression lines severely affect cell integrity and morphogenesis of the gametophyte. Thus, the CrRLK1L gene family originated from a single gene with an ancestral function in cell expansion and the maintenance of cellular integrity. During land plant evolution, this ancestral gene diversified to fulfil a multitude of specialized physiological and developmental and roles in the formation of both gametophytic and sporophytic structures essential to the life cycle of flowering plants.\n\nSummary statementThe CrRLK1L family arose in land plants and the Marchantia polymorpha genome contains a single copy, MpFER, which is broadly expressed and regulates cell expansion and cell wall integrity.",

    "abstract": "High-impact pathogenic variants in more than 1,000 protein-coding genes cause Mendelian forms of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including the newly reported AGO2 gene. This study describes the molecular and clinical characterization of 28 probands with NDD harboring heterozygous AGO1 coding variants. De novo status was always confirmed when parents were available (26/28). A total of 15 unique variants leading to amino acid changes or deletions were identified: 12 missense variants, two in-frame deletions of one codon, and one canonical splice variant leading to a deletion of two amino acid residues. Some variants were recurrently identified in several unrelated individuals: p.(Phe180del), p.(Leu190Pro), p.(Leu190Arg), p.(Gly199Ser), p.(Val254Ile) and p.(Glu376del). AGO1 encodes the Argonaute 1 protein, which functions in gene-silencing pathways mediated by small non-coding RNAs. Three-dimensional protein structure predictions suggest that these variants might alter the flexibility of the AGO1 linkers domains, which likely would impair its function in mRNA processing. Affected individuals present with intellectual disability of varying severity, as well as speech and motor delay, autistic behavior and additional behavioral manifestations. Our study establishes that de novo coding variants in AGO1 are involved in a novel monogenic form of NDD, highly similar to AGO2 phenotype.",

Here, using a knock-in mouse model homozygous for A391T, we show that the schizophrenia-associated variant changes protein glycosylation in the brain. N-linked glycosylation was most significantly impaired, with effects differing between regions. RNAseq analysis showed negligible regional variation, consistent with changes in the activity of glycosylation enzymes rather than gene expression. Finally, nearly one third of detected glycoproteins were differentially N-glycosylated in the cortex, including members of several pathways previously implicated in schizophrenia such as cell adhesion molecules and neurotransmitter receptors. These findings provide a mechanistic link between a risk allele and biochemical changes in the brain, furthering our molecular understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Early life stress (ELS) presents an important risk factor for drug addiction and comorbid depression and anxiety through persistent effects on the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathways1. Using an ELS model for child neglect (a single 24 h episode of maternal deprivation, MD) in rats, recent published works from our lab show that MD induces dysfunction in ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons 2-4 and its negative controller, the lateral habenula (LHb) 5-7. In regard to LHb, MD-induced potentiation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons shifts the coordination of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance towards excitation, resulting in an increase in the overall spontaneous neuronal activity with elevation in bursting and tonic firing, and intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons in early adolescent male rats 5-7. Here, we explored how MD affects intravenous morphine self-administration (MSA) acquisition and sucrose preference as well as glutamatergic synaptic function in LHb neurons of adult male rats self-administering morphine. We found that MD-induced increases in LHb neuronal and glutamatergic synaptic activity and E/I ratio persisted into adulthood. Moreover, MD significantly reduced morphine intake, triggered anhedonia-like behavior in the sucrose preference test (SPT), and was associated with persistent glutamatergic potentiation 24h after the last MSA session. MSA also triggered postsynaptic glutamatergic potentiation in LHb neurons of control rats during this time period. Our data highlights that ELS-induced glutamatergic plasticity in LHb may dampen the positive reinforcing properties of natural rewards and opioids, and contribute to the development of anhedonic and dysphoric states associated with opioids.",

    "abstract": "Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) assemble hair-like surface structures termed pili or fimbriae to initiate infection of the urinary tract. P pili mediate the adherence of UPEC to the kidney epithelium, facilitating bacterial colonization and pyelonephritis1. P pili are assembled through the conserved chaperone-usher (CU) pathway2-4. In this pathway, a dedicated chaperone facilitates the folding of nascent pilus subunits in the periplasm and an integral outer membrane (OM) protein termed the usher provides the assembly platform and secretion channel for the pilus fiber. Much of the structural and functional understanding of the CU pathway has been gained through investigations of type 1 pili, which promote UPEC binding to the bladder epithelium and the development of cystitis5. In contrast, the structural basis for P pilus biogenesis at the usher has remained elusive. This is in part due to the flexible and variable-length P pilus tip fiber, creating structural heterogeneity, as well as difficulties in isolating stable P pilus assembly intermediates from bacteria. Here, we have devised a method to circumvent these hindrances and determined cryo-EM structures of the activated PapC usher in the process of secreting two- and three-subunit P pilus assembly intermediates. These structures show processive steps in P pilus biogenesis, reveal differences between P and type 1 pili, and capture new conformational dynamics of the usher assembly machine.",

    "abstract": "Retroviral integration requires the stable insertion of the viral genome into the host chromosomes. During this process, the functional integration complex must associate with cellular chromatin via the interaction between retroviral integrase and nucleosomes. The final association between the HIV-1 integration complex and the nucleosomal target DNA remains unclear and may involve the chromatin-binding properties of both the retroviral integrase and its cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75. To date, there is no experimental system allowing the direct monitoring of this protein association with chromatin to depict the molecular mechanism of this process fully. To investigate this and understand the LEDGF/p75-mediated chromatin tethering of HIV-1 integrase further, we used both biochemical approaches and an unedited chromosome-binding assays. Our study revealed that retroviral IN has an intrinsic ability to bind and recognize specific chromatin regions even in the absence of its cofactor. We also showed that this integrase chromatin-binding property was modulated by the interaction with its cofactor LEDGF/p75, which redirected the enzyme to alternative chromatin regions. Using these approaches, we also better determined the chronology of efficient LEDGF/p75-mediated targeting of HIV-1 integrase to chromatin. In addition to supporting a chromatin-binding function of the integrase protein acting in concert with LEDGF/p75 for the optimal association with the nucleosomal substrate, our work precisely elucidates the mechanism of action of LEDGF/p75 in this crucial integration step.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary diversification can occur in allopatry or sympatry, can be unselected or driven by selection, and can be phenotypically manifested immediately or remain phenotypically latent until later manifestation in a newly encountered environment. Diversification of host-parasite interactions is frequently studied in the context of intrinsically selective coevolution, but the potential for host-parasite interaction phenotypes to diversify latently during parasite-blind evolution is rarely considered. Here we use a social bacterium experimentally adapted to several environments in the absence of phage to analyse allopatric diversification of latent host quality - the degree to which a host population supports a viral epidemic. Phage-blind evolution reduced host quality overall, with some bacteria becoming completely resistant to growth suppression by phage. Selective-environment differences generated only mild divergence in host-quality. However, selective environments nonetheless played a major role in shaping evolution by determining the degree of stochastic diversification among replicate populations within treatments. Ancestral motility genotype was also found to strongly shape patterns of latent hostquality evolution and diversification. These outcomes show that adaptive landscapes can differ in how they constrain stochastic diversification of a latent phenotype and that major effects of selection on biological diversification can be missed by focusing on trait means. Collectively, our findings suggest that latent-phenotype evolution (LPE) should inform host-parasite evolution theory and that diversification should be conceived broadly to include latent phenotypes.",

The blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni shows extensive variation in numbers of cercariae larvae shed and in their virulence to infected snail hosts, consistent with expected trade-offs between parasite transmission and virulence. We crossed schistosomes from two populations that differ 8-fold in cercarial shedding and in their virulence to Biomphalaria glabrata snail hosts, and determined four-week cercarial shedding profiles in F0, F1 and 376 F2 progeny from two independent crosses in inbred snails. Sequencing and linkage analysis revealed that cercarial production is polygenic and controlled by five QTLs. These QTLs act additively, explaining 28.56% of the phenotypic variation. These results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of key traits relevant to schistosome ecology can be dissected using classical linkage mapping approaches.",

    "abstract": "Studies of neural population dynamics of cell activity from monkey motor areas during reaching show that it mostly represents the generation and timing of motor behavior. We compared neural dynamics in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during the performance of a visuomotor task executed individually or cooperatively and during an observation task. In the visuomotor conditions, monkeys applied isometric forces on a joystick to guide a visual cursor in different directions, either alone or jointly with a conspecific. In the observation condition, they observed the cursors motion guided by the partner. We found that in PMd neural dynamics were widely shared across action execution and observation, with cursor motion directions more accurately discriminated than task types. This suggests that PMd encodes spatial aspects irrespective of specific behavioral demands. Furthermore, our results suggest that largest components of premotor population dynamics, which have previously been suggested to reflect a transformation from planning to movement execution, may rather reflect higher cognitive-motor processes, such as the covert representation of actions and goals shared across tasks that require movement and those that do not.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIn PMd neural dynamics is shared across action execution and mere observation\nC_LIO_LITask directional features are more accurately discriminated than action types\nC_LIO_LISpatial aspects are encoded in PMd independently from specific behavioral demands\nC_LIO_LIPMd dynamics largely reflect higher cognitive-motor processes rather than strictly motor-related functions\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Developmental control of jaw length is critical for survival. The jaw skeleton arises from neural crest mesenchyme and previously we demonstrated that these progenitors upregulate bone-resorbing enzymes including Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) when generating short quail beaks versus long duck bills. Inhibiting bone resorption or Mmp13 increases jaw length. Here, we uncover mechanisms establishing species-specific levels of Mmp13 and bone resorption. Quail show greater activation of, and sensitivity to Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF{beta}) signaling than duck; where mediators like SMADs and targets like Runx2, which bind Mmp13, become elevated. Inhibiting TGF{beta} signaling decreases bone resorption. We discover a SMAD binding element in the quail Mmp13 promoter not found in duck and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near a RUNX2 binding element that affect expression. Switching the SNPs and SMAD site abolishes TGF{beta}-sensitivity in the quail Mmp13 promoter but makes duck responsive. Thus, differential regulation of TGF{beta} signaling and Mmp13 promoter structure underlie avian jaw development and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Daily or circadian rhythms in mammals are orchestrated by a master circadian clock within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Here, cell-autonomous oscillations in gene expression, intrinsic membrane properties, and synaptic communication shape the electrical landscape of the SCN across the circadian day, rendering SCN neurons overtly more active during the day than at night. This well-accepted hallmark bioelectrical feature of the SCN has overwhelmingly emerged from studies performed on a small number of nocturnal rodent species. Therefore, for the first time, we investigate the spontaneous and evoked electrical activity of SCN neurons in a diurnal mammal. To this end, we measured the electrical activity of individual SCN neurons during the day and at night in brain slices prepared from the diurnal murid rodent Rhabdomys pumilio and then developed cutting-edge data assimilation and mathematical modelling approaches to uncover the underlying ionic mechanisms. We find that R. pumilio SCN neurons were more excited in the day than at night, recapitulating the prototypical pattern of SCN neuronal activity previously observed in nocturnal rodents. By contrast, the evoked activity of R. pumilio neurons included a prominent suppressive response that is not present in the SCN of nocturnal rodents. Our computational modelling approaches reveal transient subthreshold A-type potassium channels as the primary determinant of the suppressive response and highlight a key role for this ionic mechanism in tuning excitability of clock neurons and optimising SCN function to accommodate R. pumilios diurnal niche.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring of antimicrobial use is essential to manage the development and selection of antimicrobial resistance. A variety of indicators has become available to monitor antimicrobial use in human and animal medicine. One of them is an indicator based on defined daily dose (DDD). By using the number of DDDs used and normalizing it by the population at risk of being treated in a defined period, one can estimate the number of treatment days with antimicrobial agents in a population. For veterinary medicine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has published the European values of DDD (DDDvet) for food-producing animals. In this study, we defined Japanese defined daily doses for antimicrobial agents (DDDjp) using DDD values that we previously assigned for antimicrobial products approved for use in pigs, cattle and poultry in Japan and compared them with DDDvet values. For the comparison, the quotient of Japanese and European values (QDDD) was calculated and the effect of the administration route and the number of active substances contained in the preparation was investigated. A total of 59, 51 and 27 DDDjp values were defined for 43, 32 and 25 antimicrobial agents using the data of 269, 195 and 131 products approved for use in pigs, cattle and poultry respectively. A comparison was possible for 44, 27 and 17 pairs of DDDjp and DDDvet values for antimicrobial agents used for pigs, cattle and poultry respectively. The comparison showed median QDDD value of 0.66 and 0.63 for antimicrobial agents used for pigs and cattle respectively (P<0.01), indicating that the Japanese daily doses are significantly lower than the corresponding EMA values in these species. For the antimicrobial agents used for poultry, no siginificant difference was observed between DDDjp and DDDvet values with median QDDD value of 1.17. The difference between DDDvet and DDDjp values and absence of DDDvet values for some antimicrobial agents marketed in Japan indicate that DDDjp rather than DDDvet should be used as the basis for the calculation of antimicrobial use monitoring in farm animals in Japan.",

Our previous study showed that Ficus deltoidea (Ficus: Moraceae) is capable of increasing insulin secretion and improving tissue regeneration by reducing oxidative stress in diabetic rats. However, the assessment of treatment response is limited by the paucity of biomarkers. We aimed to evaluate the potential use of FTIR for assessing the nephroprotective effects of Ficus deltoidea (Ficus: Moraceae) in diabetic rats. A rat model of diabetes was induced using a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg body weight). Methanolic extract of F. deltoidea was administered orally at a dose of 1000 mg/kg body weight for eight weeks. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin and kidney function parameters were examined. The kidneys were subsequently subjected to FTIR and histological analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assessed the levels of oxidative stress, antioxidant, and apoptosis-related proteins in the kidney tissue. The results show, for the first time, that there is a good agreement between changes in kidney and FTIR peaks. The IR peaks (1545 cm-1 and 1511 cm-1) corresponding to amide II were restored by treatment with F. deltoidea. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the diabetic rats treated with F. deltoidea had similar clustering pattern that of the normal animals. Biochemical and histological examination further confirmed the nephroprotective effect of F. deltoidea. Thus, demonstrating how FTIR spectroscopy could be used for the diagnosis of diabetes kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that MET carriers may express deficits in motor learning and neuroplasticity, possibly deterring musicianship. Here, we compared the prevalence of the Val66Met Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) in a sample of musicians (N=50) and an ethnically matched subset from the 1000 Human Genome Project (N-424). We report no differences in genotype or allele frequencies. Results are consistent with the view that hypothesized Met-dependent deficits in neuroplasticity are either mild or can be overcome by long-term practice.",

    "abstract": "Indigenous Territories (ITs) with less centralized forest governance than Protected Areas (PAs) may represent cost-effective natural climate solutions to meet the Paris agreement. However, the literature has been limited to examining the effect of ITs on deforestation, despite the influence of anthropogenic degradation. Thus, little is known about the temporal and spatial effect of allocating ITs on carbon stocks dynamics that account for losses from deforestation and degradation. Using Amazon Basin countries and Panama, this study aims to estimate the temporal and spatial effects of ITs and PAs on carbon stocks. To estimate the temporal effects, we use annual carbon density maps, matching analysis, and linear mixed models. Furthermore, we explore the spatial heterogeneity of these estimates through geographic discontinuity designs, allowing us to assess the spatial effect of ITs and PAs boundaries on carbon stocks. The temporal effects highlight that allocating ITs preserves carbon stocks and buffer losses as PAs in Panama and Amazon Basin countries. The geographic discontinuity designs reveal that ITs boundaries secure more extensive carbon stocks than their surroundings, and this difference tends to increase towards the least accessible areas, suggesting that indigenous land use in neotropical forests may have a temporarily and spatially stable impact on carbon stocks. Our findings imply that ITs in neotropical forests support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Thus, Indigenous peoples must become recipients of countries results-based payments.",

    "abstract": "Studying a species tolerance to an ecosystems environmental conditions and its selection of available resources is relevant in ecological and evolutionary terms. Moreover, formulation of effective control strategies implicitly includes the study of habitat use and preference and niche width in anthropogenically transformed natural landscapes. Here, we evaluated whether the use, habitat preference, and niche range of the Amblyomma mixtum tick changed between stages, habitats, and seasons (summer-winter 2019) on a farm in Yopal (Casanare, Colombia). To this end, the presence and relative abundance of larvae, nymphs, and free-living adults was quantified in four different habitats according to the type of vegetation cover (Riparian Forest, Cocoa Crop, King Grass Crop, and Star Grass Paddock). Habitat availability was calculated, environmental variables were analyzed, and various indices of habitat use and preference and niche width were calculated. A. mixtums habitat use and preference and niche width changed between stages, habitat types, and time of the year. The total abundance of A. mixtum was an order of magnitude greater in summer than winter. Nymphs and larvae dominated it in the summer and adults in the winter. In summer, all the stages used the four habitats. In winter, the larvae did not use two habitats (Riparian Forest and Cocoa Crop); nymphs did not use the cocoa crop. A. mixtum adults used all the habitats in both seasons. In summer, the nymphs and larvae preferred three of the four habitats (King Grass Crop, Star Grass Paddock, and Cocoa Crops), while adults preferred the King Grass Crop. In winter, the nymphs and larvae preferred the King Grass Crop and Star Grass Paddock, while the adults preferred the King Grass Crop. The value of the niche width index was high for larvae, nymphs, and adults in summer, while it was high only for adults in winter. A. mixtum is exposed to significant daily, seasonal, and multiannual variations in relative humidity (minimum 30%), ambient temperature (minimum 18{degrees}C), solar radiation (maximum 800 W/m2), and precipitation (maximum 481 mm/month). Thus, the local A. mixtum population could rapidly acclimatize to changing habitats (unstable or temporary) under fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., King Grass Crop). However, the winter flood season in Yopal could exceed A. mixtums adaptive capacity during its most vulnerable stages. Mathematically, a low number of female A. mixtum, surviving the most demanding environmental conditions, could sufficiently ensure the populations persistence, which, coupled with the vast host range, could facilitate the ticks stages dispersal among habitats to complete their life cycle. A. mixtums population control should be carried out during its season of greater vulnerability (winter), when the population is low, particularly the females.",

    "abstract": "To gain a better understanding of the transcriptional response of Aspergillus fumigatus during invasive pulmonary infection, we used a NanoString nCounter to assess the transcript levels of 467 A. fumigatus genes during growth in the lungs of immunosuppressed mice. These genes included ones known to respond to diverse environmental conditions and those encoding most transcription factors in the A. fumigatus genome. We found that invasive growth in vivo induces a unique transcriptional profile as the organism responds to nutrient limitation and attack by host phagocytes. This in vivo transcriptional response is largely mimicked by in vitro growth in Aspergillus minimal medium that is deficient in nitrogen, iron, and/or zinc. From the transcriptional profiling data, we selected 9 transcription factor genes that were either highly expressed or strongly up-regulated during in vivo growth. Deletion mutants were constructed for each of these genes and assessed for virulence in mice. Two transcription factor genes were found to be required for maximal virulence. One was rlmA, which governs the ability of the organism to proliferate in the lung. The other was ace1, which regulates of the expression of multiple secondary metabolite gene clusters and mycotoxin genes independently of laeA. Using deletion and overexpression mutants, we determined that the attenuated virulence of the {Delta}ace1 mutant is due to decreased expression aspf1, which specifies a ribotoxin, but is not mediated by reduced expression of the fumigaclavine gene cluster or the fumagillin-pseruotin supercluster. Thus, in vivo transcriptional profiling focused on transcription factors genes provides a facile approach to identifying novel virulence regulators.\n\nAuthor summaryAlthough A. fumigatus causes the majority of cases of invasive aspergillosis, the function of most of the genes in its genome remains unknown. To identify genes encoding transcription factors that may be important for virulence, we used a NanoString nCounter to measure the mRNA levels of A. fumigatus transcription factor genes in the lungs of mice with invasive aspergillosis. The transcriptional profiling data indicate that the organism is exposed to nutrient limitation and stress during growth in the lungs, and that it responds by up-regulating genes that encode mycotoxins and secondary metabolites. In vitro, this response was most closely mimicked by growth in medium that was deficient in nitrogen, iron and/or zinc. Using the transcriptional profiling data, we identified two transcription factors that govern A. fumigatus virulence. These were RlmA, which is governs proliferation in the lung and Ace1, which controls the production of mycotoxins and secondary metabolites.",
