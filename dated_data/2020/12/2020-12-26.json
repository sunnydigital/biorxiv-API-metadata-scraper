    "abstract": "Mutational spectrum of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) does not resemble signatures of any known mutagens and variation in mtDNA mutational spectra between different tissues and organisms is still incomprehensible. Since mitochondria is tightly involved in aerobic energy production, it is expected that mtDNA mutational spectra may be affected by the oxidative damage which is increasing with cellular and organismal aging. However, the well-documented mutational signature of the oxidative damage, G>T substitutions, is typical only for the nuclear genome while it is extremely rare and age-independent in mtDNA. Thus it is still unclear if there is a mitochondria - specific mutational signature of the oxidative damage. Here, reconstructing mtDNA mutational spectra for human cancers originated from 21 tissues with various cell turnover rate, human oocytes fertilized at different ages, and 424 mammalian species with variable generation length which is a proxy for oocyte age, we observed that the frequency of AH>GH substitutions (H - heavy chain notation) is positively correlated with cellular and organismal longevity. Moreover, this mutational bias from AH to GH affects nucleotide content at the fourfold degenerative synonymous positions leading to a deficit of AH and excess of GH, which is especially pronounced in long-lived mammals. Taking into account additionally, that AH>GH is sensitive to time being single stranded during mtDNA asynchronous replication and A>G is associated with oxidative damage of single-stranded DNA in recent bacterial experiments we propose that AH>GH is a mutational signature of oxidative damage in mtDNA.",

    "abstract": "Additional gravitational cues generated by active body movements may play a role in the perception of gravitational space, but no experimental evidence has been shown on this. To investigate this possibility, we evaluated how arm movements made against gravity influenced the perceptual distortion of visual and postural vertical induced by prolonged whole-body tilt. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to perform static or dynamic arm movements during prolonged whole-body tilt and we assessed their effects on subjective visual vertical (SVV) at the tilt position (during-tilt session) and after tilting back to the upright position (post-tilt session). In Experiment 2, we evaluated how static or dynamic arm movements during prolonged tilt subsequently affected the subjective postural vertical (SPV). In Experiment 1, we observed that prolonged tilt induced the SVV shifts toward the side of body tilts in both sessions. The prolonged tilt-induced SVV shifts effectively decreased when performing dynamic arm movements in the during-tilt session, but not in the post-tilt session. In Experiment 2, the SPV shifted toward the side of prolonged body tilt, which was not significantly influenced by the performance of static or dynamic arm movements. Results of the during-tilt session suggest that the central nervous system utilizes additional cues generated by dynamic body movements for the perception of the visual vertical.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is a prominent intrinsic network that is observable in many mammalian brains. However, few studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of this network based on direct physiological recordings. Herein, we addressed this issue by characterizing the dynamics of local field potentials (LFPs) from the rat DMN during wakefulness and sleep with an exploratory analysis. We constructed a novel coactive micropattern (CAMP) algorithm to evaluate the configurations of rat DMN dynamics and further revealed the relationship between DMN dynamics with different wakefulness and alertness levels. From the gamma activity (40-80 Hz) in the DMN across wakefulness and sleep, three spatially stable CAMPs were detected: a common low-activity level micropattern (cDMN), an anterior high-activity level micropattern (aDMN) and a posterior high-activity level micropattern (pDMN). A dynamic balance across CAMPs emerged during wakefulness and was disrupted in sleep stages. In the slow-wave sleep (SWS) stage, cDMN became the primary activity pattern, whereas aDMN and pDMN were the major activity patterns in the rapid eye movement sleep (REM) stage. Additionally, further investigation revealed phasic relationships between CAMPs and the up-down states of the slow DMN activity in the SWS stage. Our study revealed that the dynamic configurations of CAMPs were highly associated with different stages of wakefulness and provided a potential three-state model to describe the DMN dynamics for wakefulness and alertness.\n\nImpact StatementIn the current study, a novel coactive micropattern method (CAMP) was developed to elucidate fast DMN dynamics during wakefulness and sleep. Our findings demonstrated that the dynamic configurations of DMN activity are specific to different wakefulness stages and provided a three-state DMN CAMP model to depict wakefulness levels, thus revealing a potentially new neurophysiological representation of alertness levels. This work could elucidate the DMN dynamics underlying different stages of wakefulness and have important implications for the theoretical understanding of the neural mechanism of wakefulness and alertness.",

Direct inference of TR binding has been limited by the resolution of Hi-C data.

    "abstract": "Metabolism plays a crucial role for cell survival and function; however, recent evidence has implicated it in regulating embryonic development. The inner cell mass undergoes orchestrated cellular divisions resulting in the formation of embryonic stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) cells. Concomitantly, changes in the metabolic profile occurs during development and are well-documented in the embryonic lineages. However, a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of these features in XEN cells remains lacking. We observed that feeder-free XEN cells exhibited high sensitivity to glycolytic inhibition in addition to maintaining elevated intra- and extracellular lactate levels. XEN cells maintain high lactate levels by increased LDHA activity and re-routing pyruvate away from the mitochondria. Importantly, exogenous lactate supplementation or promoting intracellular lactate accumulation enhances XEN differentiation in vitro. Our results highlight how lactate contributes to XEN differentiation in the mammalian embryo and may serve to enhance reprogramming efficiency of cells used for regenerative medicine.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFeeder-free XEN cells exhibit high sensitivity to glycolytic inhibition\nC_LIO_LIDistinct transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic profile exists between feeder-free ES and XEN cells\nC_LIO_LIElevated intracellular and extracellular lactate is observed in feeder-free XEN cells\nC_LIO_LILactate enhances feeder-free XEN differentiation in vitro\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cells use transporters to move protein across membranes, but the origins of the most ancient transporters are unknown. Here, we analyse the ubiquitous protein-conducting channel SecY. Features conserved by its two duplicated halves suggest that their common ancestor was an antiparallel homodimeric channel. Structural searches with SecYs halves detect exceptional similarity with the only other ubiquitous protein transporter, YidC. Their shared fold comprises a three-helix bundle interrupted by a helical hairpin. In YidC this hairpin is cytoplasmic and facilitates substrate delivery, whereas in SecY it is transmembrane and forms the substrate-binding lateral gate helices. In both, the three-helix bundle forms a protein-conducting hydrophilic groove, delimited by a conserved hydrophobic residue. We propose that SecY originated as a homodimeric YidC homolog. Many YidC homologs now use this interface to heterodimerise with a conserved partner. Unification of the two ubiquitous protein transporters would reconstruct a key step in the evolution of cells.",

    "abstract": "Past research in systems biology has taken for granted the Euclidean geometry of biological space. This has not only drawn parallels to other fields but has also been convenient due to the ample statistical and numerical optimization tools available to address the core task and downstream machine learning problems. However, emerging theoretical studies now demonstrate that biological databases exhibit hierarchical topology, characterized by heterogeneous degree distribution and a high degree of clustering, thus contradicting the flat geometry assumption. Namely, since the number of nodes in hierarchical structures grows exponentially with node depth, the biological networks naturally reside in a hyperbolic space where the circle circumference and disk area are the exponential functions of the radius. To test these claims and assess potential benefits of the applications grounded in the above hypothesis, we have developed a mathematical framework and an accompanying computational procedure for matrix factorization and implied biological relationship inference in hyperbolic space. Not only does our study demonstrate a significant increase in the accuracy of hyperbolic embedding compared to Euclidean embedding, but it also shows that the latent dimension of an optimal hyperbolic embedding is by more than an order of magnitude smaller than the latent dimension of an optimal Euclidean embedding. We see this as additional evidence that hyperbolic geometry, rather than Euclidean, underlines the biological system.",

    "abstract": "Many everyday tasks share high-level sensory goals but differ in the movements used to accomplish them. One example of this is musical pitch regulation, where the same notes can be produced using the vocal system or a musical instrument controlled by the hands. Cello playing has previously been shown to rely on brain structures within the singing network for performance of single notes, except in areas related to primary motor control, suggesting that the brain networks for auditory feedback processing and sensorimotor integration may be shared (Segado et al. 2018). However, research has shown that singers and cellists alike can continue singing/playing in tune even in the absence of auditory feedback (Chen et al. 2013, Kleber et al. 2013), so different paradigms are required to test feedback monitoring and control mechanisms. In singing, auditory pitch feedback perturbation paradigms have been used to show that singers engage a network of brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (aINS), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) when compensating for altered pitch feedback, and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and supramarginal gyrus (SMG) when ignoring it (Zarate et al. 2005, 2008). To determine whether the brain networks for cello playing and singing directly overlap in these sensory-motor integration areas, in the present study expert cellists were asked to compensate for or ignore introduced pitch perturbations when singing/playing during fMRI scanning. We found that cellists were able to sing/play target tones, and compensate for and ignore introduced feedback perturbations equally well. Brain activity overlapped for singing and playing in IPS and SMG when compensating, and pSTG and dPMC when ignoring; differences between singing/playing across all three conditions were most prominent in M1, centered on the relevant motor effectors (hand, larynx). These findings support the hypothesis that pitch regulation during cello playing relies on structures within the singing network and suggests that differences arise primarily at the level of forward motor control.\n\nHighlightsO_LIExpert cellists were asked to compensate for or ignore introduced pitch perturbations when singing/playing during fMRI scanning.\nC_LIO_LICellists were able to sing/play target tones, and compensate for and ignore introduced feedback perturbations equally well.\nC_LIO_LIBrain activity overlapped for singing and playing in IPS and SMG when compensating, and pSTG and dPMC when ignoring.\nC_LIO_LIDifferences between singing/playing across were most prominent in M1, centered around the relevant motor effectors (hand, larynx)\nC_LIO_LIFindings support the hypothesis that pitch regulation during cello playing relies on structures within the singing network with differences arising primarily at the level of forward motor control\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The majority of microbial genomes have yet to be cultured, and most proteins predicted from microbial genomes or sequenced from the environment cannot be functionally annotated. As a result, current computational approaches to describe microbial systems rely on incomplete reference databases that cannot adequately capture the full functional diversity of the microbial tree of life, limiting our ability to model high-level features of biological sequences. The scientific community needs a means to capture the functionally and evolutionarily relevant features underlying biology, independent of our incomplete reference databases. Such a model can form the basis for transfer learning tasks, enabling downstream applications in environmental microbiology, medicine, and bioengineering. Here we present LookingGlass, a deep learning model capturing a \"universal language of life\". LookingGlass encodes contextually-aware, functionally and evolutionarily relevant representations of short DNA reads, distinguishing reads of disparate function, homology, and environmental origin. We demonstrate the ability of LookingGlass to be fine-tuned to perform a range of diverse tasks: to identify novel oxidoreductases, to predict enzyme optimal temperature, and to recognize the reading frames of DNA sequence fragments. LookingGlass is the first contextually-aware, general purpose pre-trained \"biological language\" representation model for short-read DNA sequences. LookingGlass enables functionally relevant representations of otherwise unknown and unannotated sequences, shedding light on the microbial dark matter that dominates life on Earth.\n\nAvailabilityThe pretrained LookingGlass model and the transfer learning-derived models demonstrated in this paper are available in the LookingGlass release v1.01. The open source fastBio Github repository and python package provides classes and functions for training and fine tuning deep learning models with biological data2.

Here, we demonstrate a computationally redesigned natural interface for improved binding affinity could further be mutated to adopt a pH switchable interaction. The redesigned interface of Protein G-IgG Fc domain, when incorporated with histidine and glutamic acid on Protein G (PrG-EHHE), showed a switch in binding affinity by 50-fold when pH was altered from mild acidic to mild basic. The wild type (WT) interface only showed negligible switch. The overall binding affinity at mild acidic pH for PrG-EHHE outperformed the WT PrG interaction. The new reagent PrG-EHHE will be revolutionary in IgG purification since the traditional method of using an extreme acidic pH for elution can be circumvented.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=65 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/424402v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b51b0eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1036432org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a71d7forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81a29f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus spike protein, which binds to the same human receptor in both SARS-CoV-1 and 2, has been implied to be a potential source of their differential transmissibility. However, the mechanistic details of spike protein binding to its human receptor remain elusive at the molecular level. Here, we have used an extensive set of unbiased and biased microsecond-level all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins to determine the differential dynamic behavior of prefusion spike protein structure in the two viruses. Our results indicate that the active form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is more stable than that of SARS-CoV-1 and the energy barrier associated with the activation is higher in SARS-CoV-2. Our results also suggest that not only the receptor binding domain (RBD) but also other domains such as the N-terminal domain (NTD) could play a role in the differential binding behavior of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins.",

    "abstract": "B cell clones compete for entry into and dominance within germinal centers (GC), where the highest affinity BCRs are selected. However, diverse and low affinity B cells can enter and reside in GCs for extended periods. To reconcile these observations, we hypothesized that a negative feedback loop may operate within B cells to preferentially restrain high affinity clones from monopolizing the early GC niche. Here we report a role for the nuclear receptor NUR77/Nr4a1 in this process. We previously showed that NUR77 expression scales with antigen stimulation and restrains B cell expansion when T cell help is limiting. Here we show that, although NUR77 is dispensable for regulating GC size when GC are elicited in a largely clonal manner, it serves to curb immunodominance under conditions where diverse clonal populations must compete for a constrained niche. Moreover, this is independent of B cell precursor frequency and reflects, at least in part, a B cell-intrinsic role for NUR77. We propose that this is important to preserve early B cell clonal diversity in order to limit holes in the post-immune repertoire and to optimize GC selection.",

    "abstract": "Development of effective adaptive immune responses after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is predicated on recognition of viral peptides, presented in the context of HLA class II molecules, by CD4+ T-cells. We capitalised on extensive high resolution HLA data deposited in the National Marrow Donor Program registry to obtain detailed information on human HLA haplotype frequencies of twenty five human populations and used a bioinformatics approach to investigate the role of HLA polymorphism on SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity at the population and at the individual level. Within populations, we identify wide inter-individual variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity against structural, non-structural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to expressed HLA genotype. However, we find similar potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity at the population level, across all ethnic groups examined, suggesting that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after COVID-19 among different race and ethnic groups. We predict robust immune reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the basis for the majority of current vaccination efforts, both at the population and individual level, despite significant variation in Spike-derived peptide presentation by individual HLA genotypes. Finally, we provide comprehensive maps of SARS-CoV-2 proteome immunogenicity accounting for population coverage in major ethnic groups. Our findings provide important insight on the potential role of HLA polymorphism on development of protective immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination and a firm basis for further experimental studies in this field.",

    "abstract": "Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a dominant lipid component of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, plays a major role in inflammation associated with atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders. It activates inflammatory responses from macrophages, neuronal cells and endothelial cells. However, the exact mechanism by which LPC promotes inflammation remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that the production of inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxicity with LPC are both critically dependent on its ability to bring about release of ATP from cells. The induction of caspase-1-mediated IL-1{beta}-release with LPC from TLR-primed macrophages and neuronal cells is reduced in presence of ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme, apyrase and the inhibitors of purinergic signaling. ATP released from LPC-treated cells also promotes an IL-12p70hi, low phagocytic and poorly co-stimulatory phenotype in macrophages in a caspase-1 - independent manner. Treatment with apyrase reduces production of inflammatory cytokines with LPC in vivo. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated pathway for generation of inflammatory responses with LPC, and these have significant implications for therapeutic intervention in chronic inflammatory disorders promoted by this lipid.",

However, despite advances in deep repertoire sequencing, enormous TCR diversity complicates the use of TCR clonotypes as clinical biomarkers. We propose a new framework that leverages antigen-enriched repertoires to form meta-clonotypes - groups of biochemically similar TCRs - that can be used to robustly identify and quantify functionally similar TCRs in bulk repertoires. We apply the framework to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1831 public TCR meta-clonotypes from the 17 SARS-CoV-2 antigen-enriched repertoires with the strongest evidence of HLA-restriction. Applied to independent cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact amino acid matches, and 59.7% (1093/1831) were more abundant among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting HLA allele (FDR < 0.01), demonstrating the potential utility of meta-clonotypes as antigen-specific features for biomarker development. To enable further applications, we developed an open-source software package, tcrdist3, that implements this framework and facilitates flexible workflows for distance-based TCR repertoire analysis.",

AM fungi are recognised as obligate symbionts that require root colonisation to complete a life cycle involving the production of propagules, asexual spores. Recently it has been shown that Rhizophagus irregularis can produce infection-competent secondary spores asymbiotically by adding a fatty acid, palmitoleic acid. Further, asymbiotic growth can be supported using myristate as a carbon and energy source for their asymbiotic growth to increase fungal biomass. However, spore production and the ability of these spores to colonise host roots were still limited compared to co-culture of the fungus with plant roots. Here we show that a combination of two plant hormones, strigolactone and methyl jasmonate, induces production of a large number of infection-competent spores in asymbiotic cultures of Rhizophagus clarus HR1 in the presence of myristate and organic nitrogen. Inoculation of asymbiotically-generated spores promoted the growth of Welsh onions, as observed for spores produced by symbiotic culture system. Our findings provide a foundation for elucidation of hormonal control of the fungal life cycle and development of new inoculum production schemes.",

Here, to clarify whether amino acid substitutions in nsp14 affect the genomic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we searched for amino acid substitutions in nature that may interfere with nsp14 function. We found that viruses carrying a proline-to-leucine change at position 203 (P203L) have a high evolutionary rate and that a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 virus with the P203L mutation acquired more diverse genomic mutations than wild-type virus during its replication in hamsters.

LOS-induced bradykinin sensitized a transient receptor potential ion channel, TRPV1, which acts as a sensor to evoke the cough reflex. Vag8 further increased bradykinin levels by inhibiting the C1 esterase inhibitor, the major downregulator of the contact system, which generates bradykinin. PTx inhibits intrinsic negative regulation systems for TRPV1 through inactivation of Gi GTPases.

Multicellular organisms are widely distributed on Earth, and retracing the specific conditions conducive for the initial transition from unicellularity to multicellularity is difficult. However, by examining organisms that inhabit unique (e.g., isolated) environmental niches, we may be able to get a glimpse into primitive multicellularity in the context of a given environment. Here we report the discovery of a new bacterium that displayed multicellular-like characteristics and behavior. The bacterium, which was isolated adjacent to an underground stream in a limestone cave, is to be named Jeongeupia sacculi sp. nov. HS-3. On a solid surface, HS-3 self-organizes its filamentous cells to form an appearance similar to the nematic phase of a liquid crystal2. Mature colonies produce and accommodate clusters of coccobacillus progeny, and release them upon contact with water. HS-3 demonstrated novel, spatiotemporally regulated multicellularity that can resolve the so-called  competition-dispersal trade-off problem3.

PH039 acquired PARPi resistance by the third cycle of treatment and demonstrated unimpeded growth during subsequent exposure to either niraparib or rucaparib. Transcriptional profiling throughout the time course of resistance development showed widespread pathway level changes along with a marked increase in RAD51C mRNA, which reflected loss of RAD51C promoter methylation. Analysis of RAD51C methylation in patient tumor samples from the ARIEL2 Part 1 clinical trial of rucaparib monotherapy likewise indicated that loss of RAD51C methylation prior to on-study biopsy was associated with limited response. Interestingly, the PARPi resistant PH039 model remained platinum sensitive. Collectively, these results not only indicate that PARPi treatment pressure can reverse RAD51C methylation and restore RAD51C expression, but also provide an important model for studying the clinical observation that PARPi and platinum sensitivity are sometimes dissociated.",

Here we present twelve complete autopsies, including two rapid autopsies of young patients where the cause of death was Covid-19 ARDS. The main virus induced pathology was in the lung parenchyma and not in the airways. Most coagulation events occurred in the intra-alveolar and not in the intra-vascular space and the few thrombi were mainly composed of aggregated thrombocytes. The dominant inflammatory response was the massive accumulation of CD163+ macrophages and the disappearance of T killer, NK and B-cells. The virus was replicating in the pneumocytes and macrophages but not in bronchial epithelium, endothel, pericytes or stromal cells. The lung consolidations were produced by a massive regenerative response, stromal and epithelial proliferation and neovascularization. We suggest that thrombocyte aggregation inhibition, angiogenesis inhibition and general proliferation inhibition may have a roll in the treatment of advanced Covid-19 ARDS.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant recent advances in precision medicine1,2, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains near-uniformly lethal. While the most frequent genomic alterations in PDAC are not presently druggable3 and conventional therapies are often ineffective in this disease4, immune-modulatory therapies hold promise to meaningfully improve outcomes for PDAC patients. Development of such therapies requires an improved understanding of the immune evasion mechanisms that characterize the PDAC microenvironment, including frequent exclusion of antineoplastic T cells and abundance of immune-suppressive myeloid cells5-9. Here we show that cancer cell-intrinsic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) shapes the immune microenvironment to suppress antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, we find that GOT2 functions beyond its established role in the malate-aspartate shuttle10-13 and promotes the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR{delta}), facilitated by direct fatty acid binding. While GOT2 in PDAC cells is dispensable for cancer cell proliferation in vivo, GOT2 loss results in T cell-dependent suppression of tumor growth, and genetic or pharmacologic activation of PPAR{delta} restores PDAC progression in the GOT2-null context. This cancer cell-intrinsic GOT2-PPAR{delta} axis promotes spatial restriction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the tumor microenvironment, and fosters the immune-suppressive phenotype of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Our results demonstrate a non-canonical function for an established mitochondrial enzyme in transcriptional regulation of immune evasion, which may be exploitable to promote a productive antitumor immune response.",

This issue is addressed in current study.\n\nExperimental approachSB (0.3 - 2.5 g/kg) was administrated through a single peritoneal injection in mice. The core body temperature and mitochondrial function in the brain hypothalamus were monitored. Pharmacodynamics, targeted metabolomics, electron microscope, oxygen consumption rate and gene knockdown were employed to dissect the mechanism for the toxic effect.\n\nKey resultsThe temperature was reduced by SB (1.2 -2.5 g/kg) in a dose-dependent manner in mice for 2-4 hr. In the brain, the effect was associated with SB elevation and neurotransmitter (Glutamate and GABA) reduction. The mitochondria exhibited a transient volume expansion and crista loss in the hypothalamic neurons. ADP/ATP ratio was increased with accumulation of intermediate metabolites in the glycolysis, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathways. The mitochondrial protein, adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT), was activated for proton transportation leading to a transient potential collapse by proton leak. The SB activity was attenuated by ANT inhibition from gene knockdown or pharmacological blocker. The temperature drop was attenuated by i.p. injection of norepinephrine. The HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA and pyruvate, did not exhibit the same effect.\n\nConclusion and implicationsSuper-dosed SB generated an immediate and reversible toxic effect for inhibition of body temperature through transient mitochondrial reprogramming in the brain. The mechanism was quick activation of ANT proteins for the proton leak in mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "The photosynthetic capacity of mature leaves increases after several days exposure to constant or intermittent episodes of high light (HL) and is manifested primarily as changes in chloroplast physiology. This is termed dynamic acclimation but how it is initiated and controlled is unknown. From fully expanded Arabidopsis leaves, we determined HL-dependent changes in transcript abundance of 3844 genes in a 0-6h time-series transcriptomics experiment. It was hypothesised that among such genes were those that contribute to the initiation of dynamic acclimation. By focussing on HL differentially expressed transcription (co-)factor (TF) genes and applying dynamic statistical modelling to the temporal transcriptomics data, a gene regulatory network (GRN) of 47 predominantly photoreceptor-regulated (co)-TF genes was inferred. The most connected gene in this network was B-BOX DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN32 (BBX32). Plants over-expressing BBX32 were strongly impaired in dynamic acclimation and displayed perturbed expression of genes involved in its initiation. These observations led to demonstrating that as well as regulation of dynamic acclimation by BBX32, CRYPTOCHROME1, LONG HYPOCOTYL5, CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 are also important regulators of this process. Additionally, the BBX32-centric GRN provides a view of the transcriptional control of dynamic acclimation distinct from other photoreceptor-regulated processes, such as seedling photomorphogenesis.",

The neural mechanisms underlying this change in facial attractiveness according to beauty retouching level remain unknown. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging in women as they viewed photos of their own face or unknown faces that had been retouched at three levels: no, mild, and extreme. The activity in the nucleus accumbens (NA) exhibited a positive correlation with facial attractiveness, whereas amygdala activity showed a negative correlation with attractiveness. Even though the participants rated others faces as more attractive than their own, the NA showed increased activity only for their mildly retouched own face and the amygdala exhibited greater activation in the others faces condition than the own face condition. Moreover, amygdala activity was greater for extremely retouched faces than for unretouched or mildly retouched faces for both conditions. Frontotemporal and cortical midline areas showed greater activation for ones own than others faces, but such self-related activation was absent when extremely retouched. These results suggest that neural activity dynamically switches between the NA and amygdala according to perceived attractiveness of ones face.",

    "abstract": "The Pseudomonas putida group (P. putida G) is composed of at least 21 species associated to a wide range of environments, including the clinical setting. Here, we characterized 13 carbapenem-resistant P. putida G clinical isolates carrying blaVIM-2 from different hospitals of Argentina. Multilocus sequencing (MLSA) and phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rDNA, gyrB and rpoD sequences comparison allowed us to assign them to 7 well-differentiated species. Sequencing analysis revealed that blaVIM-2 genes were carried in these isolates by three different class 1 integrons (In41, In899 and In528) embedded into Tn402-like transposons. Those harboring In41 and In899 were designated Tn6335 and Tn6336, respectively, with the former found among 10 isolates. Both encompassed complete transposition modules and inverted repeats boundaries characteristic of the Tn5053/Tn402 family, whereas the third, bearing In528, exhibited a defective tni module. Tn6335 and Tn6336 were located in conjugative pLD209-type plasmids in P. asiatica, P. juntendi, P. putida G/II, and P. putida G/V isolates, and could be mobilized to Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa indicating a relevant mechanism of blaVIM-2 dissemination. In other P. asiatica and P. putida G/II isolates, Tn6335 was found inserted into the Tn21 subgroup transposons-res region, indicating capability for intragenomic mobilization and further dissemination associated to Tn3 family transposons. The Tn402-like defective element was also found inserted into the res region of another Tn3 family transposon in a P. monteilii isolate, but in an atypical orientation. Overall findings shed light on the mechanisms by which resistance genes move through environmental and opportunist Pseudomonas species.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-Mannans are hemicelluloses that are abundant in modern diets as components in seed endosperms and common additives in processed food. Currently, the collective understanding of {beta}-mannan saccharification in the human colon is limited to a few keystone species, which presumably liberate low-molecular-weight mannooligosaccharide fragments that become directly available to the surrounding microbial community. Here we show that a dominant butyrate-producer in the human gut, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is able to acquire and degrade various {beta}-mannooligosaccharides ({beta}-MOS), which are derived by the primary mannanolytic activity of neighboring gut microbiota. Detailed biochemical analyses of selected protein components from their two {beta}-mannooligosaccharides ({beta}-MOS) utilization loci (FpMULs) supported a concerted model whereby the imported {beta}-MOS are stepwise disassembled intracellularly by highly adapted enzymes. Coculturing experiments of F. prausnitzii with the primary degrader Bacteroides ovatus on polymeric {beta}-mannan resulted in syntrophic growth and production of butyrate, thus confirming the high efficiency of the FpMULs uptake system. Genomic comparison with human F. prausnitzii strains and analyses of 2441 public human metagenomes revealed that FpMULs are highly conserved and distributed worldwide. Together, our results provide a significant advance in the knowledge of {beta}-mannans metabolism and the degree to which its degradation is mediated by cross-feeding interactions between prominent beneficial microbes in the human gut.\n\nImportanceCommensal butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum are abundant in the human gut and are crucial for maintaining health. Currently, insight is lacking into how they target otherwise indigestible dietary fibers and into the trophic interactions they establish with other glycan degraders in the competitive gut environment. By combining cultivation, genomic and detailed biochemical analyses this work reveals the mechanism enabling F. prausnitzii, as a model clostridial cluster IV Firmicute, to cross-feed and access {beta}-mannan-derived oligosaccharides released in the gut ecosystem by the action of primary degraders. A comprehensive survey of human gut metagenomes shows that FpMULs are ubiquitous in human populations globally, highlighting the importance of microbial metabolism of {beta}-mannans/{beta}-MOS as a common dietary component. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the {beta}-MOS utilization capability by F. prausnitzii that may be exploited to select dietary formulations specifically boosting this beneficial symbiont, thus butyrate production, in the gut.",

Although airway-derived human cell lines exist, alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-derived lines are needed to better model these diseases. We have generated and characterized novel immortalized cell lines derived from human AECs. They grow as epithelial monolayers expressing lung progenitor markers SOX9 and SOX2, with little to no expression of mature AEC markers. Co-cultured in 3-dimensions (3D) with lung fibroblasts, the cells form NKX2-1+ organoids expressing mature AEC markers AQP5 and GPRC5A. Single-cell RNA sequencing of an AEC line in 2D versus 3D revealed increased cellular heterogeneity and induction of cytokine and lipoprotein signaling, consistent with organoid formation. Activating WNT and FGF pathways resulted in larger organoids. Our approach appears to yield lung progenitor lines that retain a genetic and structural memory of their alveolar cell lineage despite long-term expansion and whose differentiation may be modulated under various 3D conditions.

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton transform inorganic carbon into thousands of biomolecules that represent an important pool of fixed carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in the surface ocean. Metabolite production differs between phytoplankton, and the flux of these molecules through the microbial food web depends on compound-specific bioavailability to members of a wider microbial community. Yet relatively little is known about the diversity or concentration of metabolites within marine plankton. Here we compare 313 polar metabolites in 21 cultured phytoplankton species and in natural planktonic communities across environmental gradients to show that bulk community metabolomes reflect chemical composition of the phytoplankton community. We also show that groups of compounds have similar patterns across space and taxonomy suggesting that the concentrations of these compounds in the environment are controlled by similar sources and sinks. We quantify several compounds in the surface ocean that represent substantial understudied pools of labile carbon. For example, the N-containing metabolite homarine was up to 3% of particulate carbon and is produced in high concentrations by cultured Synechococcus, and S-containing gonyol accumulated up to 2.5 nM in surface particles and likely originates from dinoflagellates. Our results show that phytoplankton composition directly shapes the carbon composition of the surface ocean. Our findings suggest that in order to access these pools of bioavailable carbon, the wider microbial community must be adapted to phytoplankton community composition.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicroscopic phytoplankton transform 100 million tons of inorganic carbon into thousands of different organic compounds each day. The structure of each chemical is critical to its biological and ecosystem function, yet, the diversity of biomolecules produced by marine microbial communities remained mainly unexplored, especially small polar molecules which are often considered the currency of the microbial loop. Here we explore the abundance and diversity of small biomolecules in planktonic communities across ecological gradients in the North Pacific and within 21 cultured phytoplankton species. Our work demonstrates that phytoplankton diversity is an important determinant of the chemical composition of the highly bioavailable pool of organic carbon in the ocean, and we highlight understudied yet abundant compounds in both the environment and cultured organisms. These findings add to understanding of how the chemical makeup of phytoplankton shapes marine microbial communities where the ability to sense and use biomolecules depends on the chemical structure.",

This ability to rapidly interchange between Watson-Crick or mismatch-like forms, combined with different syn:anti isomer preferences when paired (~1:100) versus unpaired (~10:1), explains how m6A robustly slows duplex annealing without affecting melting via two pathways in which isomerization occurs before or after duplex annealing.

    "abstract": "BackgroundProkaryotic viruses referred to as phages can be divided into virulent and temperate phages. Distinguishing virulent and temperate phage-derived sequences in metavirome data is important for their role in interactions with bacterial hosts and regulations of microbial communities. However there is no experimental or computational approach to classify sequences of these two in culture-independent metavirome effectively, we present a new computational method DeePhage, which can directly and rapidly judge each read or contig as a virulent or temperate phage-derived fragment.\n\nFindingsDeePhage utilizes a \"one-hot\" encoding form to have an overall and detailed representation of DNA sequences. Sequence signatures are detected via a deep learning algorithm, namely a convolutional neural network to extract valuable local features. DeePhage makes better performance than the most related method PHACTS. The accuracy of DeePhage on five-fold validation reach as high as 88%, nearly 30% higher than PHACTS. Evaluation on real metavirome shows DeePhage annotated 54.4% of reliable contigs while PHACTS annotated 44.5%. While running on the same machine, DeePhage reduces computational time than PHACTS by 810 times. Besides, we proposed a new strategy to explore phage transformations in the microbial community by direct detection of the temperate viral fragments from metagenome and metavirome. The detectable transformation of temperate phages provided us a new insight into the potential treatment for human disease.\n\nConclusionsDeePhage is the first tool that can rapidly and efficiently identify two kinds of phage fragments especially for metagenomics analysis with satisfactory performance.

    "abstract": "Although inducible heterologous expression systems have been available since the birth of recombinant DNA technology, the diversity of devices and genetic architectures of the corresponding vectors have often resulted in a lack of reproducibility and interoperability. In an effort to increase predictability of expression of genes of interest in a variety of possible bacterial hosts we propose a composition standard for debugging and reassembling all regulatory parts that participate in the performance of such devices. As a case study we address the n-octane and dicyclopropyl ketone (DCPK)-inducible PalkB promoter of the alkane biodegradation pOCT plasmid of Pseudomonas putida. The standardized expression module consisted of an edited alkS regulatory gene that is divergently expressed and separated of PalkB by a synthetic DNA buffer sequence. The native DNA sequence of the structural alkS gene was modified to alleviate the catabolite repression exerted by some carbon and nitrogen sources through the Crc/Hfq complex of some hosts. The PalkB promoter along with the alkS variants were then formatted as SEVA (Standard European Vector Architecture) cargoes and their activity parameters in P. putida determined with GFP and luminiscent reporters. The thereby refactored system showed improvements in various features desirable in conditional expression modules: inducibility, capacity, noise reduction and on/off ratio. When applied to other promoter/regulator pairs, the compositional standard thereby implemented in the AlkS/PalkB module will enable more complex genetic programming in non-model bacteria.",

    "abstract": "At rest, mammalian brains display remarkable spatiotemporal complexity, evolving through recurrent brain states on a slow timescale of the order of tens of seconds. While the phenomenology of the resting state dynamics is valuable in distinguishing healthy and pathological brains, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify neuronal cascades as a potential mechanism. Using full-brain network modeling, we show that neuronal populations, coupled via a detailed structural connectome, give rise to large-scale cascades of firing rate fluctuations evolving at the same time scale of resting-state networks. The ignition and subsequent propagation of cascades depend upon the brain state and connectivity of each region. The largest cascades produce bursts of Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) co-fluctuations at pairs of regions across the brain, which shape the simulated resting-state network dynamics.We experimentally confirm these theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the existence and stability of intermittent epochs of functional connectivity comprising BOLD co-activation bursts in mice and human fMRI. We then provide evidence for the existence and leading role of the neuronal cascades in humans with simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. These results show that neuronal cascades are a major determinant of spontaneous fluctuations in brain dynamics at rest.\n\n1 Significance StatementFunctional connectivity and its dynamics are widely used as a proxy of brain function and dysfunction. Their neuronal underpinnings remain unclear. Using connectome-based modeling, we link the fast microscopic neuronal scale to the slow emergent whole-brain dynamics. We show that cascades of neuronal activations spontaneously propagate in resting state-like conditions. The largest neuronal cascades result in the co-fluctuation of Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent signals at pairs of brain regions, which in turn translate to stable brain states. Thus, we provide a theoretical framework for the emergence and the dynamics of resting-state networks. We verify these predictions in empirical mouse fMRI and human EEG/fMRI datasets measured in resting states conditions. Our work sheds light on the multiscale mechanisms of brain function.",

Here, we report that negative-strand RNA paramyxoviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Measles virus (MeV), can also trigger the cGAS/STING axis. While mice deficient for MyD88, TRIF and MAVS still moderately control NiV infection when compared to WT mice, additional STING deficiency resulted in 100% lethality, suggesting synergistic roles of these pathways in host protection. Moreover, deletion of cGAS or STING resulted in decreased type-I interferon production with enhanced paramyxoviral infection in both human and murine cells. Finally, the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of STING, observed during viral infections, confirmed the activation of cGAS/STING pathway by NiV and MeV. Our data suggest that cGAS/STING activation is critical in controlling paramyxovirus infection, and possibly represent attractive targets to develop countermeasures against severe disease induced by these pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cytokinesis starts with the polymerization of the tubulin-like FtsZ, which forms the cell division scaffold. SepF aligns FtsZ polymers and also acts as a membrane anchor for the Z-ring. While in most bacteria cell division takes place at midcell, during sporulation of Streptomyces many septa are laid down almost simultaneously in multinucleoid aerial hyphae. The genomes of streptomycetes encode two additional SepF paralogs, SflA and SflB, which can interact with SepF. Here we show that the sporogenic aerial hyphae of sflA and sflB mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor frequently branch, a phenomenon never seen in the wild-type strain. The branching coincided with ectopic localization of DivIVA along the lateral wall of sporulating aerial hyphae. Constitutive expression of SflA and SflB largely inhibited hyphal growth, further correlating SflAB activity to that of DivIVA. SflAB localized in foci prior to and after the time of sporulation-specific cell division, while SepF co-localized with active septum synthesis. Foci of FtsZ and DivIVA frequently persisted between adjacent spores in spore chains of sflA and sflB mutants, at sites occupied by SflAB in wild-type cells. This may be caused by the persistance of SepF multimers in the absence of SflAB. Taken together, our data show that SflA and SflB play an important role in the control of growth and cell division during Streptomyces development.",

Utilizing CoPIC screening, we mapped the interaction network among RTC-related viral proteins. We identified a total of 47 binary interactions among 14 proteins governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses. Further exploration via CoPIC led to the discovery of extensive ternary complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order complexes.

    "abstract": "The first mitotic division in mammalian zygotes is unique. The fertilized egg reactivates its cell cycle, and the maternal and paternal genomes start to reprogram to become totipotent. The first division is very sensitive to a range of perturbations, particularly the DNA damage, leading to the embryo's failure to enter the first mitosis. We discovered that a point mutation in the human CHEK1 gene resulted in an Arginine 442 to Glutamine change at the C-terminus of the CHEK1 protein. CHEK1 R442Q mutation caused the zygote to arrest just before the first division. Heterozygote individuals appeared to be healthy except that the female carriers are infertile. Expressing the corresponding mouse mutant Chk1 protein in zygotes also caused arrest before the first mitosis. Treating Chk1 R442Q mouse zygotes with low concentrations of CHEK1 inhibitor enabled the embryos to overcome the cell cycle arrest and resume normal development. Our results revealed an unexpected zygote mitotic checkpoint, which is extremely sensitive to the CHEK1 kinase activity. The fine-tuning of the DNA damage checkpoint permits the arrested one-cell embryos to overcome the first mitotic block and develop into healthy animals. These findings have important implications in assisted human reproduction.",

We estimate population structure, genetic diversity, and contemporary and historical migration within and among the three landscapes and used landscape metrics as predictor variables. Furthermore, we estimate genetic isolation by distance and resistance among individuals sampled within landscapes.\n\nResultsWe identified three genetically distinct populations with asymmetrical gene flow among landscapes and a decreasing migration rate with distance. Within each landscape, we found low genetic differentiation without genetic isolation by distance nor by resistance. In contrast, we found differentiation and spatial correlation between landscapes.\n\nConclusionsOur results uncover population dynamics of E. ruficeps through time.

    "abstract": "This study constitutes a first attempt to quantify processes that govern valve gape dynamics in bivalves. We elected to focus on the scallop, Pecten maximus, not only because of its economic importance but also because it has a complex behaviour and high sensitivity to stress, which can be inferred from valve gape dynamics. The adductor muscle is the primary organ implicated in valve movements. Scallops, as other bivalves, move their valves sharply to ensure basic physiological functions or to respond to stressing conditions; these sharp events can be perceived as discrete events within a continuous dynamic. A biophysical model, originally designed for human muscles, was first selected to simulate the adductor muscle contraction, countering the passive valve opening by the umbo ligament. However, to maintain the possibility of rapid valve movements, described as typical of bivalves behaviour, it was necessary to modify the model and propose an original formulation. The resulting hybrid modelling simulates how valve opening tends to converge continuously toward a stable steady-state angle, while being interspersed with discrete, sharp closing events, deviating values from this equilibrium. The parameters of the new model were estimated by optimization using Hall-Effect Sensor valvometry data recorded in controlled conditions. Equilibrium of the continuous regime (when fiber activation equals deactivation) was estimated for a gape angle close to ca. 15 degrees, which is ca. 45% of the maximum opening angle, hence implying a constant effort produced by the adductor muscle. The distribution of time intervals between two successive discrete events did not differ significantly from a random process, but the peak amplitudes deviated from randomness, suggesting they are regulated physiologically. These results suggest that discrete events interact with continuous dynamic regimes, regulating valve opening to minimize physiological efforts and conserve energy. However, because the overall physiological state of the scallop organism conditions the activity of the adductor muscle, a complete understanding of the physiology of bivalves will require linking a more comprehensive model of valve gape dynamics with experimental observations of physiological energy consumption under different conditions.",

To this end, we here derive an analytic expression for the distribution of waiting distances between tree changes under the sequentially Markovian coalescent model and obtain an accurate approximation to the distribution of waiting distances for topology changes. We use these results to show that some of the recently proposed methods for inferring sequences of trees along the genome provide strongly biased distributions of waiting distances. In addition, we provide a correction to an undercounting problem facing all available ARG inference methods, thereby facilitating the use of ARG inference methods to estimate temporal changes in the recombination rate.",

We recently reported that missense E778K and G908R variants of NOD2 gene are associated with recurrent pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections\n\nMethodsThis is an in-silico analysis of NOD2 gene using SNPs functionality analyses, post-translational modification site prediction and network analysis.\n\nResultsOur analysis revealed that these damaging mutations affect the structural properties and function and ligand binding in the mutant receptor.\n\nConclusionThe consequence of these mutations may also impress downstream processing and receptor crosstalk with other immune molecules and therefore increase susceptibility to infectious disease.",

    "abstract": "In silico modelling and analysis of small molecules substantially accelerates the process of drug development. Representing and understanding molecules is the fundamental step for various in silico molecular analysis tasks. Traditionally, these molecular analysis tasks have been investigated individually and separately. In this study, we presented X-MOL, which applies large-scale pre-training technology on 1.1 billion molecules for molecular understanding and representation, and then, carefully designed fine-tuning was performed to accommodate diverse downstream molecular analysis tasks, including molecular property prediction, chemical reaction analysis, drug-drug interaction prediction, de novo generation of molecules and molecule optimization. As a result, X-MOL was proven to achieve state-of-the-art results on all these molecular analysis tasks with good model interpretation ability. Collectively, taking advantage of super large-scale pre-training data and super-computing power, our study practically demonstrated the utility of the idea of \"mass makes miracles\" in molecular representation learning and downstream in silico molecular analysis, indicating the great potential of using large-scale unlabelled data with carefully designed pre-training and fine-tuning strategies to unify existing molecular analysis tasks and substantially enhance the performance of each task.",

    "abstract": "Farmland is on the decline and worldwide food security is at risk. Rice is the staple of choice for over half the Earths people. To sustain current demands and ascertain a food secure future, substandard farmland affected by abiotic stresses must be utilized. For rapid crop improvement, a broader understanding of polygenic traits like stress tolerance and crop yield is indispensable. To this end, the hidden diversity of resilient and neglected wild varieties must be traced back to their genetic roots. In this study, we separately assayed 15 phenotypes in a panel of 176 diverse accessions predominantly comprised of local landraces from Bangladesh. We compiled high resolution sequence data for these accessions. We collectively studied the ties between the observed phenotypic differences and the examined additive genetic effects underlying these variations. We applied a sophisticated fixed effect model to associate phenotypes with genotypes on a genomic scale. Discovered QTLs were mapped to known genes. Candidate genes were sorted by tissue specific gene expression profiles and protein level consequence of existing polymorphisms. Our explorations yielded 17 QTLs related to various traits in multiple trait classes. 12 identified QTLs were equivalent to findings from previous studies. Integrative analysis assumes novel functionality for 21 candidate genes on multiple evidence levels. These findings will usher novel avenues for the bioengineering of high yielding crops of the future fortified with genetic defenses against abiotic stressors.",

    "abstract": "Insertions and deletions of lengths not divisible by 3 in protein-coding sequences cause frameshifts that usually induce premature stop codons and may carry a high fitness cost. However, this cost can be partially offset by a second compensatory indel restoring the reading frame. The role of such pairs of compensatory frameshifting mutations (pCFMs) in evolution has not been studied systematically. Here, we use whole-genome alignments of protein coding genes of 100 vertebrate species, and of 122 insect species, studying the prevalence of pCFMs in their divergence. We detect a total of 619 candidate pCFM-genes; 11 of them pass stringent quality filtering, including three human genes: RAB36, ARHGAP6 and NCR3LG1. In some instances, amino acid substitutions closely predating or following pCFMs restored the biochemical similarity of the frameshifted segment to the ancestral amino acid sequence, possibly reducing or negating the fitness cost of the pCFM. Typically, however, the resulting sequence bore no biochemical similarity to the ancestral one, indicating that pCFMs can uncover radically novel regions of protein space. In total, pCFMs represent an appreciable and previously overlooked source of novel variation in amino acid sequences.",
