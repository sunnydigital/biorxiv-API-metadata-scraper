    "abstract": "BackgroundAll living things speak chemical. The challenge is to discover the vocabulary, the volatile odorant chemicals that enable communication across phylogenies and to translate them to physiological, behavioural and ecological function. Olfactory receptors (ORs) interface animals with airborne odorants. Expression of single ORs in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) makes it possible to interrogate ORs with synthetic chemicals and to identify cognate ligands that convey olfactory information.\n\nResultsThe cosmopolitan strain of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster has accompanied the human expansion out of Africa, more than ten thousand years ago. These flies are strictly anthropophilic and depend on human resources and housing for survival, particularly in colder climate zones. Curiously, humans sense the scent of a single fly, and more precisely the female pheromone (Z)-4 undecenal (Z4-11Al), at 10 ng/mL (0.06 {micro}mol/L). A screening of all functional human ORs in a HEK-293 assay provides an explanation for this astounding sensitivity, as it shows that OR10A6, one of the most highly expressed human ORs, is specifically tuned to Z4-11Al. Chemical analysis of fly effluvia confirms that cosmopolitan D. melanogaster females release Z4-11Al, while females of an African fly strain from Zimbabwe release a 1:3-blend of Z4-11Al and (Z)-4 nonenal (Z4-9Al). Interestingly, a blend of Z4-9Al and Z4-11Al produces a different aroma than the the single compounds, which is why we readily differentiate cosmopolitan and Zimbabwe flies by nose.\n\nConclusionThat we sensitively and specifically perceive the fly pheromone Z4-11Al suggests that it is a component of human odour scenes. This may have afforded a sensory drive during adaptation of commensal flies to human habitats and selected for a role of Z4-11Al in fly aggregation and premating communication. Screening ORs for key ligands leads to the discovery of messenger chemicals that enable chemical communication among and betwen vertebrate and invertebrate animals.",

    "abstract": "Membraneless Organelles (MLOs) are vital and dynamic reaction centers in cells that organize metabolism in the absence of a membrane. Multivalent interactions between protein Low-Complexity Domains (LCDs) contribute to MLO organization. Our previous work used computational methods to identify structural motifs termed Low-complexity Amyloid-like Reversible Kinked Segments (LARKS) that can phase-transition to form hydrogels and are common in human proteins that participate in MLOs. Here we searched for LARKS in proteomes of six model organisms: Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Plasmodium falciparum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Escherichia coli. We find LARKS are abundant in M. tuberculosis, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens, but not in S. cerevisiae or P. falciparum. Abundant LARKS require high glycine content, which enables kinks to form in LARKS as is illustrated in the known LARKS-rich amyloid structures of TDP43, FUS, and hnRNPA2, three proteins that participate in MLOs. These results support the idea of LARKS as an evolved structural motif and we offer the LARKSdb webserver which permits users to search for LARKS in their protein sequences of interest.",

    "abstract": "Serine(S)/threonine(T)-glutamine(Q) cluster domains (SCDs), polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts and polyglutamine/asparagine (polyQ/N) tracts are Q-rich motifs found in many proteins. SCDs often are intrinsically disordered regions that mediate protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. PolyQ and polyQ/N tracts are structurally flexible sequences that trigger protein aggregation. We show that four SCDs and three prion-causing Q/N-rich motifs of yeast proteins possess autonomous protein expression-enhancing activities. Comparative Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of the near-complete proteomes of 27 representative model eukaryotes reveal that Q-rich motifs prevail in proteins involved in specialized biological processes, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-mediated transposition, Candida albicans filamentous growth, ciliate peptidyl-glutamic acid modification, Tetrahymena thermophila xylan catabolism and meiosis, Dictyostelium discoideum development and sexual cycles, Plasmodium falciparum infection, and the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system. We also show that Q-rich motifs are expanded massively in ten ciliates with reassigned TAAQ and TAGQ codons. Our results provide new insights to explain why many ciliates reassign their nuclear stop codons into glutamine (Q). The consequence of this preponderance of Q is massive expansion of proteins harboring three structurally flexible or even intrinsically disordered Q-rich motifs. Since these Q-rich motifs can endow proteins with structural and functional plasticity, we suggest that they represent useful toolkits for evolutionary novelty.",

    "abstract": "Retinal image-based eye tracking from scanned ophthalmic imaging systems, such as scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, has allowed for precise real-time eye tracking at sub-micron resolution. To achieve real-time processing rates, strip-based image registration methods for real-time applications have several constraints that limit their performance. This trade-off is acceptable for many imaging and psychophysical applications but when the objective is precise eye motion measurement over time, a high error tolerance can be consequential. Dropped strips in these applications can complicate FEMs quantification. Some light starved imaging applications, such as autofluorescence retinal imaging, also require the retention and registration of as much of the data as possible to increase the signal to noise ratio in the final integrated or averaged image. We show here that eye motion can be extracted from image sequences from scanned imaging systems more consistently when the constraints of real-time processing are lifted, and all data is available at the time of registration. This is enabled with additional image processing steps to achieve a more robust solution. Our iterative approach identifies and discards distorted frames, detects coarse motion to generate a synthetic reference frame and then uses it for fine scale motion tracking with improved sensitivity over a larger area. We demonstrate its application here to tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (TSLO) and adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). We show that it can successfully capture most of the eye motion across each image sequence, leaving only between 0.04-3.39% of non-blink frames untracked, even with low quality images, while simultaneously minimizing image distortions induced from eye motion. These improvements will facilitate precise FEMs measurement in TSLO and longitudinal tracking of individual cells in AOSLO.",

Using deformable membrane microdevice arrays paired with combinatorial experimental design and modeling, we systematically probed the individual and integrative effects of mechanical stimulation parameters (strain magnitude (STRAIN), rate at which strain is changed (RATE) and duty period (DUTY)) on myofibrogenesis and matrix production of MSCs in 3D hydrogels. These functions were found to be dominantly influenced by a novel and higher-order interactive effect between STRAIN and DUTY. Empirical models based on our combinatorial cue-response data predicted an optimal loading regime in which STRAIN and DUTY were increased synchronously over time, which was validated to most effectively promote MSC matrix production. These findings inform the design of loading regimes for MSC-based engineered tissues and validate a broadly applicable approach to probe multifactorial regulating effects of microenvironmental and mechanobiological cues.",

    "abstract": "Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations are at risk of exposure to high water temperatures in the species native range in eastern North America. We quantified the physiological and molecular responses of juvenile brook trout to six acclimation temperatures that span the thermal distribution of the species (5, 10, 15, 20, 23, and 25{degrees}C). Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we measured the mRNA transcript abundance of temperature-induced cellular stress genes to identify a potential sub-lethal temperature threshold for brook trout between 20-23{degrees}C. Brook trout exhibited an upregulation of stress-related genes (heat shock protein 90-beta; heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein; glutathione peroxidase 1) and a downregulation of transcription factors and osmoregulation-related genes (Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter-1-a; nuclear protein 1) at temperatures [&ge;]20{degrees}C. We also used respirometry to assess the effects of the acclimation temperatures on oxygen consumption. Standard metabolic rate results indicated that energy expenditure was higher at temperatures [&ge;]20{degrees}C. We then examined the effects of acclimation temperature on metabolic rate and blood plasma parameters in fish exposed to an acute exhaustive exercise and air exposure stress. Fish acclimated to temperatures [&ge;]20{degrees}C exhibited elevated levels of plasma cortisol, muscle lactate, and plasma glucose after exposure to the acute stressors. After 24 h of recovery, fish showed longer metabolic recovery times at 15 and 20{degrees}C and cortisol levels remaining elevated at temperatures [&ge;]20{degrees}C. Our findings suggest that brook trout may have a limited ability to acclimate to temperatures >20{degrees}C and increases in temperatures beyond 20{degrees}C may impact brook trout populations.",

    "abstract": "Choline is an essential component of Acetylcholine (ACh) biosynthesis pathway which requires high-affinity Choline transporter (ChT) for its uptake into the presynaptic terminals of cholinergic neurons. Previously, we reported a predominant expression of ChT in memory processing and storing region of Drosophila brain called mushroom bodies (MB). It is unknown how ChT contributes to the functional principles of MB operation. Here, we demonstrate the role of ChT in non-associative form of learning, Habituation. Odour driven habituation traces are laid down in ChT dependent manner in antennal lobes (AL), projection neurons (PN) and MB. We observed that reduced habituation due to knockdown of ChT in MB causes hypersensitivity towards odour, suggesting that ChT also regulates incoming stimulus suppression. Importantly, we show for the first time that ChT is not unique to cholinergic neurons but is also required in inhibitory GABAergic neurons to drive habituation behaviour. Our results support a model in which ChT regulates both habituation and incoming stimuli through multiple circuit loci via an interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Strikingly, the lack of ChT in MB recapitulates major features of Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including attenuated habituation, sensory hypersensitivity as well as defective GABAergic signalling. Our data establish the role of ChT in habituation learning and suggest that its dysfunction may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders like ASD.",

    "abstract": "Most neuroimaging studies individually provide evidence on a narrow aspect of the human brain function, on distinct data sets that often suffer from small sample sizes. More generally, the high technical and cost demands of neuroimaging studies (combined with the statistical unreliability of neuroimaging pilot studies) may lead to observational bias, discouraging discovery of less obvious associations that nonetheless have important neurological implications. To address these problems, we built a machine-learning based classification framework, NeuroPredictome, optimized for the reliability and robustness of its associations. NeuroPredictome is grounded in a large-scale dataset, UK-Biobank (N=19,831), which includes resting and task functional MRI as well as structural T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging. Participants were assessed with respect to a comprehensive set of 5,034 phenotypes, including the physical and lifestyle factors most relevant to general medicine. Results generated by data-driven classifiers were then cross-validated, using deep-learning textual analyses, against 14,371 peer-reviewed research articles, providing an unbiased hypothesis-generator of linkages between diverse phenotypes and the brain. Our results show that neuroimaging reveals as many neurological links to physical and lifestyle factors as to cognitive factors, supporting a more integrative approach to medicine that considers disease interactions between multiple organs and systems.",

Although both subunits are required in equal proportions to form DNA gyrase, the gyrA and gyrB genes that encode them in Salmonella (and in many other bacteria) are at widely separated locations on the chromosome, are under separate transcriptional control and are present in different copy numbers in rapidly growing bacteria (gyrA is near the terminus of chromosome replication while gyrB is near the origin). We generated a synthetic gyrBA operon at the oriC-proximal location of gyrB to test the significance of the gyrase gene position for Salmonella physiology. Producing gyrase from an operon did not alter growth kinetics, cell morphology, competitive fitness index, or sensitivity to some gyrase-inhibiting antibiotics. However, the operon strain had altered DNA supercoiling set points, its SPI-2 virulence genes were expressed at a reduced level and its survival was reduced in macrophage. The gyrB gene could not be deleted from its oriC-proximal location, even in a gyrB merodiploid strain. We discuss the physiological significance of the different gyrA and gyrB gene arrangements found naturally in Salmonella and other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil-induced oxidative stress is a mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19, and drugs with a functional thiol group (\"thiol drugs\"), especially cysteamine, have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could limit this injury. Thiol drugs may also alter the redox status of the cysteine-rich SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SARS-2-S) and thereby disrupt ACE2 binding. Using ACE2 binding assay, reporter virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spikes (ancestral and variants) and authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-1), we find that multiple thiol drugs inhibit SARS-2-S binding to ACE2 and virus entry into cells. Pseudoviruses carrying variant spikes were less efficiently inhibited as compared to pseudotypes bearing an ancestral spike, but the most potent drugs still inhibited the Delta variant in the low millimolar range. IC50 values followed the order of their cystine cleavage rates and lower thiol pKa values. In hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, intraperitoneal (IP) cysteamine decreased neutrophilic inflammation and alveolar hemorrhage in the lungs but did not decrease viral infection, most likely because IP delivery could not achieve millimolar concentrations in the airways. These data show that thiol drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and reduce SARS-CoV-2-related lung injury in vivo and provide strong rationale for trials of systemically delivered thiol drugs as COVID-19 treatments. We propose that antiviral effects of thiol drugs in vivo will require delivery directly to the airways to ensure millimolar drug concentrations and that thiol drugs with lower thiol pKa values are most likely to be effective.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe effect of cysteamine to decrease SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in vivo and of multiple thiol drugs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro provides rationale for clinical trials of thiol drugs in COVID-19.",

Pathway activation depends in a complex way on which ligands are present and what receptors are expressed by the signal-receiving cell. To understand the combinatorial logic of such a system, we systematically measured pairwise Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligand interactions in cells with varying receptor expression. Ligands could be classified into equivalence groups based on their profile of positive and negative synergies with other ligands. These groups varied with receptor expression, explaining how ligands can functionally replace each other in one context but not another. Context-dependent combinatorial interactions could be explained by a biochemical model based on competitive formation of alternative signaling complexes with distinct activities. Together, these results provide insights into the roles of BMP combinations in developmental and therapeutic contexts and establish a framework for analyzing other combinatorial, context-dependent signaling systems.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity is coordinated across multiple spatial and temporal scales, and these patterns of coordination are implicated in both healthy and impaired cognitive operations. However, empirical cross-scale investigations are relatively infrequent, due to limited data availability and to the difficulty of analyzing rich multivariate datasets. Here we applied frequency-resolved multivariate source-separation analyses to characterize a large-scale dataset comprising spiking and local field potential activity recorded simultaneously in three brain regions (prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, hippocampus) in freely-moving mice. We identified a constellation of multidimensional, inter-regional networks across a range of frequencies (2-200 Hz). These networks were reproducible within animals across different recording sessions, but varied across different animals, suggesting individual variability in network architecture. The theta band (~4-10 Hz) networks had several prominent features, including roughly equal contribution from all regions and strong inter-network synchronization. Overall, these findings demonstrate a multidimensional landscape of large-scale functional activations of cortical networks operating across multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal scales during open-field exploration.\n\nSignificance statementNeural activity is synchronized over space, time, and frequency. To characterize the dynamics of large-scale networks spanning multiple brain regions, we recorded data from the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and hippocampus in awake behaving mice, and pooled data from spiking activity and local field potentials into one data matrix. Frequency-specific multivariate decomposition methods revealed a cornucopia of neural networks defined by coherent spatiotemporal patterns over time. These findings reveal a rich, dynamic, and multivariate landscape of large-scale neural activity patterns during foraging behavior.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale simultaneous in vivo recordings of neurons in multiple brain regions raises the question of the probability of recording direct interactions of neurons within, and between, multiple brain regions. In turn, identifying inter-regional communication rules between neurons during behavioural tasks might be possible, assuming conjoint activity between neurons in connected brain regions can be detected. Using the hypergeometric distribution, and employing anatomically-tractable connection mapping between regions, we derive a method to calculate the probability distribution of  recordable connections between groups of neurons. This mathematically-derived distribution is validated by Monte Carlo simulations of directed graphs representing the underlying anatomical connectivity structure. We apply this method to simulated graphs with multiple neurons, based on counts in rat brain regions, and to connection matrices from the Blue Brain model of the mouse neocortex connectome. Overall, we find low probabilities of simultaneously-recording directly interacting neurons in vivo in anatomically-connected regions with standard (tetrode-based) approaches. We suggest alternative approaches, including new recording technologies and summing neuronal activity over larger scales, offer promise for testing hypothesised interregional communication and source transformation rules.",

    "abstract": "The reintroduced red wolf population in northeastern North Carolina declined to 7 known wolves by October 2020. Poaching (illegal killing) is the major component of verified anthropogenic mortality in this and many other carnivore populations, but it is still not well understood. Poaching is often underestimated, partly as a result of cryptic poaching, when poachers conceal evidence. Cryptic poaching inhibits our understanding of the causes and consequences of anthropogenic mortality which is important to conservation as it can inform us about future population patterns within changing political and human landscapes. We estimate risk for marked adult red wolves of 5 causes of death (COD: legal, nonhuman, unknown, vehicle and poached) and disappearance, describe variation in COD in relation to hunting season, and compare time to disappearance or death. We include unknown fates in our risk estimates. We found that anthropogenic COD accounted for 0.724 - 0.787, including cryptic and reported poaching estimated at 0.510 - 0.635 of 508 marked animals. Risk of poaching and disappearance was significantly higher during hunting season. Mean time from collaring until nonhuman COD averaged 376 days longer than time until reported poached and 642 days longer than time until disappearance. Our estimates of risk differed from prior published estimates, as expected by accounting for unknown fates explicitly. We quantify the effects on risk for three scenarios for disappearances, which span conservative to most likely COD. Implementing proven practices that prevent poaching or hasten successful reintroduction may reverse the decline to extinction in the wild of this critically endangered population. Our findings add to a growing literature on endangered species protections and enhancing the science used to measure poaching worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of morphological traits is hypothesized to act on an extended time scale, yet studies have suggested that these changes are possible within a few generations. Trophic polymorphism enabled through niche adaptations and ecological opportunity is one phenomenon that facilitate occurrence of rapid adaptive variation, common in many northern freshwater fish species. One such species is Arctic charr, which is known for its extensive variation in morphology and the occurrence of morphs. However, the speed at which such morphological variation arises is poorly studied despite the importance for understanding the onset of evolution. The aim of this study was to elucidate this process in a gradient of eight lakes that was stocked with Arctic charr in the period from 1910 to 1917 from Lake Tinnsjoen, Norway. We used morphological measurements to test for differences in traits between populations and Haldane and Darwins evolutionary rates to estimate divergence rates in traits. We also tested for correlation between putative genetic and morphological divergence. In addition, we contrasted the morphological divergence with that expected under neutral genetic expectations, using 12 microsatellite markers, to analyze whether and which morphological differences that is following early genetic divergence. A significant genetic differentiation was found between the source population and five of the translocated populations with corresponding differences in morphological traits for four of the populations. Population genetic structuring indicated six different genetic clusters. The translocated populations also exhibited trait divergence estimated with both Haldane and Darwins rates. Differences in morphological traits showed a significant correlation with genetic divergence, and the morphological differences were most likely affected by differences in lake parameters such as maximum depth, lake size and fish community. We conclude that intraspecific morphological and genetic divergence can form on short evolutionary time scales with important implications for conservation and management practices.",

    "abstract": "The medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, is a powerful model organism for investigating fundamental neurobehavioral processes. The well-documented arrangement and properties of H. verbanas nervous system allows changes at the level of specific neurons or synapses to be linked to physiological and behavioral phenomena. Juxtaposed to the extensive knowledge of H. verbanas nervous system is a limited, but recently expanding, portfolio of molecular and multi-omics tools. Together, the advancement of genetic databases for H. verbana will complement existing pharmacological and electrophysiological data by affording targeted manipulation and analysis of gene expression in neural pathways of interest. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly for H. verbana, which is approximately 250 Mbp in size and consists of 61,282 contigs. Whole genome sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform followed by genome assembly with CLC-Bio Genomics Workbench and subsequent functional annotation. Ultimately, the diversity of organisms for which we have genomic information should parallel the availability of next generation sequencing technologies to widen the comparative approach to understand the involvement and discovery of genes in evolutionarily conserved processes. Results of this work hope to facilitate comparative studies with H. verbana and provide the foundation for future, more complete, genome assemblies of the leech.",

    "abstract": "Taxa of the family Cactaceae presents morphological and reproductive characteristics, which are used by rural communities in arid and semi-arid areas, for food, medicinal and ornamental purposes. The objectives were to identify the most used species and to relate the socioeconomic factors of the informants with their knowledge of the species. To this end, 262 semi-structured interviews were applied, with questions such as name, age, gender, educational level, source of employment, among others; eight categories of use were established: agro-ecological, agricultural, commercial, environmental service, food, medicinal, ornamental and technological; three indexes were calculated, relative importance, the value of use for each of the species and wealth of knowledge of the interviewees. Nine species are reported, from which eight are used as food and ornamental, standing out Opuntia ficus-indica for its diversity of uses, while Cylindropuntia tunicata does not report any utility. Variables such as age and residence time showed a significant relationship with the number of plants used by the interviewees. It is expected to contribute to the preservation of cacti, local knowledge and encourage large-scale cultivation since species such as Mammillaria columbiana, Melocactus andinus, and Melocactus curvispinus are being used in an unsustainable way, which could cause their local extinction.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMind-wandering is a mental phenomenon where the internal thought process disengages from the external environment periodically. In the current study, we trained EEG classifiers using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to track mind-wandering across studies.\n\nApproachWe transformed the input from raw EEG to band-frequency information (power), singletrial ERP (stERP) patterns, and connectivity matrices between channels (based on inter-site phase clustering, ISPC). We trained CNN models for each input type from each EEG channel as the input model for the meta-learner. To verify the generalizability, we used leave-N-participant-out crossvalidations (N=6) and tested the meta-learner on the data from an independent study for across-study predictions.\n\nMain resultsThe current results show limited generalizability across participants and tasks. Nevertheless, our meta-learned trained with the stERPs performed the best among the state-of-theart neural networks. The mapping of each input model to the output of the meta-learner indicates the importance of each EEG channel.\n\nSignificanceOur study makes the first attempt to train study-independent mind-wandering classifiers. The results indicate that this remains challenging. The current proposed stacking neural network design allows an easy inspection of channel importance and feature maps.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant opportunistic pathogen responsible for a variety of human infections. Its high pathogenicity resides in a diverse array of virulence factors and an ability to adapt to hostile environments. We report that these factors are tied to the activity of condensins, SMC and MksBEF, which primarily function in structural chromosome maintenance. This study revealed that both proteins are required for P. aeruginosa virulence during corneal infection. The reduction in virulence was traced to broad changes in gene expression. Transcriptional signatures of smc and mksB mutants were largely dissimilar and non-additive, with the double mutant displaying a distinct gene expression profile. Affected regulons included those responsible for lifestyle control, primary metabolism, surface adhesion and biofilm growth, iron and sulfur assimilation, and denitrification. Additionally, numerous virulence factors were affected, including type 3 and type 6 secretion systems, hemagglutinin, pyocin and macroglobulin production, and a host of virulence regulators. in vitro properties of condensin mutants mirrored their transcriptional profiles. MksB-deficient cells were impaired in pyocyanin, c-di-GMP production, and sessile growth whereas smc mutants mildly upregulated c-di-GMP, secreted fewer proteases and were growth deficient under nutrient-limiting conditions. Moreover, condensin mutants displayed an abnormal regulation upon transition to stationary phase. These data reveal that condensins are integrated into the control of multiple genetic programs related to epigenetic and virulent behavior, establishing condensins as an essential factor in P. aeruginosa ocular infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryBacterial pathogenicity is a complex phenomenon dependent on the ability of a bacterium to thrive in a hostile environment while combating the host using an array of virulence factors. This study reports that pathogenicity is also tied to structural chromosome maintenance through condensins, proteins that are responsible for the global organization of the chromosome. We show that the two Pseudomonas aeruginosa condensins, SMC and MksB, act as global regulators of gene expression. The inactivation of SMC and MksB induces opposite regulatory programs in the cell that resemble those observed during the acute and chronic phases of infection. A substantial portion of this regulation is mediated by the intracellular signaling network of P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, virulence regulation is altered in condensin mutants. The results were validated by genetic, phenotypic and virulence studies of condensin mutants. Overall, these data establish condensins as an essential factor during ocular P. aeruginosa infections revealing their involvement in the regulatory virulence network and the control of the bacterial lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Virions are a common antigen source for many viral vaccines. One limitation to using virions is that the antigen abundance is determined by the content of each protein in the virus. This caveat especially applies to viral-based influenza vaccines where the low abundance of the neuraminidase (NA) surface antigen remains a bottleneck for improving the NA antibody response. Here, we used the WHO recommended H1N1 antigens (2019-2020 season) in a systematic analysis to demonstrate that the NA to hemagglutinin (HA) ratio in virions can be improved by exchanging the viral backbone internal genes, thereby preserving the antigens. The purified inactivated virions with higher NA content show a more spherical morphology, a different balance between the HA receptor binding and NA receptor release functions, and induce a better NA inhibitory antibody response in mice. These results indicate that influenza viruses support a range of ratios for a given NA and HA pair that can be utilized to produce viral-based influenza vaccines with increased NA content which can elicit more balanced inhibitory antibody responses to NA and HA.",
