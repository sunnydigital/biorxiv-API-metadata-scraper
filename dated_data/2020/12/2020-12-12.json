    "abstract": "0.BackgroundTraditionally, EEG/MEG data are high-pass filtered and baseline-corrected to remove slow drifts. Minor deleterious effects of high-pass filtering in traditional time-series analysis have been well-documented, including temporal displacements. However, its effects on time-resolved multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) are largely unknown.\n\nNew MethodTo prevent potential displacement effects, we extend an alternative method of removing slow drift noise - robust detrending - with a procedure in which we mask out all cortical events from each trial. We refer to this method as trial-masked robust detrending.\n\nResultsIn both real and simulated EEG data of a working memory experiment, we show that both high-pass filtering and standard robust detrending create artifacts that result in the displacement of multivariate patterns into activity silent periods, particularly apparent in temporal generalization analyses, and especially in combination with baseline correction. We show that trial-masked robust detrending is free from such displacements.\n\nComparison with Existing Method(s)Temporal displacement may emerge even with modest filter cut-off settings such as 0.05 Hz, and even in regular robust detrending. However, trial-masked robust detrending results in artifact-free decoding without displacements. Baseline correction may unwittingly obfuscate spurious decoding effects and displace them to the rest of the trial.\n\nConclusionsDecoding analyses benefits from trial-masked robust detrending, without the unwanted side effects introduced by filtering or regular robust detrending. However, for sufficiently clean data sets and sufficiently strong signals, no filtering or detrending at all may work adequately. Implications for other types of data are discussed, followed by a number of recommendations.",

    "abstract": "This new method has the capacity to dynamically analyse the metabolome of interest in diverse biological matrixes by offering coverage of rat urine, plasma, liver, brain, intestine, stomach, heart, spleen, lung, faeces, fresh plant tissues, cells and microbes. In addition, this new method enables specific and efficient analysis of microdontia metabolomes, non-microdontia and whole cell metabolomes, as well as can engage in absolute determination of 84 key clinical-wide metabolites in different biological matrixes, to enable the complementary support of clinical diagnosis and classification of diseases. To demonstrate the applicable capacity of this new method, multiple-matrixes differential metabolomes were firstly characterized using this new method to coordinate metabolic modifications underlie hepatitis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) in rats, such finding provides novel insight into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of hepatitis in clinic. Altogether, we are fully confident that this new metabolomics method will be widely welcomed by scientists in different niches to solve their key questions accordingly.",

    "abstract": "How do we encode our continuous life experiences for later retrieval? Theories of event segmentation and integration suggest that the hippocampus binds separately represented events into an ordered narrative. Using a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) movie watching-recall dataset, we quantified two types of neural similarities (i.e., activation pattern similarity and within-region voxel-based connectivity pattern similarity) between separate events during movie watching and related them to subsequent retrieval of events as well as retrieval of sequential order. We demonstrated that compared to forgotten events, successfully remembered events were associated with distinct activation patterns in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. By contrast, similar connectivity patterns between events were associated with memory formation and were also relevant for retaining events in the correct order. We applied the same approaches to an independent movie watching fMRI dataset as validation and highlighted again the role of hippocampal activation pattern and connectivity pattern in memory formation. We propose that distinct activation patterns represent neural segmentation of events while similar connectivity patterns encode context information, and therefore integrate events into a narrative. Our results provide novel evidence for the role of hippocampal-medial prefrontal event segmentation and integration in episodic memory formation of real-life experience.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility and translation of neuroscience research is assumed to be undermined by introducing environmental complexity and heterogeneity. Rearing laboratory animals with minimal (if any) environmental stimulation is thought to control for biological variability but may not adequately test the robustness of our animal models. Standard laboratory housing is associated with reduced demonstrations of species typical behaviors and changes in neurophysiology that may impact the translation of research results. Modest increases in environmental enrichment (EE), mitigate against insults used to induce animal models of disease, directly calling into question the translatability of our work. This may in part underlie the disconnect between preclinical and clinical research findings. Enhancing environmental stimulation for our model organisms promotes ethological natural behaviors but may simultaneously increase phenotypic trait variability. To test this assumption, we conducted a systematic review and evaluated coefficients of variation between EE and standard housed mice and rats. Given findings of suboptimal reporting of animal laboratory housing conditions, we also developed a methodological reporting table for enrichment use in neuroscience research. Our data show that animals housed in environmental enrichment were not more variable than those in standard housing. Therefore, environmental heterogeneity introduced into the laboratory, in the form of enrichment, does not compromise data integrity. Overall, human life is complicated and by embracing such nuanced complexity into our laboratories we may paradoxically improve upon the rigor and reproducibility of our research.\n\nSignificance StatementEnvironmental complexity is thought to increase phenotypic variability, undermining research translation. We conducted a systematic review and compared coefficients of variation between environmentally enriched and standard housed laboratory animals. Despite there being no differences in variability across several phenotypic traits, there are stark contrasts in the display of ethological natural behaviors between these housing conditions. Environmental enrichment is recognized as being beneficial for animal welfare and mitigates against insults used to induce animal models of disease. In contrast, standard laboratory cages are recognized as being impoverished and  unnatural. From these observations, it is apparent that our current \"gold standard\" caging system is not a true control condition as it does not adequately test the robustness of our animal models.",

Here, we present a new approach for tuning pathway gene expression levels via random integrations and high-throughput screening.

The integrated strains could, with significantly lower expression levels than plasmid-based expression, produce high titers (10.0 {+/-} 0.9 g/L isobutanol in 48 h) and yields (69 % of the theoretical maximum). Close examination of pathway expression in the top-performing, as well as other isolates, reveals the complexity of cellular metabolism and regulation, underscoring the need for precise optimization while integrating pathway genes into the chromosome. This new method for multiplexed pathway gene integration and expression optimization could be readily extended to a wide range of pathways and chassis to create robust and efficient production strains.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive cognition is fostered by knowledge about the structure and value of our environment. Here, we hypothesize that these two kinds of information are inherently intertwined as value-weighted schemas in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Schemas (e.g., of a social network) emerge by extracting commonalities across experiences and can be understood as graphs comprising nodes (e.g., people) and edges (e.g., their relationships). We sampled information about unique real-life environments (i.e., about personally familiar people and places) and probed the neural representations of their schemas with fMRI. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that the mPFC encodes indeed both, the nodes and edges of the schemas. Critically, as hypothesized, the strength of the edges is not only determined by experience and centrality of a node but also by value. We thus account for the involvement of the mPFC in disparate functions and suggest that valuation emerges naturally from encoded memory representations.",

    "abstract": "Gene drives offer the possibility of altering and even suppressing wild populations of countless plant and animal species, and CRISPR technology now provides the technical feasibility of engineering them. However, population-suppression gene drives are prone to select resistance, should it arise. Here we develop mathematical and computational models to identify conditions under which suppression drives will evade resistance, even if resistance is present initially. Previous models assumed resistance is allelic to the drive. We relax this assumption and show that linkage between the resistance and drive loci is critical to the evolution of resistance and that evolution of resistance requires (negative) linkage disequilibrium between the two loci. When the two loci are unlinked or only partially so, a suppression drive that causes limited inviability can evolve to fixation while causing only a minor increase in resistance frequency. Once fixed, the drive allele no longer selects resistance. Our analyses suggest that among gene drives that cause moderate suppression, toxin-antidote systems are less apt to select for resistance than homing drives. Single drives of moderate effect might cause only moderate population suppression, but multiple drives (perhaps delivered sequentially) would allow arbitrary levels of suppression. The most favorable case for evolution of resistance appears to be with suppression homing drives in which resistance is dominant and fully suppresses transmission distortion; partial suppression by resistance heterozygotes or recessive resistance are less prone to resistance evolution. Given that it is now possible to engineer CRISPR-based gene drives capable of circumventing allelic resistance, this design may allow for the engineering of suppression gene drives that are effectively resistance-proof.",

We characterized the molecular basis of behavioral plasticity in queenless honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, where individuals engage in both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors. Using high-throughput behavioral tracking, we discovered these colonies contain a continuum of phenotypes, with some individuals specialized for either egg-laying or foraging and \"generalists\" that perform both. Brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles were correlated with behavioral variation, with generalists intermediate in behavior and molecular profiles. Models of brain GRNs constructed for individuals revealed that transcription factor (TF) activity was highly predictive of behavior, and behavior-associated regulatory regions had more TF motifs. These results provide new insights into the important role played by brain GRN plasticity in the regulation of behavior, with implications for social evolution.",

This paper applies these recent ideas to TCGA transcriptomic data on breast and lung cancer. The established cancer subtype organization is well reconstructed in the inferred latent topic structure. Moreover, we identify specific topics that are enriched in genes known to play a role in the corresponding disease and are strongly related to the survival probability of patients. Finally, we show that a simple neural network classifier operating in the low dimensional topic space is able to predict with high accuracy the cancer subtype of a test expression sample.",

    "abstract": "The elimination of transformed and viral infected cells by natural killer (NK) cells requires the formation of a specialized junction between NK and target cells, generally denominated immunological synapse (IS). After initial recognition, the IS enables the directed secretion of lytic granules content into the susceptible target cell. The lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 regulates NK effector function by enabling NK-IS assembly and maturation. The pathways underlying LFA-1 accumulation at the IS in NK cells have not been elucidated so far. A kinase anchoring protein 350 (AKAP350) is a centrosome/Golgi associated protein with a central role in the regulation of Golgi organization and microtubule dynamics. In T cells, AKAP350 participates in LFA-1 activation by mechanisms that remain elusive. We first investigated AKAP350 participation in NK cytolytic activity. Our results showed that the decrease in AKAP350 levels by expression of specific shRNAs (AKAP350KD) inhibited NK-YTS cytolytic activity, without affecting NK:target cell conjugate formation. The impairment of NK effector function in AKAP350KD cells correlated with decreased LFA-1 clustering and defective IS maturation. AKAP350KD cells that were exclusively activated via LFA-1 showed impaired LFA-1 organization and deficient lytic granule translocation as well. In NK AKAP350KD cells, activation signaling through Vav1 was preserved up to 10 min of interaction with target cells, but significantly decreased afterwards. Experiments in YTS and in ex vivo NK cells revealed the existence of an intracellular pool of LFA-1 vesicles, which partially associated with the Golgi apparatus. Upon NK cell activation, this LFA-1 pool redistributed to the IS in a Golgi-AKAP350-dependent manner. Disruption of Golgi integrity or alteration of microtubule dynamics impaired LFA-1 localization at the IS. Therefore, this study reveals the existence of a Golgi/AKAP350 dependent trafficking pathway for LFA-1, which is relevant for LFA-1 organization at NK-lytic IS and, concomitantly, for NK cytolytic function.",

    "abstract": "Memory, defined as an alteration in behavior towards a stimulus that follows as a consequence of experience, arises when a sensory stimulus is encountered at the same time that the animal experiences a negative or positive internal state. How this coincident detection of external and internal stimuli stably alters responses to the external stimulus is still not fully understood, especially in the context of an intact animal. One barrier to understanding how an intact biological circuit changes is knowing what molecular processes are required to establish and maintain the memory. The optically accessible and compact nervous system of C. elegans provides a unique opportunity to examine these processes. C. elegans can remember an odor such as butanone when it is paired with a single negative experience and the transient receptor potential (TRP) OSM-9/TRPV5/TRPV6 channel is known to be required for this memory. The multiple gating mechanisms of TRPV channels give them the potential to be the coincidence detectors required to integrate internal state and external stimuli. Here, we report that this TRPV channel is also required for acquisition and possibly consolidation of sleep-dependent, long-term memory of butanone. We find that in the anterior ganglion, endogenous GFP-tagged OSM-9 is expressed in the paired AWA olfactory neurons, the ASH nociceptive neuron pair, the mechanosensory OLQ tetrad, and the paired ADF and ADL sensory neurons. In these cells, OSM-9 protein is concentrated in the sensory endings, dendrites, and cell bodies, but excluded from the neurites in the nerve ring. In the tail, OSM-9 is expressed in the nociceptive phasmid neurons PHA and PHB, possibly PQR as well as PVP. In the midbody, it is possibly expressed in the mechanosensitive PVD neuron. It is notably absent from the AWC pair that are required for butanone attraction. Chronic loss of OSM-9 in a subset of ciliated neurons that do not include AWA interferes with consolidation but not learning. Because OSM-9 is expressed and required in sensory neurons that are not needed for butanone chemosensory behavior, two interpretations are possible. The first, is that OSM-9 loss leads to gain of function or neomorphic behavior of these cells that are extrinsic to the primary sensory circuit and their new activity interferes with acquisition and consolidation of memory. The second is that loss of OSM-9 leads to a loss of function phenotype in which the wild type function of these cells is diminished and this function is required for memory consolidation.\n\nAuthor summaryHow organisms learn from their environment and keep these memories for the long term ensures their survival. There is much known about the regions of the brain and the various proteins that are essential for memory, yet the exact molecular mechanisms and dynamics required are not known. We aimed to understand the genetics that underlie memory formation. We tested a gene that encodes a transient potential receptor channel vanilloid channel, which is similar to the channels we have that sense spicy foods and other harmful cues. Our studies have shown that this gene is required for the animal to be able to acquire and perhaps consolidate olfactory memory. This protein is not expressed in the sensory neurons that respond to the odor that is memorized or in other downstream interneurons in the odor-sensation circuit, but it is expressed in a distinct set of sensory neurons. This indicates that long-term memory involves wild type behavior of a wider array of sensory neurons than is required for the primary sensation. These channels are also implicated in neurological disorders where memory is affected, including Alzheimers disease. Understanding how memory formation is affected by cells outside the memory circuit might provide testable hypothesis about what goes awry in Alzheimers disease.",

To panoramically analyze K. pneumoniaes methylation features, we completed the whole genome sequences of 14 K. pneumoniae strains covering various serotypes, multilocus-sequence typings (MLSTs), clonal groups (CG), viscosity/virulence and drug-resistances, and further characterized their methylomes using PacBio-SMRT and bisulfite technologies. We identified 15 methylation motifs (13 6mA and two 5mC motifs), among which eight were novel ones. Their corresponding MTases were further validated. Additionally, we analyzed the genomic distribution of GATC and CCWGG methylation motifs shared by all strains, and identified differential distributive patterns of some hemi/un-methylated GATC motifs tending to locate in the intergenic regions (IGRs). Specifically, we characterized the in vivo methylation kinetics at single-base resolution on a genome-wide scale by simulating the dynamic processes of replication-mediated passive demethylation and MTase-catalyzed re-methylation. The slower methylation-rates of the GATC motifs in the replication origins (oriC) and IGRs suggest an epigenetic mechanism implicated in the regulation of replication-initiation and transcription. Our findings illustrate the first comprehensive dynamic methylome map of K. pneumonia at single base resolution, and provide an efficient means and important reference for a better understanding of epigenetic regulation in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Wnt signalling is important for development in all metazoan animals and associated with various human diseases. The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) and regulatory ER-associated degradation (ERAD) has been implicated in the secretion of WNT proteins. Here, we investigated how the WNT secretory factor EVI/WLS is ubiquitinated, recognised by ERAD components, and subsequently removed from the secretory pathway. We performed a focused, immunoblot-based RNAi screen for factors that influence EVI/WLS protein stability. We identified the VCP-binding proteins FAF2 and UBXN4 as novel interaction partners of EVI/WLS and showed that ERLIN2 links EVI/WLS to the ubiquitination machinery. Interestingly, we found in addition that EVI/WLS is ubiquitinated and degraded in cells irrespective of their level of WNT production. K11, K48, and K63-linked ubiquitination is mediated by the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes UBE2J2, UBE2N, and UBE2K, but independent of the E3 ligases HRD1/SYVN. Taken together, our study identified factors that link UPS to the WNT secretory pathway and provides mechanistic details on the fate of an endogenous substrate of regulatory ERAD in mammalian cells.",

We reveal CDKL5 as a sensor of DNA damage in actively transcribed regions of the nucleus, which phosphorylates transcriptional regulators such as Elongin A (ELOA) on a specific consensus motif. Recruitment of CDKL5 and ELOA to DNA damage sites, and subsequent ELOA phosphorylation, requires both active transcription and synthesis of poly-ADP ribose to which CDKL5 can bind. Critically, CDKL5 is essential for transcriptional control at DNA breaks.

    "abstract": "Annotating the genomes of multiple organisms allows us to study their genes as well as the evolution of those genes. While many eukaryotic genome assemblies already include computational gene predictions, these predictions can benefit from review and refinement through manual gene annotation. The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; thegep.org) has developed an annotation protocol for protein-coding genes that enables undergraduate students and other researchers to create high-quality gene annotations that can be utilized in subsequent scientific investigations. For example, this protocol has been utilized by the GEP faculty to engage undergraduate students in the comparative annotation of genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway in 28 Drosophila species, using D. melanogaster as the informant genome. Students construct gene models using multiple lines of computational and experimental evidence including expression data (e.g., RNA-Seq), sequence similarity (e.g., BLAST, multiple sequence alignments), and computational gene predictions. For quality control, each gene is annotated by at least two students working independently, followed by reconciliation of the submitted gene models by a more experienced student. This article provides an overview of the annotation protocol and describes how discrepancies in student submitted gene models are resolved to produce a final, high-quality gene set suitable for subsequent analyses. This annotation protocol can be adapted to other scientific questions (e.g., expansion of the Drosophila Muller F element) and other species (e.g., parasitoid wasps) to provide additional opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in genomics research. These student annotation efforts can substantially improve the quality of gene annotations in publicly available genomic databases.",

We delivered SPES to 83 electrode pairs and analyzed CCSRs recorded at 268 nonepileptic electrode sites. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) tractography localized the interhemispheric white matter pathways as streamlines directly connecting two electrode sites. We localized and visualized the putative SPES-related fiber activation, at each 1-ms time window, based on the propagation velocity defined as the DWI-based streamline length divided by the early CCSR peak latency.\n\nResultsThe resulting movie, herein referred to as four-dimensional tractography, delineated the spatiotemporal dynamics of fiber activation via the corpus callosum and anterior commissure. Longer streamline length was associated with delayed peak latency and smaller amplitude of CCSRs. The cortical regions adjacent to each fiber activation site indeed exhibited CCSRs at the same time window.\n\nConclusionsOur four-dimensional tractography successfully animated neural propagations via distinct interhemispheric pathways.\n\nSignificanceOur novel animation method has the potential to help investigators in addressing the mechanistic significance of the interhemispheric network dynamics supporting physiological function.",

We frame our BMI model as a potential game to identify stationary points (Nash equilibria) of the brain-decoder interactions, which correspond to points at which both the brain and the decoder stop adapting. Assuming the brain and the decoder adapt using gradientbased schemes, we analytically show how convergence to these equilibria depends on agent learning rates. This theoretical framework presents a basis for simulating co-adaption using dynamic game theory and can be extended to tasks with multiple dimensions and to different decoder models.

However, the completion of this analysis, which pushes out top binding sites through configurational changes, is an polynomial-state computational problem that can take multiple hours to compute, even on the fastest supercomputers. In this study, we aim to determine if graph cutting provide approximated solutions the MaxCut problem can be used as a method to provide similar results to T-REMD in the determination of top binding sites of Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) for binding analysis. Additionally, we utilize a quantum-hybrid algorithm within Iff Technologys Polar+ package using an actual quantum processor unit (QPU), an implementation of Polar+ using an emulated QPU, or Quantum Abstract Machine (QAM), on a large scale classical computing device, and an implementation of a classical MaxCut algorithm on a supercomputer in order to determine the types of advantages that can be gained through using a quantum computing device for this problem, or even using quantum algorithms on a classical device. This study found that Polar+ provides a dramatic speedup over a classical implementation of a MaxCut approximation algorithm or the use of GROMACS T-REMD, and produces viable results, in both its QPU and QAM implementations. However, the lack of direct configurational changes carried out onto the structure of SP-A after the use of graph cutting methods produces different final binding results than those produced by GROMACS T-REMD. Thus, further work needs to be completed into translating quantum-based probabilities into configurational changes based on a variety of noise conditions to better determine the accuracy advantage that quantum algorithms and quantum devices can provide in the near future.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundsOsteoprotegerin (OPG) is a profibrotic mediator produced by myofibroblasts under influence of transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}). Its expression in experimental models of liver fibrosis correlates well with disease severity and treatment responses. The regulation of OPG in liver tissue is largely unknown and we therefore set out to elucidate which growth factors/interleukins associated with fibrosis induce OPG and through which pathways.\n\nMethodsPrecision-cut liver slices of wild type and STAT6-deficient mice and 3T3 fibroblasts were used to investigate the effects of TGF{beta}, interleukin (IL) 13 (IL13), IL1{beta}, and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) on expression of OPG.\n\nResultsIn addition to TGF{beta}, only IL13 and not PDGF-BB or IL1{beta} could induce OPG expression in 3T3 fibroblasts and liver slices. This IL13-dependent induction was not shown in liver slices of STAT6-deficient mice and when wild type slices were cotreated with TGF{beta} receptor 1 kinase inhibitor galunisertib, STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499, or AP1 inhibitor T5224. This suggests that the OPG-inducing effect of IL13 is mediated through IL13 receptor 1-activation and subsequent STAT6-dependent upregulation of IL13 receptor 2, which in turn activates AP1 and induces production of TGF{beta} and subsequent production of OPG.\n\nConclusionWe have shown that IL13 induces OPG release by liver tissue through a TGF{beta}-dependent pathway involving both the 1 and the 2 receptor of IL13 and transcription factors STAT6 and AP1. OPG may therefore be a novel target for the treatment liver fibrosis as it is mechanistically linked to two important regulators of fibrosis in liver, namely IL13 and TGF{beta}1.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic activity of the human brain, observed with resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) and functional connectivity, exhibits macroscale spatial organization such as resting-state networks (RSNs) and functional connectivity gradients (FCGs). Dynamic analysis techniques have shown that the time-averaged maps captured by functional connectivity are mere summaries of time-varying patterns with distinct spatial and temporal characteristics. A better understanding of these patterns might provide insight into aspects of the brains intrinsic activity that cannot be inferred by functional connectivity, RSNs or FCGs. Here, we describe three spatiotemporal patterns of coordinated activity across the whole brain obtained by averaging similar ~20-second-long segments of rsfMRI timeseries. In each of these patterns, activity propagates along a particular macroscale FCG, simultaneously across the cortical sheet and in most other brain regions. In some areas, like the thalamus, the propagation suggests previously-undescribed FCGs. The coordinated activity across areas is consistent with known tract-based connections, and nuanced differences in the timing of peak activity between brain regions point to plausible driving mechanisms. The magnitude of correlation within and particularly between RSNs is remarkably diminished when these patterns are regressed from the rsfMRI timeseries, a quantitative demonstration of their significant role in functional connectivity. Taken together, our results suggest that a few recurring patterns of propagating intrinsic activity along macroscale gradients give rise to and coordinate functional connections across the whole brain.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of epilepsy underlies complex network dysfunction, the cell-type-specific contributions of which remain poorly defined in human disease. In this study, we developed a strategy that simultaneously isolates neuronal, astrocyte and oligodendroglial progenitor (OPC)-enriched nuclei from human fresh-frozen neocortex and applied it to characterize the distinct transcriptome of each cell type in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgical samples. Differential RNA-seq analysis revealed several dysregulated pathways in neurons, OPCs, and astrocytes, and disclosed an immature phenotype switch in TLE astrocytes. An independent single cell RNA-seq TLE dataset uncovered a hybrid population of cells aberrantly co-expressing canonical astrocyte and OPC-like progenitor markers (GFAP+OLIG2+ glia), which we corroborated in-situ in human TLE samples, and further demonstrated their emergence after chronic seizure injury in a mouse model of status epilepticus. In line with their immature signature, a subset of human TLE glia were also abnormally proliferative, both in-vivo and in-vitro. Generally, this analysis validates the utility of the proposed cell type-specific isolation strategy to study glia-specific changes ex vivo using fresh-frozen human samples, and specifically, it delineates an aberrant glial phenotype in human TLE specimens.",

    "abstract": "Demyelination, the loss of the protecting sheath of neurons, contributes to disability in many neurological diseases. In order to fully understand its role in different diseases and to monitor treatments aiming at reversing this process, it would be valuable to have PET radiotracers that can detect and quantify molecular changes involved in demyelination such as the uncovering and upregulation of the axonal potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2. Carbon-11 labeled radiotracers present the advantage of allowing for multiple scans on the same subject in the same day. Here, we describe [11C|3MeO4AP, a novel 11C-labeled version of the K+ channel tracer [18F]3F4AP, and characterize its imaging properties in two nonhuman primates including a monkey with a focal brain injury sustained during a surgical procedure three years prior to imaging. Our findings show that [11C]3MeO4AP is brain permeable, metabolically stable and has high plasma availability. When compared with [18F]3F4AP, [11C]3MeO4AP shows very high correlation in volumes of distribution (VT) confirming a common target. [11C]3MeO4AP shows slower washout than [18F]3F4AP suggesting stronger binding. Finally, similar to [18F]3F4AP, [11C]3MeO4AP is highly sensitive to the focal brain injury. All these features make it a promising radioligand for imaging demyelinated lesions.",

    "abstract": "Proponents of personalized medicine have promoted neuroimaging evaluation and treatment of major depressive disorder in three areas of clinical application: clinical prediction, outcome evaluation, and neurofeedback. Whereas psychometric considerations such as test-retest reliability are basic precursors to clinical adoption for most clinical instruments, they are often not considered for neuroimaging assessments. As an example, we consider functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of depression, a common and particularly well validated mechanistic technology for understanding disorder and guiding treatment. In this article, we review work on test-retest reliability for depression fMRI studies. We find that basic psychometrics have not been regularly attended to in this domain. For instance, no fMRI neurofeedback study has included measures of test-retest reliability despite the implicit assumption that brain signals are stable enough to train. We consider several factors that could be useful to aid clinical translation including 1) attending to how the BOLD response is parameterized, 2) identifying and promoting regions or voxels with stronger psychometric properties 3) accounting for within-individual changes (e.g., in symptomatology) across time and 4) focusing on tasks and clinical populations that are relevant for the intended clinical application. We apply these principles to published prognostic and neurofeedback data sets. The broad implication of this work is that attention to psychometrics is important for clinical adoption of mechanistic assessment, is feasible, and may improve the underlying science.",

    "abstract": "When choosing between rewards that differ in temporal proximity (inter-temporal choice), human preferences are typically stable, constituting a clinically-relevant transdiagnostic trait. Here we show in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior limb of the internal capsule / nucleus accumbens region for treatment-resistant obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), that long-term chronic (but not phasic) DBS disrupts inter-temporal preferences. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling accounting for temporal discounting behavior across multiple time points allowed us to assess both short-term and long-term reliability of inter-temporal choice. In controls, temporal discounting was highly reliable, both long-term (6 months) and short-term (1 week). In contrast, in patients undergoing DBS, short-term reliability was high, but long-term reliability (6 months) was severely disrupted. Control analyses confirmed that this effect was not due to range restriction, the presence of OCD symptoms or group differences in choice stochasticity. Model-agnostic between- and within-subject analyses confirmed this effect. These findings provide initial evidence for long-term modulation of cognitive function via DBS and highlight a potential contribution of the human nucleus accumbens region to inter-temporal preference stability over time.\n\nSignificance StatementChoosing between rewards that differ in temporal proximity is in part a stable trait with relevance for many mental disorders, and depends on prefrontal regions and regions of the dopamine system. Here we show that chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the human anterior limb of the internal capsule / nucleus accumbens region for treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive disorder disrupts the stability of inter-temporal preferences. These findings show that chronic stimulation of one of the brains central motivational hubs can disrupt preferences thought to depend on this circuit.",

In contrast to our own camera-type eyes, compound eyes reveal their resolution, sensitivity, and field of view externally, provided they have spherical curvature and orthogonal ommatidia. Non-spherical compound eyes with skewed ommatidia require measuring internal structures, such as with MicroCT (CT). Thus far, there is no efficient tool to characterize compound eye optics, from either 2D or 3D data, automatically. Here we present two open-source programs: (1) the ommatidia detecting algorithm (ODA), which measures ommatidia count and diameter in 2D images, and (2) a CT pipeline (ODA-3D), which calculates anatomical acuity, sensitivity, and field of view across the eye by applying the ODA to 3D data. We validate these algorithms on images, images of replicas, and CT eye scans from ants, fruit flies, moths, and a bee.",

    "abstract": "An important goal of urban ecology is determining what differentiates urban-tolerant populations of birds from their non-urban ancestors and urban-intolerant species. One key to urban success may be reacting appropriately to human activity, and the degree to which birds view humans as threats can be quantified by their escape behavior. Understanding individual-level plasticity, however, requires the tracking of known individuals. We compared flight-initiation distances (FID) and distances fled (DF) from approaches by a human across urban and non-urban populations of individually-marked Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) in southern California. The urban population is more tolerant to people as evidenced by attenuated FIDs and DFs relative to non-urban birds. Although individual urban birds either habituated or sensitized to repeated approaches, there was no significant pattern at the population level. Overall, the behavioral patterns exhibited by urban juncos are more supportive of in situ evolution than either being a biased sample from an ancestral non-urban population or intrinsic behavioral plasticity that produces a uniform adjustment to urban life.",

Prior research suggests that the hippocampus, which supports memory for past events, can sometimes support integration of overlapping associations or separate events, but the conditions which lead to hippocampus-dependent memory integration are unclear. We used functional brain imaging to test whether the ability to form a larger narrative (narrative coherence) drives hippocampal memory integration. During encoding of fictional stories, the hippocampus supported patterns of activity, including activity at boundaries between events, which were more similar between distant events that formed one coherent narrative, compared with events taken from unrelated narratives. Twenty-four hours later, the hippocampus preferentially supported detailed recall of coherent narrative events, through reinstatement of hippocampal activity patterns from encoding. These findings reveal a key function of the hippocampus: the dynamic integration of events into a narrative structure for memory.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common organ failures following surgery. We have developed a tripeptide mimetic (ANXA1sp) of the parent annexin A1 molecule that shows promise as an organ protectant limiting cellular stress; however, its potential as a kidney protective agent remains unexplored, and its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Our hypothesis was that ANXA1sp would limit kidney injury and improve mitochondrial function following surgical ischemic kidney injury.\n\nMethodsIn blinded fashion, wildtype mice were assigned to receive vehicle control or experimental drug (ANXA1sp) 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after kidney vascular clamping. Our primary outcome was assessment of kidney injury and function by measurement of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and histologic injury scoring of kidney tissue sections. Immunofluorescence microscopy, real-time PCR and western blot were used to assess cell death, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial biomarkers. An in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation in immortalized kidney tubule cells was used.\n\nResultsANXA1sp given prior to and after ischemic kidney injury abrogated ischemic AKI. ANXA1sp further limited kidney cell death and oxidative stress following ischemia. ANXA1sp significantly improved markers associated with mitochondrial DNA repair and mitochondrial biogenesis. ANXA1sp upregulated expression of the mitochondrial protectant sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) in the mitochondria of kidney tubular cells. Silencing of SIRT3 limited ANXA1sp-mediated protection against hypoxic cell death.\n\nConclusionsANXA1sp limits kidney injury through upregulation of SIRT3 and consequent preservation of mitochondrial function. ANXA1sp holds considerable promise as a perioperative kidney protectant prior to ischemia inducing surgery and/or kidney transplantation.",

However, it remains unclear whether astrocytic subpopulations IR for other astrocytic markers are similarly affected. Astrocytes IR to vimentin (VIM) display different regional densities than GFAP-IR astrocytes in the healthy brain, and so may be differently altered in depression and suicide. To investigate this, we compared the densities of GFAP-IR astrocytes and VIM-IR astrocytes in postmortem brain samples from depressed suicides and matched non-psychiatric controls in three brain regions (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal caudate nucleus and mediodorsal thalamus). A quantitative comparison of the fine morphology of VIM-IR astrocytes was also performed in the same regions and subjects. Finally, given the close association between astrocytes and blood vessels, we also assessed densities of CD31-IR blood vessels. Like for GFAP-IR astrocytes, VIM-IR astrocyte densities were found to be globally reduced in depressed suicide relative to controls. By contrast, CD31-IR blood vessel density and VIM-IR astrocyte morphometric features in these regions were similar between groups, except in prefrontal white matter, in which vascularization was increased and astrocytes displayed fewer primary processes. By revealing a widespread reduction of cerebral VIM-IR astrocytes in cases vs. controls, these findings further implicate astrocytic dysfunctions in depression and suicide.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, resulting in over 200 million infections and 400,000 deaths every year. A critical step of malaria infection is when sporozoites, injected by mosquitoes, travel to the liver and form liver stages. Malaria vaccine candidates which induce large numbers of malaria-specific CD8 T cells in mice are able to eliminate all liver stages, preventing fulminant malaria. However, how CD8 T cells find all parasites in 48 hours of the liver stage lifespan is not well understood. Using intravital microscopy of murine livers, we generated unique data on T cell search for malaria liver stages within a few hours after infection. To detect attraction of T cells to an infection site, we used the von Mises-Fisher distribution in 3D, similar to the 2D von Mises distribution previously used in ecology. Our results suggest that the vast majority (70-95%) of malaria-specific and non-specific liver-localized CD8 T cells did not display attraction towards the infection site, suggesting that the search for malaria liver stages occurs randomly. However, a small fraction (15-20%) displayed weak but detectable attraction towards parasites which already had been surrounded by several T cells. We found that speeds and turning angles correlated with attraction, suggesting that understanding mechanisms that determine the speed of T cell movement in the liver may improve the efficacy of future T cell-based vaccines. Stochastic simulations suggest that a small movement bias towards the parasite dramatically reduces the number of CD8 T cells needed to eliminate all malaria liver stages, but to detect such attraction by individual cells requires data from long imaging experiments which are not currently feasible. Importantly, as far as we know this is the first demonstration of how activated/memory CD8 T cells might search for the pathogen in nonlymphoid tissues a few hours after infection. We have also established a framework for how attraction of individual T cells towards a location in 3D can be rigorously evaluated.",

    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination generates mature B cells that express huge repertoires of primary antibodies as diverse immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light chains (IgL) of their B cell antigen receptors (BCRs). Cognate antigen binding to BCR variable region domains activates B cells into the germinal center (GC) reaction in which somatic hypermutation (SHM) modifies primary variable region-encoding sequences, with subsequent selection for mutations that improve antigen-binding affinity, ultimately leading to antibody affinity maturation. Based on these principles, we developed a humanized mouse model approach to diversify an anti-PD1 therapeutic antibody and allow isolation of variants with novel properties. In this approach, component Ig gene segments of the anti-PD1 antibody underwent de novo V(D)J recombination to diversify the anti-PD1 antibody in the primary antibody repertoire in the mouse models. Immunization of these mouse models further modifies the anti-PD1 antibodies through SHM. Known anti-PD1 antibodies block interaction of PD1 with its ligands to alleviate PD1-mediated T cell suppression, thereby boosting anti-tumor T cell responses. By diversifying one such anti-PD1 antibody, we derived many new anti-PD1 antibodies, including anti-PD1 antibodies with the opposite activity of enhancing PD1/ligand interaction. Such antibodies theoretically might suppress deleterious T cell activities in autoimmune diseases. The approach we describe should be generally applicable for diversifying other therapeutic antibodies.\n\nSignificance StatementThe immune system is capable of producing enormous varieties of antibodies to counter pathogenic infections. In this study, we devised a method to harness the power of the immune system to produce potentially therapeutic antibodies. As a test, we used this method to generate antibodies against the human PD1 molecule, a negative regulator of T cell activity. Available anti-PD1 therapeutic antibodies inhibit the function of PD1, thereby boosting T cell activity against tumor cells. Through our approach, we diversified one such anti-PD1 antibody in our mouse models. From this work, we obtained multiple new anti-PD1 antibodies, some of which can stimulate, rather than inhibit, PD1 function in vitro. Such PD1 stimulatory antibodies could potentially be used to suppress pathogenic T cell activities in autoimmune diseases. This method could be used to diversify the functions of other therapeutic antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Different protist species which colonize the hindguts of wood feeding Reticulitermes termites are associated with endosymbiotic bacteria belonging to the genus Endomicrobium. In this study, we focused on the endosymbionts of three protist species from Reticulitermes flavipes, which included Pyrsonympha vertens, Trichonympha agilis, and Dinenympha species II. Since these protist hosts represented members of difference taxa which colonize different niches within the hindguts of their termite hosts, we investigated if these differences translated to differential gene content and expression in their endosymbionts. Following assembly and comparative genome and transcriptome analyses, we discovered that these endosymbionts differed with respect to possible niche specific traits such carbon metabolism. Our analyses supported that genes related to carbon metabolism were acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from donor taxa which are present in termites hindgut community. In addition, our analyses supported that these endosymbionts have retained and expressed genes related to natural transformation (competence) and recombination. Taken together, the presence of genes acquired by HGT and a putative competence pathway supported that these endosymbionts are not cut-off from gene flow and that competence may be a mechanism by which members of the Endomicrobium can acquire new traits.\n\nImportanceThe composition and structure of wood, which contains cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, prevents most organisms from using this common food source. Termites are a rare exception among animals, and they rely on a complex microbiome housed in their hindguts to use wood as a source of food. The lower termite R. flavipes houses a variety of protist and prokaryotes that are the key players the disassembly of lignocellulose. In this paper we describe the genomes and the gene expression profiles of five Endomicrobium endosymbionts living inside three different protist species from R. flavipes. Data from these genomes suggest that these Endomicrobium species have different mechanisms for using both carbon and nitrogen. In addition, they harbor genes that may be used to import free DNA from their environment. This process of DNA-uptake may cntribute to the high levels of horizontal gene transfer often seen in the Endomicrobium species.",

However, the intraspecific plant response to abiotic factors and the overall effect on plant growth and productivity is still under debate. We studied forest productivity for 30 Quercus ilex subsp ballota forests in Spain along a broad climatic gradient of aridity (mean annual precipitation from 321 to 1582 mm). We used linear mixed models to quantify the effect of climatic and edaphic factors on functional traits, and to study the effect of functional traits and abiotic factors on the relative growth rate (RGR) of adult trees. Then we used piecewise structural equation models (SEMs) to determine the causal effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on forest productivity. Our results showed that forest productivity is positively affected by forest biomass and RGR, which are mainly affected by functional traits and tree biomass, respectively. In conclusion, intraspecific variability of functional traits have a significant effect on plant biomass and growth, which ultimately explain forest productivity in Quercus ilex.",

    "abstract": "Woody plants are expanding into the Arctic under a warming climate. The related impact on plant diversity is not well understood because we have only limited knowledge about plant assembly rules and because of a lack of time-series of plant diversity. Here, we applied sedimentary ancient DNA metabarcoding using the plant-specific g and h primers of the trnL gene to a sediment record from Lake Ilirney (central Chukotka Far Eastern Russia) covering the last 28 thousand years. Our results show that forb-dominated steppe-tundra and Saliceae-rich dwarf-shrub tundra communities dominated during the cold climate before 14 ka, while deciduous erect-shrub tundra was abundant during the warm period between 14 and 0 ka. Larix invasion during the late Holocene substantially lagged behind the period of densest vegetation and likely warmest period between 10 and 6 ka. Overall, we discovered the highest richness during 28-23 ka and a second richness peak during 13-10 ka: both periods are characterised by low shrub abundance. The richest communities during the cold pre-14 ka period were phylogenetically clustered, which probably originates from environmental filtering along with niche differentiation under limited resources. In contrast, the richest post-14 ka community was phylogenetically overdispersed, likely originating from an erratic recruitment process in the course of warming. Despite differences in timescale, some of our evidence can be relevant to arctic plant diversity changes. By analogy to the past, we expect a lagged response of tree invasion. In the long-term, ongoing expansion of deciduous shrubs will eventually result in a phylogenetically more diverse community but will also cause reduced plant taxonomic richness; however, richness may overshoot in the short-term.",

    "abstract": "Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (HvKp) is typically associated with ST23 clone; however, hvKp is also emerging from clones ST11, ST15 and ST147, which are also multi-drug resistant (MDR). Here, we aimed to characterise nine novel MDR hvKp isolates harbouring mosaic plasmids simultaneously carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes. Nine HvKp isolates obtained from hospitalised patients in southern India were characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility and hypervirulence phenotypes. All nine hvKp isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) using Ilumina HiSeq2500 and a subset of four were sequenced using Oxford Nanopore MinION. Among the nine isolates, seven were carbapenem-resistant, two of which carried blaNDM-5 on an IncFII plasmid and five carried blaOXA-232 on a ColKP3 plasmid. The virulence determinants were encoded in a mosaic plasmid ([~]320 Kbp) that formed as a result of its insertion in a IncFIB-IncHI1B plasmid co-integrate. The mosaic plasmid carried AMR genes (aadA2, armA, blaOXA-1, msrE, mphE, sul1 and dfrA14) in addition to rmpA2, iutA and iucABCD virulence genes. Interestingly the mosaic plasmid carried its own type IV-A3 CRISPR-cas system that is likely able to target the acquisition of IncF plasmid with the help of a traL spacer. The convergence of virulence and AMR is the biggest threat among invasive K. pneumoniae infections. However, increasing reports of the presence of mosaic plasmid carrying both AMR and virulence genes suggests MDR-hvKp isolates are no longer confined to selected clones and the containment of such isolates is very challenging.\n\nIMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen that commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections in the urinary tract, respiratory tract, lung, wound sites. The organism has gained notoriety by acquiring additional genetic traits to become either hypervirulent (HV) phenotype or multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype. Though the infections by both these phenotypes were very challenging to treat, the MDR K. pneumonia (MDR-Kp) were remained in the hospital settings while HV K. pneumonia (hvKp) strains were mostly originated from the community settings. In a recent turn of events, the evolution of MDR-Kp and hvKp has converged as both clones found to carry both MDR plasmids and virulence plasmid. These convergent strains are challenging to treat and is associated with higher mortality rate. As the recent hvKp isolates harbour mosaic plasmid encoding both AMR and virulence determinants there is a need to investigate the evolution of these pathogens. The significance of our research is in characterising the novel mosaic plasmid identified in MDR-hvKp isolates that belong sequence type (ST) 2096. Tracking the possible evolution pathway of MDR-hvKPs would greatly help in the proper surveillance and management of this superbugs.\n\nRepositoriesThe whole genome sequences of the present study isolates have been deposited in GenBank, NCBI, with accession numbers CP053765 - CP053770, CP053771 - CP053780, CP058798-CP058806, JAARNO010000001.1 - JAARNO010000005.1, JAAQSG000000000, JAARNJ000000000, JAARMH000000000 and JAAQTC000000000",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInvasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) is one of the leading causes of bacteraemia in sub-Saharan Africa. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) and further resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones have emerged in multiple iNTS serotypes. Molecular epidemiological investigations of nontyphoidal Salmonella are needed to better understand the genetic characteristics and transmission dynamics associated with major MDR iNTS serotypes across the continent.\n\nMethodsA total of 166 nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates causing invasive disease were collected from a multi-centre study in eight African countries between 2010 and 2014, and whole-genome sequenced to investigate the geographical distribution, antimicrobial genetic determinants and population structure of iNTS serotypes-genotypes. Phylogeographical reconstruction was further conducted in context of the existing genomic framework of iNTS serotypes Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Population-based incidence of MDR-iNTS disease was also estimated.\n\nResultsSalmonella enterica subsp. Enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) sequence-type (ST) 313 and Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica serotype Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) ST11 were predominant, and both exhibited high frequencies of MDR. Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica serotype Dublin (S. Dublin) ST10 emerged in West Africa. Mutations in the gyrA gene were identified in S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in Ghana; and ST313 carrying blaCTX-M-15 was found in Kenya. Inter-country transmission of MDR ST313 lineage II and the West African Clade of MDR ST11 between Ghana and neighbouring countries including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria were evident. The incidence of MDR-iNTS disease exceeded 100/100,000-person years-of-observation (PYO) in children aged <5 years in several West African countries.\n\nConclusionsMultiple MDR iNTS serotypes-sequence types, predominantly S. Typhimurium ST313 and S. Enteritidis ST11, are co-circulating in sub-Saharan Africa with evidence of transmission between West African countries. The development of safe and effective iNTS vaccines coupled with appropriate antimicrobial stewardship and adequate epidemiological monitoring are essential to limit the impact of these pathogens in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Nearby genes are often expressed as a group. Yet, the prevalence, molecular mechanisms and genetic control of local gene co-expression are far from being understood. Here, by leveraging gene expression measurements across 49 human tissues and hundreds of individuals, we found that local gene co-expression occurs in 13% to 53% genes per tissue. By integrating various molecular assays (e.g. ChIP-seq and Hi-C), we estimated the ability of several mechanisms, such as enhancer-gene targeting, in distinguishing gene pairs that are co-expressed from those that are not. Notably, we identified 32,636 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) which associate to co-expressed gene pairs and often overlap enhancer regions. Due to affecting several genes, these eQTLs are more often associated with multiple human traits than other eQTLs. Our extensive search for local gene co-expression opens the way to comprehend trait pleiotropy and comorbidity and provide functional interpretation of QTL and GWAS findings.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome-wide association studies show that variants in individual genomic loci alone are not sufficient to explain the heritability of complex, quantitative phenotypes. Many computational methods have been developed to address this issue by considering subsets of loci that can collectively predict the phenotype. This problem can be considered a challenging instance of feature selection in which the number of dimensions (loci that are screened) is much larger than the number of samples. While currently available methods can achieve decent phenotype prediction performance, they either do not scale to large datasets or have parameters that require extensive tuning.\n\nResultsWe propose a fast and simple algorithm, Macarons, to select a small, complementary subset of variants by avoiding redundant pairs that are in linkage disequilibrium. Our method features two interpretable parameters that control the time/performance trade-off without requiring parameter tuning. In our computational experiments, we show that Macarons consistently achieves similar or better prediction performance than state-of-the-art selection methods while having a simpler premise and being at least 2 orders of magnitude faster. Overall, Macarons can seamlessly scale to the human genome with ~107 variants in a matter of minutes while taking the dependencies between the variants into account.\n\nConclusionMacarons can offer a reasonable trade-off between phenotype predictivity, runtime and the complementarity of the selected subsets. The framework we present can be generalized to other high-dimensional feature selection problems within and beyond biomedical applications.\n\nAvailabilityMacarons is implemented in Matlab and the source code is available at: https://github.com/serhan-yilmaz/macarons",

    "abstract": "The ability to dynamically remodel DNA origami structures or functional nanodevices is highly desired in the field of DNA nanotechnology. Concomitantly, the use of fluorophores to track and validate the dynamics of such DNA-based architectures is commonplace and often unavoidable. It is therefore crucial to be aware of the side effects of popular fluorophores, which are often exchanged without considering the potential impact on the system. Here, we show that the choice of fluorophore can strongly affect the reconfiguration of DNA nanostructures. To this end, we encapsulate a triple-stranded DNA (tsDNA) into water-in-oil compartments and functionalize their periphery with a single-stranded DNA handle (ssDNA). Thus, the tsDNA can bind and unbind from the periphery by reversible opening of the triplex and subsequent strand displacement. Using a combination of experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and reaction-diffusion modeling, we demonstrate for twelve different fluorophore combinations that it is possible to alter or even inhibit the DNA nanostructure formation - without changing the DNA sequence. Besides its immediate importance for the design of pH-responsive switches and fluorophore labelling, our work presents a strategy to precisely tune the energy landscape of dynamic DNA nanodevices.",

    "abstract": "To understand the pathophysiological impact of liver microbiota on the early stages of fibrosis we identified the corresponding microbiota sequences and overcome the impact of different group size and patient origins with adapted statistical approaches. Liver samples with low liver fibrosis scores (F0, F1, F2) were collected from Romania(n=36), Austria(n=10), Italy(n=19), and Spain(n=17). The 16SrDNA gene was sequenced. We considered the frequency, sparsity, unbalanced sample size between cohorts to identify taxonomic profiles and statistical differences. Multivariate analyses, including adapted spectral clustering with L1-penalty fair-discriminant strategies, and predicted metagenomics were used to identify that 50 % of liver taxa were Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. The Caulobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae and Propionibacteriaceae discriminated between F0 and F1. The preQ0 biosynthesis and pathways involving glucoryranose and glycogen degradation were negatively associated with liver fibrosis F1-F2 vs F0. Altogether, our results suggest a role of bacterial translocation to the liver in the progression of fibrosis. This statistical approach can identify microbial signatures and overcome issues regarding sample size differences, the impact of environment, and sets of analyses.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form a root endosymbiosis with many agronomically important crop species and both enhance the ability of their host to obtain nutrients from the soil and increase host tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors. However, AM fungal species differ in the benefits they provide to their host plants. Here, we examined the putative molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the physiological response of Medicago truncatula to either Rhizophagus irregularis or Glomus aggregatum, a high or a low benefit AM fungus, respectively. Colonization with R. irregularis led to higher growth and nutrient uptake benefits than the colonization with G. aggregatum. These benefits were linked to an elevated expression in the roots of genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis (NSP1, NSP2, CCD7, and MAX1a), mycorrhiza-induced phosphate (PT8), ammonium (AMT2;3), and nitrate (NPF4.12) transporters and the putative ammonium transporter NIP1;5. R. irregularis also stimulated the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in the shoot and the upregulation of the sugar transporters SWEET1.2, SWEET3.3 and SWEET 12 and the lipid biosynthesis gene RAM2 in the roots. In contrast, G. aggregatum induced the expression of biotic stress defense response genes in the shoots and several genes associated with abiotic stress in the roots. This suggests that either the host perceives colonization by G. aggregatum as a pathogen attack or that G. aggregatum can prime host defense responses. Our findings reveal novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the host plant response to colonization with high- and low-benefit arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbionts.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal networks maintain robust patterns of activity despite a backdrop of noise from various sources. Mutually inhibiting neurons is a standard network motif implicated in rhythm generation. In an elementary network motif of two neurons capable of swapping from an active state to a quiescent state, we ask how different sources of stochasticity alter firing patterns. In this system, the alternating activity occurs via combined action of a calcium-dependent potassium current, sAHP (slow afterhyperpolarization), and a fast GABAergic synapse. We show that simulating extrinsic noise arising from background activity extends the dynamical range of neuronal firing. Extrinsic noise also has the effect of increasing the switching frequency via a faster build-up of sAHP current. We show that switching frequency as a function of input current has a non-monotonic behavior. Interestingly the noise tolerance of this system varies with the input current. It shows maximum robustness to noise at an input current that corresponds to the minimum switching frequency between the neurons. The slow decay time scale of sAHP conductance allows neurons to act as a low-pass filter, attenuate noise, and integrate over ion channel fluctuations. Additionally, we show that the slow inactivation time of the sAHP channel allows the neuron to act as an action potential counter. We propose that this intrinsic property of the current allows the network to maintain rhythmic activity critical for various functions, despite the noise, and operate as a temporal integrator.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStructural covariance network (SCN) has been applied successfully to structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. However, most SCNs were constructed by the unitary marker, which was insensitive for the different disease phases. The aim of this study is to devise a novel regional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) that could provide more comprehensive information in morphological network analysis.\n\nMethodsRegional radiomics similarity network (R2SN) was constructed by computing the Pearson correlations between the radiomics features extracted from any pair of regions for each subject. We further assessed the small-world property of R2SN using the graph theory method, as well as the reproducibility in the different datasets and the reliability with test-retest analysis. The relationship between the R2SN and inter-regional co-expression of gene enriched was also explored, as well as the relationship with general intelligence.\n\nResultsThe R2SN can be replicated in different datasets, also regardless of using different feature subsets. The R2SN showed high reliability with the test-retest analysis (ICC>0.7). Besides, the small-word property ({sigma}>2) and the high correlation with the gene expression (R=0.24, P<0.001) and the general intelligence was found by R2SN.\n\nConclusionR2SN provides a novel, reliable, and biologically plausible method to understand human morphological covariance based on structural MRI.\n\nImpact StatementImaging biomarkers are the cornerstone of modern radiology, and the development of valid biomarkers is crucial for optimizing individualized prediction in neurological disorders like AD. Thus, the development of the data mining method from neuroimaging is crucial for adding the biomarkers of disease. This study confirmed that R2SN provides a novel, robust and biologically plausible model and a new perspective for understanding the human brain, therefore. Thus, the R2SN has great promise in further study.",

The Type II secretion system (T2SS), a significant virulence pathway in many pathogens, belongs to this superfamily. A knowledge gap in the understanding of the T2SS is the molecular role of a small  pseudopilin protein. Using multiple biophysical techniques, we have deciphered how this missing component of the Xcp T2SS architecture is structurally integrated, and thereby also unlocked its function. We demonstrate that the low abundance XcpH is the adapter that bridges a trimeric initiating tip complex XcpIJK with a periplasmic filament of XcpG subunits. Our model reveals that each pseudopilin protein caps an XcpG protofilament in an overall pseudopilus compatible with the dimensions of the periplasm and the outer membrane-spanning secretin through which substrates of the T2SS pass. Unexpectedly, to fulfill its adapter function, the XcpH N-terminal helix must be unwound, a property shared with the XcpG subunits. We provide the first complete structural model of a type IV filament, a result immediately transferable to understanding of other T2SS and the type IV pili.",

    "abstract": "Methods for remediating PCR and sequencing artifacts in 16S rRNA gene sequence collections are in continuous development and have significant ramifications on the inferences that can be drawn. A common approach is to remove rare amplcon sequence variants (ASVs) from datasets. But, the definition of rarity is generally selected without regard for the number of sequences in the samples or the variation in sequencing depth across samples within a study. I analyzed the impact of removing rare ASVs on metrics of alpha and beta diversity using samples collected across 12 published datasets. Removal of rare ASVs significantly decreased the number of ASVs and operational taxonomic units as well as their diversity. Furthermore, their removal increased the variation in community structure between samples. When simulating a known effect size, removal of rare ASVs reduced the power to detect the effect relative to not removing rare ASVs. Removal of rare ASVs did not affect the false detection rate when samples were randomized to simulate a null model. However, the false detection rate increased when rare ASVs were removed using a null distribution and assignment of samples to simulated treatment groups according to their sequencing depth. The false detection rate did not vary when rare ASVs were retained. This analysis demonstrates the problems inherent in removing rare ASVs. Researchers are encouraged to retain rare ASVs, to select approaches that minimize PCR and sequencing artifacts, and to use rarefaction to control for uneven sequencing effort.\n\nImportanceRemoving rare amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from 16S rRNA gene sequence collections is an approach that has grown in popularity for limiting PCR and sequencing artifacts. Yet, it is unclear what impact an abundance-based filter has on downstream analyses. To investigate the effects of removing rare ASVs, I analyzed the community distributions found in the samples of 12 published datasets. Analysis of these data and simulations based on them showed that removal of rare ASVs distorts the representation of microbial communities. This has the effect of artificially making it more difficult to detect differences between treatment groups. Also of concern was the observation that if sequencing depth is confounded with the treatment, then the probability of falsely detecting a difference between the treatment groups increased with the removal of rare ASVs. The practice of removing rare ASVs should stop, lest researcher adversely affect the interpretation of their data.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription in stimulus-inducible genes requires topoisomerase II{beta} (TOP2B)-mediated DNA strand break and the activation of DNA damage response signaling in humans. Here, we report a novel function of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)-BRCA1 associated ring domain 1 (BARD1) complex, in this process. We found that BRCA1 is phosphorylated at S1524 by the kinases ATM and ATR during gene activation and that this event is essential for productive transcription. Our in vitro biochemical analyses showed TOP2B and BARD1 interaction and colocalization in the EGR1 transcription start site (TSS) and that the BRCA1-BARD1 complex ubiquitinates TOP2B, which appears to stabilize TOP2B protein in the cell and binding to DNA. Intriguingly, BRCA1 phosphorylation at S1524 controls this interaction. In addition, genomic analyses indicated colocalization between TOP2B and BRCA1 in a large number of protein-coding genes. Together, these findings reveal the novel function of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex in gene expression and in the regulation of TOP2B during Pol II transcription.\n\nSignificance StatementMaintaining genomic integrity against cellular and extracellular genotoxic elements is essential for normal cell growth and function. Recent studies indicated that stimulus-induced transcription provokes topoisomerase II{beta}-mediated DNA strand break and DNA damage response signaling, requiring DNA repair to be coupled with transcription. Here, we present a novel role for the BRCA1-BARD1 complex in regulating the transcription of serum-inducible genes and the stability of topoisomerase II{beta}. The mechanism involving topoisomerase II{beta} ubiquitination by the BRCA1-BARD1 complex and the phosphorylation of BRCA1 S1524 upon transcriptional activation appears to function as a switch to the reaction. Our findings provide the first evidence of functional interaction between the BRCA1-BARD1 complex and topoisomerase II{beta} in transcription in humans.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are key components of regulatory networks that control crucial aspects of cell decision making. The intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of tumor suppressor p53 mediates its interactions with multiple regulatory pathways to control the p53 homeostasis during the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Many cancer-associated mutations have been discovered in p53-TAD, but their structural and functional consequences are poorly understood. Here, by combining atomistic simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and binding assays, we demonstrate that cancer-associated mutations can significantly perturb the balance of p53 interactions with key activation and degradation regulators. Importantly, mutations do not all directly disrupt the known interaction interfaces. Instead, some mutations likely modulate the disordered state of p53-TAD, which affects the interactions. Our work suggests that the disordered conformational ensemble of p53-TAD can serve as a central conduit in regulating the response to various cellular stimuli at the protein-protein interaction level. Understanding how the disordered state of IDPs may be modulated by regulatory signals and/or disease associated perturbations will be essential in the studies on the role of IDPs in biology and diseases.",

Intersecting with these basic science concepts, the identification of pioneer factors (PFs) fused together as driver translocations in childhood cancers raises questions of whether these fusions retain the fundamental ability to invade repressed chromatin, consistent with their monomeric PF constituents. In this study, we define the cellular and chromatin localization of the translocation, PAX3-FOXO1, an oncogenic driver of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), derived from a genetic fusion of PFs. To quantitatively define its chromatin-targeting functions and capacity to drive epigenetic reprogramming, we developed a new method for ChIP-seq with per-cell normalization (pc-ChIP-seq). Our quantitative localization studies address structural variation in RMS genomes and reveal novel insights into heterochromatin localization of PAX3-FOXO1. From these studies, we report novel pioneer function for the major driver oncogene in RMS, with repressed chromatin binding and nucleosome-motif targeting in human cells.",
