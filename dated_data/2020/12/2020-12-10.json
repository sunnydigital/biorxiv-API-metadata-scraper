    "abstract": "Biodiversity loss is becoming a global concern due to its negative impact on services associated with the ecosystem. For agricultural soil to maintain these multi-services, the conservation of soil microbial diversity is of utmost importance. Mixed cropping systems involve the utilisation of multiple crop species on the field as well as the diversification of aboveground plants, although several contradicting results have been reported regarding their impacts on soil microbial diversity. Therefore, for the evaluation of the impact of different leguminous species used in mixed cropping systems as well as types of fertilizer on the diversity of soil microbes, a pot study was performed under maize/legume mixed cropping systems with one of three legumes, including cowpea (Vigna unguiculate (L.) Walp.), velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC.), and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) as well as one of three types of fertilizer treatments, namely chemical fertilizer (CF), carbonised chicken manure (CM), or the lack of fertilizer (Ctr). 16S rRNA analyses were conducted using the soils sampled from each pot for soil bacterial diversity assessment. Concerning the results, a decrease in the microbial diversity after CM application was shown by the soil with velvet bean + maize (MM) when compared to the Ctr treatment, while an increase in the microbial diversity was shown by the soil with common bean + maize (PM) under the same condition. In case of the CM application, the abundance of treatment-unique bacteria increased in the PM treatment, although their decrease was observed for the MM treatment. In contrast, the abundance of dominant microbes, including Thaumarchaeota was significantly lower in PM but higher in MM when the CM was applied. Legume species-dependent factors, including nutrient absorption and root exudate composition might be important concerning soil bacterial diversities. For the conservation of soil microbial diversity with mixed cropping, the interaction effect of legume species and fertilizer type should be considered in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the availability of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) remains a major clinical target for reducing circulating plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Here, we identify the molecular mechanism underlying genome-wide significant associations in the GOLIATH locus with plasma LDL-C levels. We demonstrate that GOLIATH is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates the LDL Receptor resulting in redistribution away from the plasma membrane. Overexpression of GOLIATH decreases hepatic LDLR and increases plasma LDL-C levels. Silencing of Goliath using antisense oligonucleotides, germline deletion, or AAV-CRISPR in vivo strategies increases hepatic LDLR abundance and availability, thus decreasing plasma LDL-C. In vitro ubiquitination assays demonstrate RING-dependent regulation of LDLR abundance at the plasma membrane. Our studies identify GOLIATH as a novel post-translational regulator of LDL-C levels via modulation of LDLR availability, which is likely important for understanding the complex regulation of hepatic LDLR.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate lens is a valuable model system for investigating the gene expression changes that coordinate tissue differentiation due to its inclusion of two spatially separated cell types, the outer epithelial cells and the deeper denucleated fiber cells that they support. Zebrafish are a useful model system for studying lens development given the organs rapid development in the first several days of life in an accessible, transparent embryo. While we have strong foundational knowledge of the diverse lens crystallin proteins and the basic gene regulatory networks controlling lens development, no study has detailed gene expression in a vertebrate lens at single cell resolution. Here we report an atlas of lens gene expression in zebrafish embryos at single cell resolution through five days of development, identifying a number of novel regulators of lens development as potential targets for future functional studies. Our temporospatial expression data address open questions about the function of -crystallins during lens development and provides the first detailed view of {beta}- and {gamma}-crystallin expression in and outside the lens. We describe subfunctionalization in transcription factor genes that occur as paralog pairs in the zebrafish. Finally, we examine the expression dynamics of cytoskeletal, RNA-binding, and transcription factors genes, identifying a number of novel patterns. Overall these data provide a foundation for identifying and characterizing lens developmental regulatory mechanisms and revealing targets for future functional studies with potential therapeutic impact.",

    "abstract": "The growth of biodiversity data sets generated by citizen scientists continues to accelerate. The availability of such data has greatly expanded the scale of questions researchers can address. Yet, error, bias, and noise continue to be serious concerns for analysts, particularly when data being contributed to these giant online data sets are difficult to verify. Counts of birds contributed to eBird, the worlds largest biodiversity online database, present a potentially useful resource for tracking trends over time and space in species abundances. We quantified counting errors in a sample of 1406 eBird checklists by comparing numbers contributed by birders (N=246) who visited a popular birding location in Oregon, USA, with numbers generated by a professional ornithologist engaged in a long-term study creating benchmark (reference) measurements of daily waterbird counts. We focused on waterbirds, which are easily visible at this site. We evaluated potential predictors of count differences, including characteristics of contributed checklists, of each species, and of time of day and year. Count differences were biased toward undercounts, with more than 75% of counts being below the daily benchmark value. When only checklists that actually reported a species known to be present were included, median count errors were -29.1% (range: 0 to -42.8 %; N=20 species). Model sets revealed an important influence of each species reference count, which varied seasonally as waterbird numbers fluctuated, and of percent of species known to be present each day that were included on each checklist. That is, checklists indicating a more thorough survey of the species richness at the site also had, on average, lower counting errors. However, even on checklists with the most thorough species lists, counts were biased low and exceptionally variable in their accuracy. To improve utility of such bird count data, we suggest three strategies to pursue in the future. One is to assess additional options for analytically determining how to select checklists that have the highest probability of including less biased count data, as well as exploring options for correcting bias during the analysis stage. Another is to add options for users to provide additional information that helps analysts choose checklists, such as an option for users to tag checklists where they focused on obtaining accurate counts. We also recommend exploration of opportunities to effectively calibrate citizen-science bird count data by establishing a formalized network of marquis sites where dedicated observers regularly contribute carefully collected benchmark data.",

    "abstract": "Reduced limbs and limblessness have evolved independently in many lizard clades. Skinks exhibit a wide range of limb-reduced morphologies, but only some species have been used to study the embryology of limb reduction (i.g., digit reduction in Chalcides and limb reduction in Scelotes). The genus Brachymeles, a Southeast Asian clade of skinks, includes species with a range of limb morphologies, from pentadactyl to functionally as well as structurally limbless species. Adults of the small, snake-like species Brachymeles lukbani show no sign of external limbs in the adult except for small depressions where they might be expected to occur. Embryos of B. lukbani in early stages of development, on the other hand, show a truncated but well-developed limb with a stylopod and a zeugopod, but no signs of an autopod. As development proceeds, the limbs small size persists even while the embryo elongates. These observations are made based on external morphology. We used florescent whole-mount immunofluorescence to visualize the morphology of skeletal elements and muscles within the embryonic limb of B. lukabni. Early stages have a humerus and separated ulna and radius cartilages; associated with these structures are dorsal and ventral muscle masses as those found in the embryos of other limbed species. While the limb remains small, the pectoral girdle grows in proportion to the rest of the body, with well-developed skeletal elements and their associated muscles. In later stages of development, the small limb is still present under the skin but there are few indications of its presence, save for the morphology of the scale covering it. The adult morphology consists of a well-developed pectoral girdle, small humerus, extremely reduced ulna and radius, and well-developed limb musculature connected to the pectoral girdle. These muscles form in association with a developing limb during embryonic stages, a hint that \"limbless\" lizards that possesses these muscles may have or have had at least transient developing limbs, as we find in B. lukbani. Overall, the observed pattern of ontogenetic reduction, leading to an externally limbless adult in which a limb rudiment is hidden and covered under the trunk skin, is a situation called cryptomelia. The results of this work add to our growing understanding of clade-specific patterns of limb reduction and the convergent evolution of limbless phenotypes through different developmental processes.",

    "abstract": "Although plant mitochondrial genomes typically show low rates of sequence evolution, levels of divergence in certain angiosperm lineages suggest anomalously high mitochondrial mutation rates. However, de novo mutations have never been directly analyzed in such lineages. Recent advances in high-fidelity DNA sequencing technologies have enabled detection of mitochondrial mutations when still present at low heteroplasmic frequencies. To date, these approaches have only been performed on a single plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we apply a high-fidelity technique (Duplex Sequencing) to multiple angiosperms from the genus Silene, which exhibits extreme heterogeneity in rates of mitochondrial sequence evolution among close relatives. Consistent with phylogenetic evidence, we found that S. latifolia maintains low mitochondrial variant frequencies that are comparable to previous measurements in Arabidopsis. Silene noctiflora also exhibited low variant frequencies despite high levels of historical sequence divergence, which supports other lines of evidence that this species has reverted to lower mitochondrial mutation rates after a past episode of acceleration. In contrast, S. conica showed much higher variant frequencies in mitochondrial (but not in plastid) DNA, consistent with an ongoing bout of elevated mitochondrial mutation rates. Moreover, we found an altered mutational spectrum in S. conica heavily biased towards ATGC transitions. We also observed an unusually low number of mitochondrial genome copies per cell in S. conica, potentially pointing to reduced opportunities for homologous recombination to accurately repair mismatches in this species. Overall, these results suggest that historical fluctuations in mutation rates are driving extreme variation in rates of plant mitochondrial sequence evolution.",

    "abstract": "Osteocytes are mechanosensory commander cells to regulate bone remodeling throughout the lifespan. While the osteocyte is known as a terminally differentiated cell derived from mesenchymal stem cell, the detailed mechanisms of cell-fate decision toward osteocyte differentiation still remain unclear. In this study, we fabricated three-dimensional (3D) self-organized spheroids using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Under the osteogenesis induction medium, the spheroid culture model exerted the osteocyte-likeness within 2 days compared to a conventional 2D monolayer model. By using an inhibitor of actin polymerization, we showed an involvement of actin balancing in the osteocyte differentiation in the spheroid. Notably, we represented that the cell condensed condition acquired in the 3D spheroid culture model determined a differentiation fate of MSCs to osteocytes via actin balancing. Taken together, we suggest that our self-organized spheroid model can be utilized as a new in vitro model to represent the osteocyte differentiation process and further to recapitulate an in vitro ossification process.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical and life science literature is an essential way to publish experimental results. With the rapid growth of the number of new publications, the amount of scientific knowledge represented in free text is increasing remarkably. There has been much interest in developing techniques that can extract this knowledge and make it accessible to aid scientists in discovering new relationships between biological entities and answering biological questions. Making use of the word2vec approach, we generated word vector representations based on a corpus consisting of over 16 million PubMed abstracts. We developed a text mining pipeline to produce word2vec embeddings with different properties and performed validation experiments to assess their utility for biomedical analysis. An important pre-processing step consisted in the substitution of synonymous terms by their preferred terms in biomedical databases. Furthermore, we extracted gene-gene networks from two embedding versions and used them as prior knowledge to train Graph-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on breast cancer gene expression data to predict the occurrence of metastatic events. Performances of resulting models were compared to Graph-CNNs trained with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks or with networks derived using other word embedding algorithms. We also assessed the effect of corpus size on the variability of word representations. Finally, we created a web service with a graphical and a RESTful interface to extract and explore relations between biomedical terms using annotated embeddings. Comparisons to biological databases showed that relations between entities such as known PPIs, signaling pathways and cellular functions, or narrower disease ontology groups correlated with higher cosine similarity. Graph-CNNs trained with word2vec-embedding-derived networks performed best for the metastatic event prediction task compared to other networks. Word representations as produced by text mining algorithms like word2vec, therefore capture biologically meaningful relations between entities.",

    "abstract": "Amphibians are an important vertebrate model system to understand anatomy, genetics and physiology. Importantly, the brain and spinal cord of adult urodels (salamanders) have an incredible regeneration capacity, contrary to anurans (frogs) and the rest of adult vertebrates. Among these amphibians, the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) has gained most attention because of the surge in the understanding of CNS regeneration and the recent sequencing of its whole genome. However, a complete comprehension of the brain anatomy is not available. In the present study we created a magnetic resonance imaging atlas of the in vivo neuroanatomy of the juvenile axolotl brain. This is the first MRI atlas for this species and includes 3 levels: 1) 80 regions of interest (ROIs); 2) a division of the brain according to the embryological origin of the neural tube, and 3) left and right hemispheres. Additionally, we localized the myelin rich regions of the juvenile brain. The atlas, the template that the atlas was derived from, and a masking file, can be found on Zenodo at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4311937.

While previous studies convergently determined the contribution of prefrontal-striatal systems to general inhibitory control, findings on the specific circuits that mediate the context-specific impact of inhibitory control remained inconclusive. Against this background we employed an evaluated emotional Go/No Go task with fMRI in a large cohort of subjects (N = 250) to segregate brain systems and circuits that mediate domain-general from emotion-specific inhibition control. Particularly during a positive emotional context, behavioral results showed a lower accuracy for No Go trials and a faster response time for Go trials. While the dorsal striatum and lateral frontal regions were involved in inhibitory control irrespective of emotional context, activity in the ventral striatum (VS) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) varied as a function of emotional context. On the voxel-wise network level, limbic and striatal systems generally exhibited highest changes in global brain connectivity during inhibitory control, while global brain connectivity of the left mOFC was less suppressed during emotional contexts. Functional connectivity analyses moreover revealed that negative coupling between the VS with inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/insula and mOFC varied as a function of emotional context. Together these findings indicated separable domain general systems as well emotional context-specific inhibitory brain systems which specifically encompass the VS and its connections with frontal regions.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase (Pol) III synthesizes abundant short non-coding RNAs that have essential functions in protein synthesis, secretion and other processes. Despite the ubiquitous functions of these RNAs, mutations in Pol III subunits cause Pol III-related leukodystrophy, an early-onset neurodegenerative disease. The basis of this neural sensitivity and the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are unknown. Here we show that mice expressing pathogenic mutations in the largest Pol III subunit, Polr3a, specifically in Olig2-expressing cells, have impaired growth and developmental delay, deficits in cognitive, sensory and fine sensorimotor function, and hypomyelination in multiple regions of the cerebrum and spinal cord. In contrast, the gross motor defects and cerebellar hypomyelination that are common features of severely affected patients are absent in the mice, suggesting a relatively mild form of the disease in this conditional model. Our results show that disease pathogenesis in the mice involves defects that reduce both the number of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and the ability of these cells to produce a myelin sheath of normal thickness. Thus, the findings suggest cell-specific roles for Pol III in the development and/or survival of oligodendrocytes as well as their function in myelination.\n\nSignificance StatementPathogenic mutations in subunits of RNA polymerase (Pol) III cause a prevalent autosomal recessive form of leukodystrophy. However, understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis, including how ubiquitously-expressed Pol III mutations affect primarily the central nervous system, has been limited by the absence of an animal model of the disease. We show that conditional knock-in of pathogenic Polr3a mutations in the Olig2 lineage in mice results in growth, neurobehavioral and hypomyelination phenotypes reflecting a subset of clinical features of Pol III-related leukodystrophy patients. Myelination defects in the mice identify neural-specific roles for Pol III transcription. The phenotypes of Pol III-related leukodystrophic mice enable genetic and pharmacological approaches aimed at mitigating the consequences of this disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) have highlighted slowly progressive neurodegeneration whose mechanisms remain elusive, but if blocked, could considerably improve long-term neurological function. We previously established that the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF){beta}1 is highly elevated following HI and that delivering an antagonist for TGF{beta} receptor activin-like kinase 5 (ALK5) - SB505124 - 3 days after injury in a rat model of moderate pre-term HI significantly preserved the structural integrity of the thalamus and hippocampus as well as neurological functions associated with those brain structures. To elucidate the mechanism whereby ALK5 inhibition reduces cell death, we assessed levels of autophagy markers in neurons and found that SB505124 increased numbers of autophagosomes and levels of lipidated LC3 (light chain 3), a key protein known to mediate autophagy. However, those studies did not determine whether 1) SB was acting directly on the CNS and 2) whether directly inducing autophagy could decrease cell death and improve outcome. Here we show that administering an ALK5 antagonist 3 days after HI reduced actively apoptotic cells by [~]90% when assessed one week after injury. Ex vivo studies using the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine confirmed that SB505124 enhanced autophagy flux in the injured hemisphere, with a significant accumulation of the autophagic proteins LC3 and p62 in SB505124 + chloroquine treated brain slices. We independently activated autophagy using the stimulatory peptide Tat-Beclin1 to determine if enhanced autophagy is directly responsible for improved outcomes. Administering Tat-Beclin1 starting 3 days after injury preserved the structural integrity of the hippocampus and thalamus with improved sensorimotor function. These data support the conclusion that intervening at this phase of injury represents a window of opportunity where stimulating autophagy is beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Within recent years, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been an attractive new field of research in RNA biology and disease. Consequently, numerous studies have been published towards the disclosure of circRNA biogenesis and function. Initially, circRNAs were described as a subclass of cytoplasmic non-coding RNA, however, a few recent observations have proposed that circRNAs may instead be templates for protein production. The extent to which this is the case is currently debated, and therefore using rigorous data analysis and proper experimental setups is instrumental to settle the current controversies. Here, the conventional experiments used for detecting circRNA translation are outlined, and guidelines to distinguish signal from the inherent noise are discussed. While these guidelines are specific for circRNA translation, most also apply to all other aspects of non-canonical translation.",

    "abstract": "Automated quantification of the behaviour of freely moving animals is increasingly needed in ethology, ecology, genetics and evolution. State-of-the-art approaches often require tags to identify animals, high computational power for data collection and processing, and are sensitive to environmental conditions, which limits their large-scale utilisation. Here we introduce a new automated tracking system based on millimetre-wave radars for real time robust and high precision monitoring of untagged animals. To validate our system, we tracked 64 sheep in a standard indoor behavioural test used for genetic selection. First, we show that the proposed radar application is faster and more accurate than conventional video and infrared tracking systems. Next, we illustrate how new behavioural estimators can be derived from the radar data to assess personality traits in sheep for behavioural phenotyping. Finally, we demonstrate that radars can be used for movement tracking at larger spatial scales, in the field, by adjusting operating frequency and radiated electromagnetic power. Millimetre-wave radars thus hold considerable promises for high-throughput recording of the behaviour of animals with various sizes and locomotor modes, in different types of environments.",

    "abstract": "Prevotella copri DSM18205 is a bacterium, classified under Bacteroidetes that can be found in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The role of P. copri in the GIT is unclear, and elevated numbers of the microbe have been reported both in dietary fiber-induced improvement in glucose metabolism but also in conjunction with certain inflammatory conditions. These findings raised our interest in investigating the possibility of P. copri to grow on xylan, and identify the enzyme systems playing a role in digestion of xylan-based dietary fibers in P. copri, which currently are unexplored. Two xylan degrading polysaccharide utilizing loci (PUL10 and 15) were found in the genome, with three and eight GH-encoding genes, respectively. Three of the eight gene products were successfully produced in Escherichia coli: One monomeric two-domain extracellular enzyme from GH43 (subfamily 12, in PUL10, 60 kDa) and two dimeric single module enzymes from PUL15, one extracellular GH10 (41 kDa), and one intracellular GH43 subfamily 1 enzyme (37 kDa). The GH43_12 enzyme was hydrolysing arabinofuranose residues from different substrates, and a model of the 3D-structure revealed a single arabinose binding pocket. The GH10 (1) and GH43_1 are cleaving the xylan backbone. Hydrolysis products of GH10 (1) were DP2-4, and seven subsites (-3 to +4) were predicted in the 3D-model of the GH10 active site. GH43_1 mainly produced xylose (in line with its intracellular location). Based on our results we propose that in PUL15, GH10 (1) is an extracellular endo-1,4-{beta}-xylanase, that hydrolyses mainly glucuronosylated xylan polymers to xylooligosaccharides (XOS); while, GH43_1 in the same PUL, is an intracellular {beta}-xylosidase, catalysing complete hydrolysis of the XOS to xylose. In PUL10, the characterized GH43_12 is an arabinofuranosidase, with a role in degradation of arabinoxylan, catalysing removal of arabinose-residues on xylan polymers.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionarily young genes are usually preferentially expressed in the testis across species. While it is known that older genes are generally more broadly expressed than younger genes, the properties that shaped this pattern are unknown. Older genes may gain expression across other tissues uniformly, or faster in certain tissues than others. Using Drosophila gene expression data, we confirmed previous findings that younger genes are disproportionately testis-biased and older genes are disproportionately ovary-biased. We found that the relationship between gene age and expression is stronger in the ovary than any other tissue, and weakest in testis. We performed ATAC-seq on Drosophila testis and found that while genes of all ages are more likely to have open promoter chromatin in testis than in ovary, promoter chromatin alone does not explain the ovary-bias of older genes. Instead, we found that upstream transcription factor (TF) expression is highly predictive of gene expression in ovary, but not in testis. In ovary, TF expression is more predictive of gene expression than open promoter chromatin, whereas testis gene expression is similarly influenced by both TF expression and open promoter chromatin. We propose that the testis is uniquely able to expresses younger genes controlled by relatively few TFs, while older genes with more TF partners are broadly expressed with peak expression most likely in ovary. The testis allows widespread baseline expression that is relatively unresponsive to regulatory changes, whereas the ovary transcriptome is more responsive to trans-regulation and has a higher ceiling for gene expression.",

    "abstract": "(1) BackgroundContryphan-Bt is a D-tryptophan-containing disulfide-constrained decapeptide recently isolated from the venom of Conus betulinus. The molecular targets of contryphans are controversial, and the identification of its interacting proteins may be of great importance.\n\n(2) MethodsHis-tag pull down assays were performed to investigate binding proteins of contryphan-Bt from rat brain lysate. Bt-Acp-[His]6, a contryphan-Bt derivative containing hexahistidine tag, was synthesized and used as the bait. As a control, Acp-[His]6 was used to exclude nonspecific bindings.\n\n(3) ResultsGlutamine synthetase was identified as a potential contryphan-Bt binding protein by pull down assays and subsequent LC-MS/MS. The binding of contryphan-B to glutamine synthetase was confirmed and determined using microscale thermophoresis, with a Kd of 74.02 {+/-} 2.8 M. The binding did not affect glutamine synthetase activity, suggesting that the interaction site was distinct from the catalytic center.\n\n(4) ConclusionsGlutamine synthetase was identified as a novel contryphan-Bt binding protein. This is the first report that the conopeptide binds to an intracellular protein, therefore offering a new concept and methodology for developing peptide toxins.\n\nKey ContributionThis is the first report that the conopeptide binds to an intracellular protein, therefore offering a new concept and methodology for developing peptide toxins.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is an inhabitant of natural and man-made water systems where it replicates within amoebae and ciliates and survives within biofilms. When Lp-contaminated aerosols are breathed in, Lp will enter the lungs and infect human alveolar macrophages, causing a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires Disease. Lp is often found in hot water distribution systems (HWDS), which are linked to nosocomial outbreaks. Heat treatment is used to disinfect HWDS and reduce the concentration of Lp. However, Lp is often able to recolonize these water systems, indicating an efficient heat-shock response. Tail-specific proteases (Tsp) are typically periplasmic proteases implicated in degrading aberrant proteins in the periplasm and important for surviving thermal stress. In this paper, we show that Tsp, encoded by the lpg0499 gene in Lp Philadelphia-1, is important for surviving thermal stress in water and for optimal infection of amoeba when a shift in temperature occurs during intracellular growth. Tsp is expressed in the post-exponential phase but repressed in the exponential phase. The cis-encoded small regulatory RNA Lpr17 shows opposite expression, suggesting that it represses translation of tsp. In addition, tsp is regulated by CpxR, a major regulator in Lp, in a Lpr17-independent manner. Deletion of CpxR also reduced the ability of Lp to survive heat shock. In conclusion, this study shows that Tsp is an important factor for the survival and growth of Lp in water systems.\n\nIMPORTANCELegionella pneumophila (Lp) is a major cause of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia. Lp is found in water systems including hot water distribution systems. Heat treatment is a method of disinfection often used to limit Lps presence in such systems; however, the benefit is usually short term as Lp is able to quickly recolonize these systems. Presumably, Lp respond efficiently to thermal stress, but so far not much is known about the genes involved. In this paper, we show that the Tail-specific protease (Tsp) and the two-component system CpxRA are required for resistance to thermal stress, when Lp is free in water and when it is inside host cells. Our study identifies critical systems for the survival of Lp in its natural environment under thermal stress.",
