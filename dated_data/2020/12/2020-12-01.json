    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies have enabled polygenic risk scores (PRS), which estimate the genetic value of an individual for a given trait. Since PRS accuracy is typically assessed using cohort-level metrics (e.g., R2), uncertainty in PRS estimates at individual level remains underexplored. Here we show that Bayesian PRS methods can estimate the variance of an individuals PRS and can yield well-calibrated credible intervals for the genetic value of a single individual. For real traits in the UK Biobank (N=291,273 unrelated \"white British\") we observe large variance in individual PRS estimates which impacts interpretation of PRS-based stratification; for example, averaging across 13 traits, only 0.8% (s.d. 1.6%) of individuals with PRS point estimates in the top decile have their entire 95% credible intervals fully contained in the top decile. We provide an analytical estimator for individual PRS variance--a function of SNP-heritability, number of causal SNPs, and sample size--and observe high concordance with individual variances estimated via posterior sampling. Finally as an example of the utility of individual PRS uncertainties, we explore a probabilistic approach to PRS-based stratification that estimates the probability of an individuals genetic value to be above a prespecified threshold. Our results showcase the importance of incorporating uncertainty in individual PRS estimates into subsequent analyses.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations accumulated in normal tissues are associated with aging and disease. Here, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of 1,737 morphologically normal tissue biopsies (~ 600 cells each), mostly from the epithelia, of nine organs from five donors. We found that somatic mutation accumulations and clonal expansions are widespread, although with variable extent, in morphologically normal human tissues. Somatic copy number alterations were rarely detected, except for tissues from esophagus and cardia. Endogenous mutational processes like SBS1 and SBS5 are ubiquitous among normal tissues though exhibiting different relative activities. Exogenous mutational processes like SBS22 were found in different tissues from the same donor. We reconstructed the spatial somatic clonal architecture with sub-millimeter resolution. In epithelial tissues from esophagus and cardia, macroscopic somatic clones expanded to several millimeters were frequently seen, whereas in tissues from colon, rectum, and duodenum somatic clones were microscopic in size and evolved independently. Our study depicted a body map of somatic mutations and clonal expansions from the same individuals, and it revealed that the degree of somatic clonal expansion and enrichment of driver mutations are highly organ specific.",

    "abstract": "Early life environment influences the development of various aspects of social behavior, particularly during sensitive developmental periods. Here, we aimed to study how challenges in the early postnatal period or (early) adolescence affect pro-social behavior. To this end, we adapted an existing paw operated liberation task to an automated operant task, to measure motivation (by progressively increasing required lever pressing) to liberate a trapped conspecific. Liberation of the trapped rat resulted either in social contact, or in liberation into a separate compartment. Additionally, a condition was tested in which both rats could freely move in two separate compartments and lever pressing resulted in social contact. When partners were not trapped, rats were more motivated to press the lever for opening the door than in either of the trapped configurations. Contrary to our expectation, the trapped configuration resulted in a reduced motivation to act. Early postnatal stress (24h maternal deprivation on postnatal day 3) did not affect behavior in the liberation task. However, rearing rats from early adolescence onwards in complex housing conditions (Marlau cages) reduced the motivation to door opening, both in the trapped and freely moving conditions, while motivation for a sucrose reward was not affected.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe adaptive B-cell response is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B-cell clones. Their number, size and sequence diversity are essential characteristics of B-cell populations. Identifying clones in B-cell populations is central to several repertoire studies such as statistical analysis, repertoire comparisons, and clonal tracking. Several clonal grouping methods have been developed to group sequences from B-cell immune repertoires. Such methods have been principally evaluated on simulated benchmarks since experimental data containing clonally related sequences can be difficult to obtain. However, experimental data might contains multiple sources of sequence variability hampering their artificial reproduction. Therefore, the generation of high precision ground truth data that preserves real repertoire distributions is necessary to accurately evaluate clonal grouping methods.\n\nResultsWe proposed a novel methodology to generate ground truth data sets from real repertoires. Our procedure requires V(D)J annotations to obtain the initial clones, and iteratively apply an optimisation step that moves sequences among clones to increase their cohesion and separation. We first showed that our method was able to identify clonally-related sequences in simulated repertoires with higher mutation rates, accurately. Next, we demonstrated how real benchmarks (generated by our method) constitute a challenge for clonal grouping methods, when comparing the performance of a widely used clonal grouping algorithm on several generated benchmarks. Our method can be used to generate a high number of benchmarks and contribute to construct more accurate clonal grouping tools.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe source code and generated data sets are freely available at github.com/NikaAb/BCR_GTG",

    "abstract": "MotivationSpecies tree estimation from genes sampled from throughout the whole genome is complicated due to the gene tree-species tree discordance. Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is one of the most frequent causes for this discordance, where alleles can coexist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events. Quartet-based summary methods for estimating species trees from a collection of gene trees are becoming popular due to their high accuracy and statistical guarantee under ILS. Generating quartets with appropriate weights, where weights correspond to the relative importance of quartets, and subsequently amalgamating the weighted quartets to infer a single coherent species tree allows for a statistically consistent way of estimating species trees. However, handling weighted quartets is challenging.\n\nResultsWe propose wQFM, a highly accurate method for species tree estimation from multi-locus data, by extending the quartet FM (QFM) algorithm to a weighted setting. wQFM was assessed on a collection of simulated and real biological datasets, including the avian phylogenomic dataset which is one of the largest phylogenomic datasets to date. We compared wQFM with wQMC, which is the best alternate method for weighted quartet amalgamation, and with ASTRAL, which is one of the most accurate and widely used coalescent-based species tree estimation methods. Our results suggest that wQFM matches or improves upon the accuracy of wQMC and ASTRAL.\n\nAvailabilitywQFM is available in open source form at https://github.com/Mahim1997/wQFM-2020.",

Deep learning (DL) models have been utilized to denovoly identify motifs, and have been proven to outperform traditional methods. By 2020, twenty DL models have been developed to identify DNA and RNA motifs with diverse framework designs and implementation styles. Hence, it is beneficial to systematically compare their performances, which can facilitate researchers in selecting the appropriate tools for their motif analyses. Here, we carried out an in-depth assessment of the 20 models utilizing 1,043 genomic sequencing datasets, including 690 ENCODE ChIP-Seq, 126 cancer ChIP-Seq, 172 single-cell cleavages under targets and release using a nuclease, and 55 RNA CLIP-Seq. Four metrics were designed and investigated, including the accuracy of motif finding, the performance of DNA/RNA sequence classification, algorithm scalability, and tool usability. The assessment results demonstrated the high complementarity of the existing models, and it was determined that the most suitable model should primarily depend on the data size and type as well as the model outputs. A webserver was developed to allow efficient access of the identified motifs and effective utilization of high-performing DL models.",

We show that carvones are non-competitive allosteric antagonists of the AhR that inhibit the induction of AhR target genes in a ligand-selective and cell type-specific manner. Carvones do not displace radiolabeled ligand from binding at the AhR, but they bind allosterically within the bHLH/PAS-A region of the AhR. Carvones did not influence a translocation of ligand-activated AhR into the nucleus. Carvones inhibited the heterodimerization of the AhR with its canonical partner ARNT and subsequent binding of the AhR to the promotor of CYP1A1. Interaction of carvones with potential off-targets, including ARNT and protein kinases, was refuted. This is the first report of a small dietary monoterpenoids as a new class of AhR non-competitive allosteric antagonists with the potential preventive and therapeutic application.",

    "abstract": "An important question is what genes govern the differentiation of plant embryos into suspensor and embryo-proper regions following fertilization and division of the zygote. We compared embryo proper and suspensor transcriptomes of four plants that vary in embryo morphology within the suspensor region. We determined that genes encoding enzymes in several metabolic pathways leading to the formation of hormones, such as gibberellic acid, and other metabolites are up-regulated in giant Scarlet Runner Bean and Common Bean suspensors. Genes involved in transport and Golgi body organization are up-regulated within the suspensors of these plants as well - strengthening the view that giant specialized suspensors serve as a hormone factory and a conduit for transferring substances to the developing embryo proper. By contrast, genes controlling transcriptional regulation, development, and cell division are up-regulated primarily within the embryo proper. Transcriptomes from less specialized soybean and Arabidopsis suspensors demonstrated that fewer genes encoding metabolic enzymes and hormones are up-regulated. Genes active in the embryo proper, however, are functionally similar to those active in Scarlet Runner Bean and Common Bean embryo proper regions. We uncovered a set of suspensor- and embryo-proper-specific transcription factors (TFs) that are shared by all embryos irrespective of morphology, suggesting that they are involved in early differentiation processes common to all plants. ChIP-Seq experiments with Scarlet Runner Bean and soybean WOX9, an up-regulated suspensor TF, gained entry into a regulatory network important for suspensor development irrespective of morphology.\n\nSignificanceHow plant embryos are differentiated into embryo proper and suspensor regions following fertilization is a major unanswered question. The suspensor is unique because it can vary in morphology in different plant species. We hypothesized that regulatory genes controlling the specification of embryo proper and suspensor regions should be shared by all plants irrespective of embryo morphology. We compared embryo proper and suspensor transcriptomes of plants with distinct suspensor morphologies. Scarlet Runner Bean and Common Bean have highly specialized giant suspensor regions, whereas soybean and Arabidopsis suspensors are smaller and less specialized. We uncovered a small set of embryo-proper- and suspensor-specific transcription factors shared by all embryos irrespective of morphology, suggesting that they play an important role in early embryo differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Microbial plant pathogens secrete effector proteins which manipulate the host to promote infection. Effectors can be recognised by plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors, initiating an immune response. The AVR-Pik effector from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is recognised by a pair of rice NLR receptors, Pik-1 and Pik-2. Pik-1 contains a non-canonical integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain, which directly binds AVR-Pik to activate plant defences. Non-canonical integrated domains are widespread in plant NLRs and are thought to resemble the host target of the recognised effector. AVR-Pik interacts with specific rice HMA domain-containing proteins, namely heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs) and heavy metal-associated plant proteins (HPPs). Here, we define the biochemical and structural basis of the interaction between AVR-Pik and OsHIPP19, and compare the interaction with the HMA domain of Pik-1. Using analytical gel filtration and surface plasmon resonance, we show that multiple AVR-Pik variants, including the stealthy variants AVR-PikC and AVR-PikF which do not interact with any characterised Pik-1 alleles, bind to OsHIPP19 with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of OsHIPP19 in complex with AVR-PikF reveals differences at the interface that underpin high-affinity binding of OsHIPP19-HMA to a wider set of AVR-Pik variants than achieved by the integrated HMA domain of Pik-1. Our results provide a foundation for engineering the HMA domain of Pik-1 to extend binding to currently unrecognised AVR-Pik variants and expand disease resistance in rice to divergent pathogen strains.",

    "abstract": "Cells polarize their movement or growth toward external directional cues in many different contexts. For example, budding yeast cells grow toward potential mating partners in response to pheromone gradients. Directed growth is controlled by polarity factors that assemble into clusters at the cell membrane. The clusters assemble, disassemble, and move between different regions of the membrane before eventually forming a stable polarity site directed toward the pheromone source. Pathways that regulate clustering have been identified but the molecular mechanisms that regulate cluster mobility are not well understood. To gain insight into the contribution of chemical noise to cluster behavior we simulated clustering within the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) framework to account for molecular-level fluctuations. RDME simulations are a computationally efficient approximation, but their results can diverge from the underlying microscopic dynamics. We implemented novel concentration-dependent rate constants that improved the accuracy of RDME-based simulations of cluster behavior, allowing us to efficiently investigate how cluster dynamics might be regulated. Molecular noise was effective in relocating clusters when the clusters contained low numbers of limiting polarity factors, and when Cdc42, the central polarity regulator, exhibited short dwell times at the polarity site. Cluster stabilization occurred when abundances or binding rates were altered to either lengthen dwell times or increase the number of polarity molecules in the cluster. We validated key results using full 3D particle-based simulations. Understanding the mechanisms cells use to regulate the dynamics of polarity clusters should provide insights into how cells dynamically track external directional cues.\n\nAuthor summaryCells localize polarity molecules in a small region of the plasma membrane forming a polarity cluster that directs functions such as migration, reproduction, and growth. Guided by external signals, these clusters move across the membrane allowing cells to reorient growth or motion. The polarity molecules continuously and randomly shuttle between the cluster and the cell cytosol and, as a result, the number and distribution of molecules at the cluster constantly changes. Here we present an improved stochastic simulation algorithm to investigate how such molecular-scale fluctuations induce cluster movement across the cell membrane. Unexpectedly, cluster mobility does not correlate with variations in total molecule abundance within the cluster, but rather with changes in the spatial distribution of molecules that form the cluster. Cluster motion is faster when polarity molecules are scarce and when they shuttle rapidly between the cluster and the cytosol. Our results suggest that cells control cluster mobility by regulating the abundance of polarity molecules and biochemical reactions that affect the time molecules spend at the cluster. We provide insights into how cells harness random molecular behavior to perform functions important for survival, such as detecting the direction of external signals.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks offer a promising approach for capturing complex, non-linear relationships among variables. Because they require immense sample sizes, their potential has yet to be fully tapped for understanding complex relationships between gene expression and human phenotypes. Encouragingly, a growing number of diseases are being studied through consortium efforts. Here we introduce a new analysis framework, namely MD-AD (Multi-task Deep learning for Alzheimers Disease neuropathology), which leverages an unexpected synergy between deep neural networks and multi-cohort settings. In these settings, true joint analysis can be stymied using conventional statistical methods, which (1) require \"harmonized\" phenotypes (i.e., measured in a highly consistent manner) and (2) tend to capture cohort-level variations, obscuring the subtler true disease signals. Instead, MD-AD incorporates multiple related phenotypes sparsely measured across cohorts, and learns complex, non-linear interactions between genes and phenotypes not discovered using conventional expression data analysis methods (e.g., component analysis and module detection), enabling the model to capture subtler signals than cohort-level variations. Applied to the largest available collection of brain samples (N=1,758), we demonstrate that MD-AD learns a truly generalizable relationship between gene expression program and AD-related neuropathology. The learned program generalizes in several important ways, including recapitulation of the disease progress in animal models and across tissue types, and we show that such generalizability is not achieved by previous statistical paradigms. Its ability to identify genes with high non-linear relevance to neuropathology enabled us to identify a sex-specific relationship between neuropathology and immune response across microglia, providing a nuanced context for association between inflammatory genes and AD.",

To make eye tracking freely and widely available for MRI research, we developed DeepMReye: a convolutional neural network that decodes gaze position from the MR-signal of the eyeballs. It performs camera-less eye tracking at sub-imaging temporal resolution in held-out participants with little training data and across a broad range of scanning protocols. Critically, it works even in existing datasets and when the eyes are closed. Decoded eye movements explain network-wide brain activity also in regions not associated with oculomotor function.

It facilities biological insight by enabling effective cross-species comparisons, by intimately linking data on structure and function, and by serving as hub for information on insect neuroethology. The IBdb provides novel visualization and search tools, which are also available in a unique private mode of the database, before data is made public.

However, the concept of sugar addiction is controversial and only a few studies have attempted to determine the \"addictive\" properties of sugar using rigorous scientific criteria.\n\nObjectiveHere we set out to systematically test the addictive properties of sugar in male and female mice using established paradigms and models from the drug addiction field.\n\nMethodsMale and female C57BL/6N (8-10 weeks old) were evaluated in 4 experimental procedures to study the addictive properties of sugar: (i) a drinking in the dark (DID) procedure to model sugar binging; (ii) a long-term free choice home cage drinking procedure measuring the sugar deprivation effect (SDE) following an abstinence phase; (iii) a long-term operant sugar self-administration with persistence, motivation and compulsivity measures and (iv) intracranial self-administration (ICSS).\n\nResultsFemale mice were more vulnerable to the addictive properties of sugar than male mice, showing higher binge and long-term, excessive drinking, a more pronounced relapse-like drinking following deprivation, and higher persistence and motivation for sugar. No sex differences were seen in a compulsivity test or reward sensitivity measured using ICSS following extended sugar consumption.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates the occurrence of an addictive-like phenotype for sugar in male and female mice, similar to drugs of abuse, and suggests sex-dependent differences in the development of sugar addiction.",

    "abstract": "In each sensory system of the brain, mechanisms exist to extract distinct features from stimuli to generate a variety of behavioural repertoires. These often correspond to different cell types at some stage in sensory processing. In the mammalian olfactory system, complex information processing starts in the olfactory bulb, whose output is conveyed by mitral and tufted cells (MCs and TCs). Despite many differences between them, and despite the crucial position they occupy in the information hierarchy, little is known how these two types of projection neurons differ at the mRNA level. Here, we sought to identify genes that are differentially expressed between MCs and TCs, with an ultimate goal to generate a cell-type specific Cre-driver line, starting from a transcriptome analysis using a large and publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset (Zeisel et al., 2018). Despite many genes showing differential expressions, we identified only a few that were abundantly and consistently expressed only in MCs. After further validating these putative markers using in-situ hybridization, two genes, namely Pkib and Lbdh2, remained as promising candidates. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated Cre-driver lines and analysed the resulting recombination patterns. This analysis indicated that our new inducible Cre-driver line, Lbhd2-CreERT2, can be used to genetically label MCs in a tamoxifen dose-dependent manner, as assessed by soma locations, projection patterns and sensory-evoked responses. Hence this line is a promising tool for future investigations of cell-type specific contributions to olfactory processing and demonstrates the power of publicly accessible data in accelerating science.",

Here, we showed that these structures in primary macrophages are induced by multiple microbialbased ligands, including exposure to cytosolic double-stranded DNA. Rather than accumulating aggregated proteins, we observed that ubiquitinated proteins form a ring-shaped structure around the perimeter of these circular foci. We identified that different microbial stimuli induced the formation of ubiquitin-positive foci with distinct characteristics and we observed selective recruitment of context-dependent immune regulators. Our findings are consistent with a model where these ubiquitin-containing structures act as adaptable organizing centers for innate immune signaling.\n\nSUMMARYCharbonneau et al. demonstrate that ubiquitin- and p62-containing cytosolic ring-shaped structures induced by bacterial infections, microbial ligands and cytosolic double-stranded DNA contain context-dependent immune regulators, revealing an important insight on the cellular architecture required to coordinate signal transduction in macrophage.",

    "abstract": "Two Gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria, designated 27733 and 27737, were isolated from a soft tissue infection from a human patient. They were preliminarily identified as Clostridium perfringens through a series of phenotypic tests, including Gram-staining, determination of lipase and hemolytic activities, MALDI-ToF profiling, and a commercial biochemical identification system. In line with these results, genomes obtained for both isolates were ~3.56 Mbp in size, showed a DNA G+C content of ~28.4%, and contained C. perfringens ribosomal markers (i.e. 16S rRNA gene identity >99.0% to C. perfringens ATCC13124T). A closer examination of these sequences; however, revealed low average Nucleotide Identity (~87%) and digital DNA-DNA Hybridization (~35%) values between isolates 27733/27737 and C. perfringens ATCC13124T, as well as substantial differences in gene content to multiple C. perfringens strains, indicating that they represent a novel species within the genus Clostridium. Congruently, Bayesian dating analyses placed the divergence of this new species and C. perfringens from its common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. Isolates 27733/27737 are not genomically identical (34-197 SNPs apart) and carry genes for C. perfringens-like toxins (<94% nucleotide sequence identity), including plc (alpha toxin), pfoA (perfringolysin O, theta-toxin), nagHIJKL (hyalorudinase, mu-toxin), nanHIJ (exo-alpha sialidase), and cloSI (alpha-clostripain). They do not have known antibiotic resistance genes but were catalogued as resistant to clindamycin through phenotypic tests. On the basis of the presented evidence, and due to its resemblance and potential confusion with C. perfringens, we herein propose the species C. perfringenosum sp. nov. and strain 27733 as its type strain.",

MAE reimplements the natural phenomenon of random crossovers, enabling classical linkage analysis. We demonstrate the utility of MAE with virulence-related gain-of-function screens, discovering that transfer of a single operon from a uropathogenic strain is sufficient for enabling a commensal E. coli to form large intracellular bacterial collections within bladder epithelial cells. MAE thus enables assaying natural allelic variation in E. coli (and potentially other bacteria), complementing existing loss-of-function genomic techniques.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe create F1 hybrids of E. coli using MAE, bringing the power of linkage analysis to bear on phenotypic diversity (including virulence)",

Potential causes are homeostatic proliferation, effects of HIV-1 integration, and interaction with antigens. Here we show that it is possible to link antigen responsiveness, full proviral sequence, integration site, and T cell receptor {beta}-chain (TCR{beta}) sequence to examine the role of recurrent antigenic exposure in maintaining the HIV-1 reservoir. We isolated Cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and Gag-responding CD4+ T cells from 10 treated individuals. Proviral populations in CMV-responding cells were dominated by large clones, including clones harboring replication-competent proviruses. TCR{beta} repertoires showed high clonality driven by converging adaptive responses. Although some proviruses were in genes linked to HIV-1 persistence (BACH2, STAT5B, MKL1), proliferation of infected cells under antigenic stimulation occurred regardless of the site of integration. Paired TCR{beta}-integration site analysis showed that infection could occur early or late in the course of a clones response to antigen and could generate infected cell populations too large to be explained solely by homeostatic proliferation. Together these findings implicate antigen-driven clonal selection as a major factor in HIV-1 persistence, a finding that will be a difficult challenge to eradication efforts.",

A methodology based on big data analysis, using Automatic Information System (AIS) messages, can provide valuable vessel activity information, which is necessary to estimate whale watching effort on cetacean populations. We used AIS data to automatically detect whale watching operations and quantify whale watching effort with high spatial and temporal resolution in the Canary Islands.

The methodology has also proved to be effective in providing detailed spatial information about the whale watching effort, which makes an interesting tool to manage spatial regulations and enforce exclusion zones. The widespread use of AIS devices in maritime navigation provides an enormous potential to easily extend this methodology to other regions worldwide.

We found that 53% of annual variation in winter spillovers is explained by winter temperature, which may affect bat behavior, physiology, and human risk behaviors. We infer from changes in forest cover that a progressive shift in bat roosting behavior occurred over hundreds of years, producing the current system where a majority of P. medius populations are small (median of 150 bats), occupy roost sites for 10 years or more, live in areas of high human population density, and opportunistically feed on cultivated food resources - conditions that promote viral spillover. Without interventions, continuing anthropogenic pressure on bat populations similar to what has occurred in Bangladesh could result in more regular spillovers of other bat viruses, including Hendra and Ebola viruses.",

Our genome assembly shows high completeness, with a complete BUSCO score of 93.9% using the avian dataset. Around 7.8 % of the genome contains interspersed repetitive elements. The structural annotation yielded 17,703 genes, 86.5% of which have a functional annotation, including 7,827 complete universal single-copy orthologs out of 8,338 genes represented in the BUSCO avian data set. This new annotated genome assembly will be a valuable resource as a reference for comparative and population genomic analyses of passerine, avian and vertebrate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Pleistocene glacial cycles influenced the diversification of high-latitude wildlife species through recurrent periods of range contraction, isolation, divergence, and expansion from refugia and subsequent admixture of refugial populations. For many taxa, research has focused on genetic patterns since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), however glacial cycles before the LGM likely impacted genomic variation which may influence contemporary genetic patterns. We investigate diversification and the introgressive history of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in western Canada using 33 high-coverage whole genomes coupled with larger-scale mitochondrial data. Contrary to the well-established paradigm that caribou ecotypes and contemporary genetic diversity arose from two major lineages in separate refugia during the LGM, a Beringian-Eurasian (BEL) and a North American (NAL) lineage, we found that the major diversifications of caribou occurred much earlier at around 110 kya, the start of the last glacial period. Additionally, we found effective population sizes of some caribou reaching ~700,000 to 1,000,000 individuals, one of the highest recorded historical effective population sizes for any mammal species thus far. Mitochondrial analyses dated introgression events prior to the LGM dating to 20-30 kya and even more ancient at 60 kya, coinciding with colder periods with extensive ice coverage, further demonstrating the importance of glacial cycles and events prior to the LGM in shaping demographic history. Reconstructing the origins and differential introgressive history has implications for predictions on species responses under climate change. Our results highlight the need to investigate pre-LGM demographic patterns to fully reconstruct the origin of species diversity, especially for high-latitude species.",

Here we retrospect the DNA origins of the interacting proteins in the context of 3D genome and discovered that 1) if a gene pair is more proximate in 3D genome, their corresponding proteins are more likely to interact. 2) signal peptide involvement of PPI affects the corresponding gene-gene proximity in 3D genome space. 3) by incorporating 3D genome information, existing PPI prediction methods can be further improved in terms of accuracy.

The rapid changes undergone in the way this cloud computing service operates, along with the continuous release of novel bioinformatic applications to analyze next generation sequencing data, have made the software obsolete. NGScloud2 is an enhanced and expanded version of NGScloud that permits the access to ad hoc cloud computing infrastructure, scaled according to the complexity of each experiment. NGScloud2 presents major technical improvements, such as the possibility of running spot instances and the most updated AWS instances types, that can lead to significant cost savings. As compared to its initial implementation, this improved version updates and includes common applications for de novo RNAseq analysis, and incorporates tools to operate workflows of bioinformatic analysis of reference-based RNAseq, RADseq and functional annotation. NGScloud2 optimizes the access to Amazons large computing infrastructures to easily run popular bioinformatic software applications, otherwise inaccessible to non-specialized users lacking suitable hardware infrastructures. The correct performance of the pipelines for de novo RNAseq, reference-based RNAseq, RADseq and functional annotation was tested with real experimental data. NGScloud2 code, instructions for software installation and use are available at https://github.com/GGFHF/NGScloud2.

    "abstract": "High dimensional genomic data can be analyzed to understand the effects of multiple variables on a target variable such as a clinical outcome, risk factor or diagnosis. Of special interest are functional modules, cooperating sets of variables affecting the target. Graphical models of various types are often useful for characterizing such networks of variables. In other applications such as social networks, the concept of balance in undirected signed graphs characterizes the consistency of associations within the network. To extend this concept to applications where a set of predictor variables influences an outcome variable, we define balance for functional modules. This property specifies that the module variables have a joint effect on the target outcome with no internal conflict, an efficiency that evolution may use for selection in biological networks. We show that for this class of graphs, observed correlations directly reflect paths in the underlying graph. Consequences of the balance property are exploited to implement a new module discovery algorithm, bFMD, which selects a subset of variables from highdimensional data that compose a balanced functional module. Our bFMD algorithm performed favorably in simulations as compared to other module detection methods that do not consider balance properties. Additionally, bFMD detected interpretable results in a real application for RNA-seq data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma using the percentage of tumor invasion as the target outcome of interest. bFMD detects sparse sets of variables within highdimensional datasets such that interpretability may be favorable as compared to other similar methods by leveraging balance properties used in other graphical applications.",

    "abstract": "Stoichiometric genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) have been widely used to predict metabolic phenotypes. In addition to stoichiometric ratios, other constraints such as enzyme availability and thermodynamic feasibility can also limit the phenotype solution space. Extended GEM models considering either enzymatic or thermodynamic constraints have been shown to improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method that integrates both enzymatic and thermodynamic constraints in a single Pyomo modeling framework (ETGEMs). We applied this method to construct the EcoETM, the E. coli metabolic model iML1515 with enzymatic and thermodynamic constraints. Using this model, we calculated the optimal pathways for cellular growth and the production of 22 metabolites. When comparing the results with those of iML1515 and models with one of the two constraints, we observed that many thermodynamically unfavorable and/or high enzyme cost pathways were excluded from EcoETM. For example, the synthesis pathway of carbamoyl-phosphate (Cbp) from iML1515 is both thermodynamically unfavorable and enzymatically costly. After introducing the new constraints, the production pathways and yields of several Cbp-derived products (e.g. L-arginine, orotate) calculated using EcoETM were more realistic. The results of this study demonstrate the great application potential of metabolic models with multiple constraints for pathway analysis and phenotype predication.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensitive channels are integral membrane proteins that sense mechanical stimuli. Like all membrane proteins, they pass through biosynthetic quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi that results in them reaching their destination at the plasma membrane. Here we show that N-linked glycosylation of two highly conserved asparagine residues in the  cap region of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels are necessary for the mature protein to reach the plasma membrane. Both mutation of these asparagines (N2294Q/N2331Q) and treatment with an enzyme that hydrolyses N-linked oligosaccharides (PNGaseF) eliminates the fully glycosylated mature Piezo1 protein. The N-glycans in the cap are a pre-requisite for higher-order glycosylation in the  propeller regions, which are present in loops that are essential for mechanotransduction. Importantly, trafficking-defective Piezo1 variants linked to generalized lymphatic dysplasia and bicuspid aortic valve display reduced fully N-glycosylated protein. The higher order glycosylation status in vitro correlates with efficient membrane trafficking and will aid in determining the functional impact of Piezo1 variants of unknown significance.",

These two properties define mathematically the possibility of determining the values of the parameters (identifiability) and states (observability) of a dynamic model by observing its output. In this note we warn that SIM considers scaling symmetries as the only possible cause of non-identifiability and non-observability. We show that other types of symmetries can cause the same problems without being detected by SIM, and that in those cases the method may yield a wrong result. Finally, we demonstrate how to analyse structural local identifiability and observability with symbolic computation tools that do not exhibit those issues.",

However, few studies have analyzed the evolution of the mouse brain over time at baseline. Furthermore, mouse brain studies are commonly conducted on the C57BL/6 strain, limiting the analysis to a specific genetic background. In Parkinsons disease, the gradual demise of nigral dopaminergic neurons mainly contributes to the motor symptoms. Interestingly, a decline of the dopaminergic neuron function and integrity is also a characteristic of physiological aging in some species. Age-related nigro-striatal features have never been studied in mice of different genetic backgrounds. In this study, we analyze the morphological features in the striatum of three common mouse strains, C57BL/6J, A/J, and DBA/2J at 3-, 9- and 15 months of age. By measuring dopaminergic markers, we uncover age-related changes that differ between strains and evolve dynamically over time.

However, it is unclear how these blood-based patterns relate to patterns within the brain, and how each associates with central cellular profiles. In this study, we profiled DNA methylation in both the blood and in five post-mortem brain regions (BA17, BA20/21, BA24, BA46 and hippocampus) in 14 individuals from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Microglial burdens were additionally quantified in the same brain regions. DNA methylation signatures of five epigenetic ageing biomarkers ( epigenetic clocks), and two inflammatory biomarkers (DNA methylation proxies for C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were compared across tissues and regions. Divergent correlations between the inflammation and ageing signatures in the blood and brain were identified, depending on region assessed. Four out of the five assessed epigenetic age acceleration measures were found to be highest in the hippocampus ({beta} range=0.83-1.14, p[&le;]0.02). The inflammation-related DNA methylation signatures showed no clear variation across brain regions. Reactive microglial burdens were found to be highest in the hippocampus ({beta}=1.32, p=5x10-4); however, the only association identified between the blood- and brain-based methylation signatures and microglia was a significant positive association with acceleration of one epigenetic clock (termed DNAm PhenoAge) averaged over all five brain regions ({beta}=0.40, p=0.002). This work highlights a potential vulnerability of the hippocampus to epigenetic ageing and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between DNA methylation signatures in the brain and differences in microglial burdens.",

We show that a small molecule inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR) that acts downstream of eIF2 phosphorylation prevents immunopathology and rescues the mice from mortality.

Published studies on reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by antiseptics do not exclude antiseptic-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and of a non-pathogenic, recombinant, SARS-CoV-2 infection vector (pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus). We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). Potent anti-viral activities of povidone iodine and Colgate peroxyl mouth rinses was the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts anti-viral activity. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated-viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Prolonged incubation of virus with mouth rinses was not required for viral inactivation. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is detectable in saliva from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting the potential necessity for the use of mouth rinses to suppress viral load to reduce virus spread. Published studies on anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of antiseptics determined by virus-induced cytotoxic effects cannot exclude antiseptic-associated cytotoxicity. We found that all mouth rinses tested inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Listerine and CHG were less cytotoxic than Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine and were active against the virus. When mouth rinses were present in the cell culture during the infection, the potent anti-viral effect of mouth rinses were in part due to the mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that assessing anti-viral candidates including mouth rinses with minimal potential disruption of cells may help identify active agents that can reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread.",

    "abstract": "Plant extracts are rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, sesquiterpenes and triterpenes, with potential antiviral activities. As the dramatic outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thousands of scientists are working tirelessly trying to understand the biology of this new virus and the disease pathophysiology, with the main goal to discover effective preventive treatments and therapeutic agents. Plant-derived secondary metabolites may play key roles in preventing and counteracting the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections by inhibiting the activity of several viral proteins, in particular those involved in the virus entry into the host cells and its replication. In this study, by using different in vitro approaches, we uncovered the role of a pomegranate peel extract in attenuating the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and in inhibiting the activity of the virus 3CL protease. Although further studies will be determinant to assess the efficacy of this extract in vivo, our results open up new promising opportunities to employ natural extracts for the development of effective and innovative therapies in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting millions of lives worldwide. Large retrospective studies indicate that an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors are associated with both increased disease severity and mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic, transcriptional, in vitro and in vivo analyses, we report that Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses of Topotecan (TPT), a FDA-approved Top1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced inflammation in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as four days post-infection reduces morbidity and rescues mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support the potential of Top1 inhibition as an effective host-directed therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives are inexpensive clinical-grade inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of repurposing Top1 inhibitors for COVID-19 in humans.",

    "abstract": "Proper mitotic progression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires partial nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and insertion of the spindle pole body (SPB - yeast centrosome) to build the mitotic spindle. Linkage of the centromere to the SPB is vital to this process, but why that linkage is important is not well understood. Utilizing high- resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we show that the conserved SUN- domain protein Sad1 and other SPB proteins redistribute during mitosis to form a ring complex around SPBs, which is a precursor for localized NEBD and spindle formation. Although the Polo kinase Plo1 is not necessary for Sad1 redistribution, it localizes to the SPB region connected to the centromere, and its activity is vital for redistribution of other SPB ring proteins and for complete NEBD at the SPB to allow for SPB insertion. Our results lead to a model in which centromere linkage to the SPB drives redistribution of Sad1 and Plo1 activation that in turn facilitate partial NEBD and spindle formation through building of a SPB ring structure.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells give rise to the entirety of cells within an organ. Maintaining stem cell identity and coordinately regulating stem cell divisions is crucial for proper development. In plants, mobile proteins, such as WOX5 and SHR, regulate divisions in the root stem cell niche (SCN). However, how these proteins coordinately function to establish systemic behavior is not well understood. We propose a non-cell autonomous role for WOX5 in the CEI and identify a regulator, AN3/GIF1, that coordinates CEI divisions. Here we show with a multiscale hybrid model integrating ODEs and agent-based modeling that QC and CEI divisions have different dynamics. Specifically, by combining continuous models to describe regulatory networks and agent-based rules, we model systemic behavior, which led us to predict cell-type-specific expression dynamics of SHR, SCR, WOX5, AN3, and CYCD6;1, and experimentally validate CEI cell divisions. Conclusively, our results show an interdependency between CEI and QC divisions.\n\nThumbnail image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/404426v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@abcd10org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@123e110org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8d175dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8f498_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe \"Spanish\" slug, Arion vulgaris Moquin-Tandon, 1855, is considered to be among the 100 worst pest species in Europe. It is common and invasive to at least northern and eastern parts of Europe, probably benefitting from climate change and the modern human lifestyle. The origin and expansion of this species, the mechanisms behind its outstanding adaptive success and ability to outcompete other land slugs are worth to be explored on a genomic level. However, a high-quality chromosome-level genome is still lacking.\n\nFindingsThe final assembly of A. vulgaris was obtained by combining short reads, linked reads, Nanopore long reads, and Hi-C data. The genome assembly size is 1.54 Gb with a contig N50 length of 8.6 Mb. We found a recent expansion of transposable elements (TEs) which results in repetitive sequences accounting for more than 75% of the A. vulgaris genome, which is the highest among all known gastropod species. We identified 32,518 protein coding genes, and 2,763 species specific genes were functionally enriched in response to stimuli, nervous system and reproduction. With 1,237 single-copy orthologs from A. vulgaris and other related mollusks with whole-genome data available, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of gastropods and estimated the divergence time of stylommatophoran land snails (Achatina) and Arion slugs at around 126 million years ago, and confirmed the whole genome duplication event shared by them.\n\nConclusionsTo our knowledge, the A. vulgaris genome is the first land slug genome assembly published to date. The high-quality genomic data will provide valuable genetic resources for further phylogeographic studies of A. vulgaris origin and expansion, invasiveness, as well as molluscan aquatic-land transition and shell formation.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are widely used in biology and medicine, and there has been considerable interest in multivalent antibody formats to increase binding avidity and enhance signaling pathway agonism. However, there are currently no general approaches for forming precisely oriented antibody assemblies with controlled valency. We describe the computational design of two-component nanocages that overcome this limitation by uniting form and function. One structural component is any antibody or Fc fusion and the second is a designed Fc-binding homo-oligomer that drives nanocage assembly. Structures of 8 antibody nanocages determined by electron microscopy spanning dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral architectures with 2, 6, 12, and 30 antibodies per nanocage match the corresponding computational models. Antibody nanocages targeting cell-surface receptors enhance signaling compared to free antibodies or Fc-fusions in DR5-mediated apoptosis, Tie2-mediated angiogenesis, CD40 activation, and T cell proliferation; nanocage assembly also increases SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization by -SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and Fc-ACE2 fusion proteins. We anticipate that the ability to assemble arbitrary antibodies without need for covalent modification into highly ordered assemblies with different geometries and valencies will have broad impact in biology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviral proteins archived in the Protein Data Bank were used to analyze viral proteome evolution during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses of spatial locations, chemical properties, and structural and energetic impacts of the observed amino acid changes in >48,000 viral proteome sequences showed how each one of the 29 viral study proteins have undergone amino acid changes. Structural models computed for every unique sequence variant revealed that most substitutions map to protein surfaces and boundary layers with a minority affecting hydrophobic cores. Conservative changes were observed more frequently in cores versus boundary layers/surfaces. Active sites and protein-protein interfaces showed modest numbers of substitutions. Energetics calculations showed that the impact of substitutions on the thermodynamic stability of the proteome follows a universal bi-Gaussian distribution. Detailed results are presented for six drug discovery targets and four structural proteins comprising the virion, highlighting substitutions with the potential to impact protein structure, enzyme activity, and functional interfaces. Characterizing the evolution of the virus in three dimensions provides testable insights into viral protein function and should aid in structure-based drug discovery efforts as well as the prospective identification of amino acid substitutions with potential for drug resistance.",

As such, they interact with a variety of complex microenvironments, yet how NK cells engage with these varied microenvironments is not well documented. The integrin adhesome represents a molecular network of defined and predicted integrin-mediated signaling interactions. Here, we define the integrin adhesome expression profile of NK cells from tonsil, peripheral blood and those derived from hematopoietic precursors through stromal cell coculture systems. We report that the site of cell isolation and NK cell developmental stage dictate differences in expression of adhesome associated genes and proteins. Furthermore, we define differences in cortical actin content associated with differential expression of actin regulating proteins, suggesting that differences in adhesome expression are associated with differences in cortical actin homeostasis. Together, these data provide new understanding into the diversity of human NK cell populations and how they engage with their microenvironment.",

Here we inspected sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 positivity, hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), sera immune profiling, and two single-cell RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) profiles from nasal tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Our propensity score-matching observations revealed that male individuals have a 29% increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with a hazard ration (HR) 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.48) for hospitalization and HR 1.51 (95% CI 1.24-1.84) for admission to ICU. Sera from male patients at hospital admission had decreased lymphocyte count and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and neutrophils). We found that SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN and NRP1, have elevated expression in nasal squamous cells from males with moderate and severe COVID-19. Cell-cell network proximity analysis suggests possible epithelium-immune cell interactions and immune vulnerability underlying a higher mortality in males with COVID-19. Monocyte-elevated expression of Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is associated with severe outcomes in males with COVID-19. These findings provide basis for understanding immune responses underlying sex differences, and designing sex-specific targeted treatments and patient care for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "In many groups of animals the dominance hierarchy is linear. What mechanisms underlie this linearity of the dominance hierarchy is under debate. Linearity is often attributed to cognitively sophisticated processes, such as transitive inference and eavesdropping. An alternative explanation is that it develops via the winner-loser effect. This effect implies that after a fight has been decided the winner is more likely to win again, and the loser is more likely to lose again. Although it has been shown that dominance hierarchies may develop via the winner-loser effect, the degree of linearity of such hierarchies is unknown.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate whether a similar degree of linearity, like in real animals, may emerge as a consequence of the winner-loser effect and the socio-spatial structure of group members. For this purpose, we use the model DomWorld, in which agents group and compete and the outcome of conflicts are self-reinforcing. Here dominance hierarchies are shown to emerge. In the model, we apply analytical methods previously used in a study on dominance in real hens including an analysis of behaviourial dynamics and network triad motifs.\n\nWe show that when in the complete model one parameter, representing the intensity of aggression, was set high, the model reproduced the high linearity and many patterns of hierarchical development typical of groups of hens. Yet, when omitting from the model the winner-loser effect or spatial location of individuals, this resemblance decreased markedly.\n\nOur results demonstrate that the spatial structure and the winner-loser effect provide a plausible alternative for hierarchical linearity to processes that are cognitively more sophisticated. Further research should determine whether the winner-loser effect and spatial structure of group members also explains the characteristics of hierarchical development in other species.",

Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), a member of the lysyl oxidase family, is known for promoting cancer metastasis, invasion, and stromal fibrosis in various organs. Our previous study demonstrated expression of LOXL2 in kidney podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, and the association between elevated LOXL2 and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The present study evaluated the effect of LOXL2 inhibition using an inhibitory monoclonal antibody (AB0023) on tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a folic acid-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis mouse model. We also evaluated the association of LOXL2 with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation related molecules in vitro using HK-2 cells. Our data demonstrate that AB0023 prevented the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis significantly, as determined by trichrome and picro-sirius red staining, as well as the total collagen assay. The mean expression of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad4 was lower in the AB0023-treated group although it was not statistically significant. Following transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) challenge, LOXL2-deficient HK-2 cells exhibited significantly lower expression of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin than control HK-2 cells. In conclusion, LOXL2 inhibition ameliorates renal fibrosis through the TGF-{beta}/Smad signalling pathway.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGabapentin (GBP) is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of partial and secondary generalized seizures, apart from also being used for diabetic neuropathy. GBP displays highly intricate mechanism of action and its inhibitory response in elevated antagonism of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) receptor and has potential in controlling neuropathic pain of cancer origin.\n\nObjectiveTherefore, in the present study, we have selected BCATc (Pyridoxal 5-phosphate dependent branched-chain aminotransferase cytosolic) enzyme that is highly expressed in neuropathic stress conditions and have analysed the GBP as its competitive inhibitor by modeling, docking and checking its pharmacokinetic suitability through ADMET. Though in this study the results exhibited higher efficacy of GBP in controlling neuropathic pain, the drug shows certain potential therapeutic limitations like shorter half-life, repetitive dosing, high inter subjective variability.\n\nMethodsTherefore, a suitable and equally efficacious drug delivery method was also designed and developed by loading GBP transdermal patches (GBP-TDP) by solvent evaporation method using PVP and HPMC in ratio of 2:1 as a polymer base for reservoir type of TDP. Also, PEG 400 was used as a plasticizer and PVA (4%) was taken for backing membrane preparation and then the optimized GBP-TDP was subjected for physical characterization, optimization and ex vivo release kinetics.\n\nResults and conclusionThe results showed desired specifications with uneven and flaky surface appearance giving avenue for controlled release of the drugs with 75.58% of drug release in 12 hrs., further suggesting that GBP-TDP can be used as an effective tool against diabetic neuropathy pain.",

    "abstract": "There are different factors that are the cause of abrupt spread of arbovirus. We modelled the factors (internal & external) that can increase the diffusion of dengue virus and observed their effects. These factors have influenced on the Aedes aegypti (a dengue virus carrier); factors which increase the dengue transmission. Interestingly, there are some factors that can suppress the Aedes aegypti. The species of Aedes aegypti formalizes its own network by which dengue virus is spread. Internal & external exposures of the dengue epidemic complex network have been modelled and analyzed. Influence of internal and external diffusion with two scenarios has been discussed.  Genetically modified mosquito technique has been applied and its associated simulated results are discussed. From the outcomes, the best time duration to contain the spread of dengue virus has been proposed, and our simulation model showed the possibility of suppressing the Aedes aegypti network.",
