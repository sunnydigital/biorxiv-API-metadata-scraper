    "abstract": "A continuing challenge in quantitative cell biology is the accurate and robust 3D segmentation of structures of interest from fluorescence microscopy images in an automated, reproducible, and widely accessible manner for subsequent interpretable data analysis. We describe the Allen Cell and Structure Segmenter (Segmenter), a Python-based open source toolkit developed for 3D segmentation of cells and intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high-replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The Segmenter consists of two complementary elements, a classic image segmentation workflow with a restricted set of algorithms and parameters and an iterative deep learning segmentation workflow. We created a collection of 20 classic image segmentation workflows based on 20 distinct and representative intracellular structure localization patterns as a \"lookup table\" reference and starting point for users. The iterative deep learning workflow can take over when the classic segmentation workflow is insufficient. Two straightforward \"human-in-the-loop\" curation strategies convert a set of classic image segmentation workflow results into a set of 3D ground truth images for iterative model training without the need for manual painting in 3D. The deep learning model architectures used in this toolkit were designed and tested specifically for 3D fluorescence microscope images and implemented as readable scripts. The Segmenter thus leverages state of the art computer vision algorithms in an accessible way to facilitate their application by the experimental biology researcher.\n\nWe include two useful applications to demonstrate how we used the classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows to solve more challenging 3D segmentation tasks. First, we introduce the  Training Assay approach, a new experimental-computational co-design concept to generate more biologically accurate segmentation ground truths. We combined the iterative deep learning workflow with three Training Assays to develop a robust, scalable cell and nuclear instance segmentation algorithm, which could achieve accurate target segmentation for over 98% of individual cells and over 80% of entire fields of view. Second, we demonstrate how to extend the lamin B1 segmentation model built from the iterative deep learning workflow to obtain more biologically accurate lamin B1 segmentation by utilizing multi-channel inputs and combining multiple ML models. The steps and workflows used to develop these algorithms are generalizable to other similar segmentation challenges. More information, including tutorials and code repositories, are available at allencell.org/segmenter.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection relies on genotypic and phenotypic adaptation in response to fluctuating environmental conditions and is the key to predicting and preventing drug resistance. Whereas classic persistence is all-or-nothing, here we show for the first time that an antibiotic resistance gene displays linear dose-responsive selection for increased expression in proportion to rising antibiotic concentration in E. coli. Furthermore, we observe the general nature of an instantaneous phenotypic selection process upon bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotic treatment, as well as an amino acid synthesis pathway enzyme under a range of auxotrophic conditions. To explain this phenomenon, we propose an analogy to Ohms law in electricity (V=IR) where fitness pressure acts similarly to voltage (V), gene expression to current (I), and resistance (R) to cellular machinery constraints. Lastly, mathematical modelling approaches reveal that the emergent gene expression mechanism requires variation in mRNA and protein production within an isogenic population, and cell  memory from positive feedbacks between growth and expression of any fitness-inducing gene.",

    "abstract": "During convergent differentiation, multiple developmental lineages produce a highly similar or identical cell type. However, few molecular players that drive convergent differentiation are known. Here, we show that the C. elegans Forkhead transcription factor UNC-130 is required in only one of three convergent lineages that produce the same glial cell type. UNC-130 acts transiently as a repressor in progenitors and newly-born terminal cells to allow the proper specification of cells related by lineage rather than by cell type or function. Specification defects correlate with UNC-130:DNA binding, and UNC-130 can be functionally replaced by its human homolog, the neural crest lineage determinant FoxD3. We propose that, in contrast to terminal selectors that activate cell-type specific transcriptional programs in terminally differentiating cells, UNC-130 acts early and specifically in one convergent lineage to produce a cell type that also arises from molecularly distinct progenitors in other lineages.",

A professional writer custom-designed a narrative with two independent storylines, interleaving across minute-long segments (ABAB). In the last (C) part, characters from the two storylines meet and their shared history is revealed. Part C is designed to induce the spontaneous recall of past events, upon the recurrence of narrative motifs from A/B, and to shed new light on them. Our fMRI results showed storyline-specific neural patterns, which were reinstated (i.e. became more active) during storyline transitions. This effect increased along the processing timescale hierarchy, peaking in the default mode network. Similarly, the neural reinstatement of motifs was found during part C. Furthermore, participants showing stronger motif reinstatement performed better in integrating A/B and C events, demonstrating the role of memory reactivation in information integration over intervening irrelevant events.",

The potential of the moon jellyfish (Aurelia spp.) as a new model organism has been poorly tested. However, as a tetramerous symmetry organism, it exhibits some variations in radial symmetry number. A pertinent list of morphological - number of gonads - and morphometric characteristics - e.g. ratio of the gonads area on the umbrella area - has been established to describe the morphology of 19 specimens through an image analysis. The method uses for the first time the Hough transform to approximate the gonads and the umbrella by ellipses and automatically extracts the morphometric data. A statistical comparison has been done to compare the morphometric characteristics of tetramerous jellyfish and of jellyfish with 5 gonads: it is only provided as a first step for testing biological hypotheses, since the small size of the data set leads to relativize its conclusions. It suggests that two parameters are discriminant: distance between the center of the gonads and the center of the umbrella, and the individual variability of the gonad eccentricity, both higher in jellyfish with 5 gonads. Additionally, the relative size of the gonads does not seem to be different between tetramerous and non-tetramerous. Combined to ecotoxicological bioassays to better understand the causes of this developmental alteration, this optimizable method can become a powerful tool in the symmetry description of an in situ population.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe promise of artificial intelligence in understanding biological vision relies on the comparison of computational models with brain data with the goal of capturing functional principles of visual information processing. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have successfully matched the transformations in hierarchical processing occurring along the brains feedforward visual pathway extending into ventral temporal cortex. However, we are still to learn if CNNs can successfully describe feedback processes in early visual cortex. Here, we investigated similarities between human early visual cortex and a CNN with encoder/decoder architecture, trained with self-supervised learning to fill occlusions and reconstruct an unseen image. Using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we compared 3T fMRI data from a non-stimulated patch of early visual cortex in human participants viewing partially occluded images, with the different CNN layer activations from the same images. Results show that our self-supervised image-completion network outperforms a classical object-recognition supervised network (VGG16) in terms of similarity to fMRI data. This provides additional evidence that optimal models of the visual system might come from less feedforward architectures trained with less supervision. We also find that CNN decoder pathway activations are more similar to brain processing compared to encoder activations, suggesting an integration of mid- and low/middle-level features in early visual cortex. Challenging an AI model and the human brain to solve the same task offers a valuable way to compare CNNs with brain data and helps to constrain our understanding of information processing such as neuronal predictive coding.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, yet they carry great potential for harm via misfolding and aggregation. Despite the dangers, proteins are sometimes born de novo from non-coding DNA. Proteins are more likely to be born from non-coding regions that produce peptides that do little to no harm when translated than from regions that produce harmful peptides. To investigate which newborn proteins are most likely to \"first, do no harm\", we estimate fitnesses from an experiment that competed Escherichia coli lineages that each expressed a unique random peptide. A variety of peptide metrics significantly predict lineage fitness, but this predictive power stems from simple amino acid frequencies rather than the ordering of amino acids. Amino acids that are smaller and that promote intrinsic structural disorder have more benign fitness effects. We validate that the amino acids that indicate benign effects in random peptides expressed in E. coli also do so in an independent dataset of random N-terminal tags in which it is possible to control for expression level. The same amino acids are also enriched in young animal proteins.\n\nSignificance statementProteins are sometimes born de novo. In an experiment to reproduce this process in Escherichia coli, we were able to predict 15% of the variation in random peptide fitness effects from their amino acid frequencies. In contrast, which order the amino acids are in seems to make no difference, adding no predictive power on top of simple amino acid frequencies. Amino acids that are smaller and promote intrinsic structural disorder have more benign fitness effects.",

M. rotundifolia is resistant to many of the pathogens that detrimentally affect Vitis vinifera, the grape species commonly used for winemaking. For this reason, M. rotundifolia is a valuable genetic resource for breeding. Single-molecule real-time reads were combined with optical maps to reconstruct the two haplotypes of each of the 20 M. rotundifolia cv. Trayshed chromosomes. The completeness and accuracy of the assembly were confirmed using a high-density linkage map of M. rotundifolia. Protein-coding genes were annotated using an integrated and comprehensive approach. This included using Full-length cDNA sequencing (Iso-Seq) to improve gene structure and hypothetical spliced variant predictions. Our data strongly support that Muscadinia chromosomes 7 and 20 are fused in Vitis and pinpoint the location of the fusion in Cabernet Sauvignon and PN40024 chromosome 7. Disease-related gene numbers in Trayshed and Cabernet Sauvignon were similar, but their clustering locations were different. A dramatic expansion of the Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor-like Nucleotide-Binding Site Leucine-Rich Repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR) class was detected on Trayshed chromosome 12 at the Resistance to Uncinula necator 1 (RUN1)/ Resistance to Plasmopara viticola 1 (RPV1) locus, which confers strong dominant resistance to powdery and downy mildews.

    "abstract": "The cell membrane is an inhomogeneous system composed of phospholipids, sterols and proteins that can be directly attached to underlying cytoskeleton. The linkers between the membrane and the cytoskeleton are believed to have a profound effect on the mechanical properties of the cell membrane and its ability to reshape. Here we investigate the role of membrane-cortex linkers on the extrusion of membrane tubes using computer simulations and experiments. In simulations we find that the force for tube extrusion has a non-linear dependence on the density of membrane-cortex attachments: at a wide range of low and intermediate densities of linkers the force is not significantly influenced by the presence of membrane linking proteins and resembles that of the bare membrane. For large concentrations of linkers however the force substantially increases compared to the bare membrane. In both cases the linkers provided membrane tubes with increased stability against coalescence. We then pulled tubes from HEK cells using optical-tweezers for varying expression levels of the membrane-cortex attachment protein Ezrin. In line with simulations, we observed that overexpression of Ezrin led to an increased extrusion force, while Ezrin depletion had negligible effect on the force. Our results shed light on the importance of local effects in membrane reshaping at the nanoscopic scales.",

    "abstract": "Lipids are essential to all living organisms, as an energy source, as an important cellular structural component, and as a communication tool. In this study, we used global lipidomic methods to evaluate the lipids in leaf-cutter ant fungal gardens. Leaf-cutter ants and their coevolved fungal cultivar, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, are a model mutualistic system. The fungus enzymatically digests fresh plant material that the ants cut and deliver, converting energy and nutrients from plants, and providing them to the ants through specialized hyphal swellings called gongylidia. Using combined liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, and tandem mass spectrometry we evaluated differences between the molecular speciation of lipids in the leaf-cutter ant fungal garden ecosystem. This lipidomic study characterized leaves that are fed to the gardens, gongylidia that are produced by the fungus to feed the ants, and spatially resolved regions of the fungal garden through stages of leaf degradation. Lipids containing alpha-linolenic acid (18:3) were enriched in leaves and the top of the gardens, but not dominant in the middle or bottom regions. Gongylidia were dominated by lipids containing linoleic acid (18:2). To evaluate the communicative potential of the lipids in fungal gardens we conducted a behavioral experiment that showed Atta leaf-cutter ants responded differently to 18:3 and 18:2 fatty acids, with aggression towards 18:3 and attraction for 18:2. This work demonstrates the role of lipids in both the transfer of energy and as an inter-kingdom communication tool in leaf-cutter ant fungal gardens.\n\nImportanceIn this work we examined the role of lipids in the mutualism between leaf-cutter ants and fungus. These ants cut fresh leaf material, which they provide to their fungal cultivar, that converts energy and nutrients from the plants and provides it to the ants in specialized hyphal swellings called gongylidia. This work constitutes the first example of a global lipidomics study of a symbiotic system and provides insights as to how the fungus modifies plant lipids into a usable source for the ants. Through a behavioral experiment, this work also demonstrates how lipids can be used as an inter-kingdom communication tool, in this case an attractant, rather than as a repellant, which is more often seen.",

However, the tissue level organisation of HES5 dynamics in neurogenesis is unknown. Here, we analyse the expression of HES5 ex-vivo in the developing mouse ventral spinal cord and identify microclusters of 4-6 cells with positively correlated HES5 level and ultradian dynamics. These microclusters are spatially periodic along the dorsoventral axis and temporally dynamic, alternating between high and low expression with a supra-ultradian persistence time. We show that Notch signaling is required for temporal dynamics but not the spatial periodicity of HES5. Few Neurogenin-2 cells are observed per cluster, irrespective of high or low state, suggesting that the microcluster organization of HES5 enables the stable selection of differentiating cells. Computational modelling predicts that different cell coupling strengths underlie the HES5 spatial patterns and rate of differentiation, which is consistent with comparison between the motoneuron and interneuron progenitor domains.

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that mediates the degradation of cytoplasmic components in eukaryotic cells. In plants, autophagy has been extensively associated with the recycling of proteins during carbon starvation conditions. Even though lipids constitute a significant energy reserve, our understanding of the function of autophagy in the management of cell lipid reserves and components remains fragmented. To further investigate the significance of autophagy in lipid metabolism, we performed an extensive lipidomic characterization of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) autophagy mutants (atg) submitted to dark-induced senescence conditions. Our results revealed an altered lipid profile in atg mutants, suggesting that autophagy affects the homeostasis of multiple lipid components under dark-induced senescence. The acute degradation of chloroplast lipids coupled with the differential accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and plastoglobuli indicates an alternative metabolic reprogramming towards lipid storage in atg mutants. The imbalance of lipid metabolism compromises the production of cytosolic lipid droplets and the regulation of peroxisomal lipid oxidation pathways in atg mutants.\n\nOne-sentence summaryAutophagy is required for the mobilization of membrane lipid components and lipid droplet dynamics during extended darkness in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Durable control of invasive solid tumors necessitates identifying therapeutic resistance mechanisms and effective drug combinations. A promising approach to tackle the cancer drug resistance problem is to build mechanistic mathematical models of the signaling network of cancer cells, and explicitly model the dynamics of information flow through this network under distinct genetic conditions and in response to perturbations.\n\nIn this work, we used a network-based mathematical model to identify sensitivity factors and drug combinations for the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib, which was recently approved for ER+ PIK3CA mutant breast cancer. We experimentally validated the model-predicted efficacious combination of alpelisib and BH3 mimetics (e.g. MCL1 inhibitors) in ER+ breast cancer cell lines. We also experimentally validated the reduced sensitivity to alpelisib caused by FOXO3 knockdown, which is a novel potential resistance mechanism. Our experimental results showed cell line-specific sensitivity to the combination of alpelisib and BH3 mimetics, which was driven by the choice of BH3 mimetics. We find that cell lines were sensitive to the addition of either MCL1 inhibitor s63845 alone or in combination with BCL-XL/BCL-2 inhibitor navitoclax, and that the need for the combination of both BH3 mimetics was predicted by the expression of BCL-XL. Based on these results, we developed cell line-specific network models that are able to recapitulate the observed differential response to alpelisib and BH3 mimetics, and also incorporate the most recent knowledge on resistance and response to PI3K inhibitors.\n\nOverall, we present an approach for the development, experimental testing, and refining of mathematical models, which we apply to the context of PI3K inhibitor drug resistance in breast cancer. Our approach predicted and validated PI3K inhibitor sensitivity factors (FOXO3 knockdown) and drug combinations (BH3 mimetics), and illustrates that network-based mathematical models can contribute to overcoming the challenge of cancer drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is an insect vector that transmits Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, the causal agent of the Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening disease. This disease has devastated Floridas citrus industry and threatens Californias industry as well as other citrus producing regions around the world. To find novel solutions to the disease, a better understanding of the vector is needed. The D. citri genome has been used to identify and characterize genes involved in Wnt signaling pathways. Wnt signaling is utilized for many important biological processes in metazoans, such as patterning and tissue generation. Curation based on RNA sequencing data and sequence homology confirm twenty four Wnt signaling genes within the D. citri genome, including homologs for beta-catenin, Frizzled receptors, and seven Wnt-ligands. Through phylogenetic analysis, we classify D. citri Wnt-ligands as Wg/Wnt1, Wnt5, Wnt6, Wnt7, Wnt10, Wnt11, and WntA. The D. citri version 3.0 genome with chromosomal length scaffolds reveals a conserved Wnt1-Wnt6-Wnt10 gene cluster with gene configuration similar to that in Drosophila melanogaster. These findings provide a greater insight into the evolutionary history of D. citri and Wnt signaling in this important hemipteran vector. Manual annotation was essential for identifying high quality gene models. These gene models can further be used to develop molecular systems, such as CRISPR and RNAi, that target and control D. citri populations, to manage the spread of HLB. Manual annotation of Wnt signaling pathways was done as part of a collaborative community annotation project (https://citrusgreening.org/annotation/index).",

    "abstract": "Developmental patterning is thought to be regulated by conserved signalling pathways. Initial patterns are often broad before refining to only those cells that commit to a particular fate. However, the mechanisms by which pattern refinement takes place remain to be addressed. Using the posterior crossvein (PCV) of the Drosophila pupal wing as a model, into which bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligand is extracellularly transported to instruct vein patterning, we investigate how pattern refinement is regulated. We found that BMP signalling induces apical enrichment of Myosin II in developing crossvein cells to regulate apical constriction. Live imaging of cellular behaviour indicates that changes in cell shape are dynamic and transient, only being maintained in those cells that retain vein fate after refinement. Disrupting cell shape changes throughout the PCV inhibits pattern refinement. In contrast, disrupting cell shape in only a subset of vein cells can result in a loss of BMP signalling. In addition, we observed that expressing the constitutively active form of the BMP type I receptor in clones caused apical constriction autonomously and often induced BMP signalling loss in the PCV region in a non-autonomous manner. We propose that the cell shape changes of future PCV cells allow them to compete more efficiently for the basally localised BMP signal by forming a mechano-chemical feedback loop. This study highlights a new form of competition among the cells: competing for a signal that induces cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing cell types and cell states is one of the fundamental questions in single-cell studies. Meanwhile, exploring the lineage relations among cells and finding the path and critical points in the cell fate transition are also of great importance.\n\nExisting unsupervised clustering methods and lineage trajectory reconstruction methods often face several challenges such as clustering data of arbitrary shapes, tracking precise trajectories and identifying critical points. Certain adaptive landscape approach1-3, which constructs a pseudo-energy landscape of the dynamical system, may be used to explore such problems. Thus, we propose Markov hierarchical clustering algorithm (MarkovHC), which reconstructs multi-scale pseudo-energy landscape by exploiting underlying metastability structure in an exponentially perturbed Markov chain4. A Markov process describes the random walk of a hypothetically traveling cell in the corresponding pseudo-energy landscape over possible gene expression states. Technically, MarkovHC integrates the tasks of cell classification, trajectory reconstruction, and critical point identification in a single theoretical framework consistent with topological data analysis (TDA)5.\n\nIn addition to the algorithm development and simulation tests, we also applied MarkovHC to diverse types of real biological data: single-cell RNA-Seq data, cytometry data, and single-cell ATAC-Seq data. Remarkably, when applying to single-cell RNA-Seq data of human ESC derived progenitor cells6, MarkovHC not only could successfully identify known cell types, but also discover new cell types and stages. In addition, when using MarkovHC to analyze single-cell RNA-Seq data of human preimplantation embryos in early development7, the hierarchical structure of the lineage trajectories was faithfully reconstituted. Furthermore, the critical points representing important stage transitions had also been identified by MarkovHC from early gastric cancer data8.\n\nIn summary, these results demonstrate that MarkovHC is a powerful tool based on rigorous metastability theory to explore hierarchical structures of biological data, to identify a cell sub-population (basin) and a critical point (stage transition), and to track a lineage trajectory (differentiation path).\n\nHighlightsO_LIMarkovHC explores the topology hierarchy in high-dimensional data.\nC_LIO_LIMarkovHC can find clusters (basins) and cores (attractors) of clusters in different scales.\nC_LIO_LIThe trajectory of state transition (transition paths) and critical points in the process of state transition (critical points) among clusters can be tracked.\nC_LIO_LIMarkovHC can be applied on diverse types of single-cell omics data.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImprovements in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) outcomes have followed refinement in device electrical output and electrode montage. The physical properties of the ECT stimulus, together with those of the patients head, determine the impedances measured by the device and govern current delivery to the brain and ECT outcomes.\n\nObjectiveHowever, the precise relations among physical properties of the stimulus, patient head anatomy, and patient-specific impedance to the passage of current are long-standing questions in ECT research and practice.\n\nMethodsWe developed anatomical MRI-derived models of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) that included changes in tissue conductivity due to local electrical current flow. These \"adaptive\" models simulate ECT both during therapeutic stimulation using high (~1 A) current and when dynamic impedance is measured, as well as prior to stimulation when low (~1 mA) current is used to measure static impedance. We modeled two scalp layers: a superficial scalp layer with adaptive conductivity that increases with electric field up to a subject specific maximum [Formula], and a deep scalp layer with a subject-specific fixed conductivity ({sigma}DS).\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that variation in these scalp parameters explain clinical data on subject-specific static impedance and dynamic impedance, their imperfect correlation across subjects, their relationships to seizure threshold, and the role of head anatomy. Adaptive tES models demonstrate that current flow changes local tissue conductivity which in turn shapes current delivery to the brain in a manner not accounted for in fixed tissue conductivity models.\n\nConclusionsOur predictions that variation in individual skin properties, rather than other aspects of anatomy, largely govern the relationship between static impedance, dynamic impedance, and current delivery to the brain, are themselves subject to assumptions about tissue properties. Broadly, our novel pipeline for tES models is important in ongoing efforts to optimize devices, personalize interventions, and explain clinical findings.",

However, reported changes are limited to those obtained from using univariate measures, including activation level and frequency bands. To look beyond the activation level, we used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to extract patterns of information from EEG responses to images in an animacy categorization task. Comparing healthy controls (HC) with patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we found that the neural speed of animacy information processing is decreased in MCI patients. Moreover, we found critical time-points during which the representational pattern of animacy for MCI patients was significantly discriminable from that of HC, while the activation level remained unchanged. Together, these results suggest that the speed and pattern of animacy information processing provide clinically useful information as a potential biomarker for detecting early changes in MCI and AD patients.",

    "abstract": "The committed step of eukaryotic DNA replication occurs when the replicative Mcm2-7 helicase pairs that license each replication origin are activated. Helicase activation requires the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to Mcm2-7, forming Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS complexes (CMGs). Using single-molecule biochemical assays to monitor CMG formation, we found that Cdc45 and GINS are recruited to loaded Mcm2-7 in two stages. Initially, Cdc45 and GINS are individually recruited to unstructured Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails in a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)-dependent manner, forming Cdc45-tail-GINS intermediates (CtGs). The multiple phosphorylation sites on the Mcm2-7 tails promote DDK-dependent modulation of the number of CtGs formed per Mcm2-7. In a second, inefficient event, a subset of CtGs transfer their Cdc45 and GINS components to form CMGs. Importantly, higher CtG multiplicity results in increased frequency of CMG formation. Our findings reveal molecular mechanisms sensitizing helicase activation to DDK levels with implications for the control of replication origin efficiency and timing.",

    "abstract": "Mature mRNA molecules are typically considered to be comprised of a 5UTR, a 3UTR and a coding region (CDS), all attached until degradation. Unexpectedly, however, there have been multiple recent reports of widespread differential expression of mRNA 3UTRs and their cognate coding regions, resulting in the expression of isolated 3UTRs (i3UTRs); these i3UTRs can be highly expressed, often in reciprocal patterns to their cognate CDS. Similar to the role of other lncRNAs, isolated 3UTRs are likely to play an important role in gene regulation but little is known about the contexts in which they are deployed. To begin to parse the functions of i3UTRs, here we carry out in vitro, in vivo and in silico analyses of differential 3UTR/CDS mRNA ratio usage across tissues, development and cell state changes both for a select list of developmentally important genes as well as through unbiased transcriptome-wide analyses. Across two developmental paradigms we find a distinct switch from high i3UTR expression of stem cell related genes in proliferating cells compared to newly differentiated cells. Our unbiased transcriptome analysis across multiple gene sets shows that regardless of tissue, genes with high 3UTR to CDS ratios belong predominantly to gene ontology categories related to cell-type specific functions while in contrast, the gene ontology categories of genes with low 3UTR to CDS ratios are similar and relate to common cellular functions. In addition to these specific findings our data provide critical information from which detailed hypotheses for individual i3UTRs can be tested-with a common theme that i3UTRs appear poised to regulate cell-specific gene expression and state.\n\nSignificance StatementThe widespread existence and expression of mRNA 3 untranslated sequences in the absence of their cognate coding regions (called isolated 3UTRs or i3UTRs) opens up considerable avenues for gene regulation not previously envisioned. Each isolated 3UTR may still bind and interact with micro RNAs, RNA binding proteins as well as other nucleic acid sequences, all in the absence or low levels of cognate protein production. Here we document the expression, localization and regulation of i3UTRs both within particular biological systems as well as across the transcriptome. As this is an entirely new area of experimental investigation these early studies are seminal to this burgeoning field.",

Modern humans started to appear in the fossil record outside of Africa about 100 thousand years ago though other hominins existed throughout Eurasia much earlier2-4. Recently, several researchers argued in favour of a single out of Africa event for modern humans based on whole-genome sequences analyses5-7. However, the single out of Africa model is in contrast with some of the findings from fossil records, which supports two out of Africa8,9, and uniparental data, which proposes back to Africa movement10,11. Here, we used a novel deep learning approach coupled with Approximate Bayesian Computation and Sequential Monte Carlo to revisit these hypotheses from the whole genome sequence perspective. Our results support the back to Africa model over other alternatives. We estimated that there are two successive splits between Africa and out of African populations happening around 60-80 thousand years ago and separated by 12-13 thousand years. One of the populations resulting from the more recent split has to a large extent replaced the older West African population while the other one has founded the out of Africa populations.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction has been greatly improved, but there are still a good portion of predicted models that do not have very high quality. Protein model refinement is one of the methods that may further improve model quality. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to refine a protein model towards better quality. Currently the most successful refinement methods rely on extensive conformation sampling and thus, take hours or days to refine even a single protein model. Here we propose a fast and effective method that may refine protein models with very limited conformation sampling. Our method applies GNN (graph neural networks) to predict refined inter-atom distance probability distribution from an initial model and then rebuilds the model using the predicted distance as restraints. On the CASP13 refinement targets our method may refine models with comparable quality as the two leading human groups (Feig and Baker) and greatly outperforms the others. On the CASP14 refinement targets our method is only second to Feigs method, comparable to Bakers method and much better than the others (who worsened instead of improved model quality). Our method achieves this result by generating only 5 refined models for an initial model, which can be done in [~]15 minutes. Our study also shows that GNN performs much better than convolutional residual neural networks for protein model refinement when conformation sampling is limited.\n\nAvailabilityThe code will be released once the manuscript is published and available at http://raptorx.uchicago.edu\n\nContactjinboxu@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Zika virus is a global public health emergency due to its association with microcephaly, Guillain-Barre syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis in children and adults. A total of 87 countries have had evidence of autochthonous mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus, distributed across four continents, and no antivirus therapy or vaccines are available. Therefore, several strategies have been developed to target the main mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, to reduce the burden of different arboviruses. Among such strategies, the use of the maternally-inherited endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been applied successfully to reduce virus susceptibility and decrease transmission. However, the mechanisms by which Wolbachia orchestrate resistance to ZIKV infection remain to be elucidated. In this study, we apply isobaric labeling quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify proteins and identify pathways altered during ZIKV infection; Wolbachia infection; co-infection with Wolbachia/ZIKV in the Ae. aegypti heads and salivary glands. We show that Wolbachia regulates proteins involved in ROS production, regulates humoral immune response, and antioxidant production. The reduction of ZIKV polyprotein in the presence of Wolbachia in mosquitoes was determined by mass spectrometry and corroborates the idea that Wolbachia helps to block ZIKV infections in Ae. aegypti. The present study offers a rich resource of data that may help to elucidate mechanisms by which Wolbachia orchestrate resistance to ZIKV infection in Ae. aegypti, and represents a step further on the development of new targeted methods to detect and quantify ZIKV and Wolbachia directly in complex tissues.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe abundance of ZIKV polyprotein is reduced in the presence of Wolbachia\nC_LIO_LIShotgun proteomics quantifies ZIKV and Wolbachia proteins directly in tissues\nC_LIO_LIWolbachia regulates proteins involved in ROS production\nC_LIO_LIWolbachia regulates humoral immune response and antioxidant production\nC_LIO_LIMetabolism and detoxification processes were associated with mono infections\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo assess the contribution of the melanopsin-containing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and the cones to reflexive eye closure as an implicit measure of interictal photophobia in migraine.\n\nMethodsWe studied twenty participants in each of three groups: headache-free (HAf) controls, migraine without aura (MwoA), and migraine with visual aura (MwA). Participants viewed spectral pulses that selectively targeted melanopsin, the cones, or their combination while we recorded orbicularis oculi electromyography (OO-EMG) and blinking rate.\n\nResultsTime course analysis of OO-EMG demonstrated that reflexive eye closure was tightly coupled to the spectral pulses. Compared to both the MwoA and HAf control groups, the MwA group had enhanced OO-EMG and blinking activity in response to melanopsin and cone stimulation in combination and in isolation. This response scaled with the contrast of the stimulus.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that ipRGC signals, whether elicited by melanopsin stimulation or from presumed extrinsic cone input, provide the afferent input for light-induced reflexive eye closure in a photophobic state. Participants with migraine and visual aura had a distinctly different response to visual stimulation as compared to the other two groups. This is in contrast to prior findings in this same cohort in whom higher explicit ratings of visual discomfort were found for both MwA and MwoA as compared to controls. Such a dissociation suggests distinct pathophysiology in forms of migraine, interacting with separate neural pathways by which ipRGC signals elicit implicit and explicit signs of visual discomfort.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are able to synthesize a high diversity of natural compounds that account for their success in the colonization of a variety of ecological niches. Many of them have beneficial properties. The mud from the thermal baths of Balaruc-Les-Bains, one of the oldest thermal baths in France, has long been recognized as a healing treatment for arthro-rheumatic diseases. To characterize the cyanobacteria living in these muds and the metabolites they potentially produce, several strains were isolated from the water column and biofilms of the retention basin and analyzed using a polyphasic approach. Morphological, ultrastructural and molecular (16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S ITS region sequencing) methods were employed to identify nine cyanobacterial strains belonging to the orders Chroococcales, Synechococcales, Oscillatoriales and Nostocales. The combination of morphological and genetic characteristics supported the description of a new genus and species with the type species as Pseudo-chroococcus couteii. The high taxonomic diversity in the muds of the thermal baths of Balaruc-Les-Bains along with literature reports of the potential for bioactive metabolite synthesis of these taxa allowed us to hypothesize that some of the metabolites produced by these strains could contribute to the therapeutic properties of the muds from Thermes de Balaruc-Les-Bains.",

    "abstract": "Surface-associated proteins play critical roles in the Plasmodium parasite life cycle and are major targets for vaccine development. The 6-cysteine (6-cys) protein family is expressed in a stage-specific manner throughout Plasmodium falciparum life cycle and characterized by the presence of 6-cys domains, which are {beta}-sandwich domains with conserved sets of disulfide bonds. Although several 6-cys family members have been implicated to play a role in sexual stages, mosquito transmission, evasion of the host immune response and host cell invasion, the precise function of many family members is still unknown and structural information is only available for four 6-cys proteins. Here, we present to the best of our knowledge, the first crystal structure of the 6-cys protein Pf12p determined at 2.8 [A] resolution. The monomeric molecule folds into two domains, D1 and D2, both of which adopt the canonical 6-cys domain fold. Although the structural fold is similar to that of Pf12, its paralog in P. falciparum, we show that Pf12p does not complex with Pf41, which is a known interaction partner of Pf12. We generated ten distinct Pf12p-specific nanobodies which map into two separate epitope groups; one group which binds within the D2 domain, while several members of the second group bind at the interface of the D1 and D2 domain of Pf12p. Characterization of the structural features of the 6-cys family and their associated nanobodies provide a framework for generating new tools to study the diverse functions of the 6-cys protein family in the Plasmodium life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates transcript isoforms with different 3 ends. Differences in polyadenylation sites usage, which have been associated with diseases like cancer, regulate mRNA stability, subcellular localization, and translation. By characterizing APA across the 24-hour day in mouse liver, here we show that rhythmic gene expression occurs largely in an APA isoform-specific manner, and that hundreds of arrhythmically expressed genes surprisingly exhibit a rhythmic APA isoform. The underlying mechanisms comprise isoform-specific post-transcriptional regulation, transcription factor driven expression of specific isoform, co-transcriptional recruitment of RNA binding proteins that regulate mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, and, to a lesser extent, cell subtype-specific expression. Remarkably, rhythmic expression of specific APA isoforms generates 24-hour rhythms in 3 UTR length, with shorter UTRs in anticipation of the mouse active phase. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that cycling transcriptomes are regulated by APA, and suggest that APA strongly impacts the rhythmic regulation of biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant aggregation and amyloid formation of tar DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and -synuclein (S) underlie frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), respectively. Amyloid inclusions of TDP-43 and S are also commonly co-observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidence from cellular and animal models show colocalization of the TDP-43 and S aggregates, raising the possibility of direct interactions and co-aggregation between the two proteins. In this report, we set out to answer this question by investigating the interactions between S and prion-like pathogenic C-terminal domain of TDP-43 (TDP-43 PrLD). PrLD is an aggregation-prone fragment generated both by alternative splicing as well as aberrant proteolytic cleavage of full length TDP-43. Our results indicate that two proteins interact in a synergistic manner to augment each others aggregation towards hybrid fibrils. While monomers, oligomers and sonicated fibrils of S seed TDP-43 PrLD monomer aggregation, TDP-43 PrLD fibrils failed to seed S monomers indicating selective interactions. Furthermore, S modulates liquid droplets formed by TDP-43 PrLD and RNA to promote insoluble amyloid aggregates. Importantly, the cross-seeded hybrid aggregates show greater cytotoxicity as compared to the individual homotypic aggregates suggesting that the interactions between the two proteins have a discernable impact on cellular functions. Together, these results bring forth insights into TDP-43 PrLD - S interactions that could help explain clinical and pathological presentations in patients with co-morbidities involving the two proteins.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the surface of susceptible cells through extensive interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) anchored in cell membranes. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the spike protein are able to prevent antibody binding, yet while maintaining the ability to bind ACE2 and viral infectivity, mutations in the spike protein identified in cases of human infection were mapped to the crystallographically-determined interfaces between the spike protein and ACE2 (PDB entry 6M0J), antibody CC12.1 (PDB entry 6XC2), and antibody P2B-2F6 (PDB entry 7BWJ).\n\nBoth antibody binding interfaces partially overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Among 16 mutations that map to the RBD:CC12.1 interface, 11 are likely to disrupt CC12.1 binding but not ACE2 binding. Among 12 mutations that map to the RBD:P2B-2F6 interface, 8 are likely to disrupt P2B-2F6 binding but not ACE2 binding. As expected, none of the mutations observed to date appear likely to disrupt the RBD:ACE2 interface.\n\nWe conclude that SARS-CoV-2 with mutated forms of the spike protein may retain the ability to bind ACE2 while evading recognition by antibodies that arise in response to the original wild-type form of the spike protein. It seems likely that immune evasion will be possible regardless of whether the spike protein was encountered in the form of infectious virus, or as the immunogen in a vaccine. Therefore, it also seems likely that reinfection with a variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 may occur among people who recover from Covid-19, and that vaccines with the ability to generate antibodies against multiple variant forms of the spike protein will be necessary to protect against variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 that are already circulating in the human population.",

    "abstract": "ContextSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged late in 2019 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There is an urgent need to develop curative and preventive therapeutics to limit the current pandemic and to prevent the re-emergence of Covid-19. This study aimed to assess the in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SRAS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsVero E6 cells were treated with copper gluconate 18 hours before infection. Cells were infected with a recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were maintained in fresh medium containing copper gluconate for an additional 48-hour period. The infection level was measured by the confocal microscopy-based high content screening method. The cell viability in presence of copper gluconate was assessed by XTT assay.\n\nResultsThe viability of Vero E6 cells treated with copper gluconate up to 200 M was found to be similar to that of untreated cells, but it dropped below 40% with 400 M of this agent. The infection rate was 23.8%, 18.9%, 20.6%, 6.9%, 5.3%,5.2% in cells treated with 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively. As compared to untreated cells, the number of infected cells was reduced by 71%, 77%, and 78% with 25, 50, and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusionCopper gluconate was found to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global pandemic of COVID-19, and no effective antiviral agents and vaccines are available. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BLS-3) agent, impeding the basic research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2-GFP/{Delta}N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, we developed a convenient and efficient SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics tool to dissect the virus life cycle under a BSL-2 condition. This powerful tool should accelerate our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and its antiviral development.",

Here we investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for PCR-positive tests. In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients. This novel feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain why patients can continue to produce viral RNA after recovery and suggests a new aspect of RNA virus replication.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of cell types form the vertebrate brain, but it is largely unknown how similar these cellular repertoires are between or within species, or how cell type diversity evolves. To examine cell type diversity across and within species, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of [~]130,000 hypothalamic cells from zebrafish (Danio rerio) and surface- and cave-morphs of Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus). We found that over 75% of cell types were shared between zebrafish and Mexican tetra, which last shared a common ancestor over 150 million years ago. Orthologous cell types displayed differential paralogue expression that was generated by sub-functionalization after genome duplication. Expression of terminal effector genes, such as neuropeptides, was more conserved than the expression of their associated transcriptional regulators. Species-specific cell types were enriched for the expression of species-specific genes, and characterized by the neo-functionalization of members of recently expanded or contracted gene families. Within species comparisons revealed differences in immune repertoires and transcriptional changes in neuropeptidergic cell types associated with genomic differences between surface- and cave-morphs. The single-cell atlases presented here are a powerful resource to explore hypothalamic cell types, and reveal how gene family evolution and the neo- and sub-functionalization of paralogs contribute to cellular diversity.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has identified signal sequences and motifs that are necessary and sufficient to target proteins to specific subcellular regions and organelles such as the plasma membrane, nucleus, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and mitochondria. In contrast, minimal sequence motifs that are sufficient for Golgi localization remain largely elusive. In this work, we identified a 37 amino acid alternative open reading frame (altORF) within the mRNA of the centromere protein, CENP-R. This altORF peptide localizes specifically to the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus. Through mutational analysis, we identify a minimal 10 amino acid sequence and a critical cysteine residue that are necessary and sufficient for Golgi localization. Pharmacological perturbations suggest that this peptide is modified through palmitoylation to promote its localization. Together, our work defines a minimal sequence that is sufficient for Golgi targeting and provide a valuable Golgi marker for live cell imaging.",

    "abstract": "A network of chaperones and ubiquitin ligases sustain intracellular proteostasis, and is integral in preventing aggregation of misfolded proteins associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. Using cell-based studies of polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases: Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) and Huntingtons disease (HD), we aimed to identify crucial ubiquitin ligases that protect against polyQ aggregation. We report here that Praja1 (PJA1), a Ring-H2 ubiquitin ligase abundantly expressed in the brain is diminished when polyQ repeat proteins (Ataxin-3/Huntingtin) are expressed in cells. PJA1 interacts with polyQ proteins and enhances their degradation resulting in reduced aggregate formation. Down-regulation of PJA1 in neuronal cells increases polyQ protein levels vis-a-vis their aggregates rendering the cells vulnerable to cytotoxic stress. Finally, PJA1 suppresses polyQ toxicity in yeast and rescues eye degeneration in transgenic Drosophila model of SCA3. Thus, our findings establish PJA1 as a robust ubiquitin ligase of polyQ proteins and induction of which might serve as an alternative therapeutic strategy in handling cytotoxic polyglutamine aggregates.",

    "abstract": "There is a critical need to develop small molecule inhibitors of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation. The best known reagent currently is peracetylated benzyl-GalNAc, but it is only effective at millimolar concentrations. This manuscript demonstrates that Ac5GalNTGc, a peracetylated C-2 sulfhydryl substituted GalNAc, fulfills this unmet need. When added to cultured leukocytes, breast and prostate cells, Ac5GalNTGc increased cell surface VVA-binding by ~10-fold, indicating truncation of O-glycan biosynthesis. Cytometry, mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis of HL-60 promyelocytes demonstrate that 50-80M Ac5GalNTGc prevented elaboration of 30-60% of the O-glycans beyond the Tn-antigen (GalNAc1-Ser/Thr) stage. The effect of the compound on N-glycans and glycosphingolipids was small. Glycan inhibition induced by Ac5GalNTGc resulted in 50-80% reduction in leukocyte sialyl-Lewis-X expression, and L-/P-selectin mediated rolling under flow. Ac5GalNTGc was pharmacologically active in mouse. It reduced neutrophil infiltration to sites of inflammation by ~60%. Overall, Ac5GalNTGc may find diverse applications as a potent inhibitor of O-glycosylation.",

    "abstract": "Phosphonates contain a particularly stable carbon-phosphorus bond, yet a number of microorganisms possess pathways to degrade these molecules and use them as source of phosphorus. One example is the widespread hydrolytic route for the breakdown of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP). In this pathway, the aminotransferase PhnW initially converts AEP into phosphonoacetaldehyde (PAA), which is then cleaved by the hydrolase PhnX to yield acetaldehyde and phosphate.\n\nThis work focuses on a novel enzyme (hereby termed PbfA), which is often encoded in bacterial gene clusters containing the phnW-phnX combination. Although PbfA is annotated as a transaminase, we report that it catalyzes an elimination reaction on the naturally occurring compound (R)-1-hydroxy-2-aminoethylphosphonate (R-HAEP). The reaction releases ammonia and generates PAA, which can be subsequently hydrolyzed by PhnX. Overall, the PbfA reaction represents a frequent accessory branch in the hydrolytic pathway for AEP degradation, which expands the scope and versatility of the pathway itself.",

By visualizing the flow using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models, an option is created to investigate the flow in patient-specific geometries.\n\nCFD simulation of the pathological single right ventricle in contrast to the healthy left ventricle is the research object of the present work. The aim is the numerical comparison of the intraventricular flow within the ventricles. Based on this, flow formation in different anatomies of the ventricles is investigated.\n\nPatient-specific measurements of ventricles from three-dimensional real-time echocardiographic images served as the basis for the simulations with five single right ventricle (SRV) patients and two subjects with healthy left hearts (LV) investigated. Interpolation of these data reproduced the shape and continuous motion of the heart during a cardiac cycle. This motion was implemented into a CFD model with a moving mesh methodology. For comparison of the ventricles, the vortex formation as well as the occurring turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and washout were evaluated. Vortex formation was assessed using the dimensionless vortex formation time (VFT).\n\nThe results show significantly lower values for the VFT and the TKE in SRV patients than for the compared LV Patients. Furthermore, vortex formation does not progress to the apex in SRV patients. These findings were confirmed by a significantly lower washout in SRV patients.\n\nFlow simulation within the moving ventricle provides the possibility of more detailed analysis of the ventricular function. Simulation results show altered vortex formation and reduced washout of SRV in comparison to healthy LV. This information could provide important information for the planning and treatment of Fontan patients.",

    "abstract": "Mutational signature analysis is commonly performed in genomic studies surveying cancer and normal somatic tissues. Here we present SigProfilerExtractor, an automated tool for accurate de novo extraction of mutational signatures for all types of somatic mutations. Benchmarking with a total of 34 distinct scenarios encompassing 2,500 simulated signatures operative in more than 60,000 unique synthetic genomes and 20,000 synthetic exomes demonstrates that SigProfilerExtractor outperforms thirteen other tools across all datasets with and without noise. For genome simulations with 5% noise, reflecting high-quality genomic datasets, SigProfilerExtractor outperforms other approaches by elucidating between 20% and 50% more true positive signatures while yielding more than 5-fold less false positive signatures. Applying SigProfilerExtractor to 4,643 whole-genome sequenced and 19,184 whole-exome sequenced cancers reveals four previously missed mutational signatures. Two of the signatures are confirmed in independent cohorts with one of these signatures associating with tobacco smoking. In summary, this report provides a reference tool for analysis of mutational signatures, a comprehensive benchmarking of bioinformatics tools for extracting mutational signatures, and several novel mutational signatures including a signature putatively attributed to direct tobacco smoking mutagenesis in bladder cancer and in normal bladder epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Poor recycling has accumulated millions of tons of plastic waste in terrestrial and marine environments. While biodegradation is a plausible route towards sustainable management of plastic waste, the global diversity of plastic-degrading enzymes remains poorly understood. Taking advantage of global environmental DNA sampling projects, here we construct HMM models from experimentally-verified enzymes and mine ocean and soil metagenomes to assess the global potential of microorganisms to degrade plastics. By controlling for false positives using gut microbiome data, we compile a catalogue of over 30,000 non-redundant enzyme homologues with the potential to degrade 10 different plastic types. While differences between the ocean and soil microbiomes likely reflect the base compositions of these environments, we find that ocean enzyme abundance might increase with depth as a response to plastic pollution and not merely taxonomic composition. By obtaining further pollution measurements, we reveal that the abundance of the uncovered enzymes in both ocean and soil habitats significantly correlates with marine and country-specific plastic pollution trends. Our study thus uncovers the earth microbiomes potential to degrade plastics, providing evidence of a measurable effect of plastic pollution on the global microbial ecology as well as a useful resource for further applied research.",

Reports of recent ToBRFV outbreaks from around the world indicate an emerging global epidemic. ToBRFV overcomes all tobamovirus resistances in tomato, including the durable Tm-22 resistance gene. Here, we show that the ToBRFV movement protein (MPToBRFV) is the cause for overcoming Tm-22 resistance. Transient expression of MPToBRFV failed to activate the Tm-22 resistance response. Replacement of the original MP sequences of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) with MPToBRFV enabled this recombinant virus to overcome Tm-22 resistance. Hybrid protein analysis revealed that the resistance-breaking elements are located between MPToBRFV amino acids 1 and 216, and not the C terminus as previously assumed. Interestingly, replacement of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and ToMV MPs with MPToBRFV caused an attenuation of systemic infection of both viruses. Cell-to-cell movement analysis revealed that MPToBRFV moves less effectively compared to the TMV MP (MPTMV). These findings suggest that overcoming Tm-22 is associated with attenuated MP function. This viral fitness cost may explain the high durability of Tm-22 resistance, which had remained unbroken for over 60 years.",

A diverse array of AMPAR signaling complexes are established by receptor auxiliary subunits, associating in various combinations to modulate trafficking, gating and synaptic strength 2. However, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Here, we determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of the heteromeric GluA1/2 receptor assembled with both TARP-{gamma}8 and CNIH2, the predominant AMPAR complex in the forebrain, in both resting and active states (at 3.2 and 3.7 [A], respectively). Consequential for gating regulation, two {gamma}8 and two CNIH2 subunits lodge at distinct sites beneath the ligand-binding domains of the receptor tetramer, with site-specific lipids shaping each interaction. Activation leads to a stark asymmetry between GluA1 and GluA2 along the ion conduction path, and an outward expansion of the channel triggers counter-rotations of both auxiliary subunit pairs, that promotes the active-state conformation. In addition, both {gamma}8 and CNIH2 pivot towards the pore exit on activation, extending their reach for cytoplasmic receptor elements. CNIH2 achieves this through its uniquely extended M2 helix, which has transformed this ER-export factor into a powerful positive AMPAR modulator, capable of providing hippocampal pyramidal neurons with their integrative synaptic properties.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence implicates white matter (WM) dynamics supporting learning in the mature brain. Recent MRI studies, mostly using diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI), have demonstrated learning-induced WM changes at the microstructural level. However, while DT-MRI-derived measures have sensitivity to general WM microstructural changes, they lack compartmental specificity, making them difficult to relate to underlying cellular mechanisms, stymying deeper understanding of mechanisms supporting training-induced gains in performance. Gaining a deeper understanding demands a more detailed characterization of changes in specific WM sub-components. To this end, four microstructural MRI techniques were employed to study alterations in rat brains after 5-days of water maze training: DT-MRI; Composite Hindered and Restricted Model of Diffusion (CHARMED); magnetization transfer (MT) imaging; quantitative susceptibility mapping and R2*.\n\nThe hypothesis tested here was that microstructural changes would be: (i) observed in tracts supporting spatial navigation, i.e., fornix and corpus callosum (CC); and (ii) more pronounced in the myelin-specific measures.\n\nMedians and distributions of microstructural parameters were derived along the fornix, CC and cingulum (as a comparison tract) using the  tractometry approach. Summary measures were derived from different metrics using unsupervised data reduction. Significant pre-vs-post training differences were found in the medians of two principal components loading on: (i) anisotropy indices; and (ii) MT ratio. The most striking effect, however, was seen in the distributions of pre-vs-post training MT ratio in the fornix, consistent with the primary hypothesis, and highlighting the value of this alternative to the standard approach (i.e., comparing means/medians of DT-MRI parameters) for studying neuroplasticity in vivo.\n\nSignificance statementRecent MRI-studies have demonstrated that white matter (WM) dynamics support learning, even in the mature brain. However, most studies are based on diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) measures, which although providing sensitivity to WM microstructural changes, do not provide a direct translation to the underlying cellular mechanisms making interpretation difficult. Using alternative quantitative MRI approaches, this study provided more specific subcomponent microstructural insights into the brains WM response to water-maze training. We show that myelin-specific MR measures show more marked changes than axonal-specific and DT-MRI measures, in WM tracts responsible for spatial navigation. The results promote adoption of these alternative approaches to DT-MRI for studying neuroplasticity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin (5-HT) system, particularly the 5-HT2C receptor, has consistently been implicated in behavioural control. However, while some studies have focused on the role 5-HT2C receptors plays in regulating motivation to work for reward, others have highlighted its importance in response restraint. To date, it is unclear how 5-HT transmission at this receptor regulates the balance of response invigoration and restraint in anticipation of future reward. In addition, it remains to be established how 5-HT2C receptors gate the influence of internal versus cue-driven processes over reward-guided actions. To elucidate these issues, we investigated the effects of administering the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB242084, both systemically and directly into the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), in rats performing a Go/No-Go task for small or large rewards. The results were compared to administration of d-amphetamine into the NAcC, which has previously been shown to promote behavioural activation. Systemic perturbation of 5-HT2C receptors - but crucially not intra-NAcC infusions - consistently boosted rats performance and instrumental vigour on Go trials when they were required to act. Concomitantly, systemic administration also reduced their ability to withhold responding for rewards on No-Go trials, particularly late in the holding period. Notably, these effects were often apparent only when the reward on offer was small. By contrast, inducing a hyperdopaminergic state in the NAcC with d-amphetamine strongly impaired response restraint on No-Go trials both early and late in the holding period, as well as speeding action initiation. Together, these findings suggest that 5-HT2C receptor transmission, outside the NAcC, shapes the vigour of ongoing goal-directed action as well as the likelihood of responding as a function of expected reward.",

    "abstract": "The yeast mating pathway regulates haploid cell fusion in response to pheromone signaling via a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that controls directional growth (chemotropism). However, the regulators of chemotropic morphogenesis are ill-defined. By using a non-biased genome-wide screen, we identified hundreds of genes that affect mating. An additional screens identified and validated >20 novel positive and negative regulators of pheromone gradient sensing, chemotropism, shmoo development, and mating. Aside from known regulators of exocytosis and endocytosis, genes involved in translational control downstream of the G-protein-regulated pheromone and filamentous growth MAPK pathways were identified. These include the Scp160 RNA-binding protein and the Asc1, Rpl12b, and Rpl19b ribosomal proteins (RPs). Importantly, we demonstrate that pheromone treatment and G (Gpa1) activation stimulate Scp160 binding to (and inhibition of) Asc1, which acts downstream of glucose-activated G (Gpa2) on the filamentous growth pathway. Moreover, we identify both Rpl12b and Rpl19b as RP paralog-specific positive regulators of translation of mating components, including Scp160. Thus, opposing MAPK pathways may converge at the level of translational control to regulate signaling output.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/422562v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3944e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9204eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7e902org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2bfc6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsThe I148M PNPLA3, the rs641738 in MBOAT7/TMC4 locus and the E167K TM6SF2 polymorphisms represent the main predisposing factors to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development and progression. We previously generated a full knockout of MBOAT7 in HepG2 cells (MBOAT7-/-), homozygous for the I148M PNPLA3. Therefore, we aimed to:1) investigate the synergic impact of the 3 at-risk variants on liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a large cohort of NAFLD patients;2) create in vitro models of genetic NAFLD by silencing TM6SF2 in both HepG2 and MBOAT7-/- cells.\n\nMethodsNAFLD patients (n=1380) of whom 121 had HCC were stratified with a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the number of PNPLA3, TM6SF2 and MBOAT7 at-risk variants. TM6SF2 was silenced in HepG2 (TM6SF2-/-) and MBOAT7-/- (MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/-) through CRISPR/Cas9.\n\nResultsIn NAFLD patients, the additive weight of these mutations was associated with liver disease severity and increased risk to develop HCC. In HepG2 cells, TM6SF2 silencing altered lipid composition and induced the accumulation of micro-vesicular LDs, whereas the MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/- cells showed a mixed micro/macro pattern of LDs. TM6SF2 deletion strongly affected endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria ultrastructures thus increasing ER/oxidative stress. Mitochondrial number raised in both TM6SF2-/- and MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/- models, suggesting an unbalancing in mitochondrial dynamics and the silencing of both MBOAT7 and TM6SF2 impaired mitochondrial activity with a shift towards anaerobic glycolysis. MBOAT7-/-TM6SF2-/- cells also showed the highest proliferation rate.\n\nConclusionsThe co-presence of the 3 at-risk variants impacts on NAFLD course, in both patients and experimental models affecting LDs accumulation, mitochondrial functionality and metabolic reprogramming towards HCC.",

    "abstract": "Fossils within early Cambrian phosphorites worldwide are often well preserved due to early diagenetic permineralization. Here, we examine the fossil record contained within phosphorites of the Lower Cambrian Pusa Formation (late Fortunian to Cambrian Stage 2) in Fontanarejo, central Spain. The sedimentology and age of these phosphorites have been controversial and are here reviewed and discussed, providing also a updated geological map. The Pusa Formation is composed of fine clastic sediments that are partly turbiditic, with channels of quartz-rich conglomerates and abundant phosphorites in the upper part of the succession. The microfacies and mineralogy of these channel deposits are studied here for the first time in detail, showing that they are mainly composed of subspherical apatite clasts, with minor mudstone intraclasts, quartzite and mica grains. Numerous sponge spicules, as well as entirely preserved hexactinellid sponges and demosponges, were collected within these phosphorites and likely represent stem groups. In addition to sponges, other fossils, such as small shelly fossils (SSF) of the mollusk Anabarella sp., were found. The phosphorites exhibit multiple evidence of intense microbial activity, including diverse fabrics (phosphatic oncoidal-like microbialites, thrombolites, stromatolites, and cements) and abundant fossils of filamentous microbes that strongly resemble sulfur oxidizing bacteria. Our findings strongly suggest that microbial processes mediated the rapid formation of most of the Fontanarejo apatite, probably accounting for the exceptional preservation of fragile fossils such as sponge skeletons. The apparent presence of taxonomically diverse hexactinellid and demosponge communities by the lowermost Cambrian further corroborates a Precambrian origin of the phylum Porifera.",

In mammals, bile salt composition is determined by host and microbial enzymes, affecting signaling through the bile salt-binding transcription factor Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr). However, these processes in other vertebrate classes remain poorly understood. We show that key components of hepatic bile salt synthesis and ileal transport pathways are conserved and under control of Fxr in zebrafish. Zebrafish bile salts consist primarily of a C27 bile alcohol and a C24 bile acid which undergo multiple microbial modifications including bile acid deconjugation that augments Fxr activity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we provide a cellular atlas of the zebrafish intestinal epithelium and uncover roles for Fxr in transcriptional and differentiation programs in ileal and other cell types. These results establish zebrafish as a non-mammalian vertebrate model for studying bile salt metabolism and Fxr signaling.",

The goal of the reconstruction was to determine dynamic network interactions (quantitative predictive relationships of mutual regulatory influences of and on transcription factor expression) from time course data on 56 transcript expression levels obtained following different external cues. The inherently under-determined nature of this problem was addressed in part by excluding putative regulatory motifs that did not appear to be functional in multiple independent experiments from different independent external perturbations. Data were obtained from a previously published experiment in which the 56 transcripts were assayed by bioluminescence in live cells cultured on substrates of varying levels of stiffness and exposed to different levels of arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptide. The inferred dynamical networks were validated via comparison of predictions to a priori known interactions from gene databases. We discovered that exposures to different substrate stiffnesses and to RGD stimulate responses that are mediated through GATA4, SMAD3/4, ETS-1, and STAT5 and other genes, which can initiate hypertrophic, fibrotic, and inflammatory responses. The developed dynamical system identification method for discovering new mechanotransduction pathways is applicable to the identification of gene regulatory networks in numerous emerging applications where time-series data on multiple state variables and from multiple external perturbations are available.",

Here we demonstrate that the depletion of nucleus-specific 3[-&gt;]5 exoribonuclease Rrp6p and its cofactor, Rrp47p led to the specific and selective enhancement of steady-state levels of mature small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that include 5S and 5.8S rRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs, but not 18S and 25S rRNAs. Most importantly, their steady-state enhancement does not require the exosome, TRAMP, CTEXT, or Rrp6p-associated Mpp6p. Rrp6p/47p-dependent enhancement of the steady-state levels of sncRNAs is associated with the diminution of their nuclear decay-rate and requires their polyadenylation before targeting by Rrp6p, which is catalyzed by both the canonical and non-canonical poly(A) polymerases, Pap1p and Trf4p. Consistent with this finding, we also demonstrated that Rrp6p and Rrp47p exist as an exosome-independent complex. Thus, Rrp6p-Rrp47p defines a core nuclear exosome-independent novel turnover system that targets the small non-coding RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Today, the transformation of ecosystems proceeds at unprecedented rates. Recent studies suggest that high rates of environmental change can cause rate-induced tipping. In ecological models, the associated rate-induced critical transition manifests during transient dynamics in which populations drop to dangerously low densities. In this work, we study how indirect evolutionary rescue - due to the rapid evolution of a predators trait - can save a prey population from the rate-induced collapse. Therefore, we explicitly include the time-dependent dynamics of environmental change and evolutionary adaptation in an eco-evolutionary system. We then examine how fast the evolutionary adaptation needs to be to counteract the response to environmental degradation and express this relationship by means of a critical rate. Based on this critical rate, we conclude that indirect evolutionary rescue is more probable if the predator population possesses a high genetic variation and, simultaneously, the environmental change is slow. Hence, our results strongly emphasize that the maintenance of biodiversity requires a deceleration of the anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats.",

    "abstract": "Natural disturbances like drought and wildfires are expected to increase in prevalence, so understanding how organisms are affected is a key goal for conservationists and biologists alike. While many studies have illustrated long-term effects of perturbations on survival and reproduction, little is known of short-term effects to physiology and sexual signal expression. Ornamental traits have been proposed as reliable indicators of environmental health, yet studies are lacking in the context of natural disturbances. Here we present short-term responses of male Red-backed Fairywrens (Malurus melanocephalus) to wildfire near the onset of the typical breeding season. Males of this species are characterized by plastic expression of sexual plumage phenotypes in their first breeding season. Using two populations with Fairywren captures before and after separate wildfires we illustrate that wildfire suppressed molt into ornamented plumage, including in third year males that typically show little plasticity in ornamentation. Baseline plasma corticosterone was elevated in males sampled after fire, but condition (furcular fat stores) was unaffected. Although testosterone levels did not decrease following fire, we found a positive correlation between testosterone and plumage ornamentation. In addition, males molting in ornamental plumage had higher circulating levels of testosterone than males molting in unornamented plumage following fire. Collectively, these findings suggest that wildfires inhibit or greatly delay acquisition of ornamentation in young males without exerting obvious effects on condition, but rather through subtle effects on testosterone and corticosterone circulation. This natural experiment also reveals that expression of alternative male reproductive phenotypes in this species is sensitive to environmental conditions and more plastic than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of genome structural variation (SV) to quantitative traits associated with cardiometabolic diseases remains largely unknown. Here, we present the results of a study examining genetic association between SVs and cardiometabolic traits in the Finnish population. We used sensitive methods to identify and genotype 129,166 high-confidence SVs from deep whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of 4,848 individuals. We tested the 64,572 common and low frequency SVs for association with 116 quantitative traits, and tested candidate associations using exome sequencing and array genotype data from an additional 15,205 individuals. We discovered 31 genome-wide significant associations at 15 loci, including two novel loci at which SVs have strong phenotypic effects: (1) a deletion of the ALB gene promoter that is greatly enriched in the Finnish population and causes decreased serum albumin level in carriers (p=1.47x10-54), and is also associated with increased levels of total cholesterol (p=1.22x10-28) and 14 additional cholesterol-related traits, and (2) a multiallelic copy number variant (CNV) at PDPR that is strongly associated with pyruvate (p=4.81x10-21) and alanine (p=6.14x10-12) levels and resides within a structurally complex genomic region that has accumulated many rearrangements over evolutionary time. We also confirmed six previously reported associations, including five led by stronger signals in single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and one linking recurrent HP gene deletion and cholesterol levels (p=6.24x10-10), which was also found to be strongly associated with increased glycoprotein level (p=3.53x10-35). Our study confirms that integrating SVs in trait-mapping studies will expand our knowledge of genetic factors underlying disease risk.",

    "abstract": "The UK Biobank (UKB) represents an unprecedented population-based study of 502,543 participants with detailed phenotypic data and linkage to medical records. While the release of genotyping array data for this cohort has bolstered genomic discovery for common variants, the contribution of rare variants to this broad phenotype collection remains relatively unknown. Here, we use exome sequencing data from 177,882 UKB participants to evaluate the association between rare protein-coding variants with 10,533 binary and 1,419 quantitative phenotypes. We performed both a variant-level phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) and a gene-level collapsing analysis-based PheWAS tailored to detecting the aggregate contribution of rare variants. The latter revealed 911 statistically significant gene-phenotype relationships, with a median odds ratio of 15.7 for binary traits. Among the binary trait associations identified using collapsing analysis, 83% were undetectable using single variant association tests, emphasizing the power of collapsing analysis to detect signal in the setting of high allelic heterogeneity. As a whole, these genotype-phenotype associations were significantly enriched for loss-of-function mediated traits and currently approved drug targets. Using these results, we summarise the contribution of rare variants to common diseases in the context of the UKB phenome and provide an example of how novel gene-phenotype associations can aid in therapeutic target prioritisation.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is a form of skin cancer originating from keratinocytes in the skin. It is the second most common type of cancer and is responsible for an estimated 8000 deaths per year in the United States. Compared to other cancer subtypes with similar incidences and death tolls, our understanding of the somatic mutations driving cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is limited. The main challenge is that these tumors have high mutation burdens, primarily a consequence of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage from sunlight, making it difficult to distinguish driver mutations from passenger mutations. We overcame this challenge by performing a meta-analysis of publicly available sequencing data covering 105 tumors from 10 different studies. Moreover, we eliminated tumors with issues, such as low neoplastic cell content, and from the tumors that passed quality control, we utilized multiple strategies to reveal genes under selection. In total, we nominated 30 cancer genes. Among the more novel genes, mutations frequently affected EP300, PBRM1, USP28, and CHUK. Collectively, mutations in the NOTCH and p53 pathways were ubiquitous, and to a lesser extent, mutations affected genes in the Hippo pathway, genes in the Ras/MAPK/PI3K pathway, genes critical for cell-cycle checkpoint control, and genes encoding chromatin remodeling factors. Taken together, our study provides a catalogue of driver genes in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, offering points of therapeutic intervention and insights into the biology of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOne-carbon metabolism is a metabolic network that integrates nutritional signals with biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and epigenetics. There are sex differences in hepatic one-carbon metabolism. However, it is unclear whether there are sex differences in dietary deficiencies of one-carbon metabolism in the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate if sex modulates the effects of dietary folic acid deficiency in brain tissue using a mouse model.\n\nMethodsMale and female C57Bl/6J mice were placed on a folic acid deficient (FD) or control diet (CD) at six weeks of age. Mice were maintained on these diets for six months, after which animals were euthanized and brain tissue and serum were collected for analysis. Serum folate levels were measured. In brain tissue, hippocampal volume and morphology including Cornu Ammonis 1 and 3 (CA1; CA3), and dentate gyrus thickness were measured. Apoptosis within the hippocampus was assessed using active caspase-3 immunofluorescence staining. Additionally, cortical acetylcholine metabolism was measured in brain tissue using immunofluorescence staining of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN).\n\nResultsMale and female FD mice had reduced serum levels of folate. Both males and females maintained on a FD showed a decrease in the thickness of the hippocampal CA1-CA3 region. Interestingly, there was a sex difference in the levels of active caspase-3 within the CA3 region of the hippocampus. In cortical tissue, there were increased levels of neuronal ChAT and reduced levels of AChE in FD females and male mice.\n\nConclusionsThe results indicated that FD impacts hippocampal morphology and cortical neuronal acetylcholine metabolism. The data from our study indicate that there was only one sex difference and that was in hippocampal apoptosis. Our study provides little evidence that sex modulates the effects of dietary folate deficiency on hippocampal morphology and cortical neuronal acetylcholine metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs, a.k.a. conjugative transposons) are mobile genetic elements that can move from one bacterial cell to another and often coexist in a host genome. Many bacterial species contain at least one temperate (lysogenic) phage and an integrative and conjugative element. Most strains of Bacillus subtilis are lysogenic for the phage SP{beta} and also contain the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1. We found that the presence of ICEBs1 in cells inhibited production of SP{beta}, during both activation of a lysogen and following de novo infection. The ICEBs1 gene yddK (renamed spbK for SP{beta} killing) was both necessary and sufficient for the anti-SP{beta} activity. Co-expression of spbK and yonE, in the absence of other ICEBs1 and SP{beta} genes, resulted in inhibition of cell growth and loss of cell viability. These results indicate that together spbK and yonE affected a host process needed for normal growth and that spbK constitutes an abortive infection system. We found that this anti-SP{beta} phenotype protected populations of B. subtilis from predation by SP{beta}, likely providing selective pressure for the maintenance of ICEBs1 in B. subtilis populations. spbK encodes a TIR (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor)-domain protein with similarity to both plant antiviral proteins and animal innate immune signaling proteins. We postulate that selective many uncharacterized cargo genes in ICEs may confer selective advantage to cells by protecting against other mobile elements.",

    "abstract": "Wetlands are among the most threatened habitats in the world, and so are their species, which suffer habitat loss due to climate and land use changes. Freshwater species and arthropods receive little attention in research and conservation, and the goals to stop and reverse the destruction of wetlands published 25 years ago in a manifesto by the Union of Concerned Scientists have not been reached. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and habitat requirements at two spatial scales of two species of European fishing spiders Dolomedes, which rely heavily on declining wetland habitats in Sweden and southern Norway.\n\nWe collected occurrence data for Dolomedes plantarius and Dolomedes fimbriatus, using a live-determination-method. We modelled the placement of nursery webs to describe fine scaled habitat requirements related to vegetation and microclimate. Using a machine learning approach, we described the habitat features for each species, and for co-occurrence sites, to provide insight into variables relevant for the detectability of Dolomedes.\n\nWe found that habitat requirements were narrower for D. plantarius compared to D. fimbriatus; that the detection of nursery webs can be affected by weather conditions and that nursery placement is mostly dependent on the proximity to water, the presence of Carex sp. (Sedges) and of crossing vegetation structures, and on humidity. Furthermore, co-occurring sites were more similar to D. plantarius sites than to D. fimbriatus sites, whereby surrounding forest, water type and velocity, elevation and latitude were of importance for explaining which species of Dolomedes was present.\n\nWe provide a detailed field protocol for Dolomedes studies, including a novel live-determination method, and recommendations for future field protocols.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis is a diploid species (2n = 20), the estimated haploid genome sizes of the female and male plants using flow cytometry are 818 and 843 Mb respectively. Although the genome of Cannabis has been sequenced (from hemp, wild and high-THC strains), all assemblies have significant gaps. In addition, there are inconsistencies in the chromosome numbering which limits their use. A new comprehensive draft genome sequence assembly (~900 Mb) has been generated from the medicinal cannabis strain Cannbio-2, that produces a balanced ratio of cannabidiol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol using long-read sequencing. The assembly was subsequently analysed for completeness by ordering the contigs into chromosome-scale pseudomolecules using a reference genome assembly approach, annotated and compared to other existing reference genome assemblies. The Cannbio-2 genome sequence assembly was found to be the most complete genome sequence available based on nucleotides assembled and BUSCO evaluation in Cannabis sativa with a comprehensive genome annotation. The new draft genome sequence is an advancement in Cannabis genomics permitting pan-genome analysis, genomic selection as well as genome editing.",
