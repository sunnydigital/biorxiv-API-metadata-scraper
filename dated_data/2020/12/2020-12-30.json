    "abstract": "Estrogen receptor alpha (ER/ESR1) is mutated in 30-40% of endocrine resistant ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer. ESR1 mutations cause ligand-independent growth and increased metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Despite the distinct clinical features and changes in therapeutic response associated with ESR1 mutations, there are no data about their potential role in intrinsic subtype switching. Applying four luminal and basal gene set pairs, ESR1 mutant cell models and clinical samples showed a significant enrichment of basal subtype markers. Among them, the six basal cytokeratins (BCKs) were the most enriched genes. Induction of BCKs was independent of ER binding and instead associated with chromatin reprogramming centered around a progesterone receptor-orchestrated topological associated domain at the KRT14/16/17 genomic region. Unexpectedly, high BCK expression in ER+ primary breast cancer is associated with good prognosis, and these tumors show enriched activation of a number of immune pathways, a distinctive feature shared with ESR1 mutant tumors. S100A8 and S100A9 were among the most highly induced immune mediators shared between high-BCKs ER+ and ESR1 mutant tumors, and single-cell RNA-seq analysis inferred their involvement in paracrine crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that ESR1 mutant tumors gain basal features with induction of basal cytokeratins via epigenetic mechanisms in rare subpopulation of cells. This is associated with increased immune activation, encouraging additional studies of immune therapeutic vulnerabilities in ESR1 mutant tumors.",

    "abstract": "Dache et al. (2020, FASEB J. 15, e2002338-15) recently reported the presence of respiratory-competent cell-free mitochondria in human blood (up to 3.7 x 106 per mL of blood), providing exciting perspectives on the potential role of these extra-cellular mitochondria. While their evidence for the presence of cell-free mitochondria in human blood is compelling, their conclusion that these cell-free mitochondria are respiratory-competent or functional has to be re-evaluated. To this end, we evaluated the functionality of cell-free mitochondria in human blood using high-resolution respirometry and mitochondria extracted from platelets of the same blood samples as positive controls. While cell-free mitochondria were present in human plasma (i.e. significant MitoTracker Green Fluorescence and complex IV activity), there was no evidence suggesting that their mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) was functional (i.e. respiration rate not significantly different from 0; no significant responses to ADP, uncoupler or mitochondrial inhibitors oligomycin and antimycin A). Yet, in vitro complex IV activity was detectable and even slightly higher than levels found in mitochondria extracted from platelets, suggesting that cell-free mitochondria in human blood are likely to only retain a non-functional part of the electron transport system. Despite being unlikely to be fully functional in the narrow-sense (i.e. capable of oxidative phosphorylation), circulating cell-free mitochondria may have significant physiological roles that remain to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Humans have elegant bodies that allow gymnastics, piano playing, and tool use, but understanding how they do this in detail is difficult because their musculoskeletal systems are extraordinarily complicated. Nonetheless, common movements like walking and reaching can be stereotypical, and a very large number of studies have shown their movement cost a major factor. In contrast, one might think that general movements are very individuated and intractable, but a recent study has shown that in an arbitrary set of whole-body movements used to trace large-scale closed curves, near-identical posture sequences were chosen across different subjects, both in the average trajectories of the bodys limbs and in the variance within trajectories. The commonalities in that result motivate explanations for its generality. One possibility could be that humans also choose trajectories that are economical in energetic cost. To test this hypothesis, we situate the tracing data within a fifty degree of freedom dynamic model of the human skeleton that allows the computation of movement cost. Comparing the model movement cost data from nominal tracings against various perturbed tracings shows that the latter are more energetically expensive, inferring that the original traces were chosen on the basis of minimum cost.",

    "abstract": "Advancing extensive cattle production shifts the forest landscape and is considered one of the main drivers against biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian Amazonia. Considering soil as an ecosystem it becomes vital to identify the effects of land-use changes on soil microbial communities, structure, as well as its ecological functions and services. Herein, we explored relationships between land-use, soil types and forest floor (i.e., association between litter, root layer and bulk soil) on the prokaryotic metacommunity structuring in the Western Amazonia. Sites under high anthropogenic pressure were evaluated along a gradient of {+/-} 800 km. Prokaryotic metacommunity are synergistically affected by soil types and land-use systems. Especially, the gradient of soil fertility and land-use shapes the structuring of the metacommunity and determines its composition. Forest-to-pasture conversion increases alpha, beta, and gamma diversities when considering only the prokaryotes from the bulk soil. Beta diversity was significantly higher in all forests when the litter and root layer were taken into account with the bulk soil. Our argumentation is that the forest floor harbors a prokaryotic metacommunity that adds at the regional scale of diversity a spatial turnover hitherto underestimated. Our findings highlight the risks of biodiversity loss and, consequently, the soil microbial diversity maintenance in tropical forests.",

We show further that the synthesis of the putative channel protein ComEC is translationally coupled to the upstream comEB open reading frame, so that translation of comEB and a suboptimal ribosomal binding site embedded in its sequence are needed for proper comEC expression. Translational coupling appears to be a common mechanism in three major competence operons for the adjustment of protein amounts independent of transcriptional control, probably ensuring the correct stoichiometries for assembly of the transformation machinery. comEB and comFC respectively encode cytidine deaminase and a protein resembling type 1 phosphoribosyl transferases and we speculate that nucleotide scavenging proteins are produced under competence control for efficient reutilization of the products of degradation of the non-transforming strand during DNA uptake.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant type of phospholipids in eukaryotes constituting ~30% of total lipids in Leishmania. PC synthesis mainly occurs via the choline branch of the Kennedy pathway (choline {Rightarrow} choline-phosphate {Rightarrow} CDP-choline {Rightarrow} PC) and the N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). In addition, Leishmania parasites can acquire PC and other lipids from the host or culture medium. In this study, we assessed the function and essentiality of choline ethanolamine phosphotransferase (CEPT) in Leishmania major which is responsible for the final step of the de novo synthesis of PC and PE. Our data indicate that CEPT is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and possesses the activity to generate PC from CDP-choline and diacylglycerol. Targeted deletion of CEPT is only possible in the presence of an episomal CEPT gene in the promastigote stage of L. major. These chromosomal null parasites require the episomal expression of CEPT to survive in culture, confirming its essentiality during the promastigote stage. In contrast, during in vivo infection of BALB/c mice, these chromosomal null parasites appeared to lose the episomal copy of CEPT while maintaining normal levels of virulence, replication and cellular PC. Therefore, while the de novo synthesis of PC/PE is indispensable for the proliferation of promastigotes, intracellular amastigotes appear to acquire most of their lipids through salvage and remodeling.",

However, there is currently not enough information to establish a clear connection between the genetic model(s) proposed and the putative genes involved in the differentiation between colors. In this study, 18 cDNA libraries related to the spathe color and developmental stages of A. andraeanum cut-flowers were characterized by transcriptome sequencing technology. For the de novo transcriptome, a total of 114,334,082 primary sequence reads were obtained from the Illumina sequencer and were assembled into 151,652 unigenes. Approximately 58,476 transcripts were generated and used for comparative transcriptome analysis between three varieties that differ in spathe color ( Sasha (white),  Honduras (red), and  Rapido (purple)). A large number of differentially expressed genes (8,324) that were potentially involved in multiple biological and metabolic pathways were identified, including the flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways. Our results showed that chalcone synthase (CHS) and flavonoid 3-hydroxylase (F3H) were the main genes differentially expressed in the white/red/purple comparison. We also identified a differentially expressed cytochrome P450 in the late developmental stage of the purple spathe that appeared to determine the difference between the red- and purple-colored spathes. Additionally, putative MYB-domain protein candidates that could be responsible for the control of the biosynthetic pathway were identified.

    "abstract": "[WORKING DRAFT] In order to relate health and disease to brain state, patterns of activity in the brain must be phenotyped. In this regard, polysomnography datasets present both an opportunity and a challenge, as although sleep data are extensive and multidimensional, features of the sleep EEG are known to correlate with clinical outcomes. Machine learning methods for rank reduction are attractive means for bringing the phenotyping problem to a manageable size. The whole-night power spectrogram is nonnegative, and so applying nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to separate spectrograms into time and frequency factors is a natural choice for dimension reduction. However, NMF converges differently depending on initial conditions, and there is no guarantee that factors obtained from one individual will be comparable with those from another, hampering inter-individual analysis.\n\nWe therefore reseed time-frequency NMF with group frequency factors obtained from the entire sample. This \"refactorization\" extends classical frequency bands to frequency factors. The group reseeding procedure coerces factors into equivalence classes, making them comparable across individuals. By comparing frequency factor properties, we illustrate age-related effects on the sleep EEG. The procedure can presumably be adapted to higher resolutions, e.g. to local field potential datasets, for characterizing individual time-frequency events.",

The curve of BPND of the ventral striatum went up and down at BMI of 20-30 kg/m2 and became flat after a BMI of >40 kg/m2. Linear regression analysis was performed with BPND of the striatum from two studies (n = 20). The BPND of the striatum was negatively associated with BMI. In conclusion, dopamine plays a major role in the reward system with regard to obesity. Compared to normal-weight subjects, overweight and obese subjects had decreased DR availability.

    "abstract": "For centuries, students have been taught by passively listening to lectures, usually in large groups. In many fields, this type of course delivery is not ideal. In addition, students that have grown up with online access and/or have been forced to take online course during the recent pandemic, are seeking improved online educational experiences. As providers of education, Universities must adapt to this rapidly changing environment. The emergence of exciting, \"disruptive\" technologies has provided the tools needed for educators to revolutionize the delivery of higher education. The University of Florida, through UF Online, provides students the opportunity to enroll in fully online four-year undergraduate degrees. In this report, we describe the development of fully online laboratories for the upper-division course Evolutionary Developmental Biology, which fulfill the University of Floridas laboratory requirement. This course is taken by Biology, Zoology, and related majors, including majors in the 100% online Biology degree. The experiments in the virtual laboratories would have been impossible to teach in a residential setting due to time constraints, cost, student safety issues, and regulatory/certification requirements. The ability to perform these experiments online provided University of Florida undergraduates located throughout the world access to unique, one-of-a-kind laboratory experiences. The virtual laboratories allowed students to undertake in-depth exploration and application of course content that is not possible in a residential setting. Completion of the Evolutionary Developmental Biology course provided undergraduate students the opportunity to obtain a science degree without ever visiting the universitys residential campus. During the Fall 2020 term, this course was made available to residential students, thus allowing this cohort of students to continue to make progress, 100% online, towards their undergraduate degree during the COVID19 pandemic.",

The effects of methods to correct VL only, HL only, or both VL and HL in patients with involutional entropion were compared using the published results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\nTo find RCT studies that investigated methods to correct involutional entropion, a systematic search was performed from database inception to April 2020 in the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Two independent researchers conducted the literature selection and data extraction. Evaluation of the quality of the reports was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias (ROB 2.0). The data analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines using Review Manager 5.3.\n\nTwo RCT studies were included in this meta-analysis. Surgery for involutional entropion was performed on a total of 109 eyes. Everting sutures (ES) were used on 57 eyes and lateral tarsal strips (LTS) or combined procedures (LTS + ES) were performed on 52 eyes. At the end of the follow-up periods, involutional entropion recurred in 18 eyes (31.6%) in the ES group and three eyes (5.8%) in the LTS +/- ES group. Analysis of the risk ratio showed that the LTS +/- ES method significantly lowered the recurrence rate compared to using ES only (P = 0.007).\n\nPerforming LTS +/- ES effectively lowered the recurrence rate of involutional entropion compared to ES alone. However, some patients cannot tolerate more invasive corrections such as LTS. Therefore, sequential procedures, in which ES is performed first and then when entropion recurs LTS +/- ES is performed, or another methods depending upon the degree of HL may be used.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe molecular mechanisms of the degeneration of the aortic wall in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are poorly understood. The monomeric form of C-reactive protein (mCRP) is deposited in damaged cardiovascular organs and aggravates the prognosis; however, it is unknown whether mCRP is deposited in the degenerated aorta of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We investigated whether mCRP is deposited in AAA and examined the associated pathogenic signaling pathways.\n\nMethodsTwenty-four cases of AAA were analyzed and their histological features were compared according to the level of serum CRP and the degree of mCRP deposition. Proteomic analysis was performed in AAA cases with strong and diffuse CRP immunopositivity (n=7) and those with weak, focal, and junctional CRP immunopositivity (n=3).\n\nResultsmCRP was deposited in the aortic specimens of AAA in a characteristic pattern that coincided with the lesion of the diminished elastic layer of the aortic wall. High serum CRP level was associated with stronger mCRP immunopositivity and a larger maximal diameter of aortic aneurysm. Proteomic analysis in AAA showed that multiple proteins were differentially expressed according to mCRP immunopositivity. Also, ingenuity pathway analysis showed that pathways associated with atherosclerosis, acute phase response, complement system, immune system, and coagulation were enriched in AAA cases with high mCRP immunopositivity.\n\nConclusionsAAA showed a characteristic deposition of mCRP, and multiple potentially pathologic signaling pathways were upregulated in AAA cases with strong CRP immunopositivity. mCRP and the aforementioned pathological pathways may serve as targets for managing the progression of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are crucial mediators of synaptic plasticity due to their ability to act as coincidence detectors of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal activity. However, NMDARs exist within the molecular context of a variety of postsynaptic signaling proteins, which can fine-tune their function. Here we describe a novel form of NMDAR suppression by large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ (BK) channels in the basal dendrites of a subset of barrel cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We show that NMDAR activation increases intracellular Ca2+ in the vicinity of BK channels, thus activating K+ efflux and strong negative feedback inhibition. We further show that neurons exhibiting such NMDAR-BK coupling serve as high-pass filters for incoming synaptic inputs, precluding the induction of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Together, these data suggest that NMDAR-localized BK channels regulate synaptic integration and provide input-specific synaptic diversity to a thalamocortical circuit.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes regulate the formation and function of neuronal synapses via multiple signals, however, what controls regional and temporal expression of these signals during development is unknown. We determined the expression profile of astrocyte synapse-regulating genes in the developing mouse visual cortex, identifying astrocyte signals that show differential temporal and layer-enriched expression. These patterns are not intrinsic to astrocytes, but regulated by visually-evoked neuronal activity, as they are absent in mice lacking glutamate release from thalamocortical terminals. Consequently, synapses remain immature. Expression of synapse-regulating genes and synaptic development are also altered when astrocyte signaling is blunted by diminishing calcium release from astrocyte stores. Single nucleus RNA sequencing identified groups of astrocytic genes regulated by neuronal and astrocyte activity, and a cassette of genes that show layer-specific enrichment. Thus, the development of cortical circuits requires coordinated signaling between astrocytes and neurons, identifying astrocytes as a target to manipulate in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Explanations for the evolution of monogamy in mammals typically emphasise one of two possibilities: monogamy evolves when females are overdispersed (such that males cannot defend more than one female at a time) or when males provide a service to the female. However, the first claim has never been directly tested. I test it directly at three levels using data from primates and ungulates. First, I show that the females of monogamous genera do not have territories that are significantly larger, either absolutely or relatively, than those of polygamous genera. Second, using both the Mitani-Rodman and Lowen-Dunbar inequalities, I show that, given their typical day journey lengths, males of most monogamous species could easily defend an area large enough to allow them to monopolise as many as 5-10 females if these ranged solitarily. Finally, I use a model of male mate searching strategies to show that, unlike the males of socially-living polygamous species, the opportunity cost that monogamous males incur is typically more than five times the reproductive success they have by being obligately monogamous. This suggests that the selection pressure dissuading them from pursuing a roving male strategy must be very considerable.",

    "abstract": "Shank3 monogenic mutations lead to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Shank3 is part of the glutamate receptosome that physically links ionotropic NMDA receptors to metabotropic mGlu5 receptors through interactions with scaffolding proteins PSD95-GKAP-Shank3-Homer. A main physiological function of the glutamate receptosome is to control NMDA synaptic function that is required for plasticity induction. Intact glutamate receptosome supports glutamate receptors activation and plasticity induction, while glutamate receptosome disruption blocks receptors activity, preventing the induction of subsequent plasticity. Despite possible impact on metaplasticity and cognitive behaviors, scaffold interaction dynamics and their consequences are poorly defined. Here we used mGlu5-Homer interaction as a biosensor of glutamate receptosome integrity to report changes of NMDA synaptic function. Combining BRET imaging and electrophysiology, we show that a transient neuronal depolarization inducing NMDA-dependent plasticity disrupts glutamate receptosome in a long-lasting manner at synapses and induces signaling required for the expression of the initiated neuronal plasticity such as ERK and mTOR pathways. Glutamate receptosome disruption also decreases NMDA/AMPA currents ratio, freezing the sensitivity of the synapse to subsequent changes of neuronal activity. These data show the importance of a fine-tuning of protein-protein interactions within glutamate receptosome, driven by changes of neuronal activity, to control plasticity. In a mouse model of ASD, a truncated mutant form of Shank3 prevents the integrity of the glutamate receptosome. These mice display altered plasticity, anxiety-like and stereotyped behaviors. Interestingly, repairing the integrity of glutamate receptosome and its sensitivity to the neuronal activity rescued synaptic transmission, plasticity and some behavioral traits of Shank3{triangleup}C mice. Altogether, our findings characterize mechanisms by which Shank3 mutations cause ASD and highlight scaffold dynamics as new therapeutic target.",
