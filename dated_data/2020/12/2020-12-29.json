    "abstract": "Template-based modeling (TBM), including homology modeling and protein threading, is one of the most reliable techniques for protein structure prediction. It predicts protein structure by building an alignment between the query sequence under prediction and the templates with solved structures. However, it is still very challenging to build the optimal sequence-template alignment, especially when only distantly-related templates are available. Here we report a novel deep learning approach ProALIGN that can predict much more accurate sequence-template alignment. Like protein sequences consisting of sequence motifs, protein alignments are also composed of frequently-occurring alignment motifs with characteristic patterns. Alignment motifs are context-specific as their characteristic patterns are tightly related to sequence contexts of the aligned regions. Inspired by this observation, we represent a protein alignment as a binary matrix (in which 1 denotes an aligned residue pair) and then use a deep convolutional neural network to predict the optimal alignment from the query protein and its template. The trained neural network implicitly but effectively encodes an alignment scoring function, which reduces inaccuracies in the handcrafted scoring functions widely used by the current threading approaches. For a query protein and a template, we apply the neural network to directly infer likelihoods of all possible residue pairs in their entirety, which could effectively consider the correlations among multiple residues. We further construct the alignment with maximum likelihood, and finally build structure model according to the alignment.\n\nTested on three independent datasets with in total 6,688 protein alignment targets and 80 CASP13 TBM targets, our method achieved much better alignments and 3D structure models than the existing methods including HHpred, CNFpred, CEthreader and DeepThreader. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting the context-specific alignment motifs by deep learning for protein threading.",

Recent studies have revealed that C1q/CTRP1 can regulate metabolism and inhibit inflammation. CTRP1 is also expressed in brain tissues and vascular cells of human and rat, and research on cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury demonstrates that the CTRP family can attenuate secondary brain injury and exert neuroprotective effects. Thus, this study was designed to explore the role of CTRP1 in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the underlying mechanism.\n\nMain methodsRats were assigned into rCTRP1 group, vehicle group, and sham group. Modified Feeneys method was used to establish a closed traumatic brain injury model. Morris water maze was used for directional navigation, reverse searching and space exploration tests in rats. In addition, Golgi-Cox staining was utilized to visualize neurons, dendrites and dendritic spines. ELISA was conducted to detect the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-). Finally, Western blot was adopted to detect the relative expression of p-mTOR and autophagy-related proteins (Beclin-1 and LC3-II).\n\nResultsCTRP1 improved the behavioral and histopathological outcomes, inhibited the inflammatory response, activated mTOR and decreased autophagy-associated protein synthesis in TBI rats.\n\nConclusionCTRP1 exerts neuroprotective effects in TBI rats by regulating inflammation and autophagy and has potential therapeutic properties after TBI.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe objective of the investigation was to determine the concomitant effects of upper arm blood flow restriction (BFR) and inversion on elbow flexors neuromuscular responses.\n\nMethodsRandomly allocated, 13 volunteers performed four conditions in a within-subject design: rest (control, 1-min upright position without BFR), control (1-min upright with BFR), 1-min inverted (without BFR), and 1-min inverted with BFR. Evoked and voluntary contractile properties, before, during and after a 30-s maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) exercise intervention were examined as well as pain scale.\n\nResultsInversion induced significant pre-exercise intervention decreases in elbow flexors MVC (21.1%, [Formula], p=0.02) and resting evoked twitch (29.4%, [Formula], p=0.03) forces. The 30-s MVC induced significantly greater pre- to post-test decreases in potentiated twitch force ([Formula], p<0.0009) during inversion ({downarrow}75%) than upright ({downarrow}65.3%) conditions. Overall, BFR decreased MVC force 4.8% ([Formula], p=0.05). For upright position, BFR induced 21.0% reductions in M-wave amplitude ([Formula], p=0.04). There were no significant differences for electromyographic activity or voluntary activation as measured with the interpolated twitch technique. For all conditions, there was a significant increase in pain scale between the 40-60 s intervals and post-30-s MVC (upright<inversion, and without BFR<BFR).\n\nConclusionThe concomitant application of inversion with elbow flexors BFR only amplified neuromuscular performance impairments to a small degree. Individuals who execute forceful contractions when inverted or with BFR should be cognizant that force output may be impaired.",

To overcome these challenges, operational and outcome-oriented tools that enable animal health and human health services to work specifically on their collaboration are required. While international capacity and assessment frameworks such as the IHR-MEF (International Health Regulations - Monitoring and Evaluation Framework) and the OIE PVS (Performance of Veterinary Services) Pathway exist, a tool and process that could assess and strengthen the interactions between human and animal health sectors was needed. Through a series of six phased pilots, the IHR-PVS National Bridging Workshop (NBW) method was developed and refined. The NBW process gathers human and animal health stakeholders and follows seven sessions, scheduled across three days. The outputs from each session build towards the next one, following a structured process that goes from gap identification to joint planning of corrective measures. The NBW process allows human and animal health sector representatives to jointly identify actions that support collaboration while advancing evaluation goals identified through the IHR-MEF and the OIE PVS Pathway. By integrating sector-specific and collaborative goals, the NBWs help countries in creating a realistic, concrete and practical joint road map for enhanced compliance to international standards as well as strengthened preparedness and response for health security at the human-animal interface.",

A variety of plant enzymes involved in caffeine synthesis have been characterized in vitro and several of these methylxanthine synthesis enzymes have been heterologously-expressed in yeast or bacteria. In this work, enzymes from Coffea arabica, Camellia sinensis, and Paullinia cupana have been heterologously-expressed in human cells. We demonstrate that the enzymes tested exhibit similar patterns of activity with a set of xanthine substrates in human cells when compared to previous reports of in vitro activity. We demonstrate that the activity of these enzymes can be used as a reporter for juxtacrine signaling using synNotch-induced expression in the presence of an appropriate substrate. When used in combination with synthetic caffeine receptors, this work has potential for use as an in vivo reporter (e.g. enabling non-invasive monitoring of cell-cell interactions after a cellular transplant) or in synthetic intercellular signaling a methylxanthine, such as caffeine, acting as a synthetic paracrine hormone.",

    "abstract": "Though Common carp is one of the most widely cultured species in Nepal, there is insufficient supply of fry and fingerlings of common carp. Therefore, the study was conducted with the objective to observe the breeding performance, survival and growth of common carp. Two consecutive experiments were conducted during February to May 2020. First experiment was conducted in four nursery ponds having same area (30mx17m) to observe the breeding performance and growth of hatchlings. 24 kakabans were kept in each pond and brood females and males were released in each pond in a ratio of 1:2 (female: male) i.e. 7 female and 14 male. Each brood fishes were injected with Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH A2) @ 2{micro}g/kg body weight for female and @ 1{micro}g/kg body weight to male for induced breeding of common carp. The experimental duration was of 36 days. Second experiment was also conducted in 4 nursery ponds having same area (30mx15m) to observe the survival of fry and the experimental duration was of 50 days. There was no significant difference in water quality parameters (p>0.05) and feeding among the research ponds during the culture period. Water quality parameters were measured on weekly basis. Periodic samplings were done to evaluate the daily weight gain, specific growth rate, survival rate and change in water quality parameters. The average weight gain, daily weight gain and specific growth rate of hatchlings were 0.54 g, 0.02 g/fish/day and 12.16%/day respectively. Similarly the average weight gain, daily weight gain and specific growth rate of fry were 20.43g, 0.41g/fish/day and 7.32%/day respectively. And the average survival rate of common carp fry in fish farm of Dhanusha was 47% at stocking density of 56, 000/ha. Through induced breeding process, the average number of fry produced from 7female having average total weight 19 kg and 14 male having average total weight 28 kg was 1, 38,750.",

    "abstract": "Problems of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) that increased and escalated in the last 40 years seem to be related to one or more aggressive biotypes that appeared to spread steadily worldwide. As well, some biological characteristics of B. tabaci have led some entomologists to change and multiply their methodology to update with the change in the pest genetic structures. This study is the 1st of its kind in Qassim region in KSA in respect of B. tabaci biotypes. Four identification methods (Squash Silverleaf Symptoms (SSL), cross mating, Cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences, and ISSR-PCR analysis) were carried out to determine the biotypes of B. tabaci at Qassim regions. Slight SSL symptoms were observed with varying degrees on squash leaves caused by B. tabaci population at Qassim, KSA. Cross-mating among the populations that have the same or similar genetic structures produced fertilized offspring, females and males with higher sex ratios in favor of females, and produced a higher number of eggs. Whereas, B. tabaci populations that varied greatly in their genetic structures produced unfertilized eggs, which produce males only. In the same trend, ISSR-PCR analysis revealed that B. tabaci populations at Qassim regions varied genetically and gathered into four genetic groups. In conclusion, COI analysis is a perfect tool for classification between biotypes in B. tabaci. Therefore, this study declares that B. tabaci that colonized and infest Qassim horticulture has not the same genetic structures but belonging to B biotypes. It could be named as Bemisia species complex.",

Existing methods pose motion constraints, require expert annotation, or are only applicable in laboratory conditions. Using novel computer-vision technologies, we implement a fully-automatic appearance-based method that estimates the registration parameters of a mounted cap to the scalp from a raw video of the subject. We validate our method on 10 adult subjects and demonstrate its usability with infants. We compare our method to the standard 3D digitizer, and to other photogrammetry based approaches. We show our method achieves comparable accuracy to current appearance-based methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. Our fast registration facilitates more spatially precise fNIRS analysis with developmental populations even in unconventional environments.

    "abstract": "Native chickens are dispersed in a wide range of geometry and they have influenced hereditary assets that are kept by farmers for various purposes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a widely utilized marker in molecular study because of its quick advancement, matrilineal legacy, and simple molecular structure. In a genomics study, it is important for understanding the origins, history, and adjustment of domestication. In this report, for the first time, we utilized Next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate the mitochondrial genomes and to evaluate the hereditary connections, diversity, and measure of gene stream estimation in seven Indian native chicken breeds along with twenty-two Asian native breeds. The absolute length of each mtDNA was 16775bp harboring 4 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, 12 protein-coding genes, and 1 D-loop region. The chicken breeds were genotyped by using the D-loop region and 23 haplotypes were identified. In addition, when compared to only Indian native breeds more haplotypes were identified in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit (ND4 and ND5), Cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COXI and COXII), Cytochrome b, mitochondrial encoded ATP synthase membrane subunit 6, and Ribosomal RNA genes. The phylogenetic examination utilizing N-J computational algorithms indicated that the analyzed all native chicken breeds were divided into six significant clades: A, B, C, D, E, and F. All Indian native breeds are coming under the F clade and it says all Indian breeds are domesticated in India. Besides, the sequencing results effectively distinguished SNPs, INDELs, mutations, and variants in seven Indian native breeds. Additionally, our work affirmed that Indian Red Jungle Fowl is the origin of reference Red Jungle Fowl as well as all Indian breeds, which is reflected in the dendrogram as well as network analysis based on whole mtDNA and D-loop region. Albeit, Indian Red Jungle Fowl is distributed as an outgroup, proposing that this ancestry was reciprocally monophyletic. The seven Indian native chickens of entire mtDNA sequencing and disclosure of variations gave novel insights about adaptation mechanisms and the significance of important mtDNA variations in understanding the maternal lineages of native chickens.",

    "abstract": "Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes could set the stage for individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. While value-based decision making processes in particular have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences, the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often show variable or minimal differences across sexes. Computational tools allow us to uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. Here, we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless 2-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get \"stuck\" in exploration once they had started. Female mice tended to explore less, but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.",
