    "abstract": "Animal personality is considered to be developed through complex interactions of an individual with its surrounding environment. How can we quantify the  personality of an individual? Quantifying intra- and inter-individual variability of behavior, or individual behavioral type, appears to be a prerequisite in the study of animal personality. We propose a statistical method from a predictive point of view to measure the appropriateness of our assumption of  individual behavior in repeatedly measured behavioral data from several individuals. For a model case, we studied the sponge crab Lauridromia dehaani known to make and carry a  cap from a natural sponge for camouflage. Because a cap is most likely to be rebuilt and replaced repeatedly, we hypothesized that each individual crab would grow a unique behavioral type and it would be observed under an experimentally controlled environmental condition. To test the hypothesis, we conducted behavioral experiments and employed a new Bayesian model-based comparison method to examine whether crabs have individual behavioral types in the cap making behavior. Crabs were given behavioral choices by using artificial sponges of three different sizes. We modeled the choice of sponges, size of the trimmed part of a cap, size of the cavity of a cap, and the latency to produce a cap, as random variables in 26 models, including hierarchical models specifying the behavioral types. In addition, we calculated the marginal-level widely applicable information criterion (mWAIC) values for hierarchical models to evaluate and compared them with the non-hierarchical models from the predictive point of view. As a result, the crabs of less than about 9 cm in size were found to make caps from the sponges. The body size explained the behavioral variables namely, choice, trimmed cap characteristics, and cavity size, but not latency. Furthermore, we captured the behavioral type as a probabilistic distribution structure of the behavioral data by comparing WAIC. Our statistical approach is not limited to behavioral data but is also applicable to physiological or morphological data when examining whether some group structure exists behind fluctuating empirical data.",

In three populations (college students, patients with a substance use disorder, and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers), we evaluated one such method, Bayesian adaptive design optimization (ADO), in the area of delay discounting by comparing its test-retest reliability, precision, and efficiency with that of a conventional staircase method. In all three populations tested, the results showed that ADO led to 0.95 or higher test-retest reliability of the discounting rate within 10-20 trials (under 1-2 minutes of testing), captured approximately 10% more variance in test-retest reliability, was 3-5 times more precise, and was 3-8 times more efficient than the staircase method. The ADO methodology provides efficient and precise protocols for measuring individual differences in delay discounting.",

    "abstract": "We analysed the genomic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity using magnetic resonance imaging and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from >26,000 individuals from the UK Biobank project and 5 other projects that had previously participated in the ENIGMA consortium. Our results confirm the polygenic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity, with SNPs capturing from 40% to 54% of regional brain volume variance. Chromosomal length correlated with the amount of phenotypic variance captured, r[~]0.64 on average, suggesting that at a global scale causal variants are homogeneously distributed across the genome. At a local scale, SNPs within genes ([~]51%) captured [~]1.5 times more genetic variance than the rest; and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF) captured less variance than the rest: the 40% of SNPs with MAF<5% captured <1/4th of the genetic variance. We also observed extensive pleiotropy across regions, with an average genetic correlation of rG[~]0.45. Genetic correlations were similar to phenotypic and environmental correlations, however, genetic correlations were often larger than phenotypic correlations for the left/right volumes of the same region. The heritability of differences in left/right volumes was generally not statistically significant, suggesting an important influence of environmental causes in the variability of brain asymmetry.

    "abstract": "The neurobehavioral mechanisms of human motor-control and learning evolved in free behaving, real-life settings, yet this is studied mostly in reductionistic lab-based experiments. Here we take a step towards a more real-world motor neuroscience using wearables for naturalistic full-body motion-tracking and the sports of pool billiards to frame a real-world skill learning experiment. First, we asked if well-known features of motor learning in lab-based experiments generalize to a real-world task. We found similarities in many features such as multiple learning rates, and the relationship between task-related variability and motor learning. Our data-driven approach reveals the structure and complexity of movement, variability, and motor-learning, enabling an in-depth understanding of the structure of motor learning in three ways: First, while expecting most of the movement learning is done by the cue-wielding arm, we find that motor-learning affects the whole body, changing motor-control from head to toe. Second, during learning, all subjects decreased their movement variability and their variability in the outcome. Subjects who were initially more variable were also more variable after learning. Lastly, when screening the link across subjects between initial variability in individual joints and learning, we found that only the initial variability in the right forearm supination shows a significant correlation to the subjects learning rates. This is in-line with the relationship between learning and variability: while learning leads to an overall reduction in movement variability, only initial variability in specific task-relevant dimensions can facilitate faster learning.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems such as intracellular metabolism are rationally regulated to maximize the cellular growth rate through evolution (1-4), whereas microeconomics investigates the behaviour of consumers assumed to rationally maximize their utility (5, 6). Despite this analogy as optimization problems, the link between biology and economics has not been fully established (7, 8). Here, we developed an exact mapping between the regulation of metabolism and the theory of consumer choice, thereby revealing the correspondence between long-standing mysteries in both fields: overflow metabolism and Giffen behaviour. Overflow metabolism, particularly known as the Warburg effect in cancer (9, 10), is a seemingly wasteful but ubiquitous strategy where cells utilize aerobic glycolysis instead of the more energetically-efficient oxidative phosphorylation (9-16), whereas Giffen behaviour is the unexpected consumer behaviour where a good is demanded more as its price rises (17, 18). We revealed that the general conditions for these phenomena are trade-off and complementarity, i.e., impossibility of substitution for different goods. This correspondence implies that oxidative phosphorylation is counterintuitively stimulated when its efficiency is decreased by metabolic perturbations like drug administration. Therefore, Giffen behaviour bridges the Warburg effect and the reverse and inverse Warburg effect (19-22). This highlights that application of microeconomics to metabolism can offer new predictions and paradigms for both biology and economics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Developmental Origins of Adult Disease (DOAD) theory predicts that prenatal and early life events shape adult health outcomes. Birth weight is a useful indicator of the foetal experience, and has been associated with multiple adult health outcomes. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one plausible mechanism behind the relationship of birth weight to adult health.\n\nMethodsThe Generation Scotland study allows data linkage to historic Scottish birth cohorts, and birth records held through the NHS Information and Statistics Division. Data linkage with these sources yielded a sample of 4, 710 individuals. Health measures were related to birth weight in regression models. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed in a subgroup (n=1, 395), relating adult DNAm from whole blood to birth weight, with replication in an independent sample (n=362). Associations between birth weight and epigenetic clocks were also assessed.\n\nFindingsHigher birth weight was significantly associated with reduced incidence of depression and osteoarthritis, higher body mass index, and higher general intelligence (absolute standardised effect size range 0{middle dot}04 to 0{middle dot}30, p(FDR)<0{middle dot}05). Meta-analysis of discovery and replication EWAS studies yielded one genome-wide significant CpG site (p=5{middle dot}97x10-9), cg00966482. Significant associations between birth weight and Grim Age (p=0{middle dot}0014) and DNAm-derived telomere length (p=3{middle dot}3x10-4) are also described.\n\nInterpretationOur results demonstrate associations between birth weight and adult health outcomes, with particularly striking effects for depression risk. It also provides support for an association between birth weight and DNAm, describing the first significant EWAS site associated with birth weight in an adult sample.\n\nFundingWellcome Trust Strategic Award 104036/Z/14/Z\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe associations between birth weight and various adult health outcomes have been well established. DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which early life experiences may continue to affect health throughout the lifecourse; however, evidence for birth weight associations with DNA methylation in adulthood has not yet been robustly established. This is likely due to small sample sizes of previous samples, as well as the use of poor-quality birth weight data, such as binary  low/normal variables or retrospective self-report. Alternatively, work has attempted to describe the persistence into adulthood of DNA methylation at sites identified at birth.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe investigated genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns from whole blood using data linkage-derived, continuous birth weight data, in the largest reported adult sample (n=1, 395) with replication (n=362) and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed one epigenome-wide significant CpG site, to our knowledge the first significant EWAS result reported for birth weight in a an adult sample. In addition, we found associations between birth weight and GrimAge and a DNA methylation-derived measure of telomere length, demonstrating accelerated biological ageing in lower birth weight individuals. Together, these results suggest differential methylation exists in adulthood related to birth weight, and this may be relevant to health and mortality.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAlthough CpG sites differentially methylated with birth weight at parturition may not remain so throughout life, the adult epigenome may still provide information on the impact of birth weight on health outcomes. The adult epigenome, therefore, may represent a useful archive of the foetal experience which results in birth weight variability, and this information may provide clinically useful information in mid-life.",

    "abstract": "Theories of learning distinguish between elemental and configural stimulus processing depending on whether stimuli are processed independently or as whole configurations. Evidence for elemental processing comes from findings of summation in animals where a compound of two dissimilar stimuli is deemed to be more predictive than each stimulus alone, whereas configural processing is supported by experiments employing similar stimuli in which summation is not found. However, in humans the summation effect is robust and impervious to similarity manipulations. In three experiments in human predictive learning, we show that summation can be obliterated when partially reinforced cues are added to the summands in training and test. This lack of summation only holds when the partially reinforced cues are similar to the reinforced cues (Experiment 1) and seems to depend on participants sampling only the most salient cue in each trial (Experiments 2a and 2b) in a sequential visual search process. Instead of attributing our and others instances of lack of summation to the customary idea of configural processing, we offer a formal sub-sampling rule that might be applied to situations in which the stimuli are hard to parse from each other.",

Genome-wide maps of epigenomic marks and transcription factor binding provide complementary information for interpreting a subset of such prioritized variants. Here we developed the Constrained Non-Exonic Predictor (CNEP) to quantify the evidence of each base in the human genome being in a constrained non-exonic element from over 60,000 epigenomic and transcription factor binding features. We find that the CNEP score outperforms baseline and related existing scores at predicting constrained non-exonic bases from such data. However, a subset of such bases are still not well predicted by CNEP. We developed a complementary Conservation Signature Score by CNEP (CSS-CNEP) using conservation state and constrained element annotations that is predictive of those bases. Using human genetic variation, regulatory sequence motifs, mouse epigenomic data, and retrospectively considered additional human data we further characterize the nature of constrained non-exonic bases with low CNEP scores.",

While our understanding of the mechanisms controlling morphogenesis and neurogenesis in these structures has grown, how these processes are coordinated remains largely unexplored. Neurogenesis in the zebrafish olfactory epithelium requires the bHLH proneural transcription factor Neurogenin1 (Neurog1). To address whether Neurog1 also controls morphogenesis in this system, we analysed the morphogenetic behaviour of early olfactory neural progenitors in neurog1 mutant embryos. Our results indicate that the oriented movements of these progenitors are disrupted in this context. Morphogenesis is similarly affected by mutations in the chemokine receptor gene, cxcr4b, suggesting it is a potential Neurog1 target gene. We find that Neurog1 directly regulates cxcr4b through an E-boxes cluster located just upstream of the cxcr4b transcription start site. Our results suggest that proneural transcription factors, such as Neurog1, directly couple distinct aspects of nervous system development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryNeurog1 controls olfactory organ morphogenesis via cxcr4b",

    "abstract": "Visual processing in parietal areas of the dorsal stream facilitates sensorimotor transformations for rapid movement. This action-related visual processing is hypothesized to play a distinct functional role from the perception-related processing in the ventral stream. However, it is unclear how the two streams interact when perceptual identification is a prerequisite to executing an accurate movement. In the current study, we investigated how perceptual decision-making involving the ventral stream influences arm and eye movement strategies. Participants (N = 26) moved a robotic manipulandum using right whole-arm movements to rapidly reach a stationary object or intercept a moving object on an augmented-reality display. On some blocks of trials, participants needed to identify the shape of the object (circle or ellipse) as a cue to either hit the object (circle) or move to a pre-defined location away from the object (ellipse). We found that during perceptual decision-making, there was an increased urgency to act during interception movements relative to reaching, which was associated with more decision errors. Faster hand reaction times were correlated with a strategy to adjust the movement post-initiation, and this strategy was more prominent during interception. Saccadic reaction times were faster and initial gaze lags and gains greater during decisions, suggesting that eye movements adapt to perceptual demands for guiding limb movements. Together, our findings suggest that the integration of ventral stream information with visuomotor planning depends on imposed (or perceived) task demands.\n\nNew and NoteworthyVisual processing for perception and for action are thought to be mediated by two specialized neural pathways. Using a visuomotor decision-making task, we show that participants differentially utilized online perceptual decision-making in reaching and interception, and that eye movements necessary for perception influenced motor decision strategies. These results provide evidence that task complexity modulates how pathways processing perception versus action information interact during the visual control of movement.",

Despite large-scale case-control studies aimed at identifying microbial taxa or specific genes involved in pathogeneses, the mechanisms linking them to disease have thus far remained elusive. To identify potential mechanisms through which human-associated bacteria impact host health, we leveraged publicly-available interspecies protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to find clusters of microbiome-derived proteins with high sequence identity to known human protein interactors. We observe differential targeting of putative human-interacting bacterial genes in metagenomic case-control microbiome studies. In nine independent case studies, we find evidence that the microbiome broadly targets human proteins involved in immune, oncogenic, apoptotic, and endocrine signaling pathways in relation to IBD, CRC, obesity and T2D diagnoses. This host-centric analysis strategy provides a mechanistic hypothesis-generating platform for any metagenomics cohort study and extensively adds human functional annotation to commensal bacterial proteins.\n\nOne-sentence summaryMicrobiome-derived proteins are linked to disease-associated human pathways by metagenomic and protein-protein interaction analyses.",

    "abstract": "Memory is typically thought of as enabling reminiscence about past experiences. However, memory also informs and guides processing of future experiences. These two functions of memory are often at odds: remembering specific experiences from the past requires storing idiosyncratic properties that define particular moments in space and time, but by definition such properties will not be shared with similar situations in the future and thus may not be applicable to future situations. We discovered that, when faced with this conflict, the brain prioritizes prediction over encoding. Behavioral tests of recognition and source recall showed that items allowing for prediction of what will appear next based on learned regularities were less likely to be encoded into memory. Brain imaging revealed that the hippocampus was responsible for this interference between statistical learning and episodic memory. The more that the hippocampus predicted the category of an upcoming item, the worse the current item was encoded. This competition may serve an adaptive purpose, focusing encoding on experiences for which we do not yet have a predictive model.",

    "abstract": "Force produced during an isometric finger force production task tends to drift towards a lower magnitude when visual information is occluded. This phenomenon of drift in force without ones awareness is called unintentional drift. The present study used epilogue, a particular case of post-trial visual feedback, and compared the unintentional drift for two conditions, i.e., with and without the epilogue. For this purpose, fourteen healthy participants were recruited for the experiments and were instructed to produce fingertip forces using four fingers of the right hand with the target line at 15% MVC. A trial lasted for sixteen seconds, where for the initial eight seconds, there is visual feedback followed by the visual occlusion period. The results showed a significant reduction in unintentional drift for the condition involving epilogue when compared to no epilogue. This reduction in drift is due to the shift in the referent configuration parameter by the phenomenon of RC back coupling. Further, we also claim that there might be a distribution of {lambda}s or RCs, based on the history of tuning of the control parameter by the central controller.

    "abstract": "Tissue regeneration, such as pancreatic islet tissue propagation in vitro, could serve as a promising strategy for diabetes therapy and personalized drug testing. However, such a protocol has not been realized yet. Propagation could be divided by two steps, which are: (1) expansion in vitro and (2) repeat passaging. Even the in vitro expansion of the islet has not been achieved to date. Here, we describe a method to enable the expansion of islet clusters isolated from pregnant mice or wild-type rats by employing a combination of specific regeneration factors and chemical compounds in vitro. The expanded islet clusters expressed insulin, glucagon and somatostatin, which are markers corresponding to pancreatic {beta} cells,  cells and {delta} cells, respectively. These different types of cells grouped together, were spatially organized and functioned similarly to primary islets. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that forskolin in our recipe contributed to renewal and regeneration, whereas exendin4 was essential for preserving islet cell identity. Our results provide a novel method for the in vitro expansion of islet clusters, which is an important step forward in developing future protocols and medium used for islet tissue propagation in vitro. Such method is important for future regenerative diabetes therapies and personalized medicine using large amounts of pancreatic islets derived from the same person.",

    "abstract": "An understanding of the reproductive biology of aquatic organisms is crucial for the efficient conservation and management of species and/or populations. Nevertheless, conventional spawning surveys such as visual- and capture-based monitoring generally require laborious, time-consuming work and are subject to monitoring biases such as observer bias, as well as miscounts due to false spawning. In addition, direct capture often damages eggs or individuals. Thus, an efficient non-invasive approach for monitoring spawning activity on aquatic species would be a valuable tool to understand their reproductive biology and conserving biodiversity. Here, we proposed an environmental DNA (eDNA)-based approach for monitoring and understanding spawning activity by observing spikes in eDNA concentration after spawning activity. We found in cross experiments using two medaka species (Oryzias latipes and O. sakaizumii, 1:1 individual per tank) that an eDNA spike occurred in only male species after spawning activity. In addition, the magnitude of the eDNA spike was dependent on the number of spawning activities with egg and sperm release. In the field survey during the reproductive season, eDNA concentration after spawning were 3-25 times higher than before spawning. On the other hand, there was no increase in eDNA concentration during the non-reproductive season. Therefore, our results demonstrated that spikes in the eDNA concentration are mainly caused by the release of sperm during spawning activity, and it can be used as evidence of spawning in field survey. The presented approach could be a practical tool for studying reproductive biology and provides an opportunity to design effective conservation and environmental management actions.",

    "abstract": "In the competition for the opposite sex, sexual selection can favor production of exaggerated features, but the high cost of such features in terms of energy consumption and enemy avoidance makes them go to extinction under the influence of natural selection. However, to our knowledge, fossil on exaggerated traits that are conducive to attracting opposite sex are very rare. Here, we report the exaggerated leaf-like expansion antennae of Magnusantenna wuae Du & Chen gen. et sp. nov. (Hemiptera: Coreidae) with more abundant sensory hairs from a new nymph coreid preserved in a Cretaceous Myanmar amber. The antennae are the largest among species of coreid and one of the largest known insects. Such bizarre antennae indicate that sensitive and delicate sensory system and magnificent appearance in Hemiptera have been already well established in mid-Cretaceous. Our findings provide evidence for Darwins view that sensory organs play an important role in sexual selection. This nymph with the leaf-like antennae may also represents a new camouflage pattern for defense. However, the oversized antennae are costly to develop and maintain, increasing the risks from predators. Such unparalleled expanded antennae might be the key factor for the evolutionary fate of this Myanmar amber coreid species.\n\nSignificanceDarwin proposed the importance of sensory organs in sexual selection, but it was greatly ignored compared with weapons and other common ornaments. Here, we report a new type of insect antennae, the multiple segments leaf-like expansion antennae from a new nymph coreid preserved in a Cretaceous Myanmar amber. Our finding provides evidence for the prominent role of sensory organs in sexual selection and thus supports Darwins viewpoint. This discovery demonstrates that high-efficiency antennae were present in Coreidae 99 million years ago. In addition, the exaggerated antennae might represent a new evolutionary innovation for defensive behavior. This is a case in which the high benefits and high costs brought by the exaggerated antennae jointly determine the direction of species evolution.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers are cis-regulatory DNA elements that positively regulate the transcription of target genes in a tissue-specific manner and dysregulation in various diseases such as cancer. Recent studies showed that enhancers can regulate miRNAs and participate in the biological synthesis of miRNAs. However, the network of enhancer-regulated miRNAs across multiple cancers is still unclear. Here, a total of 2,418 proximal enhancer-miRNA interactions and 1,280 distal enhancer-miRNA interactions were identified through the integration of genomic distance, co-expression, and 3D genome data in 31 cancers. The results showed that both proximal and distal interactions exhibited significant tissue-specific feature and there was a noteworthy positive correlation between the expression of miRNA and the number of regulated enhancers in most tissues. Furthermore, it was found that there was a high correlation between the formation of enhancer-miRNA pairs and the expression of eRNAs whether in distal or proximal regulation. The characteristics analysis showed that miRes (enhancers that regulated miRNAs) and non-miRes presented significant differences in sequence conservation, GC content and histone modification signatures. Notably, GC content, H3K4me1, H3K36me3 were present differently between distal regulation and proximal regulation, suggesting they might participate in chromosome looping of enhancer-miRNA interactions. Finally, we introduced a case study, enhancer: chr1:1186391-1186507[~]miR-200a was highly relevant to the survival of thyroid cancer patients and a cis-eQTL SNP on enhancer affected the expression TNFRSF18 gene as a tumor suppressor.",

    "abstract": "F420 is a low-potential redox cofactor used by diverse bacteria and archaea. In mycobacteria, this cofactor has multiple roles, including adaptation to redox stress, cell wall biosynthesis, and activation of the clinical antitubercular prodrugs pretomanid and delamanid. A recent biochemical study proposed a revised biosynthesis pathway for F420 in mycobacteria; it was suggested that phosphoenolpyruvate served as a metabolic precursor for this pathway, rather than 2-phospholactate as long proposed, but these findings were subsequently challenged. In this work, we combined metabolomic, genetic, and structural analyses to resolve these discrepancies and determine the basis of F420 biosynthesis in mycobacterial cells. We show that, in whole cells of Mycobacterium smegmatis, phosphoenolpyruvate rather than 2-phospholactate stimulates F420 biosynthesis. Analysis of F420 biosynthesis intermediates present in M. smegmatis cells harboring genetic deletions at each step of the biosynthetic pathway confirmed that phosphoenolpyruvate is then used to produce the novel precursor compound dehydro-F420-0. To determine the structural basis of dehydro-F420-0 production, we solved high-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme responsible (FbiA) in apo, substrate, and product bound forms. These data show the essential role of a single divalent cation in coordinating the catalytic pre-complex of this enzyme and demonstrate that dehydro-F420-0 synthesis occurs through a direct substrate transfer mechanism. Together, these findings resolve the biosynthetic pathway of F420 in mycobacteria and have significant implications for understanding the emergence of antitubercular prodrug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Advances in origins of life research and prebiotic chemistry suggest that life as we know it may have emerged from an earlier RNA World. However, it has been difficult to reconcile the conditions used in laboratory experiments with real-world geochemical environments that may have existed on the early Earth and hosted the origin(s) of life. This challenge is in part due to geologic resurfacing and recycling that have erased the overwhelming majority of the Earths prebiotic history. We therefore propose that Mars, a planet frozen in time, comprised of many surfaces that have remained relatively unchanged since their formation >4 Gya, is the best alternative to search for environments consistent with geochemical requirements imposed by the RNA world. In this study we synthesize in situ and orbital observations of Mars and modeling of its early atmosphere into solutions containing a range of pHs and concentrations of prebiotically relevant metals (Fe2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+), spanning various candidate aqueous environments. We then experimentally determine RNA degradation kinetics due to metal-catalyzed hydrolysis and evaluate whether early Mars could have been permissive towards the accumulation of long-lived RNA polymers. Our results indicate that a Mg2+-rich basalt sourcing metals to a slightly acidic (pH 5.4) aqueous environment mediates the slowest rates of metal-catalyzed RNA hydrolysis, though geologic evidence and modeling of basalt weathering suggest that aquifers on Mars would be near neutral (pH [~]7). Moreover, oxidizing conditions on Mars have major consequences regarding the availability oxygen-sensitive prebiotic metals (i.e., Fe2+ and Mn2+) very early in its history due to increased RNA degradation rates and precipitation. Overall, 1) low pH better preserves RNA than basic conditions at high concentrations; 2) acidic to neutral pH environments with Fe2+ or Mn2+ will hydrolyze more RNA; and 3) alkaline environments with Mg2+ dramatically hydrolyze more RNA.",

    "abstract": "Humans need to actively control their upright posture during walking to avoid loss of balance. We do not have a comprehensive theory for how humans regulate balance during walking, especially in complex environments. Balance must be maintained in a variety of contexts including crowded city side-walks, rocky nature trails, walks on the beach, or fast-paced sporting events. The nervous system must process many aspects of the environment to produce an appropriate motor output in order to maintain balance on two legs. We have previously identified three balance mechanisms that young healthy adults use to maintain balance while walking: 1) The ankle roll mechanism, a modulation of ankle inversion/eversion; 2) The foot placement mechanism, a shift of the swing foot placement; and 3) The push-off mechanism, a modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. We know that these mechanisms are interdependent and can be influenced by internal factors such as the phase of the gait cycle and walking cadence. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking in the presence of environmental constraints. Subjects walked on a selfpaced treadmill while immersed in a virtual environment that provides three different colored pathways. Subjects were instructed not to step in the No-Step Zone, which appeared either on the right or left side of the subject. While walking, subjects received balance perturbations in the form of galvanic vestibular stimulation, providing the sensation of falling sideways, either toward the No-Step zone or toward the Neutral zone on the other side. The results indicate that the use of the balance mechanisms are subtly altered depending on whether the perceived fall is toward the No-Step or the Neutral zone. This experiment provides further evidence that the balance control system during walking is extremely flexible, recruiting multiple mechanisms at different times in the gait cycle to adapt to environmental constraints.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the composition of the human microbiome are associated with health and disease. Some microbiome states persist in seemingly unfavorable conditions, e.g., the proliferation of aerobe-anaerobe communities in oxygen-exposed environments in wounds or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, it remains unclear how different stable microbiome states can exist under the same conditions, or why some states persist under seemingly unfavorable conditions. Here, using two microbes relevant to the human microbiome, we combine genome-scale mathematical modeling, bioreactor experiments, transcriptomics, and dynamical systems theory, to show that multi-stability and hysteresis (MSH) is a mechanism that can describe the shift from an aerobe-dominated state to a resilient, paradoxically persistent aerobe-anaerobe state. We examine the impact of changing oxygen and nutrient regimes and identify factors, including changes in metabolism and gene expression, that lead to MSH. When analyzing the transitions between the two states in this system, the familiar conceptual connection between causation and correlation is broken and MSH must be used to interpret the dynamics. Using MSH to analyze microbiome dynamics will improve our conceptual understanding of the stability of microbiome states and the transitions among microbiome states.\n\nOne sentence summaryMulti-stability and hysteresis (MSH) is a potential mechanism to describe shifts to and persistence of aerobe-anaerobe communities in the microbiome.",

However, these loci only explain 17-27% of the trait variance and a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms has not been achieved. In this study, we utilized an integrative genomics approach leveraging diverse genomic data from human populations to investigate whether genetic variants associated with various plasma lipid traits, namely total cholesterol (TC), high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL and LDL), and triglycerides (TG), from GWAS were concentrated on specific parts of tissue-specific gene regulatory networks. In addition to the expected lipid metabolism pathways, gene subnetworks involved in  interferon signaling,  autoimmune/immune activation,  visual transduction, and  protein catabolism were significantly associated with all lipid traits. Additionally, we detected trait-specific subnetworks, including cadherin-associated subnetworks for LDL, glutathione metabolism for HDL, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis for TC, and insulin signaling and complement pathways for TG. Finally, utilizing gene-gene relations revealed by tissue-specific gene regulatory networks, we detected both known (e.g. APOH, APOA4, and ABCA1) and novel (e.g. F2 in adipose tissue) key regulator genes in these lipid-associated subnetworks. Knockdown of the F2 gene (Coagulation Factor II, Thrombin) in 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 adipocytes reduced gene expression of Abcb11, Apoa5, Apof, Fabp1, Lipc, and Cd36, reduced intracellular adipocyte lipid content, and increased extracellular lipid content, supporting a link between adipose thrombin and lipid regulation.

    "abstract": "Hybridization of complementary single strands of DNA represents a very effective natural molecular recognition process widely exploited for diagnostic, biotechnology and nanotechnology applications. A common approach relies on the immobilization on a surface of single stranded DNA probes that bind complementary targets in solution. However, despite the deep knowledge on DNA interactions in bulk solution, the modelling of the same interactions on a surface are still challenging and perceived as strongly system-dependent. Here we show that a two dimensional analysis of the kinetics of hybridization, performed at different target concentration and probe surface density by a label-free optical biosensor, reveals peculiar features inconsistent with an ideal Langmuir-like behaviour. We propose a simple non-Langmuir kinetic model accounting for an enhanced electrostatic repulsion originating from the surface immobilization of nucleic acids and for steric hindrance close to full hybridization of the surface probes. The analysis of the kinetic data by the model enables to quantify the repulsive potential at the surface, as well as to retrieve the kinetic parameters of isolated probes. We show that the strength and the kinetics of hybridization at large probe density can be improved by a 3D immobilization strategy of probe strands with a double stranded linker.\n\nStatement of SignificanceHybridization of nucleic acids strands with complementary sequences is a fundamental biological process and is also widely exploited for diagnostic purposes. Despite the availability of effective models for the equilibrium strength of freely diffusing strands, a general predictive model for surface hybridization is still missing. Moreover, the kinetics of hybridization is not fully understood neither in solution nor on a surface. In this work we show that the analysis of the kinetics of hybridization on a surface reveals and enables to quantify two main additional contributions: electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. These are general effects expected to occur not only on a surface but in any condition with large density of nucleic acids, comparable to that of the cellular nucleus.",

Here, two mutant alleles of ACCLIMATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO THE ENVIRONMENT 1 (ape1) have been characterized in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The ape1 mutants are photosensitive and show PSII photoinhibition during high light acclimation or under high light stress. The ape1 mutants retain more PSII super-complexes and have changes to thylakoid stacking relative to control strains during photosynthetic growth at different light intensities. The APE1 protein is found in all oxygenic phototrophs and encodes a 25 kDa thylakoid protein that interacts with the Photosystem II core complex as monomers, dimers and supercomplexes. We propose a model where APE1 bound to PSII supercomplexes releases core complexes and promotes PSII heterogeneity influencing the stacking of Chlamydomonas thylakoids. APE1 is a regulator in light acclimation and its function is to reduce over-excitation of PSII centres and avoid PSII photoinhibition to increase the resilience of photosynthesis to high light.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle regeneration is essential for restoring muscle function upon injury and for the maintenance of muscle health with aging. ARHGEF3, a Rho-specific GEF, negatively regulates myoblast differentiation via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-Akt signaling in a GEF-independent manner in vitro. Here, we investigated ARHGEF3s role in skeletal muscle regeneration by creating ARHGEF3 KO mice. These mice exhibited no discernible phenotype under normal conditions. Upon injury, however, ARHGEF3 deficiency enhanced the mass, fiber size and function of regenerating muscles in both young and aged mice. Surprisingly, these effects were not mediated by mTORC2-Akt signaling, but by the GEF activity of ARHGEF3. Furthermore, ARHGEF3 KO promoted muscle regeneration through activation of autophagy, a process that is also critical for maintaining muscle strength. Accordingly, in old mice, ARHGEF3 depletion prevented muscle weakness by restoring autophagy flux. Collectively, our findings identify an unexpected link between ARHGEF3 and autophagy-related muscle pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Muscle-invasive bladder cancers have recently been characterized by their distinct expression of luminal and basal genes, which could be used to predict key clinical features such as disease progression and overall survival. For example, FOXA1, GATA3, and PPARG have been shown to be essential for luminal subtype-specific regulation and subtype switching, while TP63 and STAT3 are critical for basal subtype bladder cancer. Despite these advances, the underlying epigenetic mechanism and 3D chromatin architecture for subtype-specific regulation in bladder cancers remains largely unknown. Here, we determined the genome-wide transcriptome, enhancer landscape, TF binding profiles (FOXA1 and GATA3) in luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancers. Furthermore, we mapped genome-wide chromatin interactions by Hi-C in both bladder cancer cell lines and primary patient tumors, for the first time in bladder cancer. We showed that subtype-specific transcription is accompanied by specific open chromatin and epigenomic marks, at least partially driven by distinct TF binding at distal-enhancers of luminal and basal bladder cancers. Finally, we identified a novel clinically relevant transcriptional factor, Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (NPAS2), in luminal bladder cancers that regulates other luminal-specific genes (such as FOXA1, GATA3, and PPARG) and affects cancer cell proliferation and migration. In summary, our work shows a subtype-specific epigenomic and 3D genome structure in urinary bladder cancers and suggested a novel link between the circadian TF NPAS2 and a clinical bladder cancer subtype.",

    "abstract": "The chromosomes - DNA polymers and their binding proteins - are compacted into a spatially organized, yet dynamic, three-dimensional structure. Recent genome-wide chromatin conformation capture experiments reveal a hierarchical organization of the DNA structure that is imposed, at least in part, by looping interactions arising from the activity of loop extrusion factors. The dynamics of chromatin reflects the response of the polymer to a combination of thermal fluctuations and active processes. However, how chromosome structure and enzymes acting on chromatin together define its dynamics remains poorly understood. To gain insight into the structure-dynamics relationship of chromatin, we combine high-precision microscopy in living Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells with systematic genetic perturbations and Rouse- model polymer simulations. We first investigated how the activity of two loop extrusion factors, the cohesin and condensin complexes, influences chromatin dynamics. We observed that deactivating cohesin, or to a lesser extent condensin, increased chromatin mobility, suggesting that loop extrusion constrains rather than agitates chromatin motion. Our corresponding simulations reveal that the introduction of loops is sufficient to explain the constraining activity of loop extrusion factors, highlighting that the conformation adopted by the polymer plays a key role in defining its dynamics. Moreover, we find that the number loops or residence times of loop extrusion factors influences the dynamic behavior of the chromatin polymer. Last, we observe that the activity of the INO80 chromatin remodeler, but not the SWI/SNF or RSC complexes, is critical for ATP-dependent chromatin mobility in fission yeast. Taken together we suggest that thermal and INO80-dependent activities exert forces that drive chromatin fluctuations, which are constrained by the organization of the chromosome into loops.",

Marchantia is a liverwort, a simple plant with an open form of development that allows direct visualization of gene expression and dynamics of cellular growth in living tissues. We describe new techniques for simple and efficient axenic propagation and maintenance of Marchantia lines with no requirement for glasshouse facilities. Marchantia plants spontaneously produce clonal propagules within a few weeks of regeneration, and lines can be amplified million-fold in a single generation by induction of the sexual phase of growth, crossing and harvesting of progeny spores. The plant has a simple morphology and genome with reduced gene redundancy, and the dominant phase of its life cycle is haploid, making genetic analysis easier. We have built robust Loop assembly vector systems for nuclear and chloroplast transformation and genome editing. These have provided the basis for building and testing a modular library of standardized DNA elements with highly desirable properties. We have screened transcriptomic data to identify a range of candidate genes, extracted putative promoter sequences, and tested them in vivo to identify new constitutive promoter elements. The resources have been combined into a toolkit for plant bioengineering that is accessible for laboratories without access to traditional facilities for plant biology research. The toolkit is being made available under the terms of the OpenMTA and will facilitate the establishment of common standards and the use of this simple plant as testbed for synthetic biology.",

In this study, we challenged Nematostella polyps with heat, salinity, UV light stressors and a combination of all three to determine how abiotic stressors impact toxin expression for individuals collected across this species range. Transcriptomics and proteomics revealed that the highly abundant toxin Nv1 was the most downregulated gene under heat stress conditions in multiple populations. Physiological measurements demonstrated that venom is metabolically costly to produce suggesting that downregulating venom expression under stressful conditions may be advantageous.

    "abstract": "Opsins are the primary light-sensing molecules in animals. Opsins have peak sensitivities to specific wavelengths which allows for color discrimination. The opsin protein family has undergone duplications and losses, dynamically expanding and contracting the number of opsins, throughout invertebrate evolution, but it is unclear what drives this diversity. Light availability, however, appears to play a significant role. Dim environments are associated with low opsin diversity in deep-sea fishes and cave-dwelling animals. Correlations between high opsin diversity and bright environments, however, are tenuous. Insects are a good system to test whether opsin expansion is associated with greater light availability because they are enormously diverse and consequently display large variation in diel activity. To test this, we used 200 insect transcriptomes and examined the patterns of opsin diversity associated with diel-niche. We focused on the butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) because this group has significant variation in diel-niche, substantial opsin recovery (n=100), and particularly well-curated transcriptomes. We identified opsin duplications using ancestral state reconstruction and examined rates of opsin evolution, and compared them across diel-niches. We find Lepidoptera species active in high light environments have independently expanded their opsins at least 10 times. Opsins from diurnal taxa also evolve faster; 13 amino acids were identified across different opsins that were under diversifying selection. Structural models reveal that four of these amino acids overlap with opsin color-tuning regions. By parsing nocturnal and diurnal switches, we show that light environment can influence gene diversity, selection, and protein structure of opsins in Lepidoptera.",

    "abstract": "What determines the level of genetic diversity of a species remains one of the enduring problems of population genetics. Since, neutral diversity depends upon the product of the effective population size and mutation rate there is an expectation that diversity should be correlated to measures of census population size. This correlation is often observed for nuclear but not for mitochondrial DNA. Here we revisit the question of whether mitochondrial DNA sequence diversity is correlated to census population size by compiling the largest dataset to date from 639 mammalian species. In a multiple regression we find that nucleotide diversity is significantly correlated to both range size and mass-specific metabolic rate, but not a variety of other factors. We also find that a measure of the effective population size, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous diversity, is also significantly negatively correlated to both range and mass-specific metabolic rate. These results together suggest that species with larger ranges have larger effective population sizes. The slope of the relationship between diversity and range is such that doubling the range increases diversity by 12 to 20%, providing one of the first quantifications of the relationship between effective and census population sizes.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new pattern of population genetic structure in a host-parasite system that can arise after secondary contact (SC) of previously isolated populations. Due to different generation time and therefore different tempo of molecular evolution the host and parasite populations reach different degrees of genetic differentiation during their separation (e.g. in refugia). Consequently, during the SC the host populations are able to re-establish a single panmictic population across the whole recolonized area, while the parasite populations stop their dispersal at the SC zone and create a narrow hybrid zone (HZ). From the hosts perspective, the parasites HZ functions on a microevolutionary scale as a \"host-cleansing filter\": while passing from area A to area B, the hosts are rid of the area A parasites and acquire the area B parasites. We demonstrate this novel pattern on a model composed of Apodemus mice and Polyplax lice by comparing maternally inherited markers (complete mitochondrial genomes, and complete genomes of vertically transmitted symbiont Legionella polyplacis) with SNPs derived from the louse genomic data. We discuss circumstances which may lead to this pattern and possible reasons why it has been overlooked in the studies on host-parasite population genetics.",

    "abstract": "The smaller a population is, the faster it looses genetic variation due to genetic drift. Loss of genetic variation can reduce population growth rate, making populations even smaller and more vulnerable to loss of genetic variation, and so on. Ultimately, the population can be driven to extinction by this \"eco-evolutionary extinction vortex\". So far, extinction vortices due to loss of genetic variation have been mainly described verbally. However, quantitative models are needed to better understand when such vortices arise and to develop methods for detecting them. Here we propose quantitative eco-evolutionary models, both individual-based simulations and analytic approximations, that link loss of genetic variation and population decline. Our models assume stochastic population dynamics and multi-locus genetics with different forms of balancing selection. Using mathematical analysis and simulations, we identify parameter combinations that exhibit strong interactions between population size and genetic variation as populations decline to extinction and match our definition of an eco-evolutionary vortex, i.e. the per-capita population decline rates and per-locus fixation rates increase with decreasing population size and number of polymorphic loci. We further highlight cues and early warning signals that may be useful in identifying populations undergoing an eco-evolutionary extinction vortex.",

WGS was performed with short read (Illumina MiSeq) and long read (Oxford Nanopore MinION) technologies to generate complete genome assemblies. Illumina reads for 94 E. faecalis bloodstream isolates were used to place the optrA-positive isolates in a larger UK phylogeny.\n\nResultsSix optrA-positive linezolid-resistant E. faecalis were isolated from urogenital samples in three Scottish Health Boards (2014-2017). No epidemiological links were identified between the patients, four were community-based, and only one had recent linezolid exposure. Reference-based mapping confirmed the isolates were genetically distinct (>13,900 core SNPs). optrA was located on a plasmid in each isolate and these plasmids showed limited nucleotide similarity. There was variable presence of transposable elements surrounding optrA, (including IS1216, IS3, and Tn3) and not always as a recognisable gene cassette. OptrA amino acid sequences were also divergent, resulting in four protein variants differing in 1-20 residues. One isolate belonged to ST16 and clustered with three other isolates in the UK collection (76-182 SNPs), otherwise the optrA-positive isolates were genetically distinct from the bloodstream isolates (>6,000 SNPs).\n\nConclusionsWe report multiple variants of the linezolid resistance gene optrA in diverse E. faecalis strain and plasmid backgrounds, suggesting multiple introductions of the gene into the E. faecalis population and selection driving recent emergence.",

    "abstract": "Systems biology applies concepts from engineering in order to understand biological networks. If such an understanding was complete, biologists would be able to design ad hoc biochemical components tailored for different purposes, which is the goal of synthetic biology. Needless to say that we are far away from creating biological subsystems as intricate and precise as those found in nature, but mathematical models and high throughput techniques have brought us a long way in this direction. One of the difficulties that still needs to be overcome is finding the right values for model parameters and dealing with uncertainty, which is proving to be an extremely difficult task. In this work, we take advantage of ensemble modeling techniques, where a large number of models with different parameter values are formulated and then tested according to some performance criteria. By finding features shared by successful models, the role of different components and the synergies between them can be better understood. We will address some of the difficulties often faced by ensemble modeling approaches, such as the need to sample a space whose size grows exponentially with the number of parameters, and establishing useful selection criteria. Some methods will be shown to reduce the predictions from many models into a set of understandable \"design principles\" that can guide us to improve or manufacture a biochemical network. Our proposed framework formulates models within standard formalisms in order to integrate information from different sources and minimize the dimension of the parameter space. Additionally, the mathematical properties of the formalism enable a partition of the parameter space into independent subspaces. Each of these subspaces can be paired with a set of criteria that depend exclusively on it, thus allowing a separate sampling/screening in spaces of lower dimension. By applying tests in a strict order where computationally cheaper tests are applied first to each subspace and applying computationally expensive tests to the remaining subset thereafter, the use of resources is optimized and a larger number of models can be examined. This can be compared to a complex database query where the order of the requests can make a huge difference in the processing time. The method will be illustrated by analyzing a classical model of a metabolic pathway with end-product inhibition. Even for such a simple model, the method provides novel insight.\n\nAuthor summaryA method is presented for the discovery of design principles, understood as recurrent solutions to evolutionary problems, in biochemical networks.\n\nThe method takes advantage of ensemble modeling techniques, where a large number of models with different parameter values are formulated and then tested according to some performance criteria. By finding features shared by successful models, a set of simple rules can be identified that enables us to formulate new models that are known to perform well, a priori. By formulating the models within the framework of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) we manage to overcome some of the obstacles often faced by ensemble modeling. Further analysis of the selected modeling with standard machine learning techniques enables the formulation of simple rules - design principles - for building good performing networks. We illustrate the method with a well-known case study: the unbranched pathway with end-product inhibition.

    "abstract": "Plants respond to their environment by dynamically modulating gene expression. A powerful approach for understanding how these responses are regulated is to integrate information about cis-regulatory elements (CREs) into models called cis-regulatory codes. Transcriptional response to combined stress is typically not the sum of the responses to the individual stresses. However, cis-regulatory codes underlying combined stress response have not been established. Here we modeled transcriptional response to single and combined heat and drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. We grouped genes by their pattern of response (independent, antagonistic, synergistic) and trained machine learning models to predict their response using putative CREs (pCREs) as features (median F-measure = 0.64). We then developed a deep learning approach to integrate additional omics information (sequence conservation, chromatin accessibility, histone modification) into our models, improving performance by 6.2%. While pCREs important for predicting independent and antagonistic responses tended to resemble binding motifs of transcription factors associated with heat and/or drought stress, important synergistic pCREs resembled binding motifs of transcription factors not known to be associated with stress. These findings demonstrate how in silico approaches can improve our understanding of the complex codes regulating response to combined stress and help us identify prime targets for future characterization.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to improve their distance-running performance, many athletes race with carbon fiber plates embedded in their shoe soles. Accordingly, we sought to establish whether, and if so how, adding carbon fiber plates to shoes soles reduces athlete aerobic energy expenditure during running (improves running economy). We tested 15 athletes during running at 3.5 m/s in four footwear conditions that varied in shoe sole carbon fiber plate bending stiffness. For each condition, we quantified athlete aerobic energy expenditure and performed biomechanics analyses, which included the use of ultrasound imaging to examine soleus muscle dynamics in vivo. Overall, increased footwear bending stiffness lengthened ground contact time (p=0.048), but did not affect ankle (p[&ge;]0.060), knee (p[&ge;]0.128), or hip (p[&ge;]0.076) joint angles or moments. Additionally, increased footwear bending stiffness did not affect muscle activity (all seven measured leg muscles (p[&ge;]0.146)), stride averaged active soleus volume, (p=0.068) or aerobic power (p=0.458) during running. Hence, footwear bending stiffness does not appear to alter the volume of aerobic energy consuming muscle in the soleus, or any other leg muscle, during running. Therefore, adding carbon fiber plates to shoe soles slightly alters whole-body and calf muscle biomechanics but does not improve running economy.",

    "abstract": "Whether cultured in vitro or part of a complex tissue in vivo, a cells phenotype and function are significantly influenced by dynamic interactions with its microenvironment. To explicitly examine how a cells spatiotemporal activity impacts its behavior, we developed and validated a strategy termed SPACECAT--Spatially PhotoActivatable Color Encoded Cell Address Tags--to annotate, track, and isolate specific cells in a non-destructive, viability-preserving manner. In SPACECAT, a biological sample is immersed in a photocaged fluorescent molecule, and cells within a location of interest are labeled for further study by uncaging that molecule with user-patterned near-UV light. SPACECAT offers high spatial precision and temporal stability across diverse cell and tissue types, and is compatible with common downstream assays, including flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-Seq. Illustratively, we leveraged this approach in patient-derived intestinal organoids, a spatially complex system less amenable to genetic manipulations, to select for crypt-like regions enriched in stem-like and actively mitotic cells. Moreover, we demonstrate its applicability and utility on ex vivo tissue sections from four healthy organs and an autochthonous lung tumor model, uncovering spatially-biased gene expression patterns among immune cell subsets and identifying rare myeloid phenotypes enriched around tumor/healthy border regions. In sum, our method provides a minimally invasive and broadly applicable approach to link cellular spatiotemporal features and/or behavioral phenotypes with diverse downstream assays, enabling fundamental insights into the connections between tissue microenvironments and biological (dys)function.",

Blocking this axis was shown to be beneficial in maintaining the anti-tumor functions of the adaptive immune system. Still, the consequences of blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 axis on innate immune responses remain largely unexplored. In this context, neutrophils were shown to consist of different subpopulations, which possess either pro- and anti-tumor properties. PD-L1-expressing neutrophils are considered pro-tumor as they can suppress cytotoxic T-cells. That said, we found that PD-L1 expression is not limited to tumor promoting neutrophils but is also evident in anti-tumor neutrophils. We show that neutrophil cytotoxicity is effectively and efficiently blocked by tumor cell expressed PD-1. Furthermore blocking of either neutrophil PD-L1 or tumor cell PD-1 maintains neutrophil cytotoxicity resulting in enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. Importantly, we show that tumor cell PD-1 blocks neutrophil cytotoxicity and promotes tumor growth via a mechanism independent of adaptive immunity. Taken together, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of enhancing anti-tumor innate immune responses via blocking of the PD-L1/PD-1 axis.",

However, how occluding junction dynamics controls paracellular permeability is poorly understood. Here we describe patency, a developmentally regulated process in Drosophila oogenesis, during which cell vertices in the follicle epithelium open transiently to allow paracellular transport of yolk proteins for uptake by the oocyte. We show that the sequential removal of E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, NCAM/Fasciclin-2 and Sidekick from vertices precedes their basal-to-apical opening, while the subsequent assembly of tricellular occluding junctions terminates patency and seals the paracellular barrier. E-Cadherin-based adhesion is required to limit paracellular channel size, whereas stabilized adherens junctions, prolonged NCAM/Fasciclin-2 expression, impeded endocytosis, or increased actomyosin contractility prevent patency. Our findings reveal a key role of cell vertices as gateways controlling paracellular transport, and demonstrate that the dynamic regulation of adhesion and actomyosin contractility at vertices governs epithelial barrier properties.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the deadliest solid malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate at ten percent. PDA have unique metabolic adaptations in response to cell-intrinsic and environmental stressors, and identifying new strategies to target these adaptions is an area of active research. We previously described a dependency on a cytosolic aspartate aminotransaminase (GOT1)-dependent pathway for NADPH generation. Here, we sought to identify metabolic dependencies induced by GOT1 inhibition that could be exploited to selectively kill PDA. Using pharmacological methods, we identified cysteine, glutathione, and lipid antioxidant function as metabolic vulnerabilities following GOT1 withdrawal. Targeting any of these pathways was synthetic lethal in GOT1 knockdown cells and triggered ferroptosis, an oxidative, non-apoptotic, iron-dependent form of cell death. Mechanistically, GOT1 inhibition promoted the activation of autophagy in response to metabolic stress. This enhanced the availability of labile iron through ferritinophagy, the autolysosome-mediated degradation of ferritin. In sum, our study identifies a novel biochemical connection between GOT1, iron regulation, and ferroptosis, and suggests the rewired malate-aspartate shuttle plays a role in protecting PDA from severe oxidative challenge.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPDA exhibit varying dependence on GOT1 for in vitro and in vivo growth.\nC_LIO_LIExogenous cystine, glutathione synthesis, and lipid antioxidant fidelity are essential under GOT1 suppression.\nC_LIO_LIGOT1 inhibition sensitizes pancreatic cancer cell lines to ferroptosis.\nC_LIO_LIGOT1 inhibition represses anabolic metabolism and promotes the release of iron through autophagy.\nC_LI",

Whether common molecular mechanisms govern this fractional killing in response to different lethal stimuli is poorly understood. In part, this is because it is difficult to compare fractional killing between conditions using existing approaches. Here, we show that fractional killing can be quantified and compared for hundreds of populations in parallel using high-throughput time-lapse imaging. We find that fractional killing is highly variable between lethal agents and between cell lines. At the molecular level, we find that the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 is an important determinant of fractional killing in response to mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors but not other lethal stimuli.

    "abstract": "Rrp44 is a conserved eukaryotic protein showing endonuclease and exoribonuclease activity that plays essential functions in RNA maturation and degradation. In Trypanosoma brucei, depletion of Rrp44 (TbRrp44) blocks processing of large subunit ribosomal RNA precursors, leading to disruption of ribosome synthesis and inhibition of cell proliferation. We used a combination of molecular and chemical markers to investigate the fate of T. brucei cells upon knockdown of TbRrp44. In addition, synchrotron deep UV microscopy and cryo soft X-ray tomography were used to investigate cell morphology and ultra-structure modifications. Downregulation of TbRrp44 results in induction of autophagy, inactivation of mitochondria and expansion of acidic and lysosome-derived vacuoles in parallel with enlargement of cell size. Nuclei also increase in size without changes in DNA content. 3D tomographic reconstructions revealed extreme vacuolation of the cytoplasm of TbRrp44 knockdown cells and general alteration of organelles. Calcium-containing vesicles (acidocalcisomes) were identified by X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra (XANES) of calcium L2,3 edges on fully hydrated cells. The volumes of acidocalcisomes and lipid droplet were quantified from 3D reconstructions. Both were found in higher number and with larger volumes in TbRrp44 knockdown cells. These multiple defects indicate that a combination of signals, starting from nucleolar stress and activation of autophagy, converge to induce lysosome expansion. With time, the cytoplasm is taken up by lysosome-derived vacuoles, which may be one of the final stages leading to cell death triggered by TbRrp44 depletion. These studies provide the first evidence on the ultra-structure cell modifications caused by Rrp44 ribonuclease deficiency.\n\nAuthor summaryTrypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan belonging to the Kinetoplastidae Class, which displays distinct cellular, genomic and molecular features. These features include extra intervening sequences in the large subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor that are not found in the homologous rRNA precursor of host cells. Genetic downregulation of the T. brucei Rrp44 (TbRrp44) ribonuclease shows that it is required for accurate excision of these intervening sequences to produce mature rRNA molecules. Here, we have used a multidisciplinary approach based on molecular and chemical markers, synchrotron deep UV microscopy and cryo soft X-ray tomography to show that downregulation of TbRrp44 leads to a series of cellular alterations that eventually result in cell death. Mitochondrial activity is particularly affected in parallel with induction of autophagy response, increase in size of the cell and of organelles such as acidocalcisomes and lipid droplets, and with a massive expansion of lysosome-derived vacuoles. The ultrastructural modifications that take place in T. brucei cells are nicely highlighted in the 3D reconstructions generated using cryo soft X-ray tomography images. This study provides new insights into the multiple cellular consequences of Rrp44 ribonuclease depletion in T. brucei parasites.",

How the distances between nucleosomes (spacing), and between phasing sites and nucleosomes are determined remains unclear, and specifically, how ATP dependent chromatin remodelers impact these features. Here, we used genome-wide reconstitution to probe how Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP dependent remodelers generate phased arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes. We find that remodelers bear a functional element named the  ruler that determines spacing and phasing in a remodeler-specific way. We use structure-based mutagenesis to identify and tune the ruler element residing in the Nhp10 and Arp8 modules of the INO80 remodeler complex. Generally, we propose that a remodeler ruler regulates nucleosome sliding direction bias in response to (epi)genetic information. This finally conceptualizes how remodeler-mediated nucleosome dynamics determine stable steady-state nucleosome positioning relative to other nucleosomes, DNA bound factors, DNA ends and DNA sequence elements.",

    "abstract": "Current treatment of triple negative breast cancer patients is hindered by a high incidence of chemoresistance (30-50%). The prevailing theory is that resistance and subsequent recurrence is driven by cancer stem cells. Unfortunately, the functional characterization of cancer stem cells at the molecular level is still incomplete. We show here, that within the canonical breast cancer stem cell population, a subset of cells characterized by high Notch1 expression possesses the tumor-initiating property associated with cancer stem cells. Moreover, the tumor initiating property of these high Notch1-expressing breast cancer stem cells is mediated by a cleavage independent Notch signaling pathway culminating in the repression of SIRT1. Of note, the Notch1-mediated repression of SIRT1 is required not only for tumor initiation, but also for chemoresistance in breast cancer stem cells. Strikingly, inhibition of SIRT1 obviates the requirement for Notch1, marking the first example of conferring cancer stem cell function by inhibiting the activity of a single protein. We also demonstrate that progenitor-like mammary epithelial cells, which possess both luminal and basal properties, are also characterized by high Notch1 expression and repression of SIRT1 via the non-canonical pathway. These findings provide the first functional mechanistic requirements for tumor initiation by breast cancer stem cells and suggest that activation of the non-canonical Notch1 pathway is hardwired into tumor-initiating progenitor cells and thus a prerequisite for tumor initiation.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWe demonstrate that chemoresistant and tumor-initiating properties of breast cancer stem cells are driven by repression of SIRT1 via non-canonical Notch signaling, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for triple negative breast cancer.",
