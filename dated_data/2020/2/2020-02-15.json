    "abstract": "At any given moment, we experience a perceptual scene as a single whole and yet we may distinguish a variety of objects within it. This phenomenon instantiates two properties of conscious perception: integration and differentiation. Integration to experience a collection of objects as a unitary percept, and differentiation to experience these objects as distinct from each other. Here we evaluated the neural information dynamics underlying integration and differentiation of perceptual contents during bistable perception. Participants listened to a sequence of tones (auditory bistable stimuli) experienced either as a single stream (perceptual integration) or as two parallel streams (perceptual differentiation) of sounds. We computed neurophysiological indices of information integration and information differentiation with electroencephalographic and intracranial recordings. When perceptual alternations were endogenously driven, the integrated percept was associated with an increase in neural information-integration and a decrease in neural differentiation across frontoparietal regions, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the differentiated percept. However, when perception was exogenously driven by a change in the sound stream (no bistability) neural oscillatory power distinguished between percepts but information measures did not. We demonstrate that perceptual integration and differentiation can be mapped to theoretically-motivated neural information signatures, suggesting a direct relationship between phenomenology and neurophysiology.",

    "abstract": "To date, a substantial body of research exists suggesting an association between indicators of intelligence and various deleterious outcomes, including externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems. Much of this research, however, has focused on samples drawn from the general population, thus it remains less clear how (and if) intelligence relates to problem behaviors in samples of highly at-risk individuals. The current study seeks to contribute to this knowledge base by examining the associations between intelligence and internalizing, externalizing, and total scores on the Child Behavioral Checklist in a sample of approximately 2,500 highly disadvantaged respondents considered by Child Protective Services as at-risk for abuse or neglect. While the two measures of intelligence performed differently, there emerged some association between overall lower IQ and higher total behavioral problem scores. There was some evidence that low IQ also predicted higher internalizing scores, but this relationship varied greatly by measure and model. Results, limitations, and implications of the current study are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The {beta}-1,4-glucose linkage of cellulose is the most abundant polymeric linkage on earth and as such is of considerable interest in biology and biotechnology. It remains challenging to synthesize this linkage in vitro due to a lack of suitable biocatalysts; the natural cellulose biosynthetic machinery is a membrane-associated complex with processive activity that cannot be easily manipulated to synthesize tailor-made oligosaccharides and their derivatives. Here we identify a promiscuous activity of a soluble recombinant biocatalyst, Neisseria meningitidis glycosyltransferase LgtB, suitable for the polymerization of glucose from UDP-glucose via the generation of {beta}-1,4-glycosidic linkages. We employed LgtB to synthesize natural and derivatized cello-oligosaccharides and we demonstrate how LgtB can be incorporated in biocatalytic cascades and chemo-enzymatic strategies to synthesize cello-oligosaccharides with tailored functionalities. We also show how the resulting glycan structures can be applied as chemical probes to report on activity and selectivity of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, including lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases. We anticipate that this biocatalytic approach to derivatized cello-oligosaccharides via glucose polymerization will open up new applications in biology and nanobiotechnology.",

    "abstract": "The design of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs is not trivial, and is a computationally demanding task. Design tools need to identify target sequences that will maximise the likelihood of obtaining the desired cut, whilst minimising off-target risk. There is a need for a tool that can meet both objectives while remaining practical to use on large genomes.\n\nHere, we present Crackling, a new method that is more suitable for meeting these objectives. We test its performance on 12 genomes and on data from validation studies. Crackling maximises guide efficiency by combining multiple scoring approaches. On experimental data, the guides it selects are better than those selected by others. It also incorporates Inverted Signature Slice Lists (ISSL) for faster off-target scoring. ISSL provides a gain of an order of magnitude in speed, while preserving the same level of accuracy. Overall, this makes Crackling a faster and better method to design guide RNAs at scale.\n\nCrackling is available at https://github.com/bmds-lab/Crackling under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) 3-Clause license.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAccurately predicting essential genes using computational methods can greatly reduce the effort in finding them via wet experiments at both time and resource scales, and further accelerate the process of drug discovery. Several computational methods have been proposed for predicting essential genes in model organisms by integrating multiple biological data sources either via centrality measures or machine learning based methods. However, the methods aiming to predict human essential genes are still limited and the performance still need improve. In addition, most of the machine learning based essential gene prediction methods are lack of skills to handle the imbalanced learning issue inherent in the essential gene prediction problem, which might be one factor affecting their performance.\n\nResultsWe proposed a deep learning based method, DeepHE, to predict human essential genes by integrating features derived from sequence data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A deep learning based network embedding method was utilized to automatically learn features from PPI network. In addition, 89 sequence features were derived from DNA sequence and protein sequence for each gene. These two types of features were integrated to train a multilayer neural network. A cost-sensitive technique was used to address the imbalanced learning problem when training the deep neural network. The experimental results for predicting human essential genes showed that our proposed method, DeepHE, can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average AUC higher than 94%, the area under precision-recall curve (AP) higher than 90%, and the accuracy higher than 90%. We also compared DeepHE with several widely used traditional machine learning models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Adaboost). The experimental results showed that DeepHE greatly outperformed the compared machine learning models.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated that human essential genes can be accurately predicted by designing effective machine learning algorithm and integrating representative features captured from available biological data. The proposed deep learning framework is effective for such task.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe python code will be freely available upon the acceptance of this manuscript at https://github.com/xzhang2016/DeepHE.\n\nContactxue.zhang@tufts.edu",

    "abstract": "Once believed to be a commensal bacteria, Enterococcus faecium has recently emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen worldwide. A recent outbreak of E. faecium unrevealed natural and in vitro resistance against a myriad of antibiotics namely ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin due to over-exposure of the pathogen to these antibiotics. This fact combined with the ongoing threat demands the identification of new therapeutic targets to combat E. faecium infections.\n\nIn this present study, comparative proteome analysis, subtractive genomic approach, metabolic pathway analysis and additional drug prioritizing parameters were used to propose a potential novel drug targets for E. faecium strain DO. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified a total of 207 putative target proteins in E. faecium DO that showed no similarity to human proteins. Among them 105 proteins were identified as essential novel proteins that could serve as potential drug targets through further bioinformatic approaches; such as-prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characterization. Eventually 19 non-homologous essential proteins of E. faecium DO were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. Among these targets aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase was found to be involved in maximum pathways, and therefore, was chosen as novel drug target. Interestingly, aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme contains two domains namely acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, on which a 3D structure homology modeling and in silico molecular docking were performed. Finally, eight molecules were confirmed as the most suitable ligands for aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target.\n\nIn conclusion, being human non-homologous, aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase protein can be targeted for potential therapeutic drug development in future. However, laboratory based experimental research should be performed to validate our findings in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The balance of nutrients in soil is critical for microbial growth and function, and stoichiometric values below the Redfield ratio for C:N:P can negatively affect microbial ecosystem services. However, few studies have assessed the relationships between nutrient balance and biological productivity in extremely nutrient-poor habitats. The Mackay Glacier region of Eastern Antarctica is a hyper-oligotrophic ice-free desert and is an appropriate landscape to evaluate the effects of nutrient deficiency and imbalance on microbial community ecology. In a survey of multiple, widely dispersed soil samples from this region, we detected only low rates of microbial respiration, and observed that C:N:P ratios were well below those required for optimal activity. In silico metagenomic and soil isotopic ratio ({delta}15N) analyses indicated that the capacity for nitrogen fixation was low, but that soil microbial communities were enriched for soil nitrate assimilation processes, mostly associated with heterotrophic taxa.{delta} 13C isotope ratio data suggested that carbon dioxide was fixed principally via the Calvin cycle. Genes involved in this pathway were common to all metagenomes and were primarily attributed to members of the dominant soil bacterial phyla: Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria. The identification of multiple genes encoding non-photoautotrophic RUBISCO and carbon dioxide dehydrogenase enzymes in both the metagenomic sequences and assembled MAGs is suggestive of a trace-gas scavenging physiology in members of these soil communities.",

Infrared heater warming systems have been widely used to simulate climate warming effects on ecosystem. However, how this warming system affects dew formation has been long ignored and rarely addressed. In a typical alpine grassland ecosystem on the Northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, we measured dew amount and duration by artificial condensing surfaces, leaf wetness sensors and in situ dew formation on plants from 2012 to 2017. We also measured plant traits related to dew conditions. The results showed that (1) warming reduced the dew amount by 41.6%-91.1% depending on the measurement method, and reduced dew duration by 32.1 days compared to the ambient condition. (2) Different plant functional groups differed in dew formation. (3) Under the infrared warming treatment, the dew amount decreased with plant height, while under the ambient conditions, the dew amount showed the opposite trend. We concluded that warming with an infrared heater system greatly reduces dew formation, and if ignored, it may lead to overestimation of the effects of climate warming on ecosystem processes in climate change simulation studies.",

However, information on the enzymes catalyzing all these modifications in perennial trees, such as Quercus suber, is still not available. In this study, several epigenetic modifier proteins, including eight DNA methyltransferases (DNA Mtases), three DNA demethylases (DDMEs) and ninety-one histone modifiers including thirty-five histone methyltransferases (HMTs), twenty-six histone demethylases (HDMTs), eight histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and twenty-two histone acetylases (HDACs) were identified in Q. suber. Phylogenetic analyses of the DNA and histone modifier proteins were performed using several plant species homologs, enabling the classification of the Q. suber proteins. Additional in silico analysis showed that some Q. suber DNA Mtases, DMEs and histone modifiers have the typical domains found in the plant model Arabidopsis, which might suggest a conserved functional role. A link between the expression levels of each gene in different Q. suber tissues (buds, flowers, acorns, embryos, cork and roots) with the functions already known for their closest homologs in other species was also established. Therefore, the data generated here are important for future studies exploring the role of epigenetic regulators in this economically important species.",

The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs.

    "abstract": "Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare genetic disease in which patients experience acute phototoxic reactions after sunlight exposure. It is caused by a deficiency in ferrochelatase (FECH) in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Most patients exhibit a loss-of-function mutation in trans to an allele bearing a SNP that favours aberrant splicing of transcripts. One viable strategy for EPP is to deploy splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) to increase FECH synthesis, whereby an increase of a few percent would provide therapeutic benefit. However, successful application of SSOs in bone marrow cells is not described. Here, we show that SSOs comprising methoxyethyl-chemistry increase FECH levels in cells. We conjugated one SSO to three prototypical targeting groups and administered them to a mouse model of EPP in order to study their biodistribution, their metabolic stability and their FECH splice-switching ability. The SSOs exhibited distinct distribution profiles, with increased accumulation in liver, kidney, bone marrow and lung. However, they also underwent substantial metabolism, mainly at their linker groups. An SSO bearing a cholesteryl group increased levels of correctly spliced FECH transcript by 80% in the bone marrow. The results provide a promising approach to treat EPP and other disorders originating from splicing dysregulation in the bone marrow.",

    "abstract": "Concerns about external validity of rodent models and translation of findings across species are often based on narrow investigations of populations with limited diversity. Sources of individual variation - including genetics and sex - are only infrequently encompassed in model organism studies. As with most complex diseases, risk for cocaine use disorder is subject to considerable inter-individual variation. Explicit inclusion of individual differences in rodent research may reveal conserved phenotypes and molecular systems relevant to human addiction. We surveyed cocaine-related traits in both males and females of eight inbred mouse strains whose genomes collectively capture 90% of the genetic diversity of the mouse species. Across these strains, individual differences explained a substantial proportion of variance in cocaine-responsive or cocaine response-predictive behavioral and physiological phenotypes. Wild-derived mouse strains often extended the phenotypic ranges of these behaviors beyond what is observed in conventional laboratory strains. Striatum transcriptional responses to cocaine were also highly dependent upon strain and sex differences; most cocaine-responsive genes were differentially expressed in a manner moderated by strain, sex, or their combination. We compared the strain- and sex-mediated transcriptional responses to cocaine in mice to transcriptomic analysis of people with cocaine use disorder and found that mouse similarity to humans was highly dependent upon mouse genetic background and sex. Specifically, male WSB/EiJ mice and female NOD/ShiLtJ mice exhibited the greatest degree of neural transcriptional consilience with humans with cocaine use disorder. Model organism diversity thus represents a crucial source of biological information that can substantially improve external validity of neuropsychiatric research.\n\nSignificance StatementLaboratory mice are widely used in research on neurobiological mechanisms of addiction, but most studies use a single strain and often sex of mice. To assess how individual differences in mice modulate addiction-related traits and how this impacts comparative analysis with humans, we studied cocaine-relevant behaviors and brain molecular correlates in both males and females of genetically diverse mouse strains. In this population, individual differences related to sex and/or genetics explain large proportions of differences in cocaine-related traits. Importantly, brain gene expression data demonstrated that some strains mimic human genomic states more readily than others. Individual differences thus represent a crucial and underdeveloped source of biological information about addiction mechanisms that may influence the translational utility of such studies.",

We combined behavioural manipulation and modelling to investigate how sequence statistics are encoded into long-term memory and used to interpret incoming sensory signals.

Unbeknownst to them, a few regular patterns reoccurred sparsely (every [~]3 minutes). Reoccurring sequences showed a rapidly growing detection time advantage over novel sequences. This effect was implicit, robust to interference, and persisted up to 7 weeks.

Serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are the most commonly prescribed class of drugs to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). These antagonists have been clinically successful drugs since the 1980s, yet our understanding of how they operate at the molecular level has been hampered by the difficulty of obtaining structures of drug-receptor complexes. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the palonosetron-bound 5-HT3 receptor. We investigate the binding of palonosetron, granisetron, dolasetron, ondansetron, and cilansetron using molecular dynamics, covering the whole set of antagonists used in the clinical practice. The structural and computational results yield detailed atomic insight into the binding modes of the drugs. In light of our data, we establish a comprehensive framework underlying the inhibition mechanism by the -setron drug family.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWChanges in striatal cholinergic interneuron (ChI) activity are thought to contribute to Parkinsons disease pathophysiology and dyskinesia from chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment, but the physiological basis of these changes are unknown. We find that dopamine lesion decreases the spontaneous firing rate of ChIs, whereas chronic treatment with L-DOPA of lesioned mice increases baseline ChI firing rates to levels beyond normal activity. The effect of dopamine loss on ChIs was due to decreased currents of both hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. L-DOPA reinstatement of dopamine normalized HCN activity, but SK current remained depressed. Pharmacological blockade of HCN and SK activities mimicked changes in firing, confirming that these channels are responsible for the molecular adaptation of ChIs to dopamine loss and chronic L-DOPA treatment. These findings suggest that targeting ChIs with channel-specific modulators may provide therapeutic approaches for alleviating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractProtein phosphorylation is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications found in eukaryotic systems. It serves as a key molecular mechanism that regulates protein function in response to environmental stimuli. The Mut9-Like Kinases (MLKs) are a plant-specific family of Ser/Thr kinases linked to light, circadian, and abiotic stress signaling. Here we use quantitative phosphoproteomics in conjunction with global proteomic analysis to explore the role of the MLKs in daily protein dynamics. Proteins involved in light, circadian, and hormone signaling, as well as several chromatin-modifying enzymes and DNA damage response factors, were found to have altered phosphorylation profiles in the absence of MLK family kinases. In addition to altered phosphorylation levels, mlk mutant seedlings have an increase in glucosinolate metabolism enzymes. Subsequently, we show that a functional consequence of the changes to the proteome and phosphoproteome in mlk mutant plants is elevated glucosinolate accumulation, and increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Combined with previous reports, this work supports the involvement of MLKs in a diverse set of stress responses and developmental processes, suggesting that the MLKs serve as key regulators linking environmental inputs to developmental outputs.",

    "abstract": "Fucosylation of the inner-most N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) of N-glycans by fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) is an important step in the maturation of complex and hybrid N-glycans. This simple modification can have a dramatic impact on the activity and half-life of glycoproteins. These effects are relevant to understanding the invasiveness of some cancers, the development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics, and to a congenital disorder of glycosylation. The acceptor substrate preferences of FUT8 are well characterised and provide a framework for understanding N-glycan maturation in the Golgi, however the structural basis for these substrate preferences and the mechanism through which catalysis is achieved remains unknown. Here, we describe several structures of mouse and human FUT8 in the apo state and in complex with guanosine diphosphate (GDP), a mimic of the donor substrate, and a glycopeptide acceptor substrate. These structures provide insights into: a unique conformational change associated with donor substrate binding; common strategies employed by fucosyltransferases to coordinate GDP; features that define acceptor substrate preferences; and a likely mechanism for enzyme catalysis. Together with molecular dynamics simulations, the structures also reveal how FUT8 dimerisation plays an important role in defining the acceptor substrate binding site. Collectively, this information significantly builds on our understanding of the core-fucosylation process.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBioprosthetic heart valves (BHV) are widely used to treat heart valve disease but are fundamentally limited by structural valve degeneration (SVD). Non-calcific mechanisms of SVD entirely account for approximately 30% of SVD cases and contribute to calcific SVD but remain understudied. Glycation mechanisms have not been previously associated with SVD, despite being established as degenerative in collagenous native tissues.\n\nObjectivesTo determine whether blood component infiltration-based glycation and concomitant human serum albumin (HSA) deposition contribute mechanistically to SVD.\n\nMethodsImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to identify advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and serum albumin accumulation in 45 aortic valve BHV explanted due to SVD, glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium (BP) incubated in vitro in glyoxal and HSA, and rat subcutaneous BP implants. Structural impacts of glycation-related mechanisms were evaluated by second harmonic generation (SHG) collagen imaging. Hydrodynamic effects of valve glycation and concomitant HSA exposure were studied with an ISO-5840-compliant pulse duplicator system using surgical grade BHV.\n\nResultsAll 45 clinical explants and in vitro-incubated BP demonstrated accumulated AGE and HSA compared to un-implanted, un-exposed BHV. SHG revealed instigation of collagen malalignment similar to that in SVD explants by glycation and HSA infiltration. Rat subdermal explants also showed AGE and serum albumin accumulation. Pulse duplication demonstrated significantly reduced orifice area and increased pressure gradient and peak fluid velocity following glyoxal and HSA incubations.\n\nConclusionsGlycation and concomitant HSA infiltration occur in clinical BHV and contribute to structural and functional degeneration of leaflet tissue, thus representing novel, interacting mechanisms of BHV SVD.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton is the base of the marine food chain, oxygen, carbon cycle playing a global role in climate and ecology. Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses regulating the dynamics of phytoplankton comprise genes of rhodopsins of two distinct families. We present a function-structure characterization of two homologous proteins representatives of family 1 of viral rhodopsins, OLPVR1 and VirChR1. VirChR1 is a highly selective, Ca2+-dependent, Na+/K+- conducting channel and, in contrast to known cation channelrhodopsins (ChRs), is impermeable to Ca2+ ions. In human neuroblastoma cells, upon illumination, VirChR1 depolarizes the cell membrane to a level sufficient to fire neurons. It suggests its unique optogenetic potential. 1.4 [A] resolution structure of OLPVR1 reveals their remarkable difference from the known channelrhodopsins and a unique ion-conducting pathway. The data suggest that viral channelrhodopsins mediate phototaxis of algae enhancing the host anabolic processes to support virus reproduction, and therefore, their key role in global phytoplankton dynamics.",

In this study we show that mice containing the S47 variant have increased mTOR activity, increased oxidative metabolism, larger size, and improved metabolic efficiency. Mechanistically, we show that there is increased association between mTOR and its positive regulator Rheb in S47 cells, due to altered redox state of GAPDH, which normally binds and sequesters Rheb. Compounds that decrease glutathione in S47 cells normalize GAPDH-Rheb complex formation and mTOR activity.

Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride, MET), has been shown to decrease tumor cell proliferation, but its effects have yet to be explored with respect to the crosstalk between monocytes and breast cancer cells. Here, we investigated the effects of MET on overall phenotypic functional activities of autologous MOs during the interplay with primary breast cancer cells.\n\nMethodsHuman primary breast cancer cells were either cultured alone or co-cultured with autologous MOs before treatment with MET.\n\nResultsMET downregulated both breast cancer cell proliferation and the ratio of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt)-to-Akt in breast cancer cells. Additionally, we observed that, in the absence of MET treatment, the levels of LDH-based cytotoxicity, catalase, intracellular free calcium ions (ifCa2+), IL-10 and arginase activity were significantly reduced in co-cultures compared to those of MOs cultivated alone whereas levels of iNOS were significantly increased (for all comparisons, p < 0.05). In contrast, MET upregulated breast cancer cell LDH-based cytotoxicity levels when co-cultured with MO. MET also induced upregulation of both the inducible enzymatic activity of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase activity in MO cells and co-culture systems, although these differences did not reach significant levels for iNOS activity (p > 0.05). MET greatly decreased phagocytic activity in isolated MOs while inducing a robust increase of catalase activity in co-culture systems and of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in MOs, but not in MOs co-cultured with breast cancer cells. MET strongly upregulated the levels of ifCa2+ in co-culture systems and IFN-{gamma} production in both isolated MOs and co-culture systems. Moreover, MET treatment markedly downregulated IL-10 production in MOs, while inducing a slight increase in co-cultures (p > 0.05).\n\nConclusionsOur results show that the phenotypic functional activities of MOs change when co-cultured with primary human breast cancer cells.

Surprisingly, the bNAb VRC01, when administered concomitantly with the cessation of successful antiretroviral therapy (ART), failed rapidly in chronic HIV-1 patients. We hypothesized that the failure was due to VRC01-resistant strains that were formed before ART initiation, survived ART in latently infected cells, and were reactivated during VRC01 therapy. Current assay limitations preclude testing this hypothesis experimentally. We developed a mathematical model based on the hypothesis and challenged it with available clinical data. The model integrated within-host HIV-1 evolution, stochastic latency reactivation and viral dynamics with multiple dose VRC01 pharmacokinetics. With a virtual patient population, model predictions quantitatively captured data from two independent clinical trials. Accordingly, we attributed VRC01 failure to single-mutant VRC01-resistant proviruses in the latent reservoir triggering viral recrudescence, particularly during trough VRC01 levels.

Here, we introduce a novel multivariate analysis method for conventional blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) that allows to study sequentially activated neural patterns separated by less than 100 ms with anatomical precision. Human participants underwent fMRI and were presented with sequences of visual stimuli separated by 32 to 2048 ms. Probabilistic pattern classifiers were trained on fMRI data to detect the presence of image-specific activation patterns in early visual and ventral temporal cortex. The classifiers were then applied to data recorded during sequences of the same images presented at increasing speeds. Our results show that probabilistic classifier time courses allowed to detect neural representations and their order, even when images were separated by only 32 ms. Moreover, the frequency spectrum of the statistical sequentiality metric distinguished between sequence speeds on sub-second versus supra-second time scales. These results survived when data with high levels of noise and rare sequence events at unknown times were analyzed. Our method promises to lay the groundwork for novel investigations of fast neural computations in the human brain, such as hippocampal replay.",

    "abstract": "Cellular DNA is under constant attack by a wide variety of agents, both endogenous and exogenous. To counteract DNA damage, human cells have a large collection of DNA repair factors. Among them, DNA polymerase lambda (Pol{lambda}) stands out for its versatility, as it participates in different DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways in which gap-filling DNA synthesis is required. In this work we show that human Pol{lambda} is conjugated with Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) proteins both in vitro and in vivo, with Lys27 being the main target of this covalent modification. Pol{lambda} SUMOylation takes place in the nuclear pore complex and is mediated by the E3 ligase RanBP2. This post-translational modification promotes Pol{lambda} entry into the nucleus, which is required for its recruitment to DNA lesions and stimulated by DNA damage induction. Our work represents an advance in the knowledge of molecular pathways that regulate cellular localization of human Pol{lambda}, which are essential to be able to perform its functions during repair of nuclear DNA, and that might constitute an important point for the modulation of its activity in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Decline in the skeletal muscle stem cell (MuSC) function is a major contributor to age-associated impairments in muscle regeneration and function. The ability of MuSCs to activate (i.e. exit quiescence, enter the cell cycle, and divide) following injury is a critical step that initiates muscle regeneration. However, the mechanisms that regulate MuSC activation function are poorly understood. Here, we show that the activation function, specifically the speed by which cells progress through G0-G1, declines tremendously with age in mouse MuSCs. Using a number of in vivo models and ex vivo assays of MuSC activation and muscle regenerative functions, live cell metabolic flux analyses, and metabolomics we present data indicating that changes in MuSC mitochondrial flux underlie age-associated changes in MuSC activation. We show that, in the course of MuSC activation, there is a profound,16-fold, increase in ATP production rates, which is fueled largely by increases in pyruvate flux into mitochondria. We found that MuSCs from aged mice display progressive defects in the ability to increase mitochondrial flux during activation and that this correlates with higher levels of phosphorylated, inactivated, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Importantly, we demonstrate that pharmacologic and physiologic methods to induce dephosphorylation and activation of PDH in MuSCs are sufficient to rescue the activation and muscle regenerative functions of MuSCs in aged mice. Collectively the data presented show that MuSC mitochondrial function is a central regulator of MuSC activation and muscle regenerative functions. Moreover, our results suggest that approaches to increase MuSC pyruvate oxidation may have therapeutic potential to promote muscle repair and regeneration.",

Molecular mechanisms that enable both robust cell type proportioning despite variable initial conditions in the precursor cells, as well as the re-establishment of these proportions upon perturbations in a developing tissue remain to be characterized. Here we report that the differentiation of robust proportions of epiblast-like and primitive endoderm-like cells in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures emerges at the population level through cell-cell communication via a short-range FGF4 signal. We characterize the molecular and dynamical properties of the communication mechanism, and show how it controls both robust cell type proportioning from a wide range of experimentally controlled initial conditions, as well as the autonomous re-establishment of these proportions following the isolation of one cell type. The generation and maintenance of reproducible proportions of discrete cell types is a new function for FGF signaling that may operate in a range of developing tissues.",

    "abstract": "Skeleton extraction from 3D plant point cloud data is an essential prior for myriads of phenotyping studies. Although skeleton extraction from 3D shapes have been studied extensively in the computer vision and graphics literature, handling the case of plants is still an open problem. Drawbacks of the existing approaches include the zigzag structure of the skeleton, nonuniform density of skeleton points, lack of points in the areas having complex geometry structure, and most importantly the lack of biological relevance. With the aim to improve existing skeleton structures of state-of-the-art, we propose a stochastic framework which is supported by the biological structure of the original plant (we consider plants without any leaves). Initially we estimate the branching structure of the plant by the notion of {beta}-splines to form a curve tree defined as a finite set of curves joined in a tree topology with certain level of smoothness. In the next phase, we force the discrete points in the curve tree to move towards the original point cloud by treating each point in the curve tree as a center of Gaussian, and points in the input cloud data as observations from the Gaussians. The task is to find the correct locations of the Gaussian centroids by maximizing a likelihood. The optimization technique is iterative and is based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step estimates which Gaussian the observed point cloud was sampled from, and the M-step maximizes the negative log-likelihood that the observed points were sampled from the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with respect to the model parameters. We experiment with several real world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate the robustness of the approach over the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Shortage of raw materials needed to manufacture components for silicon-based digital memory storage has led to a search for alternatives, including systems for storing texts, images, movies and other forms of information in DNA. Use of DNA as a medium for storage of 3-D information has also been investigated. However, two problems have yet to be addressed: first, storage of 3-D information in DNA has used objects and coding schemes which require large volumes of data; second, the medium used for DNA information-keeping has been inconsistent with qualities needed for long-term data storage. Here, we address these problems. First, we created in vivo DNA-encoded digital archives holding precise specifications for 3- and 4-dimensional figures with unprecedented efficiency. Second, we have demonstrated more robust and longer-lasting information-carriers than earlier repositories for DNA-based data archives by inserting digital information into the halophile, Halobacterium salinarum, an extremophilic archaeon. We then embedded Information-keeping halophiles into crystalline mineral salts in which similar organisms have been shown to persist in stasis for hundreds of millions of years. We propose that digital information archives composed in 3 or more dimensions may be inserted into halophilic organisms and preserved intact for indefinite periods of time.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) from different human organs possess organ-specific characteristics that support specific tissue regeneration and organ development. EC specificity are identified by both intrinsic and extrinsic cues, among which, parenchyma and organ-specific microenvironment are critical contributors. These extrinsic cues are, however, largely lost during ex vivo cultures. Outstanding challenges remain to understand and re-establish EC organ-specificity for in vitro studies to recapitulate human organ-specific physiology. Here, we designed an open microfluidic platform to study the role of human kidney tubular epithelial cells in supporting EC specificity. The platform consists of two independent cell culture regions segregated with a half wall; culture media is added to connect the two culture regions at a desired timepoint, and signaling molecules can travel across the half wall (paracrine signaling). Specifically, we report that in the microscale coculture device, primary human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HPTECs) rescued primary human kidney peritubular microvascular EC (HKMEC) monolayer integrity and fenestra formation, and HPTECs upregulated key HKMEC kidney-specific genes (HNF1B, AJAP1, KCNJ16) and endothelial activation genes (VCAM1, MMP7, MMP10) in coculture. Co-culturing with HPTECs also promoted kidney-specific genotype expression in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs), and human pluripotent stem cell-derived ECs (hPSC-ECs). In comparison to the culture in HPTEC conditioned media, co-culture of ECs with HPTECs showed increased upregulation of kidney specific genes, suggesting potential bidirectional paracrine signaling. Importantly, our device is compatible with standard pipettes, incubators, and imaging readouts, and could also be easily adapted to study cell signaling between other rare or sensitive cells.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) target search on genome is highly essential for gene expression and regulation. High-resolution determination of TF diffusion along DNA remains technically challenging. Here we constructed a TF model system of the plant WRKY domain protein in complex with DNA from crystallography and demonstrated microsecond diffusion dynamics of WRKY on the DNA employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Notably, we found that WRKY preferentially binds to the Crick strand of DNA with significantly stronger energetic association than to the Watson strand. The preferential binding becomes highly prominent from non-specific to specific DNA binding, but less distinct from static binding to diffusive movements of WRKY on the DNA. Remarkably, without employing acceleration forces or bias, we captured a complete one-base pair (bp) stepping cycle of WRKY tracking along major groove of DNA with homogenous (AT)n sequence, as individual protein-DNA contacts break and reform at the binding interface. Continuous tracking of WRKY forward or backward, with occasional sliding as well as strand crossing to the minor groove of DNA, have also been captured in the simulation. The processive diffusion of WRKY had been confirmed by accompanied single-molecule fluorescence assays and coarse-grained (CG) structural simulations. The study thus provides unprecedented structural dynamics details on the TF diffusion, suggests how TF possibly approaches to gene target, and supports further high-precision experimental follow-up. The stochastic movements revealed in the TF diffusion also provide general clues on how other nucleic acid walkers step and slide along DNA.\n\nSignificance StatementHow transcription factors search for target genes impact on how quickly and accurately the genes are transcribed and expressed. To locate target sufficiently fast, 1D diffusion of the protein along DNA appears essential. Experimentally, it remains challenging to determine diffusional steps of protein on DNA. Here, we report all-atom equilibrium simulations of a WRKY protein binding and diffusing on DNA, revealing structural dynamics details which have not been identified previously. We unprecedently demonstrate a complete stepping cycle of the protein for one base pair on DNA within microseconds, along with stochastic stepping or sliding, directional switching, and strand crossing. Additionally, we have found preferential DNA strand association of WRKY. These suggest how protein factors approach toward target DNA sequences.",

Here, using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) for nanoscale protein mapping, we reveal that POC16 and its human homolog WDR90 are components of the centriolar microtubule wall along the central core region of the centriole. We further found that WDR90 is an evolutionary microtubule associated protein with a predicted structurally homology with the ciliary inner junction protein FAP20. Finally, we demonstrate that WDR90 depletion impairs the localization of inner scaffold components, leading to centriole structural abnormalities in both human and Chlamydomonas cells. Altogether, this work highlights that POC16/WDR90 is a crucial evolutionary conserved molecular player participating in centriole architecture integrity.",

Unrepaired DPCs lead to genomic instability, cancer, neurodegeneration and accelerated ageing. DPC proteolysis was recently discovered as a specialised pathway for DPC repair. The DNA-dependent SPRTN protease and 26S proteasome emerged as as two independent proteolytic systems for DPC repair. DPCs are also repaired by homologous recombination (HR), a canonical DNA repair pathway. While studying the role of ubiquitin and SUMO in DPC repair, we identified mutually exclusive signalling mechanisms associated with DPC repair pathway choice. DPC modification by SUMO-1 favours SPRTN proteolysis as the preferred pathway for DPC repair. DPC SUMOylation counteracts DPC ubiquitination, which promotes DNA breaks and the switch to HR. We propose that modification of DPCs by SUMO-1 promotes SPRTN proteolysis, which is essential for DPC removal to prevent DNA replication defects, chromosomal recombination and genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "Transformed astrocytes in the most aggressive form cause glioblastoma, the most common cancer in central nervous system with high mortality. The physiological electric field by neuronal local field potentials and tissue polarity may guide the infiltration of glioblastoma cells through the electrotaxis process. However, microenvironments with multiplex gradients are difficult to create. In this work, we have developed a hybrid microfluidic platform to study glioblastoma electrotaxis in controlled microenvironments with high through-put quantitative analysis by a machine learning-powered single cell tracking software. By equalizing the hydrostatic pressure difference between inlets and outlets of the microchannel, uniform single cells can be seeded reliably inside the microdevice. The electrotaxis of two glioblastoma models, T98G and U-251MG, require optimal laminin-containing extracellular matrix and exhibits opposite directional and electro-alignment tendencies. Calcium signaling is a key contributor in glioblastoma pathophysiology but its role in glioblastoma electrotaxis is still an open question. Anodal T98G electrotaxis and cathodal U-251MG electrotaxis require the presence of extracellular calcium cations. U-251MG electrotaxis is dependent on the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and T98G is dependent on the R-type VGCC. U-251MG and T98G electrotaxis are also mediated by A-type (rapidly inactivating) voltage-gated potassium channels and acid-sensing sodium channels. The involvement of multiple ion channels suggests that the glioblastoma electrotaxis is complex and patient-specific ion channel expression can be critical to develop personalized therapeutics to fight against cancer metastasis. The hybrid microfluidic design and machine learning-powered single cell analysis provide a simple and flexible platform for quantitative investigation of complicated biological systems.",

    "abstract": "As sensory information moves through the brain, higher-order areas exhibit more complex tuning than lower areas. Though models predict this complexity is due to convergent inputs from neurons with diverse response properties, in most vertebrate systems convergence has only been inferred rather than tested directly. Here we measure sensory computations in zebrafish vestibular neurons across multiple axes in vivo. We establish that whole-cell physiological recordings reveal tuning of individual vestibular afferent inputs and their postsynaptic targets. An independent approach, serial section electron microscopy, supports the inferred connectivity. We find that afferents with similar or differing preferred directions converge on central vestibular neurons, conferring more simple or complex tuning, respectively. Our data also resolve a long-standing contradiction between anatomical and physiological analyses by revealing that sensory responses are produced by sparse but powerful inputs from vestibular afferents. Together these results provide a direct, quantifiable demonstration of feedforward input convergence in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Plants enhance their growth in the presence of particular soil bacteria due to volatile compounds affecting the homeostasis of plant growth hormones. However, the mechanisms of volatile compound signaling and plant perception has been unclear. This study identifies the bioactive volatile 3-octanone as a plant growth stimulating volatile, constitutively emitted by the soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor grown on a rich medium. When 3-octanone is applied to developing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, a family-wide induction of the Kelch-repeat F-box genes known as KISS ME DEADLY (KMD) subsequently alters auxin/cytokinin homeostasis to promote the growth of lateral roots and inhibit the primary root. Loss of function of the KMD family or other alterations of auxin/cytokinin homeostasis suppresses the volatile-induced growth response. This reveals a function of KMDs in the pathway of microbial volatile perception and plant growth responses.\n\nSignificance StatementVolatiles from soil microbes are profound stimulators of plant growth. This work identifies for the first time a plant hormone signaling regulator, the gene family KISS ME DEADLY (KMD), to be an early essential step in plant growth promotion by a soil bacterial volatile, 3-octanone. The KMD-regulated gene network alters the tissue sensitivity balance for the growth hormones auxin and cytokinin, modifying root growth rate and architecture. Previously, the Kelch repeat F-box gene family of KMDs have been shown to be important down-regulators of both positive cytokinin signaling and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, but upstream cues were unknown. This report places the KMD family regulation of plant growth and defense into its biotic context.",

In our strategy, a sacrificial layer is applied in the dual photolithography patterning to achieve a one-dimensional channel with a very low aspect ratio (1:10,000). Microalgae/bacteria mixture is then introduced into the deformable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nano-channel. The hydrodynamic deformation of the nano-channel is regulated to allow the bacteria cells to pass through while leaving the microalgae cells trapped in the device. At a flow rate of 4 l/min, ~100% of the microalgae cells are trapped in the device. Additionally, this device is capable of immobilizing single cells in a transparent channel for auto-fluorescence tracking. These microalgae cells demonstrate minimal photo-bleaching over 250 s laser exposure and can be used to monitor hazardous compounds in the sample with a continuous flow fashion.

    "abstract": "Trauma-related necrotizing myocutaneous mucormycosis (NMM) has a high morbidity and mortality in victims of combat-related injuries, geo-meteorological disasters, and severe burns. Inspired by the observation that several recent clusters of NMM have been associated with extreme mechanical forces (e.g. during tornados), we studied the impact of mechanical stress on Mucoralean biology and virulence in a Drosophila melanogaster infection model. In contrast to other experimental procedures to exert mechanical stress, tornadic shear challenge (TSC) by magnetic stirring induced a hyper-virulent phenotype in several clinically relevant Mucorales species but not in Aspergillus or Fusarium. Whereas fungal growth rates, morphogenesis, and susceptibility to noxious environments or phagocytes were not altered by TSC, soluble factors released in the supernatant of shear-challenged R. arrhizus spores rendered static spores hyper-virulent. Consistent with a rapid decay of TSC-induced hyper-virulence, minimal transcriptional changes were revealed by comparative RNA sequencing analysis of static and shear-challenged Rhizopus arrhizus. However, inhibition of the calcineurin/heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) stress response circuitry by cyclosporine A (CsA) and tanespimycin abrogated the increased pathogenicity of R. arrhizus spores following TSC. Similarly, calcineurin loss-of-function mutants of Mucor circinelloides displayed no increased virulence capacity in flies after undergoing TSC. Collectively, these results establish that TSC induces hyper-virulence specifically in Mucorales and point out the calcineurin/hsp90 pathway as a key orchestrator of this phenotype. Our findings invite future studies of topical calcineurin inhibitor treatment of wounds as an adjunct mitigation strategy for NMM following high-energy trauma.\n\nSignificanceGiven the limited efficacy of current medical treatments in trauma-related necrotizing mucormycosis, there is a dire need to better understand the Mucoralean pathophysiology in order to develop novel strategies to counteract fungal tissue invasion following severe trauma. Here, we describe that tornadic shear stress challenge transiently induces a hyper-virulent phenotype in various pathogenic Mucorales species but not in other molds known to cause wound infections. Our data support a model whereby shear stress-induced hyper-virulence is primarily driven by soluble factors and orchestrated by the calcineurin/hsp90 pathway. Importantly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of calcineurin signaling abrogated hyper-virulence in shear stress-challenged Mucorales, encouraging further evaluation of (topical) calcineurin inhibitors to improve therapeutic outcomes of NMM after combat-related blast injuries or violent storms.",

    "abstract": "As third generation sequencing technologies become more reliable and widely used to solve several genome-related problems, self-correction of long reads is becoming the preferred method to reduce the error rate of Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore long reads, that is now around 10-12%. Several of these self-correction methods rely on some form of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) to obtain a consensus sequence for the original reads. In particular, error-correction tools such as RACON and CONSENT use Partial Order (PO) graph alignment to accomplish this task. PO graph alignment, which is computationally more expensive than optimal global pairwise alignment between two sequences, needs to be performed several times for each read during the error correction process. GPUs have proven very effective in accelerating several compute-intensive tasks in different scientific fields. We harnessed the power of these architectures to accelerate the error correction process of existing self-correction tools, to improve the efficiency of this step of genome analysis.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated version of the PO alignment presented in the POA v2 software library, implemented on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. We obtain up to 6.5x speedup compared to 64 CPU threads run on two 2.3 GHz 16-core Intel Xeon Processors E5-2698 v3. In our implementation we focused on the alignment of smaller sequences, as the CONSENT segmentation strategy based on k-mer chaining provides an optimal opportunity to exploit the parallel-processing power of GPUs. To demonstrate this, we have integrated our kernel in the CONSENT software. This accelerated version of CONSENT provides a speedup for the whole error correction step that ranges from 1.95x to 8.5x depending on the input reads.",

The heart is one of the main target organs of arsenic damage, but the preventive and curative measures underlying arsenic poisoning are not clear. To investigate the effect of tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on the injury of H9C2 cardiomyocytes induced by NaAsO2,H9C2 cardiomyocyteswere divided into four groups where control group with general medium, arsenic (As) group received sodium arsenite (NaAsO2)-containing general medium, STS pretreatment+As group and finally the STS alone group. Compared with the control group, different concentrations of STS had no significant effect on the cell viability (n = 6, P > 0.05); Compared with the control group, there was no significant change in the viability of cells treated with arsenic for 12 h after STS pretreatment for 6 h (n = 6, P > 0.05),the viability of cells treated with NaAsO2 alone was decreased(n = 6, P < 0.05);Compared with the control group, the cell viability was decreased after STS pretreatment for 12h and arsenic for 24h, the cell viability of NaAsO2 group was also decreased, the viability of NaAsO2 cells was lower than that of STS pretreated for 12h with NaAsO2 for 24h(n=6,p<0.05).The content of Caspase 3/7 in the NaAsO2 group was higher than that in the STS and NaAsO2 group and the Control group and STS group after 12h, the differences were statistically significant(n=6,p<0.05).After STS pretreatment for 12h and NaAsO2 for 24 h, there was no significant difference in Caspase 8 content between NaAsO2 group and other groups(n=6,P>0.05) As a result, Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate can attenuate the injury of H9C2 cardiomyocytes induced by sodium arsenite.",

    "abstract": "While vital to platelet and leukocyte adhesion, the role of integrin affinity modulation in adherent cells remains controversial. In endothelial cells, atheroprone hemodynamics and oxidized lipoproteins drive an increase in the high affinity conformation of 5{beta}1 integrins in endothelial cells in vitro, and 5{beta}1 integrin inhibitors reduce proinflammatory endothelial activation to these stimuli in vitro and in vivo. However, the importance of 5{beta}1 integrin affinity modulation to endothelial phenotype remains unknown. We now show that endothelial cells (talin1 L325R) unable to induce high affinity integrins initially adhere and spread, but show significant defects in nascent adhesion formation. In contrast, overall focal adhesion number, area, and composition in stably adherent cells are similar between talin1 wildtype and talin1 L325R endothelial cells. However, talin1 L325R endothelial cells fail to induce high affinity 5{beta}1 integrins, fibronectin deposition, and proinflammatory responses to atheroprone hemodynamics and oxidized lipoproteins. Inducing the high affinity conformation of 5{beta}1 integrins in talin1 L325R cells partially restores fibronectin deposition, whereas NF-{kappa}B activation and maximal fibronectin deposition require both integrin activation and other integrin-independent signaling. In endothelial-specific talin1 L325R mice, atheroprone hemodynamics fail to promote inflammation and macrophage recruitment, demonstrating a vital role for integrin activation in regulating endothelial phenotype.",

However, little is known about the adaptation mechanisms of H. pylori when the environment changes from the outside to the inside of the living body. Here we show that small non-coding RNA HPnc4160 is a crucial novel RNA molecule of H. pylori that negatively regulates bacterial-host adaptation and gastric cancer. H. pylori isolated from gerbils stomachs eight weeks post-infection acquired mutations in the increased number of T-repeats within the upstream region of the HPnc4160 coding region, which leads to reduced HPnc4160 expression levels that also seen in cancer patients-derived H. pylori. By comparing RNA-seq and iTRAQ analysis between wild-type and hpnc4160 deficient mutant strains, we identified eight targets of HPnc4160 including cagA and unknown factors. Mice infection experiment revealed that the hpnc4160 deficient mutant had a higher number of colonized bacteria in the mice stomach than the wild-type strain, indicating that reduced expression levels of HPnc4160 was important for bacterial host adaptation. The expression level of HPnc4160 was lower in the clinical isolates derived from gastric cancer patients compared with non-cancer-derived strains, while the mRNA expression levels of target factors were higher.

    "abstract": "Northern peatlands are experiencing more frequent fire events as a result of changing climate conditions. Forest fires naturally result in a direct and negative climate impact by emitting large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Recent studies show that this extensive emission may shift the soil carbon regime from a sink to a source. However, the fires also convert parts of the burnt biomass into pyrogenic carbon. Here, we show an indirect, but positive, climate impact induced by fire-derived pyrogenic carbon. We found that the accumulation of pyrogenic carbon reduced post-fire methane production from peatland soils by 13-24%. The conductive, capacitive, and redox-cycling electron transfer mechanisms enabled pyrogenic carbon to function as an electron snorkel, which redirected soil electron fluxes to facilitate alternative microbial respiration and reduced the rate of methane production by 50%. Given the fact that methane has a 34-fold greater warming potential than carbon dioxide, we estimate that global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 35 Tg CO2e annually through the electron snorkeling of pyrogenic carbon in peatlands. Our results highlight an important, but overlooked, function of pyrogenic carbon in neutralizing forest fire emissions and call for its consideration in the global carbon budget estimation.",

To evaluate existing risk prediction algorithms and the impact of including addition genetic risk on the performance of prediction.\n\nMethodsWe identified individuals with incident PD diagnoses (n=1276) and unmatched controls (n=500,406) in UK Biobank. We determined the association of risk factors with incident PD using adjusted logistic regression models. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was constructed and used to examine gene-environment interactions. The PRS was also incorporated into a previously-developed prediction algorithm for finding incident cases.\n\nResultsStrong evidence of association (Pcorr<0.05) was found between PD and a positive family history of PD, a positive family history of dementia, non-smoking, low alcohol consumption, depression, and daytime somnolence, and novel associations with epilepsy and earlier menarche. Individuals with the highest 10% of PRS scores had increased risk of PD (OR=3.30, 95% CI 2.57-4.24) compared to the lowest risk decile. Higher PRS scores were associated with earlier age at PD diagnosis and inclusion of the PRS in the PREDICT-PD algorithm improved model performance (Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 0.0053, p=6.87x10-14). We found evidence of interaction between the PRS and diabetes.\n\nInterpretationHere we used UK Biobank data to reproduce several well-known associations with PD, to demonstrate the validity and predictive power of a polygenic risk score, and to demonstrate a novel gene-environment interaction, whereby the effect of diabetes on PD risk appears to depend on prior genetic risk for PD.",

    "abstract": "The red algae Kappaphycus alvarezii is the most important aquaculture species in Kappaphycus, widely distributed in tropical waters, and it has become the main crop of carrageenan production at present. The mechanisms of adaptation for high temperature, high salinity environments and carbohydrate metabolism may provide an important inspiration for marine algae study. Scientific background knowledge such as genomic data will be also essential to improve disease resistance and production traits of K. alvarezii. 43.28 Gb short paired-end reads and 18.52 Gb single-molecule long reads of K. alvarezii were generated by Illumina HiSeq platform and Pacbio RSII platform respectively. The de novo genome assembly was performed using Falcon_unzip and Canu software, and then improved with Pilon. The final assembled genome (336 Mb) consists of 888 scaffolds with a contig N50 of 849 Kb. Further annotation analyses predicted 21,422 protein-coding genes, with 61.28% functionally annotated. Here we report the draft genome and annotations of K. alvarezii, which are valuable resources for future genomic and genetic studies in Kappaphycus and other algae.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic diversity of culturable actinobacteria isolated from the intertidal regions of west coast of Maharashtra, India was studied using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Total of 140 actinobacterial isolates were obtained, which belonged to 14 genera, 10 families and 65 putative species with Streptomyces being the most dominant (63%) genus followed by Nocardiopsis and Micromonospora. They were screened for production of extracellular protease inhibitors (PI) against three pure proteases viz. chymotrypsin, trypsin, subtilisin and one crude extracellular protease from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eighty percent of the isolates showed PI activity against at least one of the four proteases, majority of them belonged to genus Streptomyes. Actinobacterial diversity from two sites Ade (17{degrees}52' N, 73{degrees}04' E) and Harnai (17{degrees}48' N, 73{degrees}05' E) with varying degree of anthropological pressure showed that more putative species diversity was obtained from site with lower human intervention i.e Ade (Shannons H 3.45) than from Harnai (Shannons H 2.83), a site with more human intervention. Further, in Ade percentage of isolates not showing PI activity against any of the proteases was close to 21% and that in Harnai was close to 9%. Considering human activities in the coastal region might be contributing to increasing the organic load and in turn increasing the presence of extracellular enzymes in the intertidal environments it would be interesting to look at the association of PI production and organic load in these habitats.",

Here we demonstrate that the non-neuronal ENS cell compartment of teleosts shares molecular and morphological characteristics with mammalian enteric glia but cannot be identified by the expression of canonical glia markers. However, unlike their mammalian counterparts, which are generally quiescent and do not undergo neuronal differentiation during homeostasis, we show that a relatively high proportion of zebrafish enteric glia proliferate under physiological conditions giving rise to progeny that differentiate into enteric neurons. We also provide evidence that, similar to brain neural stem cells, the activation and neuronal differentiation of enteric glia are regulated by Notch signalling. Our experiments reveal remarkable similarities between enteric glia and brain neural stem cells in teleosts and open new possibilities for use of mammalian enteric glia as a potential source of neurons to restore the activity of intestinal neural circuits compromised by injury or disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder with the clinical hallmarks of motor and phonic tics which are associated with hyperactivity in dopaminergic networks. Dopaminergic hyperactivity in the basal ganglia has previously been linked to increased sensitivity to positive reinforcement and increases in choice impulsivity.\n\nObjectiveWe address whether this extends to changes in temporal discounting, where impulsivity is operationalized as an increased preference to choose smaller-but-sooner over larger-but-later rewards. Results are discussed with respect to neural models of temporal discounting, dopaminergic alterations in Tourette syndrome and the developmental trajectory of temporal discounting.\n\nMethodsIn the first study we included nineteen adolescent patients with Tourette syndrome and nineteen age- and education matched controls. In the second study, we compared twenty-five adult patients with Tourette syndrome and twenty-five age- and education-matched controls.\n\nResultsIn the light of the dopaminergic hyperactivity model, we predicted differences in temporal discounting in patients with Tourette syndrome. However, computational modeling of choice behavior using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation revealed reduced impulsive choice in adolescent patients, and no group differences in adults.\n\nConclusionWe speculate that adolescents might show reduced discounting due to improved inhibitory functions that also affect choice impulsivity and/or the developmental trajectory of executive control functions. The absence of an effect in adults might be due to differences in the clinical population (e.g. patients who acquired successful tic inhibition during adolescence might have gone into remission). Future studies would benefit from adopting longitudinal approaches to further elucidate the developmental trajectory of these effects.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction is thought to contribute to the severity of psychiatric disorders; however, it has been unclear whether current high-simple-sugar diets contribute to pathogenesis of these diseases. Here we demonstrate that a high-sucrose diet during adolescence induces psychosis-related behavioral endophenotypes, including hyperactivity, poor working memory, impaired sensory gating, and disrupted interneuron function in mice deficient for glyoxalase-1 (Glo1), an enzyme involved in detoxification of sucrose metabolites. Further, the high-sucrose diet induced microcapillary impairments and reduced brain glucose uptake in brains of Glo1 deficient mice. Aspirin protected against this angiopathy, enhancing brain glucose uptake, and preventing abnormal behavioral phenotypes. Similar vascular damage to our model mice was found in the brains of randomly collected schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, suggesting that psychiatric disorders are associated with angiopathy in the brain caused by various environmental stresses, including metabolic stress.",

    "abstract": "Path integration spatial navigation processes are emerging as promising cognitive markers for prodromal and clinical Alzheimers disease (AD). However, such path integration changes have been little explored in Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), despite neurovascular change being a major contributing factor to dementia and potentially AD. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of path integration impairments in VCI compared to AD is unclear. In the current pilot study, we explore path integration performance in AD and VCI patient groups and hypothesise that i) medial parietal mediated egocentric processes will be more affected in VCI and ii) medial temporal mediated allocentric processes will be more affected in AD. This retrospective cross-sectional study included early stage VCI patients (n=9), AD patients (n=10) and healthy age-matched controls (n=20). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as spatial navigation testing. The spatial navigation tests included the virtual reality  Supermarket task assessing egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (map-based) navigation as well as the  Clock Orientation test assessing egocentric and path integration processes. Results showed that egocentric path integration processes are only impaired in VCI, potentially distinguishing it from AD. However, in contrast to our prediction, allocentric path integration was similarly impaired for VCI and AD. These preliminary findings suggest limited specificity of allocentric path integration deficits between VCI and AD. By contrast, egocentric path integration deficits emerge as more specific to VCI, potentially allowing for more specific diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for vascular impairment in dementia.",

    "abstract": "The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a critical node within the basal ganglia circuit. Phasic changes in the activity of GPe neurons during movement and their alterations in Parkinsons disease (PD) argue that the GPe is important in motor control. PV+ neurons and Npas1+ neurons are the two principal neuron classes in the GPe. The distinct electrophysiological properties and axonal projection patterns argue that these two neuron classes serve different roles in regulating motor output. However, the causal relationship between GPe neuron classes and movement remains to be established. Here, by using optogenetic approaches in mice (both males and females), we showed that PV+ neurons and Npas1+ neurons promoted and suppressed locomotion, respectively. Moreover, PV+ neurons and Npas1+ neurons are under different synaptic influences from the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Additionally, we found a selective weakening of STN inputs to PV+ neurons in the chronic 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of PD. This finding reinforces the idea that the reciprocally connected GPe-STN network plays a key role in disease symptomatology and thus provides the basis for future circuit-based therapies.\n\nSignificance StatementThe external pallidum is a key, yet an understudied component of the basal ganglia. Neural activity in the pallidum goes awry in neurological diseases, such as Parkinsons disease. While this strongly argues that the pallidum plays a critical role in motor control, it has been difficult to establish the causal relationship between pallidal activity and motor (dys)function. This was in part due to the cellular complexity of the pallidum. Here, we showed that the two principal neuron types in the pallidum have opposing roles in motor control. In addition, we described the differences in their synaptic influence. Importantly, our research provides new insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that explain the hypokinetic features of Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Advances in technology have allowed for the study of metabolomics in the context of disease, enabling the discovery of new potential risk factors, diagnostic markers, and drug targets. For neurological and psychiatric phenotypes, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is of particular biomedical importance as it is in direct contact with the brain and spinal cord. However, the CSF metabolome is difficult to study on a large scale due to the relative complexity of the procedure needed to collect the fluid compared to blood or urine studies. Here, we present a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS), an analysis using individual-level genetic and metabolomic data from two cohorts to impute metabolites into large samples with genome-wide association summary statistics. We conducted a metabolome-wide genome-wide association analysis with 338 CSF metabolites, identifying 16 genotype-metabolite associations, 6 of which were novel. Using these results, we then built prediction models for all available CSF metabolites and tested for associations with 27 neurological and psychiatric phenotypes in large cohorts, identifying 19 significant CSF metabolite-phenotype associations. Our results demonstrate the potential of MWAS to overcome the logistic challenges inherent in cerebrospinal fluid research to study the role of metabolomics in brain-related phenotypes and the feasibility of this framework for similar studies of omic data in scarce sample types.",

    "abstract": "Channels that are permeable to small molecules such as ATP, in addition to atomic ions, are emerging as important regulators in health and disease. Nonetheless, mechanisms of molecular permeation and selectivity of these channels remain mostly unexplored due to the lack of quantitative methodologies. To address this need, we developed a novel two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC)/dye uptake assay to examine the kinetics of molecular permeation of channels formed by human connexins (hCx), and the calcium homeostasis modulator (hCALHM1). We expressed hCx26, hCx30, and hCALHM1 individually in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To quantify the uptake of small molecular dyes through these channels, we developed a protocol that renders oocytes translucent - thereby amenable to optical detection techniques - without affecting the functional properties of the expressed channels. To control membrane potential and to determine functional channel expression accurately, dye uptake was evaluated in conjunction with TEVC. Using this methodology, we found that: (1) CALHM1 and Cx30 hemichannels display saturable transport of molecules that could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with apparent KM and Vmax; (2) Kinetic parameters for molecular transport through CALHM1 are sensitive to voltage and extracellular calcium; (3) Significant transport of molecules occurs through CALHM1 when there are little or no ionic currents through the channels; (4) Cx mutations in the N-terminal region significantly affect kinetics of transport and permselectivity. Our results reveal that molecular flux through these channels has a rate-limiting step, that the kinetic parameters of molecular transport are sensitive to modulators of channel gating and that molecular transport and ionic currents can be differentially affected. Our methodology allows the analysis of how human mutations causing diseases affect kinetic properties and permselectivity of molecular signaling and enables the study of molecular mechanisms, including selectivity and saturability, associated with molecular transport in large-pore channels.",

Super-resolution microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit by localizing individual fluorescing molecules in a field of view. This is particularly difficult since each individual molecule appears and disappears randomly across time and because the total number of molecules in the field of view is unknown. Additionally, data sets acquired with super-resolution microscopes can contain a large number of spurious fluorescent fluctuations caused by background noise.\n\nTo address these problems, we present a Bayesian nonparametric framework capable of identifying individual emitting molecules in super-resolved time series. We tackle the localization problem in the case in which each individual molecule is already localized in space. First, we collapse observations in time and develop a fast algorithm that builds upon the Dirichlet process. Next, we augment the model to account for the temporal aspect of fluorophore photo-physics. Finally, we assess the performance of our methods with ground-truth data sets having known biological structure.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionGlucose has been deemed the driving force of tumor growth for decades. However, research has shown that several tumors metabolically shift towards glutaminolysis. The development of radiolabeled glutamine derivatives could be a useful molecular imaging tool for visualizing these tumors. We elaborated on the glutamine-derived PET tracers by developing two novel probes, namely [18F]fluorophenylglutamine and [18F]fluorobiphenylglutamine\n\nMaterials and methodsBoth tracers were labelled with fluorine-18 using our recently reported ruthenium-based direct aromatic fluorination method. Their affinity was evaluated with a [3H]glutamine inhibition experiment in a human PC-3 and a rat F98 cell line. The imaging potential of [18F]fluorophenylglutamine and [18F]fluorobiphenylglutamine was tested using a mouse PC-3 and a rat F98 tumor model.\n\nResultsThe radiosynthesis of both tracers was successful with overall non-decay corrected yields of 18.46 {+/-} 4.18 % (n=10) ([18F]fluorophenylglutamine) and 8.05 {+/-} 3.25 % (n=5) ([18F]fluorobiphenylglutamine). In vitro inhibition experiments showed a moderate and low affinity of fluorophenylglutamine and fluorobiphenylglutamine, respectively, towards the human ASCT-2 transporter. Both compounds had a low affinity towards the rat ASCT-2 transporter. These results were endorsed by the in vivo experiments with low uptake of both tracers in the F98 rat xenograft, low uptake of [18F]FBPG in the mice PC-3 xenograft and a moderate uptake of [18F]FPG in the PC-3 tumors.\n\nConclusionWe investigated the imaging potential of two novel PET radiotracers [18F]FPG and [18F]FBPG. [18F]FPG is the first example of a glutamine radiotracer derivatized with a phenyl group which enables the exploration of further derivatization of the phenyl group to increase the affinity and imaging qualities. We hypothesize that increasing the affinity of [18F]FPG by optimizing the substituents of the arene ring can result in a high-quality glutamine-based PET radiotracer.\n\nAdvances in Knowledge and Implications for patient careWe hereby report novel glutamine-based PET-tracers. These tracers are tagged on the arene group with fluorine-18, hereby preventing in vivo defluorination, which can occur with alkyl labelled tracers (e.g. (2S,4R)4-[18F]fluoroglutamine). [18F]FPG shows clear tumor uptake in vivo, has no in vivo defluorination and has a straightforward production. We believe this tracer is a good starting point for the development of a high-quality tracer which is useful for the clinical visualization of the glutamine transport.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "The incidence rate of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. Herbal formulations have recently gained importance as an alternative therapeutic option in controlling diabetes without causing any side effects. In the present study, we have demonstrated maintenance of glycemic homeostasis and anti-adipogenic potential of a herbo-mineral formulation Divya MadhuKalp (DMK). Initially, we evaluated the presence of bioactive compounds in DMK using LC/MS-QToF analysis. In-vitro analysis of DMK in L6 (skeletal muscle) cells showed a significant increase in cellular glucose uptake. Similarly, a human equivalent dose of DMK significantly reduced blood glucose level in normoglycemic and oral glucose tolerance rat model. DMK extract also inhibited formation of advanced glycation end product and showed anti--glucosidase activity. Further analysis of DMK in 3T3 L1 pre-adipocytes demonstrated anti-adipogenic activity through reduction in intracellular lipid accumulation and triglyceride contents along with downregulation of major adipogenic transcriptional factors (PPAR-{gamma} and C/EBP) and, adipocytes marker genes (LPL, AP2 and adiponectin). In conclusion, DMK exhibited anti-diabetic and anti-adipogenic activities by synergistic effect of its bioactive compounds and can be considered as a potent herbo-mineral formulation for treating metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Invasive microbial species constitute a major threat to biodiversity, agricultural production and human health. Invasions are often dominated by one or a small number of genotypes, yet the underlying factors driving invasions are poorly understood. The chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica first decimated the American chestnut and a recent outbreak threatens European chestnut trees. To unravel the mechanisms underpinning the invasion of south-eastern Europe, we sequenced 188 genomes of predominantly European strains. Genotypes outside of the invasion zone showed high levels of diversity with evidence for frequent and ongoing recombination. The invasive lineage emerged from the highly diverse European genotype pool rather than a secondary introduction from Asia. The expansion across south-eastern Europe was mostly clonal and is dominated by a single mating type suggesting a fitness advantage of asexual reproduction. Our findings show how an intermediary, highly diverse bridgehead population gave rise to an invasive, largely clonally expanding pathogen.\n\nData availabilityAll raw sequencing data is available on the NCBI Short Read Archive (BioProject PRJNA604575)",

    "abstract": "MotivationModern genomic data sets often involve multiple data-layers (e.g., DNA-sequence, gene expression), each of which itself can be high-dimensional. The biological processes underlying these data-layers can lead to intricate multivariate association patterns.\n\nResultsWe propose and evaluate two methods for analysis variance when both input and output sets are high-dimensional. Our approach uses random effects models to estimate the proportion of variance of vectors in the linear span of the output set that can be explained by regression on the input set. We consider a method based on orthogonal basis (Eigen-ANOVA) and one that uses random vectors (Monte Carlo ANOVA, MC-ANOVA) in the linear span of the output set. We used simulations to assess the bias and variance of each of the methods, and to compare it with that of the Partial Least Squares (PLS)-an approach commonly used in multivariate-high-dimensional regressions. The MC-ANOVA method gave nearly unbiased estimates in all the simulation scenarios considered. Estimates produced by Eigen-ANOVA and PLS had noticeable biases. Finally, we demonstrate insight that can be obtained with the of MC-ANOVA and Eigen-ANOVA by applying these two methods to the study of multi-locus linkage disequilibrium in chicken genomes and to the assessment of inter-dependencies between gene expression, methylation and copy-number-variants in data from breast cancer tumors.\n\nAvailabilityThe Supplementary data includes an R-implementation of each of the proposed methods as well as the scripts used in simulations and in the real-data analyses.\n\nContactgustavoc@msu.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, distinct nutrient signals are relayed by specific plasma membrane receptors to signal transduction pathways that are interconnected in complex information-processing networks. The function of these networks is to govern robust cellular responses to unpredictable changes in the nutritional environment of the cell. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these nutrient signaling pathways and their interconnections have been well characterized. However the complexity of the signaling network confounds the interpretation of the overall regulatory  logic of the control system. Here, we propose a literature-curated molecular mechanism of the integrated nutrient signaling network in budding yeast, focusing on early temporal responses to carbon and nitrogen signaling. We build a computational model of this network to reconcile literature-curated quantitative experimental data with our proposed molecular mechanism. We evaluate the robustness of our estimates of the models kinetic parameter values. We test the model by comparing predictions made in mutant strains with qualitative experimental observations made in the same strains. Finally, we use the model to predict nutrient-responsive transcription factor activities in a number of mutant strains undergoing complex nutrient shifts.",

    "abstract": "Functional interactions between cellular components of the muscle stem cell (MuSC) niche regulate the regenerative ability of skeletal muscles in physiological and pathological conditions; however, the identity of the mediators of these interactions remains largely unknown. We show here that fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP)-derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) mediate microRNA transfer to MuSCs, and that exposure of dystrophic FAPs to HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) increases the intra-EV levels of a subset of microRNAs (miRs), which cooperatively target biological processes of therapeutic interest, including regeneration, fibrosis and inflammation. In particular, we found that increased levels of miR206 in EVs released from FAPs of muscles from Duchenne dystrophic patients or mice (mdx) exposed to HDACi were associated with enhanced regeneration and inhibition of fibrosis of dystrophic muscles. Consistently, EVs from HDACi-treated dystrophic FAPs could stimulated MuSC activation and expansion ex vivo, and promoted regeneration, while inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation of dystrophic muscles, upon intramuscular transplantation, in vivo. These data reveal a potential for pharmacological modulation of FAP-derived EVs content as novel strategy for focal therapeutic interventions in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and possibly other muscular diseases.\n\nBrief SummaryExtracellular Vesicles from HDACi-treated dystrophic FAPs promote regeneration, while inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation of dystrophic muscles",

    "abstract": "Range expansions of naturally spreading species are crucial for understanding how species interact with the environment and build their niche. Here, we studied the bumblebee Bombus haematurus Kriechbaumer, 1870, a species historically distributed in the eastern Mediterranean area which has very recently started expanding northwards into Central Europe. After updating the global distribution of this species, we investigated if niche shifts took place during this range expansion between colonized and historical areas. In addition, we have explored which climatic factors have favoured the natural range expansion of the species. Our results indicated that Bombus haematurus has colonized large territories in 7 European countries outside the historical area in the period from the 1980s to 2018, a natural expansion over an area that equals the 20% of the historical distribution. In addition, this bumblebee performs generalism in flower visitation and habitat use, although a preference for forested areas emerges. The land-use associated with the species in the colonized areas is similar to the historical distribution, indicating that no major niche shifts occurred during the spread. Furthermore, the component of climate change that favoured this colonization is the warming of winter temperatures and similar warming rates took place during both overwintering and queens emergence phases. These findings document a case of natural range expansion due to environmental change rather than due to niche shifts, and specifically they indicate that warmer winters are playing a major role in the process of natural colonization of new areas.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with deletion mutations has been linked to aging, and age related neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we model effect of mtDNA half-life on mtDNA competition and selection.\n\nIndividual cells effectively form a closed ecosystem containing a large population of independently replicating mtDNA. We would expect competition and selection to occur between wild type mtDNA and various mutant variants. There is a symbiotic relationship between the cell and the mitochondria, and unrestricted mtDNA replication would be detrimental to the host cell. Deletion mutations of mtDNA are relatively common and give a replication advantage to the shorter sequence, as this could be lethal to the host cell, we would expect to see differences in mtDNA replication in short and long lived cells.\n\nIn this paper, we use a computer simulation of mtDNA replication, where mtDNA sequences may undergo deletion errors and give rise to mutant species that can compete with the wild type. This study focuses on longer lived cells where the wild type mtDNA is expected to be more susceptible to displacement by mutants. Our simulations confirm that deletion mutations have a replication advantage over the wild type due to decreased replication time. Wild type survival times diminished with increased mutation probabilities. The relationship between survival time and mutation rate was non-linear; a ten-fold increase in mutation probability resulted in a halving in wild type survival time.\n\nIn contrast a modest increase in the mtDNA half-life had a profound affect on the wild type survival time in the presence of deletion mutants, thereby, mitigating the replicative advantage of shorter sequence mutations. Given the relevance of mitochondrial dysfunction to various neurodegenerative conditions, we propose that therapies to increase mtDNA half-life could be a therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are cup-shaped vesicles that are secreted by cells and are involved in the intercellular transport of a variety of substances, including proteins, RNA, and liposomes. Studies have shown that pathogenic microorganisms are contained in exosomes extracted from pathogenic micro-infected cells. The Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is a non-encapsulated single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus that causes ulceration in the pigs nose, the appearance of blisters, and other clinical symptoms similar to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Whether exosomes from SVV-infected cells can mediate SVV intercellular transmission is of great significance. There have been no studies showing whether exosomes can carry SVV in susceptible and non-susceptible cells. Here, we first extracted and identified exosomes from SVV-infected IBRS-2 cells. It was confirmed that replication of SVV can be inhibited when IBRS-2 cells treated with exosomes inbihitor GW4869. Furthermore, laser confocal microscopy and qRT-PCR experiments were performed to investigate whether exosomes can carry SVV and enable the virus to proliferate in susceptible and non-susceptible cells. Finally, exosome-mediated intercellular transmission can not be completely blocked by SVV-specific neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, this study showed that exosomes extracted from the SVV-infected IBRS-2 cells can carry SVV and transmit productive SVV infection between SVV susceptible and non-susceptible cells, this transmit infection is resistant to SVV specific neutralization antibody.\n\nIMPORTANCEExosomes participate in intercellular communnication between cells. Exosomes derived from virus-infected cells can mediate virus transmission or/and regulate immune response. However, the function of exosomes that from SVV-infected host cells during SVV transmission is unclear. Here, we demonstrate SVV can utilize host exosomes to establish productive infection in intercellular transmission. Furthermore, exosome-mediated SVV transmission is resistant to SVVV-specific neutralizing antibodies. This discovery sheds light on neutralizing antibodies resistant to SVVV transmission by exosomes as a potential immune evasion mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In this study, bacterial strains Ha5T, Ta1 and Jb2 were isolated from different colonies of weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina. They were distinguished as different strains based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and distinctive random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprints. Cells of these bacterial strains were Gram-negative, rod-shaped, aerobic, non-motile, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. They were able to grow at 15-37{degrees}C (optimum, 28-30{degrees}C) and in the presence of 0-1.5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0%). Their predominant cellular fatty acids were C18:1{omega} 7c, C16:0, C19:0{omega} 8c cyclo, C14:0 and C16:0 2-OH. Strains Ha5T, Ta1 and Jb2 shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (94.56-94.63%) with Neokomagataea tanensis NBRC106556T but were phylogenetically closer to Bombella spp. and Saccharibacterfloricola DSM15669T. Both 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis and core gene-based phylogenomic analysis placed them in a distinct lineage in family Acetobacteraceae. These bacterial strains shared higher than species level thresholds in multiple overall genome-relatedness indices which indicated that they belonged to the same species. In addition, they did not belong to any of the current taxa of Acetobacteraceae as they had low pairwise average nucleotide identity ([&le;]70.7%), in silico DNA-DNA hybridization ([&le;]39.5%) and average amino acid identity ([&le;]66.u%) values with all the type members of the family. Based on these results, bacterial strains Ha5T, Ta1 and Jb2 represent a novel species of a novel genus in family Acetobacteraceae, for which we propose the name Oecophyllibacter saccharovorans gen. nov. sp. nov., and strain Ha5T as the type strain.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for disordered Ca2+ signaling in dopamine neurons in Parkinsons disease (PD), and this likely involves altered Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) function. Previous work suggests that oxidative stress - a major feature in PD pathogenesis - affects regulatory methionine residues that sustain CaMKII activity in a Ca2+/CaM-independent manner. Here, applying computational modeling, we predicted formation of a defined disulfide bridge close to the CaMKII docking site for Ca2+/CaM binding. In vitro and in vivo investigations using PD models revealed formation of a disulfide bridge and loss of the CaMKII-calmodulin interaction. Mutagenesis of the relevant cysteine residues abrogated disulfide bridge formation and recovered the CaMKII-calmodulin interaction. Importantly, dopamine neurons from post-mortem PD brain specimens also lost this regulatory protein-protein interaction, providing relevance in the human disease. This study provides novel insights into oxidative CaMKII-CaM dysfunction, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "We present a Python-based software package to automatically obtain phenomenological models of input-controlled synthetic biological circuits from descriptive models. From the parts and mechanism description of a synthetic biological circuit, it is easy to obtain a chemical reaction model of the circuit under the assumptions of mass-action kinetics using various existing tools. However, using these models to guide design decisions during an experiment is difficult due to a large number of reaction rate parameters and species in the model. Hence, phenomenological models are often developed that describe the effective relationships among the circuit inputs, outputs, and only the key states and parameters. In this paper, we present an algorithm to obtain these phenomenological models in an automated manner using a Python package for circuits with inputs that control the desired outputs. This model reduction approach combines the common assumptions of time-scale separation, conservation laws, and species abundance to obtain the reduced models that can be used for design of synthetic biological circuits. We consider an example of a simple gene expression circuit and another example of a layered genetic feedback control circuit to demonstrate the use of the model reduction procedure.",

Histo-differentiation of reticulum of goat stomach took place at 38 days of gestation. The wall of foetal reticulum was made up of three strata i. e. epithelium, pleuripotent blastemic tissue and serosa up to 49 days of fetal age and definite four layers viz. epithelium, propria-submucosa, tunica muscularis and serosa were observed first at 51 days of gestation. Upto 100 days of gestation the reticulum was lined by undifferentiated stratified epithelium and thereafter gradually transformed into stratified squamous epithelium. Keratinization was noticed at term. Primary and secondary reticular crests made their appearance at 60 and 112 days of gestation, respectively. Corial papillae were detected in primary and secondary reticular crests at 121 and 145 days of gestation, respectively. Near term, the core of the reticular crest also contained muscularis mucosae in its proximal 1/3rd region while core of the corial papillae contained only lamina propria. Reticular, collagen and elastic fibers came into sight at 46, 100 and 134 days of gestation, respectively.\n\nSummary statementThe study was conducted on intrauterine reticulum of Indian goat. From this study it can be concluded that the histogenesis of reticulum was almost completed in prenatal life. However, to become functional it still required more time as the relative sizes of reticulum and process of keratinization were yet to be completed.",
