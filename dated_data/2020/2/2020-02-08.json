    "abstract": "Animals display remarkable variation in social behavior. However, outside of rodents, little is known about the neural mechanisms of social variation, and whether they are shared across species and sexes, limiting our understanding of how sociality evolves. Using coral reef butterflyfishes, we examined gene expression correlates of social variation (i.e., pair bonding vs. solitary living) within and between species and sexes. In several brain regions, we quantified gene expression of receptors important for social variation in mammals: oxytocin (OTR), arginine vasopressin (V1aR), dopamine (D1R, D2R), and mu-opioid (MOR). We found that social variation across individuals of the oval butterflyfish, Chaetodon lunulatus, is linked to differences in OTR,V1aR, D1R, D2R, and MOR gene expression within several forebrain regions in a sexually dimorphic manner. However, this contrasted with social variation among six species representing a single evolutionary transition from pair bonded to solitary living. Here, OTR expression within the supracommissural part of the ventral telencephalon was higher in pair bonded than solitary species, specifically in males. These results contribute to the emerging idea that nonapeptide, dopamine, and opioid signaling is a central theme to the evolution of sociality across individuals, although the precise mechanism may be flexible across sexes and species.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell measurement techniques can now probe gene expression in heterogeneous cell populations from the human body across a range of environmental and physiological conditions. However, new mathematical and computational methods are required to represent and analyze gene expression changes that occur in complex mixtures of single cells as they respond to signals, drugs, or disease states. Here, we introduce a mathematical modeling platform, PopAlign, that automatically identifies subpopulations of cells within a heterogeneous mixture, and tracks gene expression and cell abundance changes across subpopulations by constructing and comparing probabilistic models. Probabilistic models provide a low-error, compressed representation of single cell data that enables efficient large-scale computations. We apply PopAlign to analyze the impact of 40 different immunomodulatory compounds on a heterogeneous population of donor-derived human immune cells as well as patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma. PopAlign scales to comparisons involving tens to hundreds of samples, enabling large-scale studies of natural and engineered cell populations as they respond to drugs, signals or physiological change.",

    "abstract": "Survival depends on the ability of animals to select the appropriate behavior in response to threat and safety sensory cues. However, the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which the brain learns to encode accurate predictors of threat and safety remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that frontal association cortex (FrA) pyramidal neurons integrate auditory cues and basolateral amygdala (BLA) inputs non-linearly in a NMDAR-dependent manner. We found that the response of FrA pyramidal neurons was more pronounced to Gaussian noise than to pure 8 kHz tone, and that the activation of BLA-to-FrA axons was the strongest during safe periods in between conditioning pairings. Blocking BLA-to-FrA signaling specifically at the time of presentation of Gaussian noise (but not 8 kHz tone) as a safety signal impaired the formation of auditory fear memories. Taken together, our data reveal a circuit mechanism that facilitates the formation of fear traces in the FrA, thus providing a new framework for probing discriminative learning and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "We conducted snorkel surveys for juvenile salmonids in reaches of the Entiat River (Washington, USA) treated with engineered log jams (ELJs), and in reaches without treatments, to determine if habitat-unit-scale observations can identify whether restoration has increased the habitat capacity of a reach. The conceptual basis and field methodology emphasize fish density data (fish/habitat area in m2) from unrestored habitat within a reach treated with ELJs compared to surveys in 1) unrestored habitat in untreated reaches and 2) restored habitat in treated reaches. A Bayesian generalized linear model enabled us to quantify density differences among habitat types using advanced computational statistics. Modal density of young-of-the-year Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) was at least 3.1-fold and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, in restored habitat compared with unrestored habitat for all treated reaches examined. To distinguish the density differences in those reaches as capacity increases rather than redistribution from poor habitat to good habitat, we compared density in unrestored habitat in both treated and untreated reaches. Here we found no differences for either species, confirming that the increased density in restored habitat units did not come from depletion of unrestored habitat in the same reach. We thus concluded that restoration increased the habitat capacity of the reach at the scale of pools created by ELJs.",

    "abstract": "Conceptual and methodological tools from behavioral ecology can inform studies of habitat quality and their potential for evaluating habitat restoration in conservation efforts is explored here. Such approaches provide mechanistic detail in understanding the relationship between organisms and their habitats and are thus more informative than correlations between density and habitat characteristics. Several Pacific salmon species have been the target of habitat restoration efforts for the past 2-3 decades, but most post-restoration effectiveness studies have been limited to correlative data described above. In mark-recapture assays from four different study years, the affinity of sub-yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) for stream pools restored with or created by engineered log structures was greater than that for pools without restoration, though with high interannual variability. From corresponding distribution and density data, it was clear that habitat affinity data are not always concordant with single observations of density. The same was true of the correlation between either affinity or density and physical characteristics of pools, although depth and current velocity had some explanatory power for both responses in Chinook. Movement into pools by Chinook during the assays indicated that restored pools can support more immigrants at a given density than can unrestored pools; however no such pattern emerged for steelhead. Variation among individuals in body condition has implications for population-wide fitness, and such low variation was correlated with stronger affinity for pools in Chinook regardless of restoration status. This suggests that pools may mediate habitat-related trade-offs and that restoring them might have a positive effect on fitness. Thus affinity, immigration, and condition data give much-needed mechanistic indication of habitat selection for restored habitat via an apparent capacity increase and those potential fitness benefits. This is stronger support for restoration effectiveness than density differences alone because density data 1) may simply indicate redistribution of fish from poor to good habitats and 2) are not adequate to show correlations between restoration and positive change in traits correlated with fitness.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of deep learning techniques in genomics has been hindered by the difficulty of mechanistically interpreting the models that these techniques produce. In recent years, a variety of post-hoc attribution methods have been proposed for addressing this neural network interpretability problem in the context of gene regulation. Here we describe a complementary way of approaching this problem. Our strategy is based on the observation that two large classes of biophysical models of cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep neural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical interpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be rapidly inferred, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced by certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). These results suggest a scalable strategy for using MPRAs to systematically characterize the biophysical basis of gene regulation in a wide range of biological contexts. They also highlight gene regulation as a promising venue for the development of scientifically interpretable approaches to deep learning.",

    "abstract": "The domestic cat (Felis catus) numbers over 94 million in the USA alone, occupies households as a companion animal, and, like humans, suffers from cancer and common and rare diseases. However, genome-wide sequence variant information is limited for this species. To empower trait analyses, a new cat genome reference assembly was developed from PacBio long sequence reads that significantly improve sequence representation and assembly contiguity. The whole genome sequences of 54 domestic cats were aligned to the reference to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs). Across all cats, 16 SNVs predicted to have deleterious impacts and in a singleton state were identified as high priority candidates for causative mutations. One candidate was a stop gain in the tumor suppressor FBXW7. The SNV is found in cats segregating for feline mediastinal lymphoma and is a candidate for inherited cancer susceptibility. SV analysis revealed a complex deletion coupled with a nearby potential duplication event that was shared privately across three unrelated dwarfism cats and is found within a known dwarfism associated region on cat chromosome B1. This SV interrupted UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH), a gene involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. Importantly, UGDH has not yet been associated with human dwarfism and should be screened in undiagnosed patients. The new high-quality cat genome reference and the compilation of sequence variation demonstrate the importance of these resources when searching for disease causative alleles in the domestic cat and for identification of feline biomedical models.\n\nAuthor summaryThe practice of genomic medicine is predicated on the availability of a high quality reference genome and an understanding of the impact of genome variation. Such resources have lead to countless discoveries in humans, however by working exclusively within the framework of human genetics, our potential for understanding diseases biology is limited, as similar analyses in other species have often lead to novel insights. The generation of Felis_catus_9.0, a new high quality reference genome for the domestic cat, helps facilitate the expansion of genomic medicine into the felis lineage. Using Felis_catus_9.0 we analyze the landscape of genomic variation from a collection of 54 cats within the context of human gene constraint. The distribution of variant impacts in cats is correlated with patterns of gene constraint in humans, indicating the utility of this reference for identifying novel mutations that cause phenotypes relevant to human and cat health. Moreover, structural variant analysis revealed a novel variant for feline dwarfism in UGDH, a gene that has not been associated with dwarfism in any other species, suggesting a role for UGDH in cases of undiagnosed dwarfism in humans.",

    "abstract": "The Caribbean archipelago is a hotspot of biodiversity characterized by a high rate of extinction. Recent studies have examined these losses, but the causes of the Antillean Late Quaternary vertebrate extinctions, and especially the role of humans, are still unclear. Current results provide support for climate-related and human-induced extinctions, but often downplaying other complex bio-ecological factors that are difficult to model or to detect from the fossil and archaeological record. Here, we discuss Caribbean vertebrate extinctions and the potential role of humans derived from new and existing fossil and archaeological data from Cuba. Our results indicate that losses of Cubas native fauna occurred in three waves: one during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, a second during the middle Holocene, and a third one during the last 2 ka, coinciding with the arrival of agroceramists and the early Europeans. The coexistence of now-extinct species with multiple cultural groups in Cuba for over 4 ka implies that Cuban indigenous non-ceramic cultures exerted far fewer extinction pressures to native fauna than the later agroceramists and Europeans that followed. This suggests a determinant value to increased technological sophistication and demographics as the most plausible effective extinction drivers.",

We examined and manipulated mitochondria dynamics with high temporal resolution during mouse and human cortical neurogenesis. We reveal that shortly after cortical stem cells have divided, daughter cells that retain high levels of mitochondria fission will become neurons, while those destined to self-renew undergo rapid mitochondria fusion. Induction of mitochondria fusion after mitosis redirects daughter cells towards cell self-renewal, but only during a restricted time window, which is doubled in human cortical stem cells with higher self-renewing potential. Mitochondria dynamics drives neurogenesis through modulation of the NAD+ sensor Sirtuin-1, leading to Histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling necessary for neurogenic conversion.

Here, we assessed the relative importance of canopy position - top, mid, and bottom at a height between 31 m and 20 m - and tree species identity for shaping the phyllosphere microbiome in a floodplain hardwood forest. Leaf material was sampled from three tree species - maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), oak (Quercus robur L.), and lime (Tilia cordata MILL.) - at the Leipzig canopy crane facility (Germany). Estimated bacterial species richness (Chao1) and bacterial abundances approximated by quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA genes exhibited clear vertical trends with a strong increase from the top to the mid and bottom position of the canopy. 30 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) formed the core microbiome, which accounted for 77% of all sequence reads. These core OTUs showed contrasting trends in their vertical distribution within the canopy, pointing to different ecological preferences and tolerance to presumably more extreme conditions at the top position of the canopy. Co-occurrence analysis revealed distinct tree species-specific OTU networks, and 55-57% of the OTUs were unique to each tree species.

    "abstract": "Parental experience can modulate the behavior of the progeny through the inheritance of phenotypic traits acquired by the progenitors. While the molecular mechanisms for behavioral inheritance are studied under several environmental conditions, it remains largely unexplored how the nature of the parental experience affects the information transferred to the next generation. To address this question we used C. elegans, a nematode that feeds on bacteria in its habitat. Some of these bacteria are pathogenic and the worm learns to avoid them after a brief exposure. We found, unexpectedly, that a short parental experience increased the preference for the pathogen in the progeny. Furthermore, increasing the time of parental exposure switched the response of the progeny from attraction to avoidance. To characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) RRF-3, required for the biogenesis of 26G endo-siRNAs, regulated both types of intergenerational effects. Together, we show that different parental experiences with the same environmental stimulus generate diverse effects on the behavior of the progeny through small RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Principled computational approaches for tumor phylogeny reconstruction via single-cell sequencing typically aim to build the most likely perfect phylogeny tree from the noisy genotype matrix - which represents genotype calls of single-cells. This problem is NP-hard, and as a result, existing approaches aim to solve relatively small instances of it through combinatorial optimization techniques or Bayesian inference. As expected, even when the goal is to infer basic topological features of the tumor phylogeny - rather than reconstructing the topology entirely, these approaches could be prohibitively slow. In this paper, we introduce fast deep-learning solutions to the problems of inferring whether the most likely tree has a linear (chain) or branching topology and whether a perfect phylogeny is feasible from a given genotype matrix. We also present a reinforcement learning approach for reconstructing the most likely tumor phylogeny. This preliminary work demonstrates that data-driven approaches can reconstruct key features of tumor evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic variants underlying severe diseases are less likely to be transmitted to the next generation, and are thus gradually and selectively eliminated from the population through negative selection. Here, we study the determinants of this evolutionary process in genes underlying severe diseases in humans.\n\nResultsWe propose a novel approach, CoNeS, integrating known negative selection scores through principal component projection. We compare evidence for negative selection at 319 genes underlying inborn errors of immunity (IEI), which are life-threatening monogenic disorders. We find that genes underlying autosomal dominant (AD) or X-linked IEI are under stronger negative selection than those underlying autosomal recessive (AR) IEI, which are under no stronger selection than genes not known to be disease-causing. However, we find that genes with mutations causing AR IEI that are lethal before reproductive maturity and that display complete penetrance are under stronger negative selection than other genes underlying AR IEI. We also find that genes underlying AD IEI by haploinsufficiency are under stronger negative selection than other genes underlying AD IEI. Finally, we replicate these results in a study of 1,140 genes causing inborn errors of neurodevelopment.\n\nConclusionsThese findings collectively show that the clinical outcomes of inborn errors, together with the mode and mechanism of inheritance of these errors, determine the strength of negative selection acting on severe disease-causing genes. These findings suggest that estimating the intensity of negative selection with CoNeS may facilitate the selection of candidate genes in patients suspected to carry an inborn error.",

    "abstract": "In cancer, recurrently mutated sites in DNA and proteins, called hotspots, are thought to be raised by positive selection and therefore important due to its potential functional impact. Although recent evidence for APOBEC enzymatic activity have shown that specific types of sequences are likely to be false, the identification of putative hotspots is important to confirm either its functional role or its mechanistic bias. In this work, an algorithm and a statistical model is presented to detect hotspots. The model consists of a beta-binomial component plus fixed effects that efficiently fits the distribution of mutated sites. The algorithm employs an optimal step-wise approach to find the model parameters. Simulations show that the proposed algorithmic model is highly accurate for common hotspots. The approach has been applied to TCGA mutational data from 33 cancer types. The results show that well-known cancer hotspots are easily detected. Besides, novel hotspots are also detected. An analysis of the sequence context of detected hotspots show a preference for TCG sites that may be related to APOBEC or other unknown mechanistic biases. The detected hotspots are available online in http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx/HotSpotsAnnotations.",

LazyBastard starts from a bipartite overlap graph between long reads and restrictively filtered short-read unitigs, which are then reduced to a long-read overlap graph G. Edges are removed from G to obtain first a consistent orientation and then a DAG. Using heuristics based on properties of proper interval graphs, contigs are extracted as maximum weight paths. These are translated into genomic sequence only in the final step. A prototype implementation of LazyBastard, entirely written in python, not only yields significantly more accurate assemblies of the yeast and fruit fly genomes compared to state-of-the-art pipelines but also requires much less computational effort.\n\nFundingRSF / Helmholtz Association 18-44-06201; Deutsche Academische Austauschdienst, DFG STA 850/19-2 within SPP 1738; German Federal Ministery of Education an Research 031A538A, de.NBI-RBC",

From the human perspective, rats are a chronic problem that causes billions of dollars in damage to agriculture, health and infrastructure. Did genetic adaptation play a role in the spread of rats in cities? To approach this question, we collected whole-genome sequences from 29 brown rats from New York City (NYC) and scanned for genetic signatures of adaptation. We tested for (i) high-frequency, extended haplotypes that could indicate selective sweeps and (ii) loci of extreme genetic differentiation between the NYC sample and a sample from the presumed ancestral range of brown rats in northeast China. We found candidate selective sweeps near or inside genes associated with metabolism, diet, the nervous system and locomotory behavior. Patterns of differentiation between NYC and Chinese rats at putative sweep loci suggests that many sweeps began after the split from the ancestral population. Together, our results suggest several hypotheses on adaptation in rats living in close proximity to humans.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing is an effective approach for studying an aquatic species with little prior molecular information available, yielding both physiological and genomic data, but its genetic applications are not well-characterized. We investigate this possible role for RNA sequencing for population genomics in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, walleye (Sander vitreus). Lake Winnipeg walleye represent the largest component of the second-largest freshwater fishery in Canada. In the present study, large female walleye were sampled via nonlethal gill biopsy over two years at three spawning sites representing a latitudinal gradient in the lake. Genetic variation from sequenced messenger RNA was analyzed for neutral and adaptive markers to investigate population structure and possible adaptive variation. We find low population divergence (FST = 0.0095), possible northward gene flow, and outlier loci that vary latitudinally in transcripts associated with cell membrane proteins and cytoskeletal function. These results indicate that Lake Winnipeg walleye may be effectively managed as a single demographically connected metapopulation with contributing subpopulations, and suggest genomic differences possibly underlying observed phenotypic differences. Because RNA sequencing data can yield physiological in addition to genetic information discussed here, we argue that it is useful for addressing diverse molecular questions in the conservation of freshwater species.",

Recent long-read sequencing technologies promise to improve genome reconstruction. However, the integration of two different sequencing modalities makes downstream analyses complex. We, therefore, developed MUFFIN, a complete metagenomic workflow that uses short and long reads to produce high-quality bins and their annotations. The workflow is written by using Nextflow, a workflow orchestration software, to achieve high reproducibility and fast and straightforward use. This workflow also produces the taxonomic classification and KEGG pathways of the bins and can be further used by providing RNA-Seq data (optionally) for quantification and annotation. We tested the workflow using twenty biogas reactor samples and assessed the capacity of MUFFIN to process and output relevant files needed to analyze the microbial community and their function. MUFFIN produces functional pathway predictions and if provided de novo transcript annotations across the metagenomic sample and for each bin.\n\nAuthor SummaryRVD did the development and design of MUFFIN and wrote the first draft; BM and EBR did the critical reading and correction of the manuscript; MH did the critical reading of the manuscript and the general adjustments for the metagenomic workflow; AV did the critical reading of the manuscript and adjustments for the taxonomic classifications.

    "abstract": "Reactivated long-term memories can become labile and sensitive to modification. Memories in this destabilized state can be weakened or strengthened, but there is limited research characterizing the mechanisms underlying retrieval-induced qualitative updates (i.e., information integration). We have previously implicated cholinergic transmission in object memory destabilization. Here we present a novel rodent paradigm developed to assess the role of this cholinergic mechanism in qualitative memory updating. The post-reactivation object memory modification (PROMM) task exposes rats to contextual information following object memory reactivation. Subsequent object exploratory performance suggests that the contextual information is integrated with the original memory in a reactivation- and time-dependent manner. This effect is blocked by interference with M1 muscarinic receptors and several downstream signals in perirhinal cortex. These findings therefore demonstrate a hitherto unacknowledged cognitive function for acetylcholine with important implications for understanding the dynamic nature of long-term memory storage in the normal and aging brain.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that in addition to its classical role in protein turnover, ubiquitination is required for a variety of membrane protein sorting events. However, and despite substantial progress in the field, a long-standing question remains: given that all ubiquitin (Ub) units are identical, how do different elements of the sorting machinery recognize their specific cargoes?\n\nHere we provide an answer to this question as we discovered a mechanism based on the coincidence detection of lysine ubiquitination and Ser/Thr phosphorylation for the endocytic adaptor epsin to mediate the internalization of the yeast Na+ pump Ena1.\n\nInternalization of Ena1-GFP was abolished in double epsin knock-out in S. cerevisiae and was rescued by re-introducing either one of the 2 yeast epsins, Ent1 or Ent2 in an UIM (Ub Interacting Motif)-dependent manner. Further, our results indicate that ubiquitination of its C-terminal Lys1090 is needed for internalization of Ena1 and requires the arrestin-related-trafficking adaptor, Art3.\n\nWe determined that in addition to ubiquitination of K1090, the presence of a Ser/Thr-rich patch (S1076TST1079) within Ena1 was also essential for its internalization. Our results suggest that this ST motif is targeted for phosphorylation by casein kinases. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of this S/T patch was not required for ubiquitination. Instead, ubiquitination of K1090 and phosphorylation of the ST motif were independently needed for epsin-mediated internalization of Ena1.\n\nWe propose a model in which a dual detection mechanism is used by Ub-binding elements of the sorting machinery to differentiate among multiple Ub-cargoes.",
