    "abstract": "In recent years, planting machinery that enables precise control of the planting rates has become available for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.). With increasingly available topographical and soil information, there is a growing interest in developing variable rate planting strategies to exploit variation in the agri-landscape in order to maximize production. A random forest regression-based approach was developed to model the interactions between planting rate, topography, and soil characteristics and their effects on yield based on on-farm variable rate planting trials for corn and soybean conducted at 27 sites in New York between 2014 and 2018 (57 site-years) in collaboration with the New York Corn and Soybean Growers Association. Planting rate ranked highly in terms of random forest regression variable importance while explaining relatively minimal yield variation in the linear context, indicating that yield response to planting rate likely depends on complex interactions with agri-landscape features. Models were moderately predictive of yield within site-years and across years at a particular site, while the ability to predict yield across sites was low. Relatedly, variable importance measures for the topographical and soil features varied considerably across sites. Together, these results suggest that local testing may provide the most accurate optimized planting rate designs due to the unique set of conditions at each site. The proposed method was extended to identify the optimal variable rate planting design for maximizing yield at each site given the topographical and soil data, and empirical validation of the resulting designs is currently underway.",

    "abstract": "Microbial lipid production from second generation feedstocks presents a sustainable route to future fuels, foods and bulk chemicals. The oleaginous yeast Metshnikowia pulcherrima has previously been investigated as a potential platform organism for lipid production due to its ability to be grown in non-sterile conditions and metabolising a wide range of oligo- and monosaccharide carbon sources within lignocellulosic hydrolysates. However, the generation of inhibitors from depolymerisation causes downstream bioprocessing complications, and despite M. pulcherrimas comparative tolerance, their presence is deleterious to both biomass and lipid formation. Using either a single inhibitor (formic acid) or an inhibitor cocktail (formic acid, acetic acid, fufural and HMF), two strategies of adaptive laboratory evolution were performed to improve M. pulcherrimas fermentation inhibitor tolerance. Using a sequential batch culturing approach, the resulting strains from both strategies had increased growth rates and reduced lag times under inhibiting conditions versus the progenitor. Interestingly, the lipid production of the inhibitor cocktail evolved strains markedly increased, with one strain producing 41% lipid by dry weight compared to 22% of the progenitor. The evolved species was cultured in a non-sterile 2L stirred tank bioreactor and accumulated lipid rapidly, yielding 6.1 g/L of lipid (35% cell dry weight) within 48 hours; a lipid productivity of 0.128 g L-1 h-1. Furthermore, the lipid profile was analogous to palm oil, consisting of 39% C16:0 and 56% C18:1 after 48 hours.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe eukaryotic genome is capable of producing multiple isoforms from a gene by alternative polyadenylation (APA) during pre-mRNA processing. APA in the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of mRNA produces transcripts with shorter or longer 3-UTR. Often, 3-UTR serves as a binding platform for microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, which affect the fate of the mRNA transcript. Thus, 3-UTR APA is known to modulate translation and provides a mean to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Current bioinformatics pipelines have limited capability in profiling 3-UTR APA events due to incomplete annotations and a low-resolution analyzing power: widely available bioinformatics pipelines do not reference actionable polyadenylation (cleavage) sites but simulate 3-UTR APA only using RNA-seq read coverage, causing false positive identifications. To overcome these limitations, we developed APA-Scan, a robust program that identifies 3-UTR APA events and visualizes the RNA-seq short-read coverage with gene annotations.\n\nMethodsAPA-Scan utilizes either predicted or experimentally validated actionable polyadenylation signals as a reference for polyadenylation sites and calculates the quantity of long and short 3-UTR transcripts in the RNA-seq data. APA-Scan works in three major steps: (i) calculate the read coverage of the 3-UTR regions of genes; (ii) identify the potential APA sites and evaluate the significance of the events among two biological conditions; (iii) graphical representation of user specific event with 3-UTR annotation and read coverage on the 3-UTR regions. APA-Scan is implemented in Python3. Source code and a comprehensive users manual are freely available at https://github.com/compbiolabucf/APA-Scan.\n\nResultAPA-Scan was applied to both simulated and real RNA-seq datasets and compared with two widely used baselines DaPars and APAtrap. In simulation APA-Scan significantly improved the accuracy of 3-UTR APA identification compared to the other baselines. The performance of APA-Scan was also validated by 3-end-seq data and qPCR on mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. The experiments confirm that APA-Scan can detect unannotated 3 -UTR APA events and improve genome annotation.\n\nConclusionAPA-Scan is a comprehensive computational pipeline to detect transcriptome-wide 3-UTR APA events. The pipeline integrates both RNA-seq and 3-end-seq data information and can efficiently identify the significant events with a high-resolution short reads coverage plots.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-dependent structural deformations of the DNA double helix (dsDNA) have been extensively studied, where adenine tracts (A-tracts) provide a striking example for global bending in the molecule. In contrast to dsDNA, much less is known about how the nucleotide sequence affects bending deformations of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Using all-atom microsecond long molecular dynamics simulations we found a sequence motif consisting of alternating adenines and uracils, or AU-tracts, that bend the dsRNA helix by locally compressing the major groove. We experimentally tested this prediction using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of long dsRNA molecules containing phased AU-tracts. AFM images revealed a clear intrinsic bend in these AU-tracts molecules, as quantified by a significantly lower persistence length compared to dsRNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. The bent structure of AU-tracts here described might play a role in sequence-specific recognition of dsRNAs by dsRNA-interacting proteins or impact the folding of RNA into intricate tertiary and quaternary structures.",
