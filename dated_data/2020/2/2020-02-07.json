    "abstract": "Area-based conservation through reserves or other measures is vital for preserving biodiversity and its functions for future generations1-5, but its effective implementation suffers from a lack of both spatial detail necessary for management practices6 and transparency around national responsibilities that might underpin cross-national support mechanisms7. Here we implement a conservation prioritization2,8 framework that accounts for spatial data limitations yet offers actionable guidance at a 1km resolution. Our multi-scale linear optimization approach delineates globally the areas required to meet area-based conservation targets for all ~32 000 described terrestrial vertebrate species, while offering flexibility in decision management to meet different local conservation objectives. Roughly 30.4% of land is sufficient to meet conservation targets for all species, of which 60.1% is either already protected9 or has minimal human modification10. However, the remaining 39.9% of human-modified areas need to be managed or restored in some form to ensure the long-term survival for over half of species. This burden of area-based conservation is distributed very unevenly among countries, and, without a process that explicitly addresses geopolitical inequity, meeting species conservation targets would require disproportionately large commitments from poorer countries (i.e., lower GNI). Our analysis provides baseline information for a potential intergovernmental and stakeholder contribution mechanism in service of a globally shared goal of sustaining biodiversity. Future updates and extensions to this global priority map have the potential to guide local and national advocacy and actions with a data-driven approach to support global conservation outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Biological aging is the gradual, progressive decline in system integrity that occurs with advancing chronological age, causing morbidity and disability. Measurements of the pace of aging are needed to serve as surrogate endpoints in trials of therapies designed to prevent disease by slowing biological aging. We report a blood DNA-methylation measure that is sensitive to variation in the pace of biological aging among individuals born the same year. We first modeled longitudinal change in 18 biomarkers tracking organ-system integrity across 12 years of follow-up in the Dunedin birth cohort. Rates of change in each biomarker were composited to form a measure of aging-related decline, termed Pace of Aging. Elastic-net regression was used to develop a DNA-methylation predictor of Pace of Aging, called DunedinPoAm for Dunedin (P)ace (o)f (A)ging (m)ethylation. Validation analyses showed DunedinPoAm was associated with functional decline in the Dunedin Study and more advanced biological age in the Understanding Society Study, predicted chronic disease and mortality in the Normative Aging Study, was accelerated by early-life adversity in the E-risk Study, and DunedinPoAm prediction was disrupted by caloric restriction in the CALERIE trial. DunedinPoAm generally outperformed epigenetic clocks. Findings provide proof-of-principle for DunedinPoAm as a single-time-point measure of a persons pace of biological aging.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations track linguistic information during speech comprehension (e.g., Ding et al., 2016; Keitel et al., 2018), and are known to be modulated by acoustic landmarks and speech intelligibility (e.g., Zoefel & VanRullen, 2015). But, it is unclear what information (e.g., timing, rhythm, or content) the brain utilizes to generate linguistic structure and meaning beyond the information that is present in the physical stimulus. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether oscillations are modulated by linguistic content over and above the speech stimulus rhythmicity and temporal distribution. We manipulated the presence of semantic and syntactic information apart from the timescale of their occurrence, and controlled for the acoustic-prosodic and lexical-semantic information in the signal. EEG was recorded while 29 adult native speakers of all genders listened to naturally-spoken Dutch sentences, jabberwocky controls with a sentence-like prosodic rhythm and morphemes, word lists with lexical content but no phrase structure, and backwards acoustically-matched controls. Mutual information (MI) analysis revealed sensitivity to linguistic content: Phase MI was highest for sentences at the phrasal (0.8-1.1 Hz) and lexical timescale (1.9-2.8 Hz), suggesting that the delta-band is modulated by lexically-driven combinatorial processing beyond prosody, and that linguistic content (i.e., structure and meaning) organizes the phase of neural oscillations beyond the timescale and rhythmicity of the stimulus. This pattern is consistent with neurophysiologically-inspired models of language comprehension (Martin, 2016, 2020; Martin & Doumas, 2017) where oscillations encode endogenously-generated linguistic content over and above exogenous or stimulus-driven timing and rhythm information.\n\nSignificance StatementBiological systems like the brain encode their environment not only by reacting in a series of stimulus-driven responses, but by combining stimulus-driven information with endogenous, internally-generated, inferential knowledge and meaning. Understanding language from speech is the human benchmark for this. Much research focusses on the purely stimulus-driven response, but here, we focus on the goal of language behavior: conveying structure and meaning. To that end, we use naturalistic stimuli that contrast acoustic-prosodic and lexical-semantic information to show that, during spoken language comprehension, oscillatory modulations reflect computations related to inferring structure and meaning from the acoustic signal. Our experiment provides the first evidence to date that compositional structure and meaning organize the oscillatory response, above and beyond acoustic and lexical controls.",

    "abstract": "Articulography and functional neuroimaging are two major tools for studying the neurobiology of speech production. Until now, however, it has generally not been possible to use both in the same experimental setup because of technical incompatibilities between the two methodologies. Here we describe results from a novel articulography system dubbed Magneto-articulography for the Assessment of Speech Kinematics (MASK), used for the first time to obtain kinematic profiles of oro-facial movements during speech together with concurrent magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements of neuromotor brain activity. MASK was used to characterise speech kinematics in a healthy adult, and the results were compared to measurements from the same participant with a conventional electromagnetic articulography (EMA) setup. We also characterised speech movement kinematics with MASK in a group of ten typically developing children, aged 8-12 years. Analyses targeted the gestural landmarks of the utterances /ida/, /ila/ and reiterated productions of /pataka/. These results demonstrate that the MASK technique can be used to reliably characterise movement profiles and kinematic parameters that reflect development of speech motor control, together with MEG measurements of brain responses from speech sensorimotor cortex. This new capability sets the stage for cross-disciplinary efforts to understand the developmental neurobiology of human speech production.",

Humans experience a high rate of unexplained spontaneous miscarriage. Could it be that a portion of these miscarriages reflect a Bruce-like effect? Given ethical constraints on a direct test, we instead probed for circumstantial evidence in women with repeated pregnancy loss (RPL). Consistent with a Bruce-like effect, women with RPL remembered the body-odor of their spouse, but controls could not. Also consistent with a Bruce-like effect, body-odor from a stranger man caused increased activity in the hypothalamus of women experiencing RPL, yet decreased activity in the hypothalamus of women controls. Finally, RPL was associated with reduced olfactory-bulb volume. Although not causal, these observations link RPL with an altered behavioral and brain response to mens body-odor, implicating the olfactory system in this poorly understood or managed condition.",

Mutations of ATRX result in the ATR-X intellectual disability syndrome and have been identified in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. The mechanisms by which ATRX mutations lead to autism and autistic-like behaviours are not yet known. To address this question, we generated mice with postnatal Atrx inactivation in excitatory neurons of the forebrain and performed a battery of behavioural assays that assess autistic-like behaviours.\n\nMethodsMale and female mice with a postnatal conditional knockout of Atrx were tested in a battery of behavioural tests that assess autistic features. We utilized paradigms that measure social behaviour, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours, as well as sensory gating. Statistics were calculated by two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Sidaks multiple comparison test or unpaired Students T-tests as indicated.\n\nResultsThe behaviour tests revealed no significant differences between Atrx-cKO and control mice. We identified sexually dimorphic changes in odor habituation and discrimination; however, these changes did not correlate with social deficits. We additionally observed sex-specific differences in sociability, vertical episodes, and acoustic startle response when results were analyzed by sex.\n\nConclusionThe postnatal knockout of Atrx in forebrain excitatory neurons does not lead to autism-related behaviours in male or female mice.",

    "abstract": "Host shifts can drastically change the selective pressures that animals experience from their environment. Drosophila sechellia is a species restricted to the Seychelles islands, where it specialized on the fruit Morinda citrifolia (noni). This fruit is known to be toxic to closely related Drosophila species, including D. melanogaster and D. simulans, releasing D. sechellia from interspecific competition when breeding on this substrate. Previously, we showed that D. sechellia is unable to mount an effective immunological response against wasp attack, while the closely-related species can defend themselves from parasitoid attack by melanotic encapsulation. We hypothesized that this inability constitutes a trait loss due to a reduced risk of parasitoid attack in noni. Here we present a field study aimed to test the hypothesis that specialization on noni has released D. sechellia from the antagonistic interaction with its larval parasitoids. Our results from the field survey indicate that D. sechellia was found in ripe noni, whereas another Drosophila species, D. malerkotliana, was present in unripe and rotting stages. Parasitic wasps of the species Leptopilina boulardi emerged from rotten noni, where D. malerkotliana was the most abundant host. These results indicate that the specialization of D. sechellia on noni has indeed drastically altered its ecological interactions, leading to a relaxation in the selection pressure to maintain parasitoid resistance.",

The new specimen preserves six postaxial cervical vertebrae, five completely fused sacral and four posterior caudal vertebrae in addition to two manual unguals. The completely fused neurocentral junctions indicate that a skeletally mature individual of the same species of LH PV39 would be smaller than Philovenator and comparable in body size to a skeletal mature individual of Almas. The extremely dorsoventrally compressed sacral centra and neural canal, and the middle three sacral centra that are shorter and wider than the first and the last one distinguishing LH PV39 from other known troodontids. A series of phylogenetic analyses were conducted using modified published matrices. By coding LH PV39 in different strategies, the troodontid affinity of LH PV39 is confirmed and it was recovered as the sister taxon of either Mei and Sinovenator (LH PV39 scored as a separate OTU) or Linhevenator (incorporating LH PV39 into Philovenator) in the best resolved coelurosaurian interrelationships. The referral of LH PV39 to Philovenator does not seriously alter the phylogenetic position of Philovenator nor the interrelationships of troodontids. This new finding confirms that the small and large sized troodontids are coexisted in the Gobi Desert of the Mongolia Plateau until the end of Cretaceous.",

Using these datasets, we evaluate the performance of three recently developed meta-predictors, REVEL, GAVIN and ClinPred, and compare their performance against two commonly used in silico tools, SIFT and PolyPhen-2.\n\nResultsAlthough the newer meta-predictors outperform the older tools, the performance of all pathogenicity predictors is substantially lower in the clinically-representative dataset. Using our clinically-relevant dataset, REVEL performed best with an area under the ROC of 0.81. Using a concordance-based approach based on a consensus of multiple tools reduces the performance due to both discordance between tools and false concordance where tools make common misclassification. Analysis of tool feature usage may give an insight into the tool performance and misclassification.\n\nConclusionOur results support the adoption of meta-predictors over traditional in silico tools, but do not support a consensus-based approach as recommended by current variant classification guidelines.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlcohol use disorders can be conceptualised as a learned pattern of maladaptive alcohol-consumption behaviours. The memories encoding these behaviours centrally contribute to long-term excessive alcohol consumption and are a key therapeutic target. The transient period of memory instability sparked during memory reconsolidation offers a therapeutic window to directly rewrite these memories using targeted behavioural interventions. However, clinically-relevant demonstrations of the efficacy of this approach are few. We examined key retrieval parameters for destabilising naturalistic drinking memories and the ability of subsequent counterconditioning to effect long-term reductions in drinking.\n\nMethodsHazardous/harmful beer-drinking volunteers (N=120) were factorially randomised to retrieve (RET) or not retrieve (No RET) alcohol reward memories with (PE) or without (No PE) alcohol reward prediction error. All participants subsequently underwent disgust-based counterconditioning of drinking cues. Acute responses to alcohol were assessed pre- and post-manipulation and drinking levels assessed up to 9 months.\n\nResultsGreater long-term reductions in drinking were found when counterconditioning was conducted following retrieval (with and without PE), despite a lack of short-term group differences in motivational responding to acute alcohol. Large variability in acute levels of learning during counterconditioning were noted.  Responsiveness to counterconditioning predicted subsequent responses to acute alcohol in RET+PE only, consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms.\n\nConclusionsThe longevity of behavioural interventions designed to reduce problematic drinking levels may be enhanced by leveraging reconsolidation-update mechanisms to rewrite maladaptive memory. However, inter-individual variability in levels of corrective learning is likely to determine the efficacy of reconsolidation-updating interventions and should be considered when designing and assessing interventions.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus plays a critical role in storing and retrieving spatial information. By targeting the dorsal hippocampus and manipulating specific \"candidate\" molecules using pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we have previously discovered that long-term active place avoidance memory requires transient activation of particular molecules in dorsal hippocampus. These molecules include amongst others, the persistent kinases Ca-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and the atypical protein kinase C isoform PKC{iota} /{lambda} for acquisition of the conditioned behavior, whereas persistent activation of the other atypical PKC, protein kinase M zeta (PKM{zeta}) is necessary for maintaining the memory for at least a month. It nonetheless remains unclear what other molecules and their interactions maintain active place avoidance long-term memory, and the candidate molecule approach is both impractical and inadequate to identify new candidates since there are so many to survey. Here we use a complementary approach to identify candidates by transcriptional profiling of hippocampus subregions after formation of the long-term active place avoidance memory. Interestingly, 24-h after conditioning and soon after expressing memory retention, immediate early genes were upregulated in the dentate gyrus but not Ammons horn of the memory expressing group. In addition to determining what genes are differentially regulated during memory maintenance, we performed an integrative, unbiased survey of the genes with expression levels that covary with behavioral measures of active place avoidance memory persistence. Gene Ontology analysis of the most differentially expressed genes shows that active place avoidance memory is associated with activation of transcription and synaptic differentiation in dentate gyrus but not CA3 or CA1, whereas hypothesis-driven candidate molecule analyses identified insignificant changes in the expression of many LTP-associated molecules in the various hippocampal subfields, nor did they covary with active place avoidance memory expression, ruling out strong transcriptional regulation but not translational regulation, which was not investigated. These findings and the data set establish an unbiased resource to screen for molecules and evaluate hypotheses for the molecular components of a hippocampus-dependent, long-term active place avoidance memory.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious studies have investigated differences in the volumes of subcortical structures (e.g., caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus) between individuals with and without Tourette syndrome (TS), as well as the relationships between these volumes and tic symptom severity. These volumes may also predict clinical outcome in Provisional Tic Disorder (PTD), but that hypothesis has never been tested.\n\nObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether the volumes of subcortical structures measured shortly after tic onset can predict tic symptom severity at one year post tic onset, when TS can first be diagnosed.\n\nMethodsWe obtained T1-weighted structural MRI scans from 41 children with PTD (25 with prospective motion correction [vNavs]) whose tics had begun less than 9 months (median 3.7 months) prior to the first study visit (baseline). We re-examined them at the 12-month anniversary of their first tic (follow-up), assessing tic severity using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. We quantified the volumes of subcortical structures using volBrain software.\n\nResultsBaseline hippocampal volume was correlated with tic severity at the 12-month follow-up, with a larger hippocampus at baseline predicting worse tic severity at follow-up. This result was confirmed in the subgroup scanned with prospective motion correction. The volumes of other subcortical structures did not significantly predict tic severity at follow-up.\n\nConclusionThese findings suggest that hippocampal volume may be an important marker in predicting prognosis in Provisional Tic Disorder.",

    "abstract": "Following prolonged swimming, Caenorhabditis elegans cycle between active swimming bouts and inactive quiescent bouts. Swimming is exercise for C. elegans and here we suggest that inactive bouts are a recovery state akin to fatigue. Previously, analysis of exercise-induced quiescent (EIQ) bouts relied on laborious manual observation, as existing automated analysis methods for C. elegans swimming either cannot analyze EIQ bouts or fail to accurately track animal posture during these bouts. It is known that cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) activity plays a conserved role in sleep, rest, and arousal. Using C. elegans EGL-4 PKG, we first validate a novel learning-based computer vision approach to automatically analyze C. elegans locomotory behavior and distinguish between activity and inactivity during swimming for long periods of time. We find that C. elegans EGL-4 PKG function predicts EIQ first bout timing, fractional quiescence, bout number, and bout duration, suggesting that previously described pathways are engaged during EIQ bouts. However, EIQ bouts are likely not sleep as animals are feeding during the majority of EIQ bouts. We find that genetic perturbation of neurons required for other C. elegans sleep states also does not alter EIQ dynamics. Additionally, we find that EIQ onset is sensitive to age and DAF-16 FOXO function. In summary, we have validated a new behavioral analysis software that enabled a quantitative and detailed assessment of swimming behavior, including EIQ. We found novel EIQ defects in aged animals and animals with mutations in a gene involved in stress tolerance. We anticipate that further use of this software will facilitate the analysis of genes and pathways critical for fatigue and other C. elegans behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Almost twenty years after the human genome was sequenced, the wealth of data produced by the international human genome project has not translated into a significantly improved drug discovery enterprise. This is in part because small molecule modulators that could be used to explore the cellular function of their target proteins and to discover new therapeutic opportunities are only available for a limited portion of the human proteome. International efforts are underway to develop such chemical tools for a few, specific protein families, and a \"Target 2035\" call to enable, expand and federate these efforts towards a comprehensive chemical coverage of the druggable genome was recently announced. But what is the druggable genome? Here, we systematically review structures of human proteins bound to drug-like ligands available from the protein databank (PDB) and use ligand desolvation upon binding as a druggability metric to draw a landscape of the human druggable genome. We show that the vast majority of druggable protein families, including some highly populated and deeply associated with cancer according to genomic screens, are almost orphan of small molecule ligands, and propose a list of 46 druggable domains representing 3440 human proteins that could be the focus of large chemical probe discovery efforts.",

    "abstract": "Excess of heterozygosity (H) is a widely used measure of genetic diversity of a population. As high-throughput sequencing and genotyping data become readily available, it has been applied to investigating the associations of genome-wide genetic diversity with human diseases and traits. However, these studies often report contradictory results. In this paper, we present a meta-analysis of five whole-exome studies to examine the association of H scores with Alzheimers disease. We show that the mean H score of a group is not associated with the disease status, but is associated with the sample size. Across all five studies, the group with more samples has a significantly lower H score than the group with fewer samples. To remove potential confounders in empirical data sets, we perform computer simulations to create artificial genomes controlled for the number of polymorphic loci, the sample size and the allele frequency. Analyses of these simulated data confirm the negative correlation between the sample size and the H score. Furthermore, we find that genomes with a large number of rare variants also have inflated H scores. These biases altogether can lead to spurious associations between genetic diversity and the phenotype of interest. Based on these findings, we advocate that studies shall balance the sample sizes when using genome-wide H scores to assess genetic diversities of different populations, which helps improve the reproducibility of future research.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) optical microscopy has allowed the investigation of many biological structures below the diffraction limit, however, most of the techniques are hampered by the need for fluorescent labels. Non-linear label-free techniques such as Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) provide structurally specific contrast without the addition of exogenous labels, allowing observation of unperturbed biological systems. Here we achieve super-resolution SHG (SR-SHG) for the first time. We use the photonic nanojet (PNJ) phenomena to achieve a resolution of ~{lambda}/6 with respect to the fundamental wavelength, a ~2.7-fold improvement over diffraction-limited SHG under the same imaging conditions. Crucially we find that the polarisation properties of excitation are maintained in a PNJ allowing the resolution to be further enhanced by detection of polarisation-resolved SHG (p-SHG) by observing anisotropy in signals. These new findings allowed us to visualise biological SHG-active structures such as collagen at an unprecedented and previously unresolvable spatial scale. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of an array of self-assembled high-index spheres overcomes the issue of a limited field of view for such a method, allowing PNJ-assisted SR-SHG to be used over a large area. Dysregulation of collagen at the nanoscale occurs in many diseases and is an underlying cause in diseases such as lung fibrosis. Here we are able to demonstrate that pSR-SHG allows unprecedented observation of changes at the nanoscale that are invisible by conventional diffraction-limited SHG imaging. The ability to non-destructively image SHG-active biological structures without labels at the nanoscale with a relatively simple optical method heralds the promise of a new tool to understand biological phenomena and drive drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Proper chromosome segregation is essential for faithful cell division and if not maintained results in defective cell function caused by abnormal distribution of genetic information. Polo-like kinase 1 interacting checkpoint helicase (PICH) is a DNA translocase essential in chromosome bridge resolution during mitosis. Its function in resolving chromosome bridges requires both DNA translocase activity and ability to bind chromosomal proteins modified by Small Ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). However, it is unclear how these activities are cooperating to resolve chromosome bridges. Here, we show that PICH specifically promotes the organization of SUMOylated proteins like SUMOylated TopoisomeraseII\u03b1 (TopoII\u03b1) on mitotic chromosomes. Conditional depletion of PICH using the Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) system resulted in the retention of SUMOylated chromosomal proteins, including TopoII\u03b1, indicating that PICH functions to control proper association of these proteins with chromosomes. Replacement of PICH with its mutants showed that PICH is required for the proper organization of SUMOylated proteins on chromosomes. In vitro assays showed that PICH specifically attenuates SUMOylated TopoII\u03b1 activity using its SUMO-binding ability. Taken together, we propose a novel function of PICH in remodeling SUMOylated proteins to ensure faithful chromosome segregation.Summary Statement Polo-like kinase interacting checkpoint helicase (PICH) interacts with SUMOylated proteins to mediate proper chromosome segregation during mitosis.

    "abstract": "Genome scans can potentially identify genetic loci involved in evolutionary processes such as local adaptation and gene flow. Here, we show that recombination rate variation across a neutrally evolving genome gives rise to mixed sampling distributions of mean FST[Formula], a common population genetic summary statistic. In particular, we show that in regions of low recombination the distribution of [Formula] estimates have more variance and a longer tail than in more highly recombining regions. Determining outliers from the genome-wide distribution without taking local recombination rate into consideration may therefore increase the frequency of false positives in low recombination regions and be overly conservative in more highly recombining ones. We perform genome-scans on simulated and empirical Drosophila melanogaster datasets and, in both cases, find patterns consistent with this neutral model. Similar patterns are observed for other summary statistics used to capture variation in the coalescent process. Linked selection, particularly background selection, is often invoked to explain heterogeneity in [Formula] across the genome, but here we point out that even under neutrality, statistical artefacts can arise due to variation in recombination rate. Our results highlight a flaw in the design of genome scan studies and suggest that without estimates of local recombination rate, interpreting the genomic landscape of any summary statistic that captures variation in the coalescent process will be very difficult.",

Recent results published in the literature propose different ways to leverage the tree structure to increase the detection rate of differentially abundant taxa. Here, we propose instead to use a different hierachical structure, in the form of a correlation-based tree, as it may capture the structure of the data better than the phylogeny. We first show that the correlation tree and the phylogeny are significantly different before turning to the impact of tree choice on detection rates. Using synthetic data, we show that the tree does have an impact: smoothing p-values according to the phylogeny leads to equal or inferior rates as smoothing according to the correlation tree. However, both trees are outperformed by the classical, non hierachical, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure in terms of detection rates. Other procedures may use the hierachical structure with profit but do not control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) a priori and remain inferior to a classical Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with the same nominal FDR. On real datasets, no hierarchical procedure had significantly higher detection rate that BH. Although intuition advocates the use of a hierachical structure, be it the phylogeny or the correlation tree, to increase the detection rate in microbiome studies, current hierachical procedures are still inferior to non hierachical ones and effective procedures remain to be invented.",

    "abstract": "The auditory system plays a critical role in supporting our ability to detect abrupt changes in our surroundings. Here we study how this capacity is affected in the course of healthy ageing. Artifical acoustic  scenes, populated by multiple concurrent streams of pure tones ( sources) were used to capture the challenges of listening in complex acoustic environments. Two scene conditions were included: REG scenes consisted of sources characterized by a regular temporal structure. Matched RAND scenes contained sources which were temporally random. Changes, manifested as the abrupt disappearance of one of the sources, were introduced to a subset of the trials and participants ( young group N=41, age 20-38 years;  older group N=41, age 60-82 years) were instructed to monitor the scenes for these events. Previous work demonstrated that young listeners exhibit better change detection performance in REG scenes, reflecting sensitivity to temporal structure. Here we sought to determine: (1) Whether  baseline change detection ability (i.e. in RAND scenes) is affected by age. (2) Whether aging affects listeners sensitivity to temporal regularity. (3) How change detection capacity relates to listeners hearing and cognitive profile. The results demonstrated that healthy aging is associated with reduced sensitivity to abrupt scene changes in RAND scenes but that performance does not correlate with age or standard audiological measures such as pure tone audiometry or speech in noise performance. Remarkably older listeners change detection performance improved substantially (up to the level exhibited by young listeners) in REG relative to RAND scenes. This suggests that the capacity to extract and track the regularity associated with scene sources, even in crowded acoustic environments, is relatively preserved in older listeners.",

The CC, corneal diameter, and refractive status were not significantly correlated with presence of DR or VTDR.\n\nConclusionLonger AL, deeper ACD, higher lens power, and higher AL/CR ratio may be protective factors against DR. Considering the high prevalence of myopia in the Chinese juvenile population, it is worth paying attention to how the incidence of DR in this generation may change over time.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTo efficiently save cost and reduce risk in drug research and development, there is a pressing demand to develop in-silico methods to predict drug sensitivity to cancer cells. With the exponentially increasing number of multi-omics data derived from high-throughput techniques, machine learning-based methods have been applied to the prediction of drug sensitivities. However, these methods have drawbacks either in the interpretability of mechanism of drug action or limited performance in modeling drug sensitivity.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we presented a pathway-guided deep neural network model, referred to as pathDNN, to predict the drug sensitivity to cancer cells. Biological pathways describe a group of molecules in a cell that collaborates to control various biological functions like cell proliferation and death, thereby abnormal function of pathways can result in disease. To make advantage of both the excellent predictive ability of deep neural network and the biological knowledge of pathways, we reshape the canonical DNN structure by incorporating a layer of pathway nodes and their connections to input gene nodes, which makes the DNN model more interpretable and predictive compared to canonical DNN. We have conducted extensive performance evaluations on multiple independent drug sensitivity data sets, and demonstrate that pathDNN significantly outperformed canonical DNN model and seven other classical regression models. Most importantly, we observed remarkable activity decreases of disease-related pathway nodes during forward propagation upon inputs of drug targets, which implicitly corresponds to the inhibition effect of disease-related pathways induced by drug treatment on cancer cells. Our empirical experiments show that pathDNN achieves pharmacological interpretability and predictive ability in modeling drug sensitivity to cancer cells.\n\nAvailabilityThe web server, as well as the processed data sets and source codes for reproducing our work, is available at http://pathdnn.denglab.org",

    "abstract": "Fear is adaptive when the level of the response rapidly scales to degree of threat. Using a discrimination procedure consisting of danger, uncertainty and safety cues, we have found rapid fear scaling (within two seconds of cue presentation) in male rats. Here we examined a possible role for the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) in the acquisition and expression of fear scaling. In experiment 1, male Long Evans rats received bilateral sham or neurotoxic NAcc lesions, recovered and underwent fear discrimination. NAcc-lesioned rats were generally impaired in scaling fear to degree of threat, and specifically impaired in rapid uncertainty-safety discrimination. In experiment 2, male Long Evans rats received NAcc transduction with halorhodopsin or a control fluorophore. After fear scaling was established, the NAcc was illuminated during cue or control periods. NAcc-halorhodopsin rats receiving cue illumination were specifically impaired in rapid uncertainty-safety discrimination. The results reveal a general role for the NAcc in scaling fear to degree of threat, and a specific role in rapid discrimination of uncertain threat and safety.\n\nSignificance StatementRapidly discriminating cues for threat and safety is essential for survival and impaired threat-safety discrimination is a hallmark of stress and anxiety disorders. In two experiments, we induced nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) dysfunction in rats receiving fear discrimination consisting of cues for danger, uncertainty and safety. Permanent NAcc dysfunction, via neurotoxic lesion, generally disrupted the ability to scale fear to degree of threat, and specifically impaired one component of scaling: rapid discrimination of uncertain threat and safety. Reversible NAcc dysfunction, via optogenetic inhibition, specifically impaired rapid discrimination of uncertain threat and safety. The results reveal that the NAcc is essential to scale fear to degree of threat, and is a plausible source of dysfunction in stress and anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Everyday task sequences, such as cooking, contain overarching goals (completing the meal), sub-goals (prepare vegetables), and motor actions (chopping). Such tasks generally are considered hierarchical because superordinate levels (e.g., goals) affect performance at subordinate levels (e.g., sub-goals and motor actions). However, there is debate as to whether this hierarchy is \"strict\" with unidirectional, top-down influences, and it is unknown if and how practice affects performance at the superordinate levels. To investigate these questions, we manipulated practice with sequences at the goal and motor action levels using an abstract, or non-motor, task sequence paradigm (Desrochers et al., 2015; Schneider & Logan, 2006). In three experiments, participants performed memorized abstract task sequences composed of simple tasks (e.g., color/shape judgements), where some contained embedded motor response sequences. We found that practice facilitated performance and reduced control costs for abstract task sequences and subordinate tasks. The interrelation was different between the hierarchical levels, demonstrating a strict relationship between abstract task sequence goals and sub-goals and a non-strict relationship between sub-goal and motor response levels. Under some conditions, the motor response level influenced the abstract task sequence level in a non-strict manner. Further, manipulating the presence or absence of a motor sequence after learning indicated that these effects were not the result of an integrated representation produced by practice. These experiments provide evidence for a mixed hierarchical model of task sequences and insight into the distinct roles of practice and motor processing in efficiently executing task sequences in daily life.",

Transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) has been shown to be effective in treating MDD, but the current treatment dosage does not account for anatomical head and brain changes due to aging.\n\nAimWe study effective t-PBM dosage and its variations across age groups using state-of-the-art Monte Caxrlo (MC) simulations and age-dependent brain atlases ranging between 5 to 85 years of age.\n\nApproachAge-dependent brain models are derived from 18 MRI brain atlases. Two extracranial source positions, F3-F4 and Fp1-Fpz-Fp2 in the EEG 10-20 system, are simulated at five selected wavelengths and energy depositions at two MDD-relevant cortical regions - dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) - are quantified.\n\nResultsAn overall decrease of energy deposition was found with increasing age. A strong negative correlation between the thickness of extra-cerebral tissues (ECT) and energy deposition, suggesting that increasing ECT thickness over age is primarily responsible for reduced energy delivery. The F3-F4 position appears to be more efficient in reaching dlPFC compared to treating vmPFC via the Fp1-Fpz-Fp2 position.\n\nConclusionQuantitative simulations revealed age-dependent light delivery across the lifespan of human brains, suggesting the needs for personalized and age-adaptive t-PBM treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathways are known to be crucial in the development of neural crest lineages, including the sympathetic nervous system. Surprisingly, their role in paediatric neuroblastoma, the prototypic tumour arising from this lineage, remains relatively uncharacterised. We previously demonstrated that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling can have cell-type specific effects on neuroblastoma phenotypes, including growth inhibition and differentiation, and that BMP4 mRNA and protein were induced by Wnt3a/Rspo2. In this study, we characterise the phenotypic effects of BMP4 on neuroblastoma cells, demonstrating convergent induction of MSX homeobox transcription factors by Wnt and BMP4 signalling and BMP4-induced growth suppression and differentiation. Immunohistochemical analysis of BMP4 expression in primary neuroblastomas confirms a striking absence of BMP4 in poorly differentiated tumours, in contrast to high expression in ganglion cells. These results are consistent with a tumour suppressive role for BMP4 in neuroblastoma. RNA sequencing following BMP4 treatment revealed induction of Notch signalling, verified by increases of Notch3 and Hes1 proteins. Together, our data demonstrate for the first time Wnt-BMP-Notch signalling crosstalk associated with growth suppression of neuroblastoma.",

The successes gained with long-lasting pyrethroid treated bed-nets is now in jeopardy because of wide-spread, pyrethroid-resistance in mosquitoes. Using crowd modeling theory normalized for standard bed-net architecture, we were able to design an attract-trap-kill mechanism for mosquitoes that does not require insecticides. Using three-dimensional polyester knitting and heat fixation, trap funnels were developed with high capture efficacy, no egression under worst-case laboratory conditions, and greater durability than current bed-nets sold. Field testing in Africa in WHO huts with Gen1-3 T (trap)-Nets validated our model, and as predicted, Gen3 had the highest efficacy with a 4.3-fold greater trap-kill rate with no deterrence or repellency compared to Permanet 2.0, the most common bed-net in Africa. A T-Net population model was developed based on field data to predict community level mosquito control compared to a pyrethroid bed-net. This model showed the Gen3 T-Net under field conditions in Africa against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes was 12.7-fold more efficacious than single chemical, pyrethroid treated nets, demonstrating significantly greater mosquito control using bed-nets without insecticides.",

Additionally, it has a major role in acquiring the structural insights from the parameters derived from the experimental techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy. Steric hindrance is one of the important measures to validate the accuracy of the constructed model. A web user interface (WUI) namely, STRIDER (steric hindrance estimator) (www.iith.ac.in/strider/) can estimate and report pairwise inter- and intra- molecular steric hindrances using the van der Waals radius of 117 elements through a user interactive interface. STRIDER also identifies and reports the coordination number of 64 metals along with their interacting pattern in an interactive mode. STRIDER can analyze an ensemble of conformers, wherein, multiple conformers are used to circumvent sampling issue in flexible docking, understand protein folding and facilitate structure based virtual screening. Further, it generates a pymol session file that can be used for offline analysis. As STRIDER simply requires the Cartesian coordinates of the given molecule in protein data bank format, any chemical structure can be an input.\n\nAvailabilityIt can be freely accessible through: www.iith.ac.in/strider/ without any registration.\n\nTheme Of the Concept\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/931550v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7be933org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b2e30org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1056b7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d42f28_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The number of FPUs served as a barometer for stable and long-distance transport by multiple motors, which was then used to quantify the extent of damage to axonal transport by dynarrestin, a dynein inhibitor. We found that dynarrestin decreased the FPU for retrograde transport more than anterograde transport.

From population and comparative genomics, we infer the insertion is derived in N2 and related laboratory lines, likely arising during the domestication of Caenorhabditis elegans, and breaking a conserved protein. The ancestral version of col-182 also modifies the phenotypes of four other classical cuticle mutant alleles, and the effects of natural genetic variation on worm shape and locomotion.

    "abstract": "One particularly promising feature of nanopore sequencing is the ability to reject reads, enabling real-time selection of molecules without complex sample preparation. This is based on the idea of deciding whether a molecule warrants full sequencing depending on reading a small initial part. Previously, such decisions have been based on a priori determination of which regions of the genome were considered of interest. Instead, here we consider more general and complex strategies that incorporate already-observed data in order to optimize the rejection strategy and maximise information gain from the sequencing process. For example, in the presence of coverage bias redistributing data from areas of high to areas of low coverage would be desirable.\n\nWe present BOSS-RUNS, a mathematical and algorithmic framework to calculate the expected benefit of new reads and generate dynamically updated decision strategies for nanopore sequencing. During sequencing, in real time, we quantify the current uncertainty at each site of one or multiple reference genomes, and for each novel DNA fragment being sequenced we decide whether the potential decrease in uncertainty at the sites it will most likely cover warrants reading it in its entirety. This dynamic, adaptive sampling allows real-time focus of sequencing efforts onto areas of highest benefit.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of BOSS-RUNS by mitigating coverage bias across and within the species of a microbial community. Additionally, we show that our approach leads to improved variant calling due to its ability to sample more data at the most relevant genomic positions.",

However, viable measurement models for estimating individual differences in grey matter structural integrity are lacking; instead, findings rely on fallible single indicators of integrity. Here, we introduce multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) methodology to capture individual differences in grey matter integrity, based on multimodal structural imaging in a large sample of 1,522 healthy adults aged 60 to 88 years from the Berlin Aging Study II, including 331 participants who underwent MR imaging. Structural integrity factors expressed the common variance of voxel-based morphometry (VBM), mean diffusivity (MD), and magnetization transfer ratio (MT) for each of four regions of interest (ROI): hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. Except for precuneus, the integrity factors correlated with episodic memory. Associations with hippocampal and parahippocampal integrity persisted after controlling for age, sex, and education. Our results support the proposition that episodic memory ability in old age benefits from maintained structural integrity of hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Exploratory follow-up analyses on sex differences showed that this effect is restricted to men. Multimodal factors of structural brain integrity might help improve our biological understanding of human memory aging.",

    "abstract": "Detecting and learning temporal regularities is essential to accurately predict the future. A long-standing debate in cognitive science concerns the existence of a dissociation, in humans, between two systems, one for handling statistical regularities governing the probabilities of individual items and their transitions, and another for handling deterministic rules. Here, to address this issue, we used finger tracking to continuously monitor the online build-up of evidence, confidence, false alarms and changes-of-mind during sequence processing. All these aspects of behaviour conformed tightly to a hierarchical Bayesian inference model with distinct hypothesis spaces for statistics and rules, yet linked by a single probabilistic currency. Alternative models based either on a single statistical mechanism or on two non-commensurable systems were rejected. Our results indicate that a hierarchical Bayesian inference mechanism, capable of operating over distinct hypothesis spaces for statistics and rules, underlies the human capability for sequence processing.",

    "abstract": "Similarly to human population imaging, there are several well-founded motivations for animal population imaging, the most notable being the improvement of the validity of statistical results by pooling a sufficient number of animal data provided by different imaging centers. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a multicenter animal study, sharing raw data from forty rats and processing pipelines between four imaging centers. As specific use case, we considered the estimation of T1 and T2 maps for the healthy rat brain at 7T. We quantitatively report about the variability observed across two data provider centers and evaluate the influence of image processing steps on the final maps, by using three fitting algorithms from three centers. Finally, to derive relaxation time values per brain area, two multi-atlas segmentation pipelines from different centers were executed on two different platforms. In this study, the impact of the acquisition was 2.21% (not significant) and 9.52% on T1 and T2 estimates while the impact of the data processing pipeline was not significant (1.04% and 3.33%, respectively). In addition, the computed normality values can serve as relaxometry reference maps to explore differences to animal models of pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding provides a computational paradigm for modelling perceptual processing as the construction of representations accounting for causes of sensory inputs. Here, we develop a scalable, deep predictive coding network that is trained using a Hebbian learning rule. Without a priori constraints that would force model neurons to respond like biological neurons, the model exhibits properties similar to those reported in experimental studies. We analyze low- and high-level properties such as orientation selectivity, object selectivity and sparseness of neuronal populations in the model. As reported experimentally, image selectivity increases systematically across ascending areas in the model hierarchy. A further emergent network property is that representations for different object classes become more distinguishable from lower to higher areas. Thus, deep predictive coding networks can be effectively trained using biologically plausible principles and exhibit emergent properties that have been experimentally identified along the visual cortical hierarchy.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding brain mechanisms of perception requires a computational approach based on neurobiological principles. Many deep learning architectures are trained by supervised learning from large sets of labeled data, whereas biological brains must learn from unlabeled sensory inputs. We developed a Predictive Coding methodology for building scalable networks that mimic deep sensory cortical hierarchies, perform inference on the causes of sensory inputs and are trained by unsupervised, Hebbian learning. The network models are well-behaved in that they faithfully reproduce visual images based on high-level, latent representations. When ascending the sensory hierarchy, we find increasing image selectivity, sparseness and generalizability for object classification. These models show how a complex neuronal phenomenology emerges from biologically plausible, deep networks for unsupervised perceptual representation.",

    "abstract": "In learning and adapting movements in changing conditions, people attribute the errors they experience to a combined weighting of internal or external sources. As such, error attribution that places more weight on external sources should lead to decreased updates in our internal models for movement of the limb or estimating the position of the effector, i.e. there should be reduced implicit learning. However, measures of implicit learning are the same whether or not we induce explicit adaptation with instructions about the nature of the perturbation. Here we evoke clearly external errors by either demonstrating the rotation on every trial, or showing the hand itself throughout training. Implicit reach aftereffects persist, but are reduced in both groups. Only for the group viewing the hand, changes in hand position estimates suggest that predicted sensory consequences are not updated, but only rely on recalibrated proprioception. Our results show that estimating the position of the hand incorporates source attribution during motor learning, but recalibrated proprioception is an implicit process unaffected by external error attribution.",

The infectious course was monitored by bioluminescence (BLI) signal via IVIS imaging and recording of weight change. The infected hind paws were harvested at four time points: 24 hours, 72 hours, 1 week and 2 weeks for histopathology using Alcian Blue hematoxylin staining. Two-way ANOVA with Sidaks multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis.\n\nResultsThe infected cohort displayed significantly elevated bioluminescent values, reductions in weight, and exhibited swelling of the infected digit throughout the course of infection. By day 7 most infected mice saw a substantial decrease in BLI signal intensity, however two infected mice exhibited persistent BLI intensity through day 14. Histopathology of the infected cohort showed tissue disorganization and the presence of a cellular infiltrate in and around the flexor tendon sheath.\n\nConclusionsA murine model of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is possible. Further optimization of the model offers an experimental platform for investigation of the pathophysiology of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis.\n\nClinical RelevanceThis animal model can be utilized in order to elucidate the basic molecular/cellular mechanisms of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis while simultaneously evaluating novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormone cytokinin influences many aspects of plant growth and development, several of which also involve the cellular process of autophagy, including leaf senescence, nutrient re-mobilization, and developmental transitions. The Arabidopsis type-A Response Regulators (type-A ARR) are negative regulators of cytokinin signaling that are transcriptionally induced in response to cytokinin. Here, we describe a mechanistic link between cytokinin signaling and autophagy, demonstrating that plants modulate cytokinin sensitivity through autophagic regulation of type-A ARR proteins. Type-A ARR proteins were degraded by autophagy in an AUTOPHAGY-RELATED (ATG)5-dependent manner. EXO70D family members interacted with Type-A ARR proteins, likely in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and recruited them to autophagosomes via interaction with the core autophagy protein, ATG8. Consistently, loss-of-function exo70D1,2,3 mutants compromised targeting of type-A ARRs to autophagic vesicles, have elevated levels of type-A ARR proteins, and are hyposensitive to cytokinin. Disruption of both type-A ARRs and EXO70D1,2,3 compromised survival in carbon-deficient conditions, suggesting interaction between autophagy and cytokinin responsiveness in response to stress. These results indicate that the EXO70D proteins act as selective autophagy receptors to target type-A ARR cargos for autophagic degradation, demonstrating that cytokinin signaling can be modulated by selective autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Metaheuristic procedures (MH) have been a trend driving Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers for the past 50 years. A variety of tools and applications (not only in Computer Science) stem from these techniques. Also, MH frequently rely on evolution, a trademark process involved in cell colony growth. Generally, MH are used to approximate the solution to difficult problems but require a large amount of computational resources. Cell colonies harboring synthetic distributed circuits using intercell communication offer a direction for tackling this problem, as they process information in a massively parallel fashion. In this work, we propose a framework that maps MH elements to synthetic circuits in growing cell colonies. The framework relies on cell-cell communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing (QS) and bacterial conjugation. As a proof-of-concept, we also implemented the workflow associated to the framework, and tested the execution of two specific MH (Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing) encoded as synthetic circuits on the gro simulator. Furthermore, we show an example of how our framework can be extended by implementing another kind of computational model: The Cellular Automaton. This work seeks to lay the foundations of mappings for implementing AI algorithms in a general manner using Synthetic Biology constructs in cell colonies.",

The model generates a range of disease dynamics consistent with observed Aedes aegypti abundances and laboratory-confirmed arboviral incidence with variable accuracy (28 - 85% for vectors, 44 - 88% for incidence). The model predicted vector dynamics better in sites with a smaller proportion of young children in the population, lower mean temperature, and homes with piped water and made of cement. Models with limited calibration that robustly capture climate-virus relationships can help guide intervention efforts and climate change disease projections.",

To investigate the mechanism of centromere-type transition, we improved the fragmented genome assembly and constructed a chromosome-level genome assembly of C. tropicalis by employing PacBio sequencing, chromosome conformation capture sequencing (3C-seq), chromoblot, and genetic analysis of engineered aneuploid strains. Further, we analyzed the 3D genome organization using 3C-seq data, which revealed spatial proximity among the centromeres as well as telomeres of seven chromosomes in C. tropicalis. Intriguingly, we observed evidence of inter-centromeric translocations in the common ancestor of C. albicans and C. tropicalis. Identification of putative centromeres in closely related Candida sojae, Candida viswanathii and Candida parapsilosis indicates loss of ancestral HIR-associated centromeres and establishment of evolutionary new centromeres (ENCs) in C. albicans.

However, neurological patients with damage restricted to the occipital cortex typically show perfectly vivid VMI, while more anterior damages extending into the temporal lobe, especially in the left hemisphere, often cause VMI impairments. Here we present two major results reconciling neuroimaging findings in neurotypical subjects with the performance of brain-damaged patients: (1) a large-scale metaanalysis of 46 fMRI studies, of which 27 investigated specifically visual mental imagery, revealed that VMI engages fronto-parietal networks and a well-delimited region in the left fusiform gyrus. (2) A Bayesian analysis showing no evidence for imagery-related activity in early visual cortices. We propose a revised neural model of VMI that draws inspiration from recent cytoarchitectonic and lesion studies, whereby fronto-parietal networks initiate, modulate, and maintain activity in a core temporal network centered on the fusiform imagery node, a high-level visual region in the left fusiform gyrus.",

    "abstract": "We present a non-invasive method based on Optical Coherence Elastography (OCE) enabling the in vivo segmentation of morphological tissue constituents, in particular, monitoring of morphological alterations during both tumor development and its response to therapies. The method uses compressional OCE to reconstruct tissue stiffness map as the first step. Then the OCE-image is divided into regions, for which the Youngs modulus (stiffness) falls in specific ranges corresponding to the morphological constituents to be discriminated. These stiffness ranges (characteristic \"stiffness spectra\") are initially determined by careful comparison of the \"gold-standard\" histological data and the OCE-based stiffness map for the corresponding tissue regions. After such precalibration, the results of morphological segmentation of OCE-images demonstrate a striking correlation with the histological results in terms of percentage of the segmented zones. To demonstrate high sensitivity of the OCE-method and its excellent correlation with conventional histological segmentation we present results obtained in vivo on a murine model of breast cancer in comparative experimental study of the efficacy of two anti-tumor chemotherapeutic drugs with different mechanisms of action. The new technique allowed in vivo monitoring and quantitative segmentation of (i) viable, (ii) dystrophic, (iii) necrotic tumor cells and (iv) edema zones very similar to morphological segmentation of histological images. Numerous applications in other experimental/clinical areas requiring rapid, nearly real-time, quantitative assessment of tissue structure can be foreseen.",

Tandem duplications of genomic loci are thought to be widespread among bacteria but due to their often intractable size and instability, comprehensive studies of the range and genome dynamics of these mutations are rare. We define a methodology to investigate duplications in bacterial genomes based on read depth of genome sequence data as a proxy for copy number. We demonstrate the approach with Bordetella pertussis, whose insertion sequence element-rich genome provides extensive scope for duplications to occur. Analysis of genome sequence data for 2430 B. pertussis isolates identified 272 putative duplications, of which 94% were located at 11 hotspot loci. We demonstrate limited phylogenetic connection for the occurrence of duplications, suggesting unstable and sporadic characteristics. Genome instability was further described in-vitro using long read sequencing via the Nanopore platform. Clonally derived laboratory cultures produced heterogenous populations containing multiple structural variants. Short read data was used to predict 272 duplications, whilst long reads generated on the Nanopore platform enabled the in-depth study of the genome dynamics of tandem duplications in B. pertussis. Our work reveals the unrecognised and dynamic genetic diversity of B. pertussis and, as the complexity of the B. pertussis genome is not unique, highlights the need for a holistic and fundamental understanding of bacterial genetics.",

The biosynthesis of these molecules in marine algae begins with the desaturation of fatty acids by {Delta}6-desaturases and enzymes from different species display a range of specificities towards {omega}3 and {omega}6 LCPUFAs. In the absence of a molecular structure, the structural basis for the variable substrate specificity of {Delta}6-desaturases is poorly understood. Here we have conducted a consensus mutagenesis and ancestral protein reconstruction-based analysis of the {Delta}6-desaturase family, focusing on the {omega}3-specific {Delta}6-desaturase from Micromonas pusilla (Mp{Delta}6des) and the bispecific ({omega}3/{omega}6) {Delta}6-desaturase from Ostreococcus tauri (Ot{Delta}6des). Our characterization of consensus amino acid substitutions in Mp{Delta}6des revealed that residues in diverse regions of the protein, such as the N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain, can make important contributions to determining substrate specificity. Ancestral protein reconstruction also suggests that some extant {Delta}6-desaturases, such as Ot{Delta}6des, could have adapted to different environmental conditions by losing specificity for {omega}3-LCPUFAs. This dataset provides a map of regions within {Delta}6-desaturases that contribute to substrate specificity and could facilitate future attempts to engineer these proteins for use in biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Braided DNAs are significant structural intermediates in cellular processes, yet little has been experimentally demonstrated about their higher-order structure and twisting torques. We use magnetic tweezers to measure braid extensions at forces ranging from 0.3 to 8 piconewtons, and then apply a thermodynamic Maxwell relation to calculate the torque. Experimentally inferred torques in unbuckled braids take on values up to 76 pN{middle dot}nm, which depends on force, and inter-tether distance. As predicted using a statistical mechanical model, the twist modulus of the braids increases with catenation prior to buckling or formation of plectoneme, and is comparable to that of single DNA.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae uses several type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors, namely XopN, XopQ, XopX, and XopZ, to suppress rice immune responses that are induced following treatment with cell wall degrading enzymes. Here we show that the T3SS secreted effector XopX interacts with two of the eight rice 14-3-3 proteins. Mutants of XopX that are defective in 14-3-3 binding are also defective in suppression of immune responses, suggesting that interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is required for suppression of host innate immunity. However, Agrobacterium mediated delivery of both XopX and XopQ into rice cells results in induction of rice immune responses. These immune responses are not observed when either protein is individually delivered into rice cells. XopQ-XopX induced rice immune responses are not observed in a XopX mutant that is defective in 14-3-3 binding. Yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays indicate that XopQ and XopX interact with each other. In a screen for Xanthomonas effectors which can suppress XopQ-XopX induced rice immune responses, five effectors were identified, namely XopU, XopV, XopP, XopG and AvrBs2, which were able to do so. These results suggest a complex interplay of Xanthomonas T3SS effectors in suppression of pathogen triggered immunity and effector triggered immunity to promote virulence on rice.\n\nSignificance statementThis work studies the role of the type III effector XopX in the suppression and induction of rice immune responses, by differential interaction with the 14-3-3 proteins, or with the type III effector XopQ respectively. We have also identified a subset of type III effectors which can suppress this form of immune responses.",

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of parent populations, germination conditions, and the substrate to commercial seedling production of E. edulis. Nine thousand seven hundred and thirteen seeds were distributed between the heated water and control, greenhouse and open-field treatments. The parent population presented high differences between most of the germination indexes. Influencing the germination rate, mean germination time and germination speed, but not affecting synchrony and uncertainty indexes. Heated water treatment did not affect any of the studied indexes, presenting a close pattern of germination over time, indicating it is an appropriate method for seedling production. Greenhouse and open-field treatment presented variations at the same indexes affected in the parent population analysis. The most profitable method for E. edulis seed germination was the greenhouse production method, which provided the best indexes results.",

    "abstract": "Vascular diseases are among the leading causes of death and threaten human health worldwide. Imaging examination of vascular pathology with reduced invasiveness is challenging due to the intrinsic vasculature complexity and the non-uniform scattering from bio-tissues. Here, we report VasNet, a vasculature-aware unsupervised learning algorithm that augments pathovascular recognition from small sets of unlabeled fluorescence and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. The VasNet adopts the multi-scale fusion strategy with a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) loss function that induces biased pattern reconstruction, by strengthening the features relevant to the retinal vasculature reference while weakening the irrelevant features. VasNet delivers outputs of \"Structure + X\", where X refers to multi-dimensional features such as blood flows, the distinguishment of blood dilation and its suspicious counterparts, and the dependence of new pattern emergence on a disease progression, which may assist the discovery of novel diagnostics. Therefore, explainable imaging output from VasNet and other algorithm extensions hold the promise to revolutionize the practice of medical diagnosis, as it improves performance while reduces the cost on human expertise, equipment exquisite and time consumption.",

However, it is also possible that sex chromosome formation occurs in regions with pre-existing recombination suppression. To evaluate these possibilities, we constructed linkage maps and a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus, a species with a young neo-sex chromosome found in part of its geographical range. We found that the ancestral sex-linked region is located in a large region characterized by low recombination. Furthermore, comparison between the recombination landscape of the neo-sex chromosome and its autosomal homologue indicates that low recombination rates preceded sex linkage. Our findings suggest that ancestrally low rates of recombination have facilitated the formation and evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a debilitating neuropsychiatric illness affecting over 20% of the population worldwide. Despite its prevalence, our understanding of its pathophysiology is severely limited, thus hampering the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Recent advances have clearly established astrocytes as major players in the pathophysiology, and plausibly pathogenesis, of major depression. In particular, astrocyte density in the hippocampus is severely diminished in MDD patients and correlates strongly with the disease outcome. Moreover, astrocyte densities from different subfields of the hippocampus show varying trends in terms of their correlation to the disease outcome. Given the central role that hippocampus plays in the pathophysiology of depression and in the action of antidepressant drugs, changes in hippocampal astrocyte density and physiology may have a significant effect on behavioral symptoms of MDD. In this study, we used Chronic Mild Unpredictable Stress (CMUS) in mice, which induces a depressive-like state, and examined its effects on astrocytes from different subfields of the hippocampus. We used S100{beta} immunostaining to estimate the number of astrocytes per mm2 from various hippocampal subfields. Furthermore, using confocal images of fluorescently labeled GFAP-immunopositive hippocampal astrocytes, we quantified various morphology-related parameters and performed Sholl analysis. We found that CMUS exerts differential effects on astrocyte cell density, ramification, cell radius, surface area, and process width of hippocampal astrocytes from different hippocampal subfields. Taken together, our study reveals that chronic stress doesnt uniformly affect all hippocampal astrocytes; but exerts its effects differentially on different astrocytic subpopulations within the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Fibrillar collagen-integrin interactions in the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulate a multitude of cellular processes and cell signalling. Collagen I fibrils serve as the molecular scaffolding for connective tissues throughout the human body and are the most abundant protein building blocks in the ECM. The ECM environment is diverse, made up of several ECM proteins, enzymes, and proteoglycans. The contents of the ECM environment are modulated by disease and aging and may influence these critical collagen-integrin interactions. In particular, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), anionic polysaccharides that decorate proteoglycans, become depleted in the ECM with natural aging and their mis-regulation has been linked to cancers and other diseases. The impact of GAG concentration in the ECM environment on collagen interactions is not well understood. Here, we integrate protein adhesion assays with liquid high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess the affects of GAG depletion on the interaction of collagen I fibrils with the integrin 2I domain. Adhesion assays demonstrate that 2I preferentially binds to GAG-depleted collagen I fibrils. By amplitude modulated AFM in air and in solution, we find that GAG-depleted collagen I fibrils retain structural features of the native fibrils, including their characteristic D-banding pattern, a key structural motif. AFM fast force mapping in solution shows that GAG depletion reduces the stiffness of individual fibrils, lowering the indentation modulus by half compared to native fibrils. Together these results shed new light on how GAGs influence collagen I fibril- integrin interactions and may aid in strategies to treat diseases that result from GAG misregulation.\n\nStatement for broader audienceAging and disease result in mis-regulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which may affect fibrillar collagen interactions that are vital for cellular processes. Here, we characterize the impact of GAG depletion on collagen-integrin 2I domain interactions and collagen fibril topography and stiffness. We show that GAG depletion increases collagen-2I binding and reduces stiffness in comparison to native fibrils. These results may inform on strategies for treating GAG mis-regulation.",

    "abstract": "Bst-2/tetherin inhibits the release of numerous enveloped viruses by physically attaching nascent particles to infected cells during the process of viral budding from the cell surface. Tetherin also restricts human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), and pandemic main (M) group HIV-1s are thought to exclusively rely on their Vpu proteins to overcome tetherin-mediated restriction of virus release. However, at least one M group HIV-1 strain, the macrophage-tropic primary AD8 isolate, is unable to express vpu due to a mutation in its translation initiation codon. Here, using primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), we show that AD8 was able to use its Nef protein to compensate for the absence of Vpu and restore virus release to wild type levels. We demonstrate that HIV-1 AD8 Nef reduces endogenous tetherin levels from the cell surface, physically separating it from the site of viral budding and thus preventing HIV retention. Mechanistically, AD8 Nef enhances l-tetherin internalisation, leading to perinuclear accumulation of the restriction factor. Finally, we show that Nef proteins from other HIV strains also display varying degrees of tetherin antagonism. Overall, this is the first report showing that M group HIV-1s can use an accessory protein other than Vpu to antagonise human tetherin.",

Many isolation techniques routinely discard the large EVs at the early stages of small EV or exosome isolation protocols. We describe here a standardised method to isolate large EVs and examine EV marker expression and diameter using imaging flow cytometry.\n\nMethodsWe describe step-wise isolation and characterisation of a subset of large EVs from the medulloblastoma cell line UW228-2 assessed by fluorescent light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and TRPS. Viability of parent cells was assessed by Annexin V exposure by flow cytometry. Imaging flow cytometry (Imagestream Mark II) identified EVs by direct fluorescent membrane labelling with Cell Mask Orange (CMO) in conjunction with EV markers. A stringent gating algorithm based on side scatter and fluorescence intensity was applied and expression of EV markers CD63, CD9 and LAMP 1 assessed.\n\nResultsUW228-2 cells prolifically release EVs of up to 6 {micro}m. We show that the Imagestream Mark II imaging flow cytometer allows robust and reproducible analysis of large EVs, including assessment of diameter. We also demonstrate a correlation between increasing EV size and co-expression of markers screened.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed a labelling and stringent gating strategy which is able to explore EV marker expression (CD63, CD9 and LAMP1) on individual EVs within a widely heterogeneous population. Taken together data presented here strongly support the value of exploring large EVs in clinical samples for potential biomarkers, useful in diagnostic screening and disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The ability to integrate input from different sensory systems is a fundamental property of many brains. Yet, the patterns of neuronal connectivity that underlie such multisensory integration remain poorly characterized. The Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body -- an associative center required for the formation of olfactory and visual memories -- is an ideal system to investigate how different sensory channels converge in higher-order brain centers. The neurons connecting the mushroom body to the olfactory system have been described in great detail, but input from other sensory systems remains poorly defined. Here, we use a range of anatomical and genetic techniques to identify two novel types of mushroom body input neuron that connect visual processing centers -- namely the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum -- to the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body. Together with previous work that described a pathway conveying visual information from the medulla to the ventral accessory calyx of the mushroom body (Vogt et al., 2016), our study defines a second, parallel pathway that is anatomically poised to convey information from the visual system to the dorsal accessory calyx. This connectivity pattern -- the segregation of the visual information into two separate pathways -- could be a fundamental feature of the neuronal architecture underlying multisensory integration in associative brain centers.",

    "abstract": "Marine cyanobacteria are infected by phage whose genomes encode ferredoxin (Fd) electron carriers. While these Fds are thought to redirect the energy harvested from light to phage-encoded oxidoreductases that enhance viral fitness, it is not clear how the biophysical properties and partner specificities of phage Fds relate to those in photosynthetic organisms. Bioinformatic analysis using a sequence similarity network revealed that phage Fds are most closely related to cyanobacterial Fds that transfer electrons from photosystems to oxidoreductases involved in nutrient assimilation. Structural analysis of myovirus P-SSM2 Fd (pssm2-Fd), which infects Prochlorococcus marinus, revealed high similarity to cyanobacterial Fds ([&le;]0.5 [A] RMSD). Additionally, pssm2-Fd exhibits a low midpoint reduction potential (-336 mV vs. SHE) similar to other photosynthetic Fds, albeit lower thermostability (Tm = 28{degrees}C) than many Fds. When expressed in an Escherichia coli strain with a sulfite assimilation defect, pssm2-Fd complemented growth when coexpressed with a Prochlorococcus marinus sulfite reductase, revealing that pssm2-Fd can transfer electrons to a host protein involved in nutrient assimilation. The high structural similarity with cyanobacterial Fds and reactivity with a host sulfite reductase suggest that phage Fds evolved to transfer electrons to cyanobacterial-encoded oxidoreductases.",

Most cells maintain telomere repeat lengths by utilizing the enzyme telomerase, although there are some cancer cells that use a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere extension, termed Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). Cells that employ ALT are characterized, in part, by the presence of specialized PML nuclear bodies called ALT-associated PML-Bodies (APBs). APBs localize to and cluster telomeric ends together with telomeric and DNA damage factors, which led to the proposal that these bodies act as a platform on which ALT can occur. However, the necessity of APBs and their function in the ALT pathway has remained unclear. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete PML and APB components from ALT-positive cells to cleanly define the function of APBs in ALT. We find that PML is required for the ALT mechanism, and that this necessity stems from APBs role in localizing the BLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) complex to ALT telomere ends. Strikingly, recruitment of the BTR complex to telomeres in a PML-independent manner bypasses the need for PML in the ALT pathway, suggesting that BTR localization to telomeres is sufficient to sustain ALT activity.",

We show that the scrib mutation impacts the direct transcriptional output of the Notch pathway, without altering the global distribution of Su(H), the Notch dedicated transcription factor. The Notch-dependent neoplasms require however, the action of a group of transcription factors, similar to those previously identified for Ras/scrib neoplasm (namely AP-1, Stat92E, Ftz-F1, and bZIP factors), further suggesting the importance of this transcription factor network during neoplastic growth. Finally our work highlights some Notch/scrib specificities, in particular the role of the PAR domain containing bZIP transcription factor and Notch direct target Pdp1 for neoplastic growth.",

While previous studies have mostly focussed on how community aspects such as species richness and composition affect carrion consumption rates, it remains unclear whether this important function of scavengers is better explained by the dominance of key functional traits or niche complementarity as a result of a diverse functional representation.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we test three competitive hypotheses to assess if carrion consumption in vertebrate scavenger communities depends on: i) the presence of key dominant traits (functional identity hypothesis), ii) functional diversity that promotes niche complementarity (functional diversity hypothesis), or iii) the accumulation of individuals and species, irrespective of their trait representation (functional equivalence). To explore these hypotheses, we used five study areas in Spain and South Africa, which represent a gradient of scavenger biodiversity, i.e., ranging from communities dominated by facultative scavengers, such as generalists and meso-predators, to those including vultures and large carnivores.\nC_LIO_LIWithin study areas, traits that characterise obligate scavengers or large carnivores (e.g. mean home range, proportion of social foragers) were positively linked to rapid carrion consumption, while the biomass of functional groups including facultative scavengers were either weakly or negatively associated with carrion consumption.\nC_LIO_LIWhen combining all study areas, higher rates of carrion consumption were related to scavenger communities dominated by species with large home ranges (e.g. Gyps vultures), which was found to be a key trait. In contrast, metrics describing functional diversity (functional dispersion) and functional equivalence (species richness and abundance) had lower predictive power in explaining carrion consumption patterns.\nC_LIO_LIOur data support the functional identity hypothesis as a better framework for explaining carrion consumption rates than functional diversity or equivalence. Our findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms sustaining ecosystem functioning in vertebrate communities and reinforce the role of obligate scavengers and large carnivores as keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity and genotype x environment interaction (GxE) is of primary importance for plant breeding in the context of global climate change. Tomato is a widely cultivated crop that can grow in different geographical habitats and which evinces a great capacity of expressing phenotypic plasticity. We used a multi-parental advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) tomato population to explore GxE and plasticity for multiple traits measured in a multi-environment trial (MET) design comprising optimal cultural conditions and water deficit, salinity and heat stress over 12 environments. Substantial GxE was observed for all the traits measured. Different plasticity parameters were estimated through the Finlay-Wilkinson and factorial regression models and used together with the genotypic means for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping analyses. Mixed linear models were further used to investigate the presence of interactive QTLs (QEI). The results highlighted a complex genetic architecture of tomato plasticity and GxE. Candidate genes that might be involved in the occurrence of GxE were proposed, paving the way for functional characterization of stress response genes in tomato and breeding for climate-adapted crop.\n\nHighlightThe genetic architecture of tomato response to several abiotic stresses is deciphered.

    "abstract": "Association of phenotypes or exposures with genomic and epigenomic data faces important statistical challenges. One of these challenges is to account for variation due to unobserved confounding factors, such as individual ancestry or cell-type composition in tissues. This issue can be addressed with penalized latent factor regression models, where penalties are introduced to cope with high dimension in the data. If a relatively small proportion of genomic or epigenomic markers correlate with the variable of interest, sparsity penalties may help to capture the relevant associations, but the improvement over non-sparse approaches has not been fully evaluated yet. Here, we present least-squares algorithms that jointly estimate effect sizes and confounding factors in sparse latent factor regression models. In simulated data, sparse latent factor regression models generally achieved higher statistical performance than other sparse methods, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM). In generative model simulations, statistical performance was slightly lower (while being comparable) to non-sparse methods, but in simulations based on empirical data, sparse latent factor regression models were more robust to departure from the model than the non-sparse approaches. We applied sparse latent factor regression models to a genome-wide association study of a flowering trait for the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and to an epigenome-wide association study of smoking status in pregnant women. For both applications, sparse latent factor regression models facilitated the estimation of non-null effect sizes while overcoming multiple testing issues. The results were not only consistent with previous discoveries, but they also pinpointed new genes with functional annotations relevant to each application.",

Cells sense and adapt to hypoxia by activating hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), but it is still an outstanding question why cell types differ in their transcriptional response to hypoxia.\n\nResultsHere, we report that HIFs fail to bind CpG dinucleotides that are methylated in their consensus binding sequence, both in in vitro biochemical binding assays and in vivo studies of differentially methylated isogenic cell lines. Based on in silico structural modelling, we show that 5-methylcytosine indeed causes steric hindrance in the HIF binding pocket. A model wherein cell-type-specific methylation landscapes, as laid-down by the differential expression and binding of other transcription factors under normoxia control cell-type-specific hypoxia responses is observed. We also discover ectopic HIF binding sites in repeat regions which are normally methylated. Genetic and pharmacological DNA demethylation, but also cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation, expose these binding sites, inducing HIF-dependent expression of cryptic transcripts. In line with such cryptic transcripts being more prone to cause double-stranded RNA and viral mimicry, we observe low DNA methylation and high cryptic transcript expression in tumours with high immune checkpoint expression, but not in tumours with low immune checkpoint expression, where they would compromise tumour immunotolerance. In a low-immunogenic tumour model, DNA demethylation upregulates cryptic transcript expression in a HIF-dependent manner, causing immune activation and reducing tumour growth.\n\nConclusionsOur data elucidate the mechanism underlying cell-type specific responses to hypoxia, and suggest DNA methylation and hypoxia to underlie tumour immunotolerance.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is exceptionally resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). We previously reported that elevated systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6) and increased numbers of T cells positive for circulating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) correlate with worse overall survival in patients with PDAC. We postulated that combined blockade of IL-6 and CTLA-4 would significantly enhance anti-tumor immune responses to PDAC. Dual blockade of IL-6 and CTLA-4 in immune competent mice bearing subcutaneously injected pancreatic tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by overwhelming T cell infiltration. Therapeutic efficacy was confirmed in an orthotopic murine model of pancreatic cancer and T cell depletion studies unveiled a unique dependence on CD4+ T cells for anti-tumor activity of dual IL-6 and CTLA-4 blockade. In vitro studies utilizing T cells from a TRP-1 transgenic mouse as an antigen-specific model system demonstrate this combination therapy elicits increased IFN-{gamma} production by activated CD4+ T cells. Additionally, IFN-{gamma} stimulation of pancreatic tumor cells in vitro profoundly increased tumor cell production of CXCR3 specific chemokines (CXCL10 and CXCL9). Further studies blocking CXCR3 in the presence of combined IL-6 and CTLA-4 blockade prevented orthotopic tumor regression, demonstrating a dependence on the CXCR3 axis for anti-tumor efficacy. We also found combination therapy increased intratumoral CD4+ T cells and elicited systemic changes in T-helper subsets. These data represent the first report of IL-6 and CTLA-4 blockade as a means to regress pancreatic tumors with defined operative mechanisms of efficacy. Given these results, this therapeutic combination has potential for immediate clinical translation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryBlockade of interleukin-6 in pancreatic cancer enhances CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibition to regress tumors in a CD4+ T cell and CXCR3-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an extension to a heuristic method for phasing and imputation of genotypes of descendants in bi-parental populations so that it can phase and impute genotypes of parents of bi-parental populations that are fully ungenotyped or partially genotyped. The imputed genotypes of the parent are then used to impute low-density genotyped descendants of the bi-parental population to high-density. The extension works in three steps. First, it identifies whether a parent has no or low-density genotypes available and it identifies all of its relatives that have high-density genotypes. Second, using the high-density information of relatives, it determines whether the parent is homozygous or heterozygous for a given locus. Third, it phases heterozygous positions of the parent by matching haplotypes to its relatives.\n\nWe implemented the new algorithm in an extension of the AlphaPlantImptue software and tested its accuracy of imputing missing parent genotypes in simulated bi-parental populations from different scenarios. We also tested the accuracy of imputation of the missing parents descendants using the true genotype of the parent and compared this to using the imputed genotypes of the parent. Our results show that across all scenarios, the accuracy of imputation of a parent, measured as the correlation between true and imputed genotypes, was > 0.98 and did not drop below [~] 0.96. The imputation accuracy of a parent was always higher when it was inbred than when it was outbred and when it had low-density genotypes. Including ancestors of the parent at HD, increasing the number of crosses and the number of high-density descendants all increased the accuracy of imputation. The high imputation accuracy achieved for the parent across all scenarios translated to little or no impact on the accuracy of imputation of its descendants at low-density.\n\nKey MessageNew fast and accurate method for phasing and imputation of SNP chip genotypes within diploid bi-parental plant populations.",

    "abstract": "One of the pervasive features of cancer is the diversity of mutations found in malignant cells within the same tumor; a phenomenon called clonal diversity or intratumor heterogeneity. Clonal diversity allows tumors to adapt to the selective pressure of treatment and likely contributes to the development of treatment resistance and cancer recurrence. Thus, the ability to precisely delineate the clonal substructure of a tumor, including the evolutionary history of its development and the co-occurrence of its mutations, is necessary to understand and overcome treatment resistance. However, DNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples cannot accurately resolve complex clonal architectures. Here, we performed high-throughput single-cell DNA sequencing to quantitatively assess the clonal architecture of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We sequenced a total of 556,951 cells from 77 patients with AML for 19 genes known to be recurrently mutated in AML. The data revealed clonal relationship among AML driver mutations and identified mutations that often co-occurred (e.g., NPM1/FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A/NPM1, SRSF2/IDH2, and WT1/FLT3-ITD) and those that were mutually exclusive (e.g., NRAS/KRAS, FLT3-D835/ITD, and IDH1/IDH2) at single-cell resolution. Reconstruction of the tumor phylogeny uncovered history of tumor development that is characterized by linear and branching clonal evolution patterns with latter involving functional convergence of separately evolved clones. Analysis of longitudinal samples revealed remodeling of clonal architecture in response to therapeutic pressure that is driven by clonal selection. Furthermore, in this AML cohort, higher clonal diversity ([&ge;]4 subclones) was associated with significantly worse overall survival. These data portray clonal relationship, architecture, and evolution of AML driver genes with unprecedented resolution, and illuminate the role of clonal diversity in therapeutic resistance, relapse and clinical outcome in AML.",

    "abstract": "Allele-specific expression is when one allele of a gene shows higher levels of expression compared to the other allele, in a diploid organism. Genomic imprinting is an extreme example of this, where some genes exhibit allele-specific expression in a parent-of-origin manner. Recent work has identified potentially imprinted genes in species of Hymenoptera. However, the molecular mechanism which drives this allelic expression bias remains unknown. In mammals DNA methylation is often associated with imprinted genes. DNA methylation systems have been described in species of Hymenoptera, providing a candidate imprinting mechanism. Using previously generated RNA-Seq and whole genome bisulfite sequencing from reproductive and sterile bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers we have identified genome-wide allele-specific expression and allele-specific DNA methylation. The majority of genes displaying allele-specific expression are common between reproductive castes and the proportion of allele-specific expression bias generally varies between colonies. We have also identified genome-wide allele-specific DNA methylation patterns in both castes. There is no significant overlap between genes showing allele-specific expression and allele-specific methylation. These results indicate that DNA methylation does not directly drive genome-wide allele-specific expression in this species. Only a small number of the genes identified may be  imprinted and it may be these genes which are associated with allele-specific DNA methylation. Future work utilising reciprocal crosses to identify parent-of-origin DNA methylation will further clarify the role of DNA methylation in parent-of-origin allele-specific expression.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. A major neuropathological finding in ALS is the coexistence of glial activation and aggregation of the phosphorylated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43-kDa (pTDP43) in the motor cortex at the earliest stages of the disease. Despite this, the transcriptional alterations associated with these pathological changes in this major vulnerable brain region have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we have performed massive RNA sequencing of the motor cortex of ALS (n=11) and healthy controls (HC; n=8). We report extensive RNA expression alterations at gene and isoform levels, characterized by the enrichment of neuroinflammatory and synapse related pathways. The assembly of gene co-expression modules confirmed the involvement of these two principal transcriptomic changes, and showed a strong negative correlation between them. Furthermore, cell-type deconvolution using human single-nucleus RNA sequencing data as reference demonstrated that microglial cells are overrepresented in ALS compared to HC. Importantly, we also show for the first time in the human ALS motor cortex, that microgliosis is mostly driven by the increased proportion of a microglial subpopulation characterized by gene markers overlapping with the recently described disease associated microglia (DAM). Using immunohistochemistry, we further evidenced that this microglial subpopulation is overrepresented in ALS and that variability in pTDP43 aggregation among patients negatively correlates with the proportion of microglial cells. In conclusion, we report that neuroinflammatory changes in ALS motor cortex are dominated by microglia which is concomitant with a reduced expression of postsynaptic transcripts, in which DAM might have a prominent role. Microgliosis therefore represents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in ALS.",

    "abstract": "Browning of white fat reduces obesity in many preclinical models. Vitamin A metabolites (retinoids) have been linked to thermogenic programming of adipose tissue (AT), however the physiologic importance of systemic retinoid metabolism for AT browning is unknown. Here we show that cold stimulation in mice and humans increases circulating retinol and its plasma transporter, retinol binding protein (RBP). Cold exposure shifts retinol abundance from liver towards subcutaneous white AT which correlates with enhanced thermogenic gene transcription. Cold-mediated retinoid flux is abrogated in Rbp deficient (Rbp-/-) mice and AT browning is dramatically impaired, which renders Rbp-/- mice cold intolerant. Rbp deficiency attenuates cold-induced lipid clearance due to decreased oxidative capacity. In humans, cold-mediated retinol increase is associated with enhanced lipid utilization. Retinol stimulation in primary human adipocytes promotes thermogenic gene expression and mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, coordinated retinol delivery is essential for cold-induced thermogenic programming of white fat.",

In this study, we targeted the GHRH gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to avoid passenger alleles/mutations and performed in-depth physiological and metabolic characterization. In agreement with our previous observation, male and female GHRH-/- mice have significantly reduced body weight and enhanced insulin sensitivity when compared to wild type littermates. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry showed that there were significant decreases in lean mass, bone mineral content and density, and a dramatic increase in fat mass of GHRH-/- mice when compared to wild type littermates. Indirect calorimetry measurements including oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and energy expenditure were dramatically reduced in GHRH-/- mice compared to wild type mice. Respiratory exchange ratio was significantly lower in GHRH-/- mice during the light cycle, but not during the dark cycle, indicating a circadian related metabolic shift towards fat utilization in the growth hormone deficient mice.

The heat shock responsive phosphorylation sites showed enrichment of RNA binding proteins with putative roles in heat shock response included P-body / stress granules and the eukaryotic translation initiation 4F complex.

We first identify a highly specific metabolite as the endogenous steroid, cholesterol sulphate. Next, a screen of other small molecules with a similar steroid scaffold identified fludrocortisone acetate as being both specific and having highly potent osteogenic-inducing activity.

    "abstract": "Sister chromatid cohesion is established by Eco1 in S phase. Nevertheless, the exact consequence of Eco1-catalyzed acetylation is unknown, and the cohesive state remains highly controversial. Here we show that self-interactions of cohesin subunits Scc1/Rad21 and Scc3 occur in a DNA replication-coupled manner in both yeast and human. Through cross-linking mass spectrometry and VivosX analysis of purified cohesin, we show that a subpopulation of cohesin may exist as dimers. Importantly, cohesin-cohesin interaction becomes significantly compromised when Eco1 is depleted. On the other hand, deleting either deacetylase Hos1 or Eco1 antagonist Wpl1/Rad61 results in an increase (e.g., from [~]20% to 40%) of cohesin dimers. These findings suggest that cohesin dimerization is controlled by common mechanisms as the cohesion cycle, thus providing an additional layer of regulation for cohesin to execute various functions such as sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, gene expression, chromatin looping and high-order organization.\n\nAuthor SummaryCohesin is a ring that tethers sister chromatids since their synthesis during S phase till their separation in anaphase. According to the single-ring model, one ring holds twin sisters. Here we show a conserved cohesin-cohesin interaction from yeast to human. A subpopulation of cohesin is dimerized concomitantly with DNA replication. Cohesin dimerization is dependent on the acetyltransferase Eco1 and counteracted by the anti-establishment factor Wpl1 and deacetylase Hos1. Approximately 20% of cellular cohesin complexes are measured to be dimers, close to the level of Smc3 acetylation by Eco1 in vivo. These findings provide evidence to support the double-ring model in sister chromatid cohesion.",

It is parameterized by the k-mer length k, a window length w and an order on the k-mers. Minimizers are used in a large number of softwares and pipelines to improve computation efficiency and decrease memory usage. Despite the methods popularity, many theoretical questions regarding its performance remain open. The core metric for measuring performance of a minimizer is the density, which measures the sparsity of sampled k-mers. The theoretical optimal density for a minimizer is 1/w, provably not achievable in general. For given k and w, little is known about asymptotically optimal minimizers, that is minimizers with density O(1/w).\n\nResultsWe derive a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of asymptotically optimal minimizers. We also provide a randomized algorithm, called the Miniception, to design minimizers with the best theoretical guarantee to date on density in practical scenarios. Constructing and using the Miniception is as easy as constructing and using a random minimizer, which allows the design of efficient minimizers that scale to the values of k and w used in current bioinformatics software programs.\n\nAvailabilityReference implementation of the Miniception and the codes for analysis can be found at https://github.com/kingsford-group/miniception.\n\nContactgmarcais@cs.cmu.edu",

    "abstract": "Microbes active in extremely cold environments are not as well explored as those of other extreme environments. Studies have revealed a substantial microbial diversity and identified cold-specific microbiome molecular functions. We analyzed the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of twenty snow samples collected during early and late spring in Svalbard, Norway using our computational read-based microbiome function annotation tool, mi-faser. Our results revealed a more diverse microbiome functional capacity and activity in the early compared to in the late spring samples. The dissimilarity between the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of the same samples was also significantly higher in the early spring. These findings suggest that early spring samples may contain a larger fraction of DNA of dormant organisms, while late spring samples reflect a new community that is metabolically active. We additionally showed that the abundance of the sequencing reads mapping to the fatty acid synthesis-related microbial pathways was significantly positively correlated with organic acid levels, in both our late spring metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. Moreover, the geraniol degradation pathway and the styrene degradation pathway read abundances correlated and inversely correlated, respectively, with the organic acid levels. These results suggest a possible nutrient switch. Our study thus highlights the activity of microbial degradation pathways of complex organic compounds previously unreported at low temperatures.",

    "abstract": "During developmental angiogenesis, endothelial cells respond to shear stress by migrating and remodelling the initially hyperbranched plexus, removing certain vessels whilst maintaining others. The key regulator of vessel preservation is cell decision behaviour at bifurcations. At flow-convergent bifurcations where migration paths diverge, cells must finely tune migration along both possible paths if the bifurcation is to persist. Experiments have demonstrated that disrupting the cells ability to sense shear or junction forces transmitted between cells impacts the preservation of bifurcations during the remodelling process. However, how these migratory cues integrate during cell decision making remains poorly understood. Therefore, we present the first agent-based model of endothelial cell flow-mediated migration suitable for interrogating the mechanisms behind bifurcation stability. The model simulates flow in a bifurcated vessel network composed of agents representing endothelial cells arranged into a lumen which migrate against flow. Upon approaching a bifurcation where more than one migration path exists, agents refer to a stochastic bifurcation rule which models the decision cells make as a combination of flow-based and collective-based migratory cues. With this rule, cells favour branches with relatively larger shear stress or cell number. We found that cells must integrate both cues nearly equally to maximise bifurcation stability. In simulations with stable bifurcations, we found competitive oscillations between flow and collective cues, and simulations that lost the bifurcation were unable to maintain these oscillations. The competition between these two cues is haemodynamic in origin, and demonstrates that a natural defence against bifurcation loss during remodelling exists: as vessel lumens narrow due to cell efflux, resistance to flow and shear stress increases, attracting new cells to enter and rescue the vessel from regression. Our work provides theoretical insight into the role of junction force transmission has in stabilising vasculature during remodelling and as an emergent mechanism to avoid functional shunting.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhen new blood vessels are created, the endothelial cells that make up these vessels migrate and rearrange in response to blood flow to remodel and optimise the vessel network. An essential part of this process is maintaining the branched structure of the network; however, it is unclear what cues cells consider at regions were vessels branch (i.e., bifurcations). In this research, we present a computer model of cell migration to interrogate the process of preserving bifurcations during remodelling. In this model, cells at bifurcations are influenced by both flow and force transmitted from neighbouring cells. We found that both cues (flow-based and collective-based) must be considered equally in order to preserve branching in the vessel network. In simulations with stable bifurcations, we demonstrated that these cues oscillate: a strong signal in one was accompanied by a weak signal in the other. Furthermore, we found that these cues naturally compete with each other due to the coupling between blood flow and the size of the blood vessels, i.e. larger vessels with more cells produce less flow signals and vice versa. Our research provides insight into how forces transmitted between neighbouring cells stabilises and preserves branching during remodelling, as well as implicates the disruption of this force transmission as a potential mechanism when remodelling goes wrong as in the case of vascular malformation.",

    "abstract": "Subcellular targeting of proteins is essential to orchestrate cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells. During cell division of Ustilago maydis, for example, chitinases must be specifically targeted to the fragmentation zone at the site of cell division to degrade remnant chitin and thus separate mother and daughter cells. Chitinase Cts1 is exported to this location via an unconventional secretion pathway putatively operating in a lock-type manner. The underlying mechanism is largely unexplored. Here, we applied a forward genetic screen based on UV mutagenesis to identify components essential for Cts1 export. The screen revealed a novel factor termed Jps1 lacking known protein domains. Deletion of the corresponding gene confirmed its essential role for Cts1 secretion. Localization studies demonstrated that Jps1 colocalizes with Cts1 in the fragmentation zone of dividing yeast cells. While loss of Jps1 leads to exclusion of Cts1 from the fragmentation zone and strongly reduced unconventional secretion, deletion of the chitinase does not disturb Jps1 localization. Yeast-two hybrid experiments suggest that the two proteins interact. In essence, we identified a novel component of unconventional secretion that functions in the fragmentation zone to enable export of Cts1. We hypothesize that Jps1 acts as an anchoring factor, supporting the proposed novel lock-type mechanism of unconventional secretion.",

    "abstract": "Human norovirus frequently causes outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. Although discovered more than five decades ago, antiviral development has, until recently, been hampered by the lack of a reliable human norovirus cell culture system. Nevertheless, a lot of pathogenesis studies were accomplished using murine norovirus (MNV), which can be grown routinely in cell culture. In this study, we analysed a sizeable library of Nanobodies that were raised against the murine norovirus virion with the main purpose of developing Nanobody-based inhibitors. We discovered two types of neutralizing Nanobodies and analysed the inhibition mechanisms using X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and cell culture techniques. The first type bound on the top region of the protruding (P) domain. Interestingly, the Nanobody binding region closely overlapped the MNV receptor-binding site and collectively shared numerous P domain-binding residues. In addition, we showed that these Nanobodies competed with the soluble receptor and this action blocked virion attachment to cultured cells. The second type bound at a dimeric interface on the lower side of the P dimer. We discovered that these Nanobodies disrupted a structural change in the capsid associated with binding co-factors (i.e., metal cations/bile acid). Indeed, we found that capsids underwent major conformational changes following addition of Mg2+ or Ca2+. Ultimately, these Nanobodies directly obstructed a structural modification reserved for a post-receptor attachment stage. Altogether, our new data show that Nanobody-based inhibition could occur by blocking functional and structural capsid properties.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThis research discovered and analysed two different types of MNV neutralizing Nanobodies. The top-binding Nanobodies sterically inhibited the receptor-binding site, whereas the dimeric-binding Nanobodies interfered with a structural modification associated with co-factor binding. Moreover, we found that the capsid contained a number of vulnerable regions that were essential for viral replication. In fact, the capsid appeared to be organized in a state of flux, which could be important for co-factor/receptor binding functions. Blocking these capsid-binding events with Nanobodies directly inhibited essential capsid functions. Moreover, a number of MNV-specific Nanobody binding epitopes were comparable to human norovirus-specific Nanobody inhibitors. Therefore, this additional structural and inhibition information could be further exploited in the development of human norovirus antivirals.",

    "abstract": "[Finding suitable common feature sets for use in multiclass subject independent brain-computer interface (BCI) classifiers is problematic due to characteristically large inter-subject variation of electroencephalographic signatures. We propose a wrapper search method using a one versus the rest discrete output classifier. Obtaining and evaluating the quality of feature sets requires the development of appropriate classifier metrics. A one versus the rest classifier must be evaluated by a scalar performance metric that provides feedback for the feature search algorithm. However, the one versus the rest discrete classifier is prone to settling into degenerate states for difficult discrimination problems. The chance of occurrence of degeneracy increases with the number of classes, number of subjects and imbalance between the number of samples in the majority and minority classes. This paper proposes a scalar Quality (Q)-factor to compensate for classifier degeneracy and to improve the convergence of the wrapper search. The Q-factor, calculated from the ratio of sensitivity to specificity of the confusion matrix, is applied as a penalty to the accuracy (1-error rate). This method is successfully applied to a multiclass subject independent BCI using 10 untrained subjects performing 4 motor tasks in conjunction with the Sequential Floating Forward Selection feature search algorithm and Support Vector Machine classifiers.]",

    "abstract": "Many compounds have the potential to harm pancreatic beta-cells; organochlorine pollutants belong to those compounds. In this work, we aimed to find markers of acute toxicity of p,p -DDT among proteins expressed in human pancreatic beta-cells NES2Y and visible at 2-D electrophoresis. We exposed NES2Y cells to a lethal dose of p,p -DDT (150 M) for 24 hours and 30 hours and determined changes in protein expression using 2-D electrophoresis. We also stained the cells exposed to p,p -DDT to visualize the altered phenotype of the exposed cells. Among proteins with changed expression, we identified proteins involved in ER stress (GRP78, and endoplasmin), mitochondrial proteins (GRP75, ECHM, IDH3A, NDUS1, and NDUS3), proteins with potential to change the cell morphology (EFHD2, TCPA, NDRG1, and ezrin), and some other proteins (HNRPF, HNRH1, K2C8, vimentin, PBDC1, EF2, PCNA, biliverdin reductase, G3BP1, FRIL, and HSP27). These proteins can be used as markers of acute DDT toxicity.",

    "abstract": "We have used MRI to provide important new insights into the function of the human placenta in utero. We have measured slow net flow and high net oxygenation in the placenta in vivo, which are consistent with efficient delivery of oxygen from mother to fetus. Our experimental evidence substantiates previous hypotheses on the effects of spiral artery remodelling in utero, and also indicates rapid venous drainage from the placenta, which is important since the outflow has been largely neglected in the past. Furthermore, beyond Braxton Hicks contractions, which involve the entire uterus, we have identified a new physiological phenomenon, the  utero-placental pump, by which the placenta and underlying uterine wall contract independently of the rest of the uterus, expelling maternal blood from the intervillous space.",

    "abstract": "High ambient temperature due to global warming has a profound influence on plant growth and development at all stages of life cycle. Plant response to high ambient temperature termed thermomorphogenesis is characterized by hypocotyl and petiole elongation, and hyponastic growth at seedling stage. However, the molecular mechanism of thermomorphogenesis is still rudimentary. Here, we show that a set of four SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) genes are required for thermomorphogenesis. Consistently, SPAs are necessary for global gene expression changes in response to high ambient temperature. SPA1 level is unaffected, while the thermosensor phyB is stabilized in the spaQ mutant at high ambient temperature. Furthermore, in the absence of four SPA genes, the pivotal transcription factor PIF4 fails to accumulate, indicating a role of SPAs in regulating the phyB-PIF4 module at high ambient temperature. SPA1 directly phosphorylates PIF4 in vitro, and a mutant SPA1 affecting the kinase activity fails to rescue the PIF4 level as well as the thermo-insensitive phenotype of spaQ, suggesting that the SPA1 kinase activity is necessary for thermomorphogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest that SPAs integrate light and temperature signaling via fine tuning the phyB-PIF4 module.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety among graduate students in the United States has increased over the last several decades, affecting not only their overall mental health but also reducing retention in graduate programs. Teachers with high teaching anxiety can negatively impact student learning, yet the impacts of teaching anxiety on graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) is not well studied. Biology GTAs teach most introductory Biology labs and discussions nationally, thus broadly influencing the quality of undergraduate education. In Fall 2016, we investigated Biology GTA teaching anxiety at a large research-intensive southeastern university by (1) measuring teaching anxiety of Biology GTAs, and (2) exploring the relationships among teaching anxiety, self-efficacy, and coping. Using multiple linear regressions, we found that greater teaching self-efficacy is related to lower teaching anxiety in Biology GTAs (R2adi =0.65, p<0.001). Coping strategies and frequencies did not significantly contribute to teaching anxiety in our models. We found similar levels of teaching anxiety across genders, ethnicities, student citizenship status (domestic vs. international) and teaching experience level. However, there were significant differences among student subgroups in teaching self-efficacy and coping strategies. Effective coping may contribute to the lack of anxiety differences among some of the student subgroups. These results can inform teaching professional development for GTAs, and encourage greater awareness and dialogue about the impacts of mental health issues in academia.",
