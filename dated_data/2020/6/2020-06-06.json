    "abstract": "Monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) form mating-based pair bonds. Although wild prairie voles rarely re-pair following loss of a partner, laboratory studies have shown that previous pairing and mating does not negate the ability to form a new partner preference. However, little is known about how prior bond experience may alter the trajectory and display of a new pair bond. In the present study, we disrupted an initial pair bond by separating partners and then varied the amount of time before a new partner was introduced. We assessed how separation time affected the stability of partner preference over time and influenced decision-making in male voles performing a head-to-head partner preference test in which they chose between the first and second partner. We found that the ability to consistently display a preference for the second partner, supplanting the initial pair bond, depended on how long the test animal was separated from their first partner. Prior bonding experience also shaped the subsequent effects of mating on partner preference. Partner preference strength was sensitive to latency to mate with the second partner but not the first partner, irrespective of separation time. These results suggest that the ability to form a consistent, strong preference for a new partner after an initial pair bond depends upon the amount of time that has passed since separation from the first partner. These results provide valuable insight into how social bonds are dynamically shaped by prior social experience and identify variables that contribute to recovery from partner loss and the ability to form a new pair bond.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile genetics explains some familial breast cancer cases, we showed that environmentally-induced epigenetic inheritance of breast cancer can also occur in rodent models. We previously reported that paternal consumption of a high-fat diet and ensuing obesity increased breast cancer susceptibility in the offspring (F1). Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether paternal-induced programming of breast cancer in daughters is associated with systemic alterations or mammary epithelium-specific factors. It also remains to be determined whether the ancestrally programmed breast cancer predisposition in F1 progeny can be transmitted to subsequent generations.\n\nMethodsMale mice (F0) were fed either a control (CO) diet or an obesity-inducing diet (OID) for seven weeks and then mated with female mice (F0) reared on a CO diet. The resulting offspring (F1), also exclusively fed CO diet, were either used for mammary gland and tumor transplantation surgeries or to generate the F2 generation. To induce the mammary tumors, female mice were treated with 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Total RNA extracted from F0 or F1 males sperm was used for small RNA-Seq analysis.\n\nResultsMammary glands from F1 CO female offspring exhibited enhanced development when transplanted into OID females [OID(CO-MG)], as shown by higher mammary gland area, epithelial branching and elongation, compared to CO females that received a CO mammary gland [CO(CO-MG)]. Similarly, mammary tumors from F1 CO female offspring transplanted into OID females [OID(CO.T)] displayed improved growth with a higher proliferation/apoptosis rate. We also found that granddaughters (F2) from the OID grand-paternal germline showed accelerated tumor growth compared to COxCO granddaughters (F2). Transmission of breast cancer predisposition to the F2 generation through OID male germline was associated with alterations in specific sperm tRNA fragments (tRF) in both F0 and F1 males.\n\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that systemic metabolic and mammary stromal alterations are the most significant contributors to paternal programming of mammary gland development and cancer predisposition in female offspring rather than mammary epithelium confined factors. Our data also show breast cancer predisposition in OID daughters can be transmitted to subsequent generations and could explain some familial cancers, if confirmed in humans.",

    "abstract": "Treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains insufficient due to clonal heterogeneity and clinical complexity. Dysregulation of apoptosis is observed across MDS subtypes regardless of mutations and represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity. Venetoclax (VEN), a selective inhibitor of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), has yielded impressive responses in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). BCL2 family anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL and induced myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) are implicated in leukemia survival, and upregulation of MCL1 is seen in VEN-resistant AML and MDS. Here, we determined the in vitro sensitivity of MDS patient samples to selective inhibitors of BCL2, BCL-XL and MCL1. While VEN response positively correlated with increasing blast counts, all MDS subtypes responded to the MCL1 inhibitor, S63845. Treatment with combined VEN+S63845 was synergistic in all MDS subtypes and reduced MDS engraftment in MISTRG6 mice supporting the pursuit of clinical trials with combined BCL2+MCL1 inhibition in MDS.",

    "abstract": "The paradigm of a fossil based, non-renewable economy will have to change in the future due to environmental concerns and the inevitable depletion of resources. Therefore, the way we produce and consume chemicals has to be rethought: The bio-economy offers such a concept for the sustainable production of commodity chemicals using waste streams or renewable electricity and CO2. Residual biomass or organic wastes can be gasified to energy rich mixtures that in turn can be used for synthesis gas fermentation.\n\nWithin this scope, we present a new process for the production of trehalose from gaseous substrates with the hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium Cupriavidus necator H16. We first show that C. necator is a natural producer of trehalose, accumulating up to 3.6% of its cell dry weight as trehalose when stressed with 150 mM sodium chloride. Bioinformatic investigations revealed a so far unknown mode of trehalose and glycogen metabolism in this organism. Next, we evaluated different concepts for the secretion of trehalose and found that expression of the sugar efflux transporter A (setA) from Escherichia coli was able to lead to a trehalose-leaky phenotype. Finally, we characterized the strain under autotrophic conditions using a H2/CO2/O2-mixture and other substrates. Even without overexpressing trehalose synthesis genes, titers of 0.47 g/L and yields of around 10% were reached, which shows the great potential of this process.\n\nTaken together, this process represents a new way to produce sugars with a higher areal efficiency than photosynthesis by crop plants. With further metabolic engineering, we anticipate an application of this technology for the renewable production of trehalose and other sugars, as well as for the synthesis of 13C-labeled sugars.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/136564v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@190a3f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fc0ce0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b17bf8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1421639_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Identification of pregnancies at risk of preterm birth (PTB), the leading cause of newborn deaths, remains challenging given the syndromic nature of the disease. We report a longitudinal multi-omics study coupled with a DREAM challenge to develop predictive models of PTB. We found that whole blood gene expression predicts ultrasound-based gestational ages in normal and complicated pregnancies (r=0.83), as well as the delivery date in normal pregnancies (r=0.86), with an accuracy comparable to ultrasound. However, unlike the latter, transcriptomic data collected at <37 weeks of gestation predicted the delivery date of one third of spontaneous (sPTB) cases within 2 weeks of the actual date. Based on samples collected before 33 weeks in asymptomatic women we found expression changes preceding preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes that were consistent across time points and cohorts, involving, among others, leukocyte-mediated immunity. Plasma proteomic random forests predicted sPTB with higher accuracy and earlier in pregnancy than whole blood transcriptomic models (e.g. AUROC=0.76 vs. AUROC=0.6 at 27-33 weeks of gestation).",

    "abstract": "As anomalous heat waves are causing the widespread decline of coral reefs worldwide, there is an urgent need to identify coral populations tolerant to thermal stress. Heat stress adaptive potential is the degree of tolerance expected from evolutionary processes and, for a given reef, depends on the arrival of propagules from reefs exposed to recurrent thermal stress. For this reason, assessing spatial patterns of thermal adaptation and reef connectivity is of paramount importance to inform conservation strategies.\n\nIn this work, we applied a seascape genomics framework to characterize the spatial patterns of thermal adaptation and connectivity for coral reefs of New Caledonia (Southern Pacific). In this approach, remote sensing of seascape conditions was combined with genomic data from three coral species. For every reef of the region, we computed a probability of heat stress adaptation, and two indices forecasting inbound and outbound connectivity. We then compared our indicators to field survey data, and observed that decrease of coral cover after heat stress was lower at reefs predicted with high probability of adaptation and inbound connectivity. Last, we discussed how these indicators can be used to inform local conservation strategies and preserve the adaptive potential of New Caledonian reefs.",

We identified pairs and networks of residue variants that exhibited statistically high frequencies of covariance with each other. While these interactions are likely key to both protein structure and other protein-protein interactions, we have also found that they can be used to provide a new computational approach (CoVariance-based Phylogeny Analysis) for understanding viral evolution and adaptation.

    "abstract": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an urgent need to develop therapeutic interventions. Among them, neutralizing antibodies play crucial roles for preventing viral infections and contribute to resolution of infection. Here, we describe the generation of antibody libraries from 17 different COVID-19 recovered patients and screening of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. After 3 rounds of panning, 456 positive phage clones were obtained with high affinity to RBD (receptor binding domain). Then the positive clones were sequenced and reconstituted into whole human IgG for epitope binning assays. After that, all 19 IgG were classified into 6 different epitope groups or Bins. Although all these antibodies were shown to have ability to bind RBD, the antibodies in Bin2 have more superiority to inhibit the interaction between spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Most importantly, the antibodies from Bin2 can also strongly bind with mutant RBDs (W463R, R408I, N354D, V367F and N354D/D364Y) derived from SARS-CoV-2 strain with increased infectivity, suggesting the great potential of these antibodies in preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations. Furthermore, these neutralizing antibodies strongly restrict the binding of RBD to hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. Consistently, these antibodies effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry into hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. In Vero-E6 cells, these antibodies can even block the entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells at only 12.5 nM. These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.",

While the coupling from hippocampus to scalp EEG is well established, we provide here direct cortical recordings for a fine-grained analysis.\n\nMethodsA patient performed a WM task where a string of letters was presented all at once, thus separating the encoding period from the maintenance period. We recorded sEEG from the hippocampus, temporo-parietal ECoG from a 64-contact grid electrode, and scalp EEG.\n\nResultsPower spectral density (PSD) showed a clear task dependence: PSD in the posterior parietal lobe (10 Hz) and in the hippocampus (20 Hz) peaked towards the end of the maintenance period.\n\nInter-area synchronization was characterized by the phase locking value (PLV). WM maintenance enhanced PLV between hippocampal sEEG and scalp EEG specifically in the theta range [6 7] Hz.\n\nPLV from hippocampus to parietal cortex increased during maintenance in the [9 10] Hz alpha and the 20 Hz range.\n\nWhen analyzing the information flow to and from auditory cortex by Granger causality, the flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus with a peak in the [8 18] Hz range while letters were presented, and this flow was subsequently reversed during maintenance, while letters were maintained in memory.\n\nConclusionsThe increased functional interaction between hippocampus and cortex through synchronized oscillatory activity and the directed information flow provide physiological basis for reverberation of memory items during maintenance.

Here, we investigated hippocampal and cortical activity while a subject maintained sets of letters in verbal working memory for a few seconds to guide action.\n\nAfter confirming the coupling between hippocampal oscillations and oscillations on the scalp, we found during maintenance that hippocampal oscillations increased coupling differentially to several areas of cortex by recording directly from the cortex.. During encoding of the letters, information flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus and subsequently reversed during maintenance, thus providing a physiological basis for memory encoding and maintenance.\n\nThis demonstrates a network for working memory that is bound by coherent oscillations that underlie the functional connectivity between cortical areas and hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "In the early stages of Alzheimers disease (AD), tau pathology first develops in the entorhinal cortex (EC), then spreads to the hippocampus and at later stages, to the neocortex. Pathology in the neocortex correlates with impaired cognitive performance. Overall, tau pathology correlates well with neurodegeneration but the spatial and temporal association between tau pathology and overt volume loss is unclear. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with tensor-based morphometry (TBM) we mapped the spatio-temporal pattern of structural changes in a mouse model of AD-like progressive tauopathy. A novel, co-registered in vivo MRI atlas identified particular regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that had significant volume reduction. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and pre-/para-subiculum (PPS) had the most significant atrophy at the early stage, but atrophy then spread into the hippocampus, most notably, the CA1, dentate gyrus (DG) and subiculum (Sub). TBM-related atrophy in the DG and Sub preceded overt cell loss that has been reported in ex vivo studies in the same mouse model. By unifying an ex vivo 3D reconstruction of tau pathology with the TBM-MRI results we mapped the progression of atrophy in the MTL with the corresponding spread of tau pathology. Our study shows that there is an association between the spread of tau pathology and TBM-related atrophy from the EC to the hippocampus, but atrophy in the DG and Sub preceded overt cell loss.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySpread of tau pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease assessed by MRI was associated with reduced brain tissue volume but not neuronal loss.",

    "abstract": "How daily clocks in the brain are set by light to local environmental time and encode the seasons is not fully understood. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a central circadian clock that orchestrates physiology and behavior in tune with daily and seasonal light cycles. Here we have found that optogenetically simulated light input to explanted SCN changes the waveform of the molecular clockworks from sinusoidal in free-running conditions to highly asymmetrical shapes with accelerated synthetic (rising) phases and extended degradative (falling) phases marking clock advances and delays at simulated dawn and dusk. Daily waveform changes are sufficient to entrain to simulated winter and summer photoperiods, and to non-24h periods. SCN imaging further reveals that acute waveform shifts are greatest in the ventrolateral SCN, while period effects are greatest in the dorsomedial SCN. Thus, circadian entrainment is encoded by SCN clock gene waveform changes that arise from spatiotemporally distinct intrinsic responses within the SCN neural network.",

    "abstract": "More than 50 genetic loci have been identified as being associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and many of these are involved in immune pathways and lipid metabolism. Therefore, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of immune-relevant cells, to study the mis-regulation of genes implicated in AD. We used expression and genetic data from naive and induced CD14+ monocytes and two GWAS of AD to study genetically controlled gene expression in monocytes at different stages of differentiation and compared the results with those from TWAS of brain and blood. We identified nine genes with statistically independent TWAS signals, seven are known AD risk genes from GWAS: BIN1, PTK2B, SPI1, MS4A4A, MS4A6E, APOE and PVR and two, LACTB2 and PLIN2/ADRP, are novel candidate genes for AD. Three genes, SPI1, PLIN2 and LACTB2, are TWAS significant specifically in monocytes. LACTB2 is a mitochondrial endoribonuclease and PLIN2/ADRP associates with intracellular neutral lipid storage droplets (LSDs) which have been shown to play a role in the regulation of the immune response. Notably, LACTB2 and PLIN2 were not detected from GWAS alone.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to unravel connections between genetic variants and diseases. Larger sample sizes in GWAS can lead to discovering more associations and more accurate genetic predictors. However, sharing and combining distributed genomic data to increase the sample size is often challenging or even impossible due to privacy concerns and privacy protection laws such as the GDPR. While meta-analysis has been established as an effective approach to combine summary statistics of several GWAS, its accuracy can be attenuated in the presence of cross-study heterogeneity. Here, we present sPLINK (safe PLINK), a user-friendly tool, which performs federated GWAS on distributed datasets while preserving the privacy of data and the accuracy of the results. sPLINK neither exchanges raw data nor does it rely on summary statistics. Instead, it performs model training in a federated manner, communicating only model parameters between cohorts and a central server. We verify that the federated results from sPLINK are the same as those from aggregated analyses conducted with PLINK. We demonstrate that sPLINK is robust against heterogeneous data (phenotype and confounding factors) distributions across cohorts while existing meta-analysis tools considerably lose accuracy in such scenarios. We also show that sPLINK achieves practical runtime, in order of minutes or hours, and acceptable network bandwidth consumption for chi-square and linear/logistic regression tests. Federated analysis with sPLINK, thus, has the potential to replace meta-analysis as the gold standard for collaborative GWAS. The user-friendly, readily usable sPLINK tool is available at https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/splink.",

Cognitive impairment is a universal and as yet unexplained feature of CdLS. We characterized the transcriptional profile of cortical neurons from CdLS patients and found deregulation of hundreds of genes enriched for neuronal functions related to synaptic transmission, signalling processes, learning and behaviour. Inducible proteolytic cleavage of cohesin disrupted 3-D genome organization and transcriptional control in post-mitotic cortical mouse neurons. The genes affected belonged to similar gene ontology classes and showed significant numerical overlap with those deregulated in CdLS. Interestingly, gene expression was largely rescued by subsequent reconstitution of cohesin function. These experiments show that cohesin is continuously required for neuronal gene expression and provide a tractable approach for addressing mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in CdLS.",

Trajectory analyses and immunophenotyping of epithelial progenitors in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) indicate that hAEC2s transdifferentiate into metaplastic basal cells through alveolar-basal intermediate (ABI) cells that we also identify in hAEC2-derived organoids. Modulating hAEC2-intrinsic and niche factors dysregulated in IPF can attenuate metaplastic basal cell transdifferentiation and preserve hAEC2 identity. Finally, hAEC2s transplanted into fibrotic immune-deficient murine lungs engraft as either hAEC2s or differentiated KRT5+ basal cells. Our study indicates that hAEC2s-loss and expansion of alveolar metaplastic basal cells in IPF are causally connected, which would not have been revealed utilizing murine AEC2s as a model.\n\nHighlightsO_LIHuman AEC2s transdifferentiate into KRT5+ basal cells when accompanied by primary adult human lung mesenchyme in 3D organoid culture.\nC_LIO_LIAlterations of hAEC2-intrinsic and niche factors dysregulated in IPF can modify metaplastic hAEC2 transdifferentiation.\nC_LIO_LIhAEC2s engraft into fibrotic lungs of immune-deficient mice and transdifferentiate into metaplastic basal cells.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptional trajectory analysis suggests that hAEC2s in IPF gives rise to metaplastic basal cells via alveolar-basal intermediate cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is governed by the action of an interconnected network of transcription factors. Among them, only Oct4 and Sox2 have been shown to be strictly required for the self-renewal of ESCs and pluripotency, particularly in culture conditions where differentiation cues are chemically inhibited. Here, we report that the conjunct activity of two orphan nuclear receptors, Esrrb and Nr5a2, parallels the importance of that of Oct4 and Sox2 in naive ESCs. By occupying a large common set of regulatory elements, these two factors control the binding of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog to DNA. Consequently, in their absence the pluripotency network collapses and the transcriptome is substantially deregulated, leading to the differentiation of ESCs. Altogether, this work identifies orphan nuclear receptors, previously thought to be performing supportive functions, as a new set of core regulators of naive pluripotency.",

In this study, we re-examine this issue in the Drosophila melanogaster wing and notum using split-Gal4 co-expression analysis, systematic pairwise and triple somatic CRISPR-based knock-outs and double RNAi experiments. Pairwise loss-of-function experiments targeting wg together with other Wnt genes does not produce PCP defects, neither via somatic CRISPR nor RNAi. In addition, somatic knock-out of evi (aka wntless), which is required for the secretion of all Wnt ligands expressed in these tissues, did not produce detectable PCP phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare blood disorder that results from immune-mediated destruction of bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells. Improved understanding of the mechanisms that favor T cell attack in BM could help to improve early diagnosis and disease treatment. Diacylglycerol kinase {zeta} (DGK{zeta}) limits T cell responses through phosphorylation of diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid. This reaction attenuates diacylglycerol-dependent activation of the Ras/ERK/CD69 and PKC{theta}/NF{kappa}B pathways in response to antigen. Here we show that, in contrast to the lack of basal activation observed in peripheral lymphoid organs, DGK{zeta}-/- mice showed increased numbers of activated T cells in BM, together with a significant increase in IFN{gamma} as well as perforin and granzyme B and C levels. The enhanced presence of T cells in DGK{zeta}-/- mouse BM correlates with reduced BM cellularity, impaired hematopoiesis, and lower frequency of circulating red cells, granulocytes, and platelets. Our studies coincide with the recent characterization of lower DGK{zeta} expression in T cells isolated from the BM of patients with acquired AA, and suggest that limited DGK{zeta} expression and/or functions predispose to T cell-mediated BM destruction. This study identifies the BM as a niche particularly sensitive to DGK{zeta} deficiency and indicates that this mouse model could be of interest for studying the mechanism that contributes to AA development.\n\nKey pointsO_LIDGK{zeta}-deficiency in mice results in larger numbers of CD69-positive T cells in bone marrow, with enhanced expression of IFN{gamma} and lytic enzymes.\nC_LIO_LIDGK{zeta} loss recapitulates many clinical aspects of human aplastic anemia, identifying a critical hub for immune system-dependent bone marrow failure.\nC_LI\n\nVisual abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/136390v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d485b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9599c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a17842org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1de640d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microbial exponential growth is expected to occur infrequently outside of the laboratory, in the environment. Instead, resource-limited conditions impose non-growth states for microbes. However, non-growth states are uncharacterized for the majority of environmental bacteria, especially in regard to exometabolite production. To investigate exometabolite production in response to nutrient limitation, we compared exometabolites produced over time in stationary phase across three environmental bacteria: Burkholderia thailandensis E264 (ATCC 700388), Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 31532, and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC3000 (ATCC BAA-871). We grew each strain in monoculture and investigated exometabolite dynamics over time from mid-exponential to stationary phase. We focused on exometabolites that were released into the media and accumulated over 45 hours, including approximately 20 hours of stationary phase. In concert, we analyzed transcripts (RNAseq) to inform interpretation of exometabolite output. We found that a majority of exometabolites released under these conditions were strain-specific. A subset of identified exometabolites were involved in both central and secondary metabolism. Transcript analysis supported that exometabolites were released from intact cells, as various transporters were either upregulated or consistently expressed. Interestingly, we found that all strains released succinate, and that each strain re-routed their metabolic pathways involved in succinate production during stationary phase. Overall, these results show that non-growth states can also be metabolically active and dynamic. Furthermore, they show that environmental bacteria have the capability to transform a resource-limited extracellular environment into a rich chemical milieu. This work has implications for understanding microbial community interactions via exometabolites, and within resource-limited environments.\n\nImportanceNon-growth states are common for bacteria that live in resource-limited environments, and yet these states remain largely uncharacterized in cellular metabolism and metabolite output. Here, we investigated and compared stationary phase exometabolites and RNA transcripts for each of three environmental bacterial strains. We observed that diverse exometabolites were produced and that they collectively exhibited clear and directional dynamics over time. Additionally, each bacteria strain had a characteristic exometabolite profile and dynamic. This work affirms that stationary phase is not at all \"stationary\" for these bacteria, and sets the stage for understanding how individual metabolisms support interspecies interactions in resource-limited environments.",

Promoter DNA binding to RNAP induces conformational change of the {sigma} domain 2 that opens a gate for DNA loading and ejects {sigma}1.1 from the RNAP cleft to facilitate open complex formation. DksA/ppGpp binding to RNAP also opens the DNA loading gate, but it is not coupled to {sigma}1.1 ejection and impedes the open complex formation of the rRNA promoter due to its G+C rich discriminator sequence. Mutations in {sigma}1.1 or the {beta}lid stabilize the RNAP and rRNA promoter complex and decrease its sensitivity to DksA/ppGpp. These results provide a molecular basis for exceptionally active rRNA transcription and for its vulnerability to DksA/ppGpp.",

Using a model of cutaneous allergen exposure, we show that allergens directly activate TRPV1+ sensory neurons leading to itch and pain behaviors. Allergen-activated sensory neurons release the neuropeptide Substance P, which stimulates proximally located CD301b+ DCs through MRGPRA1. Substance P induces CD301b+ DC migration to the draining lymph node where they initiate Th2 differentiation.

Oysters were reared under three experimental pCO2 treatments ( control, 580 atm;  moderate OA, 1000 uatm;  high OA, 2800 atm) and sampled at 6 time points (24 hours - 80 days). We found that high OA initially induced changes in the pH of the extrapallial fluid (pHEPF) relative to the external seawater, but the magnitude of this difference was highest at 9 days and diminished over time. Calcification rates were significantly lower in the high OA treatment compared to the other treatments. To explore how oysters regulate their extrapallial fluid, gene expression and DNA methylation were examined in the mantle-edge tissue of oysters from day 9 and 80 in the control and high OA treatments. Mantle tissue mounted a significant global molecular response (both in the transcriptome and methylome) to OA that shifted through time. Although we did not find individual genes that were significantly differentially expressed to OA, the pHEPF was correlated with the eigengene expression of several co-expressed gene clusters. A small number of OA-induced differentially methylated loci were discovered, which corresponded with a weak association between OA-induced changes in genome-wide gene body DNA methylation and gene expression. Gene body methylation, however, was not significantly correlated with the eigengene expression of pHEPF correlated gene clusters. These results suggest that in C. virginica, OA induces a subtle response in a large number of genes, but also indicates that plasticity at the molecular level may be limited. Our study highlights the need to re-assess the plasticity of tissue-specific molecular responses in marine calcifiers, as well as the role of DNA methylation and gene expression in mediating physiological and biomineralization responses to OA.",

    "abstract": "Predicting wheat phenology is important for cultivar selection, for effective crop management and provides a baseline for evaluating the effects of global change. Evaluating how well crop phenology can be predicted is therefore of major interest. Twenty-eight wheat modeling groups participated in this evaluation. Our target population was wheat fields in the major wheat growing regions of Australia under current climatic conditions and with current local management practices. The environments used for calibration and for evaluation were both sampled from this same target population. The calibration and evaluation environments had neither sites nor years in common, so this is a rigorous evaluation of the ability of modeling groups to predict phenology for new sites and weather conditions. Mean absolute error (MAE) for the evaluation environments, averaged over predictions of three phenological stages and over modeling groups, was 9 days, with a range from 6 to 20 days. Predictions using the multi-modeling group mean and median had prediction errors nearly as small as the best modeling group. About two thirds of the modeling groups performed better than a simple but relevant benchmark, which predicts phenology by assuming a constant temperature sum for each development stage. The added complexity of crop models beyond just the effect of temperature was thus justified in most cases. There was substantial variability between modeling groups using the same model structure, which implies that model improvement could be achieved not only by improving model structure, but also by improving parameter values, and in particular by improving calibration techniques.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a prominent mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes febrile illness in humans. To infect host cells, WNV virions first bind to plasma membrane receptors, then initiate membrane fusion following endocytosis. The viral transmembrane E protein, triggered by endosomal pH, catalyzes fusion while undergoing a dimer-to-trimer transition. Previously, single-particle WNV fusion data was interrogated with a stochastic cellular automaton simulation, which modeled the E proteins during the fusion process. The results supported a linear fusion mechanism, with E protein trimerization being rate-limiting. Here, we present corrections to the previous simulation, and apply them to the WNV fusion data. We observe that a linear mechanism is no longer sufficient to fit the data. Instead, an off-pathway state is necessary; these results are corroborated by chemical kinetics modeling. When compared with a similar Zika virus fusion model, this suggests that off-pathway fusion mechanisms may characterize flaviviruses more broadly.",

Molecular and analytical characterization of exosomes using western blotting, Raman and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and the multivariate analysis on the spectral data obtained, assessed for better molecular specifications and purity of particle. TEI method isolated exosomes with higher exosomal yield, purity, and recovery directly translatable into drug delivery and targeted therapeutics whereas ultracentrifuge had good recovery of particle morphology but showed particle aggregation and yielded exosomes with smaller mean size. PROSPR technique isolated a mixture of EVs, showed lower protein recovery in PAGE and western blotting but higher spectroscopic protein to lipid ratio and distinguishable EV population in multivariate analysis compared to exosomes isolated by TEI and UC.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from chronic lung infections often overproduce alginate, giving rise to the mucoid phenotype. Isolation of mucoid strains from chronic lung infections correlates with a poor patient outcome. The most common mutation that causes the mucoid phenotype is called mucA22 and results in a truncated form of the anti-sigma factor MucA that is continuously subjected to proteolysis. When a functional MucA is absent, the cognate sigma factor, AlgT, is no longer sequestered and continuously transcribes the alginate biosynthesis operon leading to alginate overproduction. In this work, we report that in the absence of wild-type MucA, providing exogenous AlgT is toxic. This is intriguing since mucoid strains endogenously possess high levels of AlgT. Furthermore, we show that suppressors of toxic AlgT production have mutations in mucP, a protease involved in MucA degradation, and provide the first atomistic model of MucP. Our findings support a model where mutations in mucP stabilize the truncated form of MucA22 rendering it functional and therefore able to reduce toxicity by properly sequestering AlgT.\n\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen capable of causing chronic lung infections. Phenotypes important for the long-term persistence and adaption to this unique lung ecosystem are largely regulated by the AlgT sigma factor. Chronic infection isolates often contain mutations in the anti-sigma factor mucA resulting in uncontrolled AlgT and continuous production of alginate, in addition to the expression of ~300 additional genes including algT itself. Here we report that in the absence of wild-type MucA, AlgT overproduction is lethal and that suppressors of toxic AlgT production have mutations in the MucA protease, MucP. Since AlgT contributes to the establishment of chronic infections, understanding how AlgT is regulated will provide vital information on how P. aeruginosa is capable of causing long-term infections.",

    "abstract": "MlaFEDB is a Gram-negative inner membrane protein complex involved in the inter membrane trafficking of phospholipids. Originally proposed to transport phospholipids in a retrograde direction, recent evidence suggests MlaFEDB may actually export phospholipids from the inner membrane to the periplasmic carrier protein, MlaC, potentially suggesting a role in either anterograde trafficking of phospholipids to the outer membrane or bidirectional phospholipid movement. MlaFEDB is part of the ABC transporter superfamily of proteins and has been shown to hydrolyse ATP through the cytoplasmic facing MlaF component. However, the movement of PLs from FEDB to MlaC has been shown to occur in an ATP independent fashion hence the role of ATP hydrolysis within this complex remains unclear. In this study we sought to elucidate the role of ATP and provide evidence to suggest MlaFEDB has flippase activity, utilising ATP hydrolysis to translocate phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of the IM. We also show that in the absence of ATP MlaFEDB mediates the loading of MlaC with phospholipids directly from the inner leaflet only. Our data provides a novel role for MlaFEDB and presents a link between Mla driven phospholipid transport and ATP hydrolysis.",

    "abstract": "RNA structures are dynamic. As a consequence, mutational effects can be hard to rationalize with reference to a single static native structure. We reasoned that deep mutational scanning experiments, which couple molecular function to fitness, should capture mutational effects across multiple conformational states simultaneously. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle that this is indeed the case, using the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila as a model system. We comprehensively mutagenized two 4-bp segments of the intron that come together to form the P1 extension (P1ex) helix at the 5 splice site and, following cleavage at the 5 splice site, dissociate to allow formation of an alternative helix (P10) at the 3 splice site. Using an in vivo reporter system that couples splicing activity to fitness in E. coli, we demonstrate that fitness is driven jointly by constraints on P1ex and P10 formation and that patterns of epistasis can be used to infer the presence of intramolecular pleiotropy. Importantly, using a machine learning approach that allows quantification of mutational effects in a genotype-specific manner, we show that the fitness landscape can be deconvoluted to implicate P1ex or P10 as the effective genetic background in which molecular fitness is compromised or enhanced. Our results highlight deep mutational scanning as a tool to study transient but important conformational states, with the capacity to provide critical insights into the evolution and evolvability of RNAs as dynamic ensembles. Our findings also suggest that, in the future, deep mutational scanning approaches might help us to reverse-engineer dynamic interactions and critical non-native states from a single fitness landscape.",

Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction in Caenorhabditis elegans activates RNAi-directed silencing via induction of a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I helicase viral response pathway. The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of eol-1 requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form dsRNA, as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses.

    "abstract": "Citrullination is a post-translational modification (PTM) of arginine that is crucial for several physiological processes, including gene regulation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Despite recent advances, studies of protein citrullination remain challenging due to the difficulty of accessing proteins homogeneously citrullinated at a specific site. Herein, we report a novel technology that enables the site-specific incorporation of citrulline (Cit) into proteins in mammalian cells. This approach exploits an E. coli-derived engineered leucyl tRNA synthetase-tRNA pair that incorporates a photocaged-citrulline (SM60) into proteins in response to a nonsense codon. Subsequently, SM60 is readily converted to Cit with light in vitro and in living cells. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we biochemically characterized the effect of incorporating Cit at two known autocitrullination sites in Protein Arginine Deiminase 4 (PAD4, R372 and R374) and showed that the R372Cit and R374Cit mutants are 181- and 9-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. This powerful technology possesses immense potential to decipher the biology of citrullination.",

Achromatia cells from differing ecosystems (e.g. freshwater vs. saline) are, unexpectedly, equally functionally equipped but differ in gene expression patterns by transcribing only relevant genes. We suggest environmental adaptation occurs by increasing the copy number of relevant genes across the cells hundreds of chromosomes, without losing irrelevant ones, thus maintaining the ability to survive in any ecosystem type.

    "abstract": "For over a decade RNA interference (RNAi) has been an important molecular tool for functional genomics studies in parasitic flatworms. Despite this, our understanding of RNAi dynamics in many flatworm parasites, such as the temperate liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica), remains rudimentary. The ability to maintain developing juvenile fluke in vitro provides the opportunity to perform functional studies during development of the key pathogenic life stage. Here, we investigate the RNAi competence of developing juvenile liver fluke. Firstly, all life stages examined possess, and express, core candidate RNAi effectors encouraging the hypothesis that all life stages of F. hepatica are RNAi competent. RNAi effector analyses supported growing evidence that parasitic flatworms have evolved a separate clade of RNAi effectors with unknown function. Secondly, we assessed the impact of growth / development during in vitro culture on RNAi in F. hepatica juveniles and found that during the first week post-excystment liver fluke juveniles exhibit quantitatively lower RNAi mediated transcript knockdown when maintained in growth inducing media. This did not appear to occur in older in vitro juveniles, suggesting that rapidly shifting transcript dynamics over the first week following excystment alters RNAi efficacy after a single 24 hour exposure to double stranded (ds)RNA. Finally, RNAi efficiency was found to be improved through use of a repeated dsRNA exposure methodology that has facilitated silencing of genes in a range of tissues, thereby increasing the utility of RNAi as a functional genomics tool in F. hepatica.",

    "abstract": "Atypical attention orienting has been found to be impaired in many neuropsychological disorders, but the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Attention can be oriented exogenously (i.e., driven by salient stimuli) or endogenously (i.e., driven by one\u2019s goals or intentions). Genetic mouse models are useful tools to investigate the neurobiology of cognition, but a well-established assessment of attention orienting in mice is missing. This study aimed to adapt the Posner task, a widely used attention orienting task in humans, for use in mice using touchscreen technology and to test the effects of two attention-modulating drugs, methylphenidate (MPH) and atomoxetine (ATX), on the performance of mice during this task. In accordance with human performance, mice responded more quickly and more accurately to validly cued targets compared to invalidly cued targets, thus supporting mice as a valid animal model to study the neural mechanisms of attention orienting. This is the first evidence that mice can be trained to voluntarily maintain their nose-poke on a touchscreen and to complete attention orienting tasks using exogenous peripheral cues and endogenous symbolic cues. The results also showed no significant effects of MPH and ATX on attention orienting, although MPH improved overall response times in mice during the exogenous orienting task. In summary, the current study provides a critical translational task for assessing attention orienting in mice and to investigate the effects of attention-modulating drugs on attention orienting.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The role of the cerebellum in speech perception remains a mystery. Given its uniform architecture, we tested the hypothesis that it implements a domain-general mechanism whose role in speech is determined by connectivity. We collated all neuroimaging studies reporting cerebellar activity in the Neurosynth database (n = 8,206). From this set, we found all studies involving passive speech and sound perception (n = 72, 64% speech, 12.5% sounds, 12.5% music, and 11% tones) and speech production and articulation (n = 175). Standard and coactivation neuroimaging meta-analyses were used to compare cerebellar and associated cortical activations between passive perception and production. We found distinct regions of perception-and production-related activity in the cerebellum and regions of perception-production overlap. Each of these regions had distinct patterns of cortico-cerebellar connectivity. To test for domain generality versus specificity, we identified all psychological and task-related terms in the Neurosynth database that predicted activity in cerebellar regions associated with passive perception and production. Regions in the cerebellum activated by speech perception were associated with domain-general terms related to prediction. One hallmark of predictive processing is metabolic savings (i.e., decreases in neural activity when events are predicted). To test the hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a predictive role in speech perception, we examined cortical activation between studies reporting cerebellar activation and those without cerebellar activation during speech perception. When the cerebellum was active during speech perception there was far less cortical activation than when it was inactive. The results suggest that the cerebellum implements a domain-general mechanism related to prediction during speech perception.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic associated with key aspects of metabolic disease such as obesity and diabetes. The first stage of NAFLD is characterized by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, but this can further progress into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis or cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A western diet, high in fats, sugars and cholesterol is linked to NAFLD development. Murine models are often used to experimentally study NAFLD, as they can display similar histopathological features as humans; however, there remains debate on which diet-induced model most appropriately and consistently mimics both human disease progression and pathogenesis. In this study, we performed a side-byside comparison of two popular diet models of murine NAFLD/NASH and associated HCC: a high fat diet supplemented with 30% fructose water (HFHF) and a western diet high in cholesterol (WDHC), comparing them to a common grain-based chow diet (GBD). Mice on both experimental diets developed liver steatosis, while WDHC-fed mice had greater levels of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis than HFHF-fed mice. In contrast, HFHF-fed mice were more obese and developed more severe metabolic syndrome, with less pronounced liver disease. Despite these differences, WDHC-fed and HFHF-fed mice had similar tumour burdens in a model of diet-potentiated liver cancer. Response to diet and resulting phenotypes were generally similar between sexes, albeit delayed in females. Notably, although metabolic and liver disease phenotypes are often thought to progress in parallel, this study shows that modest differences in diet can significantly uncouple glucose homeostasis and liver damage. In conclusion, long-term feeding of either HFHF or WDHC are reliable methods to induce NASH and diet-potentiated liver cancer in mice of both sexes; however, the choice of diet involves a trade-off between severity of metabolic syndrome and liver damage.Competing Interest StatementThe western diet high in cholesterol (WDHC) was provided by ResearchDiets. Data was discussed with staff at ResearchDiets prior to publication; however, they were not involved in experimental design, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the manuscript.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to elucidate the physiological responses of three Lotus forage accessions to alkaline stress and the influence of the inoculation of a Pantoea eucalypti endophyte strain on its mitigation. One-month-old diploid accessions of Lotus corniculatus (Lc) and Lotus tenuis (Lt), and the interspecific hybrid LtxLc obtained from these parental accessions, were exposed to alkaline stress (pH 8.2) by the addition of NaHCO3 10 mM to the nutrient solution for 2 weeks. The results indicated that Lt and the LtxLc hybrid are alkaline-tolerant compared to Lc, based on the observation that their dry mass is not reduced under stress, and symptoms of chlorosis do not appear on leaf blades, in contrast to observations of the Lc accession subjected to identical growth and stress conditions. In Lc and LtxLc accessions, the Fe2+ concentration decreased in the aerial part under stress and increased in the roots. Interveinal chlorosis observed in the youngest leaves of Lc during alkaline treatment was accompanied with a higher reduction of Fe2+ levels in shoots and a higher increment of Fe2+ in roots, compared to the other accession. Plant inoculation also tended to acidify the medium under alkalinity, contributing to Fe accumulation in the roots. Moreover, the inoculation caused a considerable increase in Fe2+ content in shoots in all three Lotus forage species under alkaline treatment.\n\nFv/Fm and PIABS were only reduced in Lc under alkaline treatment. Inoculation reverted this effect and improved the ABS/RC and DIo/RC ratios in all three accessions. In addition, under alkaline conditions, Lc dissipated more energy than control plants. Expression of the metal-transporting gene NRAMP1 increased in the inoculated Lc accession under stress, while remaining unmodified in Lt and LtxLc hybrid.\n\nAltogether, the results obtained make clear the importance of inoculation with P. eucalypti, which contributed significantly to the mitigation of alkaline stress. Thus, all the results provide useful information for improving alkaline tolerance traits in Lotus forage species and their interspecific hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are RNA binding molecules that are involved in key processes such as RNA splicing and transcription. One such hnRNP protein, hnRNP L, regulates alternative splicing (AS) by binding to pre-mRNA transcripts. However, it is unclear what factors contribute to hnRNP L-regulated AS events. Using proteomic approaches, we identified several key factors that co-purify with hnRNP L. We demonstrate that one such factor, the histone methyltransferase SETD2, specifically interacts with hnRNP L in vitro and in vivo. This interaction occurs through a previously uncharacterized domain in SETD2, the SETD2-hnRNP L Interaction (SHI) domain, the deletion of which, leads to a reduced H3K36me3 deposition. Functionally, SETD2 regulates a subset of hnRNP L-targeted AS events. Our findings demonstrate that SETD2 by interacting with Pol II as well as hnRNP L, can mediate the crosstalk between the transcription and the splicing machinery.",

    "abstract": "High-quality genomic resources facilitate population-level and species-level comparisons to answer questions about behavioral ecology, morphological and physiological adaptations, as well as the evolution of genomic architecture. Squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) are particularly diverse in characteristics that have intrigued evolutionary biologists, but high-quality genomic resources for squamates are relatively sparse. Lizards in the genus Sceloporus have a long history as important ecological, evolutionary, and physiological models, making them a valuable target for the development of genomic resources. We present a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome assembly, SceUnd1.0, (utilizing 10X Genomics Chromium, HiC, and PacBio data) and tissue/developmental stage transcriptomes for the Eastern Fence Lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. We performed synteny analysis with other available squamate chromosome-level assemblies to identify broad patterns of chromosome evolution including the fusion of micro- and macrochromosomes in S. undulatus. Using this new S. undulatus genome assembly we conducted reference-based assemblies for 34 other Sceloporus species to improve draft nuclear genomes assemblies from 1% coverage to 43% coverage on average. Across these species, typically >90% of reads mapped for species within 20 million years divergence from S. undulatus, this dropped to 75% reads mapped for species at 35 million years divergence. Finally we use RNAseq and whole genome resequencing data to compare the three assemblies as references, each representing an increased level of sequencing, cost and assembly efforts: Supernova Assembly with data from10X Genomics Chromium library; HiRise Assembly that added data from HiC library; and PBJelly Assembly that added data from PacBio sequencing. We found that the Supernova Assembly contained the full genome and was a suitable reference for RNAseq, but the chromosome-level scaffolds provided by the addition of the HiC data allowed the reference to be used for other whole genome analysis, including synteny and whole genome association mapping analyses. The addition of PacBio data provided negligible gains. Overall, these new genomic resources provide valuable tools for advanced molecular analysis of an organism that has become a model in physiology and evolutionary ecology.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis and assembly of long DNA fragments has greatly accelerated synthetic biology and biotechnology research. However, long turnaround times or synthesis failures create unpredictable bottlenecks in the design-build-test-learn cycle. We developed a machine learning model, called the Synthesis Success Calculator, to predict whether a long DNA fragment can be readily synthesized with a short turnaround time. The model also identifies the sequence determinants associated with the synthesis outcome. We trained a random forest classifier using biophysical features and a compiled dataset of 1076 DNA fragment sequences to achieve high predictive performance (F1 score of 0.928 on 251 unseen sequences). Feature importance analysis revealed that repetitive DNA sequences were the most important contributor to synthesis failures. We then applied the Synthesis Success Calculator across large sequence datasets and found that 84.9% of the Escherichia coli MG1655 genome, but only 34.4% of sampled plasmids in NCBI, could be readily synthesized. Overall, the Synthesis Success Calculator can be applied on its own to prevent synthesis failures or embedded within optimization algorithms to design large genetic systems that can be rapidly synthesized and assembled.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

We performed a \"hypothesis-free\" exome-wide burden-based analysis of different variant frequencies, predicted functional impact and age of onset classes, in order to expand the understanding of rare variants in PD. Analyzing whole-exome data from a total of 1,425 PD cases and 596 controls, we found a significantly increased burden of ultra-rare (URV= private variants absent from gnomAD) protein altering variants (PAV) in early-onset PD cases (EOPD, <40 years old; P=3.95x10-26, beta=0.16, SE=0.02), compared to LOPD cases (>60 years old, late-onset), where more common PAVs (allele frequencies <0.001) showed the highest significance and effect (P=0.026, beta=0.15, SE=0.07). Gene-set burden analysis of URVs in EOPD highlighted significant disease- and tissue-relevant genes, pathways and protein-protein interaction networks that were different to that observed in non-EOPD cases. Heritability estimates revealed that URVs account for 15.9% of the genetic component in EOPD individuals. Our results suggest that URVs play a significant role in EOPD and that distinct etiological bases may exist for EOPD and sporadic PD. By providing new insights into the genetic architecture of PD, our study may inform approaches aimed at novel gene discovery and provide new directions for genetic risk assessment based on disease age of onset.",

    "abstract": "Functional diversification of transcription factor families through variation in modular domain architectures has played a central role in the independent evolution of gene regulatory networks underlying complex development in plants and animals. Here we show that architecture has in turn constrained evolution of B3 DNA binding domains in the B3 network regulating embryo formation in plants. B3 domains of ABI3, FUS3, LEC2 and VAL1 proteins recognize the same cis-element. ABI3 and VAL1 have complex architectures that physically integrate cis-element recognition with other signals, whereas LEC2 and FUS3 have reduced architectures conducive to their roles as pioneer activators. Qualitatively different activities of LEC2 and ABI3 B3 domains measured in vivo and in vitro are attributed in part to clade-specific substitutions in three amino acids that interact with the DNA backbone. Activities of FUS3 and VAL1 B3 domains show a similar correlation with architectural complexity. Domain-swap analyses in planta show that in a complex architecture setting the attenuated activities of ABI3 and VAL1 B3 domains are required for proper integration of ciselement recognition with hormone signalling. These results highlight modes of structural variation affecting non-specific, electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone as a general mechanism allowing adaptation of DNA binding affinity to architectural constraints while preserving DNA sequence specificity.",

However, whether IGPR-1 is activated in response to, and mediates autophagy remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that IGPR-1 is activated by autophagy inducing stimuli, such as amino acid starvation, nutrient deprivation, rapamycin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have identified I{kappa}B kinase{beta} (IKK{beta}) as a key serine/threonine kinase activated by autophagy stimuli and mediates phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser220. Activation of IGPR-1, in turn, stimulates phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which leads to phosphorylation of key pro-autophagy proteins, ULK1 and Beclin-1 (BECN1), increased LC3-II levels and accumulation of LC3 punctum. This study demonstrates that IGPR-1 is activated by and regulates autophagy, connecting cell adhesion to autophagy, a finding that has important significance for autophagy-driven pathologies such cardiovascular diseases and cancer.",

Selection for these selfish sex chromosomes can lead to completely female populations, which cannot produce offspring and go extinct. However, at the population level, moderately female-biased sex ratios are optimal because relatively few males are required to fertilise all the females. We develop eco-evolutionary models for sex-linked meiotic drive alleles to investigate their full range of demographic effects. We find general conditions for the spread and fixation of X-drivers, accounting for transmission bias and other factors associated with the spread of X-drivers such as sperm competition and polyandry. Our results suggest driving X-alleles that do not reach fixation (or do not bias segregation excessively) will boost population sizes and persistence times by increasing population productivity, demonstrating the potential for selfish genetic elements to move sex ratios closer to the population-level optimum. We suggest that researchers should look beyond extinction risk and consider the potential for ecologically beneficial side effects of selfish genetic elements, especially in light of proposals to use meiotic drive for biological control.",
