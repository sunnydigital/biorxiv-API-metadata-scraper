    "abstract": "During the 2020 SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, there has been an acute shortage of viral transport medium. Many different products have been used to meet the demands of large-scale diagnostic and surveillance testing. The stability of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was assessed in several commercially produced transport media and an in-house solution. Coronavirus RNA was rapidly destroyed in the commercial transport media though the deleterious effects on intact virus were limited. Similar results were obtained for a Type A influenza virus. There was reduced detection of both virus and nucleic acid when a herpesvirus sample and purified DNA were tested. Collectively these data showed that the commercial viral transport media contained nucleases or similar substances and may seriously compromise diagnostic and epidemiological investigations.\n\nRecommendations to include foetal bovine serum as a source of protein to enhance the stabilising properties of viral transport media are contraindicated. Almost all commercial batches of foetal bovine serum contain pestiviruses and at times other bovine viruses. In addition to the potential for there to be nucleases in the transport medium, the presence of these viruses and other extraneous nucleic acid in samples may compromise the interpretation of sequence data. The inclusion of foetal bovine serum presents a biosecurity risk for the movement of animal pathogens and renders these transport media unsuitable for animal disease diagnostic applications. While these transport media may be suitable for virus culture purposes, there could be misleading results if used for nucleic acid-based tests. Therefore, these products should be evaluated to ensure fitness for purpose.",

Effective diagnosis, treatment, and prophylactic measures are urgently required to meet global demand: recombinant antibodies fulfill these requirements and have marked clinical potential. Here, we describe the fast-tracked development of an alpaca Nanobody specific for the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with therapeutic potential applicability. We present a rapid method for nanobody isolation that includes an optimized immunization regimen coupled with VHH library E. coli surface display, which allows single-step selection of high-affinity nanobodies using a simple density gradient centrifugation of the bacterial library. The selected single and monomeric Nanobody, W25, binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with sub-nanomolar affinity and efficiently competes with ACE-2 receptor binding. Furthermore, W25 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 wild type and the D614G variant with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, demonstrating its potential as antiviral agent.",

    "abstract": "Tightly packed complexes of nucleocapsid protein and genomic RNA form the core of viruses and may assemble within viral factories, dynamic compartments formed within the host cells. Here, we examine the possibility that the multivalent RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein (N) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) compacts RNA via protein-RNA liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and that N interactions with host RNA-binding proteins are mediated by phase separation. To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a N-terminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for purification. Using in vitro phase separation assays, we find that N is assembly-prone and phase separates avidly. Phase separation is modulated by addition of RNA and changes in pH and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, N enters into in vitro phase separated condensates of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2) and their low complexity domains (LCs). However, N partitioning into the LC of FUS, but not TDP-43 or hnRNPA2, requires cleavage of the solubilizing MBP fusion. Hence, LLPS may be an essential mechanism used for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viral genome packing and host protein co-opting, functions necessary for viral replication and hence infectivity.",

    "abstract": "In late 2019, an outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in high morbidity and mortality in infected humans1. Complete understanding of COVID-19, the multi-faceted disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, requires suitable small animal models, as does the development and evaluation of vaccines and antivirals2. Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters. We propose that comparative assessment in young versus aged hamsters of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and treatments may yield valuable information as this small-animal model appears to mirror age-dependent differences in human patients.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and rapid proliferation of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a global pandemic, with over six million cases and nearly four hundred thousand deaths reported world-wide by the end of May 2020. A rush to find the cures prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing therapeutics vis-a-vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in supporting the mechanistic studies of drug/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the non-covalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease of its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/142794v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ce764corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8909corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e13fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2383a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The function of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein p6, encoded by ORF6, is not fully known. Based upon its similarity to p6 from SARS-CoV, it may play a similar role, namely as an antagonist of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Here we report the sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain passaged six times after original isolation from a clinical patient in Hong Kong. The genome sequence shows a 27 nt in-frame deletion ({Delta}27,264-27,290) within ORF6, predicted to result in a 9 aa deletion ({Delta}FKVSIWNLD) from the central portion of p6. This deletion is predicted to result in a dramatic alteration in the three-dimensional structure of the resultant protein (p6{Delta}22-30), possibly with significant functional implications. Analysis of the original clinical sample indicates that the deletion was not present, while sequencing of subsequent passages of the strain identifies the deletion as a majority variant. This suggests that the deletion originated ab initio during passaging and subsequently propagated into the majority, possibly due to the removal of selective pressure through the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. The specific function of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 N-terminus, if any, has not yet been determined. However, this deletion is predicted to cause a shift from N-endo to N-ecto in the transmembrane localization of the SARS-CoV-2 p6{Delta}22-30 N-terminus, possibly leading to the ablation of its native function.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic spread very fast around the world. A few days after the first detected case in South Africa, an infection started a large hospital outbreak in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be used to trace the path of transmission within a hospital. It can also identify the source of the outbreak and provide lessons to improve infection prevention and control strategies. In this manuscript, we outline the obstacles we encountered in order to genotype SARS-CoV-2 in real-time during an urgent outbreak investigation. In this process, we encountered problems with the length of the original genotyping protocol, reagent stockout and sample degradation and storage. However, we managed to set up three different library preparation methods for sequencing in Illumina. We also managed to decrease the hands on library preparation time from twelve to three hours, which allowed us to complete the outbreak investigation in just a few weeks. We also fine-tuned a simple bioinformatics workflow for the assembly of high-quality genomes in real-time. In order to allow other laboratories to learn from our experience, we released all of the library preparation and bioinformatics protocols publicly and distributed them to other laboratories of the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance (SANGS) consortium.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the stomach of approximately half of the worlds population. Manifestation of clinical diseases associated with H. pylori infection, including cancer, is driven by strain properties and host responses; and as chronic infection persists, both are subject to change. Previous studies have documented frequent and extensive within-host bacterial genetic variation. To define how within-host diversity contributes to phenotypes related to H. pylori pathogenesis, this project leverages a collection of 39 clinical isolates acquired prospectively from a single subject at two time points and from multiple gastric sites. During the six years separating collection of these isolates, this individual, initially harboring a duodenal ulcer, progressed to gastric atrophy and concomitant loss of acid secretion. Whole genome sequence analysis identified 2,232 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across isolates and a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.3x10-4 substitutions/site/year. Gene ontology analysis identified cell envelope genes among the genes with excess accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs (nSNPs). A dendrogram based on genetic similarity, clusters isolates from each time point separately. Within time points, there is segregation of subgroups with phenotypic differences in bacterial morphology, ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, and mouse colonization. Higher inflammatory cytokine induction in recent isolates maps to shared polymorphisms in the Cag PAI protein, CagY, while rod morphology in a subgroup of recent isolates mapped to eight mutations in three distinct helical cell shape determining (csd) genes. The presence of subgroups with unique genetic and phenotypic properties suggest complex selective forces and multiple sub-niches within the stomach during chronic infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryHelicobacter pylori, one of the most common bacterial pathogens colonizing humans, is the main agent responsible for stomach ulcers and cancer. Certain strain types are associated with increased risk of disease, however many factors contributing to disease outcome remain unknown. Prior work has documented genetic diversity among bacterial populations within single individuals, but the impact of this diversity for continued bacterial infection or disease progression remains understudied. In our analysis we examined both genetic and functional features of many stomach isolates from a single individual infected over six years. During these six years the subject shifted from having excess acid production and a duodenal ulcer to lower acid production from gastric atrophy. The 39 isolates form sub-populations based on gene sequence changes that accumulated in the different isolates. In addition to having distinguishing genetic features, these sub-populations also have differences in several bacterial properties, including cell shape, ability to activate immune responses, and colonization in a mouse model of infection. This apparent functional specialization suggests that the bacterial sub-populations may have adapted to distinct sub-niches within the stomach during chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-191, recognizes host cells by attaching its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE22-7. Neutralizing antibodies that block RBD-ACE2 interaction have been a major focus for therapeutic development8-18. Llama-derived single-domain antibodies (nanobodies, [~]15 kDa) offer advantages including ease of production and possibility for direct delivery to the lungs by nebulization19, which are attractive features for bio-drugs against the global respiratory disease. Here, we generated 99 synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) by in vitro selection using three libraries. The best sybody, MR3 bound to RBD with high affinity (KD = 1.0 nM) and showed high neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses (IC50 = 0.40 g mL-1). Structural, biochemical, and biological characterization of sybodies suggest a common neutralizing mechanism, in which the RBD-ACE2 interaction is competitively inhibited by sybodies. Various forms of sybodies with improved potency were generated by structure-based design, biparatopic construction, and divalent engineering. Among these, a divalent MR3 conjugated with the albumin-binding domain for prolonged half-life displayed highest potency (IC50 = 12 ng mL-1) and protected mice from live SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Our results pave the way to the development of therapeutic nanobodies against COVID-19 and present a strategy for rapid responses for future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the ongoing global pandemics has led to infections of millions of people and losses of many lives. The rapid, accurate and convenient SARS-CoV-2 virus detection is crucial for controlling and stopping the pandemics. Diagnosis of patients in the early stage infection are so far limited to viral nucleic acid or antigen detection in human nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples. Here we developed a method for rapid and direct optical measurement of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in one step nearly without any sample preparation using a spike protein specific nanoplasmonic resonance sensor. We demonstrate that we can detect as few as 30 virus particles in one step within 15 minutes and can quantify the virus concentration linearly in the range of 103 vp/ml to 106 vp/ml. Measurements shown on both generic microplate reader and a handheld smartphone connected device suggest that our low-cost and rapid detection method may be adopted quickly under both regular clinical environment and resource-limited settings.",

These peptides derived from HR1 and HR2 of SARA-CoV-2 spike protein were further tested for their interaction and potential fusion possibility through circular dichroism spectrum. Here we used the peptide COVID-2019-HR1P1 (40 amino acids) as the target, which was derived from HR1 of SARA-CoV-2 spike protein, while the designed peptides including COVID-2019-HR2P1 (37 amino acids), COVID-2019-HR2P2 (32 amino acids) and others derived from HR2 of SARA-CoV-2 were tested for their binding to COVID-2019-HR1P1. Interestingly, results showed that both COVID-2019-HR2P1 and COVID-2019-HR2P2 can form the complex with COVID-2019-HR1P1, respectively.

Non structural protein 1 (nsp1) is found in all beta coronavirus that causes several severe respiratory diseases. This protein is considered as a virulence factor and has an important role in pathogenesis. This study aims to elucidate the structural conformations of non structural protein 1 (nsp1), prediction of epitope sites and identification of important residues for targeted therapy against COVID-19. In this study, molecular modelling coupled with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyse the conformational change of nsp1 of SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV at molecular level. Principal component analysis escorted by free energy landscape revealed that SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein shows greater flexibility, compared to SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV nsp1. From the sequence alignment, it was observed that 28 mutations are present in SERS-CoV2 nsp1 protein compared to SERS-CoV1 nsp1. Several B-cell and T-cell epitopes were identified by immunoinformatics approach. SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein binds with the interface region of the palm and finger domain of POLA1 by using hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions.

    "abstract": "The introduction of several differential gene expression analysis tools has made it difficult for researchers to settle on a particular tool for RNA-seq analysis. This coupled with the appropriate determination of biological replicates to give an optimum representation of the study population and make biological sense. To address these challenges, we performed a survey of 8 tools used for differential expression in RNA-seq analysis. We simulated 39 different datasets (from 10 to 200 replicates, at an interval of 5) using compcodeR with a maximum of 100 replicates. Our goal was to determine the effect of varying the number of replicates on the performance (F1-score, recall and precision) of the tools. EBSeq and edgeR-glmRT recorded the highest (0.9385) and lowest (0.6505) average F1-score across all replicates, respectively. We also performed a pairwise comparison of all the tools to determine their concordance with each other in identifying differentially expressed genes. We found the greatest concordance to be between limma voom treat and limma voom ebayes. Finally, we recommend employing edgeR-glmRT for RNA-seq experiments involving 10-50 replicates and edgeR-glmQLF for studies with 55 to 200 replicates.\n\nAuthor summaryDownstream analysis of RNA-seq data in R often poses several challenges to researchers as it is a daunting task to choose a specific differential expression analysis tool over another. Researchers also find it challenging to determine the number (replicates) of samples to use in order to give comparable and accurate results. In this paper, we surveyed eight differential expression analysis tools using different number of replicates of simulated RNA-seq count data. We measured the performance of each tool and based on the recorded F1-scores, recall and precision, we made the following recommendations; consider edgeR-glmRT and edgeR-glmQLF for replicates of 10-50 and 55-200 respectively.",

    "abstract": "Feedback control is a universal feature of cell signaling pathways. Naked/NKD is a widely conserved feedback regulator of Wnt signaling which controls animal development and tissue homeostasis. Naked/NKD destabilizes Dishevelled, which assembles Wnt signalosomes to inhibit the {beta}-catenin destruction complex via recruitment of Axin. Here, we discover that the molecular mechanism underlying Naked/NKD function relies on its assembly into ultrastable decameric core aggregates via its conserved C-terminal histidine cluster (HisC). HisC aggregation is facilitated by Dishevelled and depends on accumulation of Naked/NKD during prolonged Wnt stimulation. Naked/NKD HisC cores co-aggregate with a conserved histidine cluster within Axin, to destabilize it along with Dishevelled, possibly via the autophagy receptor p62 which binds to HisC aggregates. Consistent with this, attenuated Wnt responses are observed in CRISPR-engineered flies and human epithelial cells whose HisC has been deleted. Thus, HisC aggregation by Naked/NKD provides context-dependent feedback control of prolonged Wnt responses.",

    "abstract": "Moral judgments may be driven by both principled and opportunistic motivations. Being morally principled is to consistently adhere to a single set of rules about morality and justice. Opportunistic morality rather involves selectively enforcing rules when they are beneficial to ones interests. These two kinds of motivations sometimes pull in the same direction, other times not. Prior studies on moral motivations have mostly focused on principled morality. Opportunistic morality, along with its phenotypic and genetic correlates, remains largely unexamined. Here, utilizing a sample from the Norwegian Twin Registry, consisting of 312 monozygotic-and 298 dizygotic twin pairs (N = 1220), we measure peoples propensity to react to injustice as victims, observers, beneficiaries, and perpetrators of injustice, using the Justice Sensitivity scale. Our genetically informative sample allows a biometric modeling approach that provides increased stringency in inferring latent psychological traits. We find evidence for two substantially heritable traits explaining correlations between Justice Sensitivity facets, which we interpret as a principled justice sensitivity (h2 = .45) leading to increased sensitivity to injustices of all categories, and an opportunistic justice sensitivity (h2 = .69) associated with increased victim sensitivity and a decreased propensity to feel guilt from being a perpetrator. These heritable justice traits share a genetic substrate with broad strategies for cooperation (as measured by altruism and trust) and for selectively benefitting oneself over the adaptive interests of others (as measured by social dominance orientation and support for monopolizing territory and resources), and differ genetically and phenotypically from Big Five personality traits.",

All mothers completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences as an index of schizotypy dimensionality. An auditory paired-tone paradigm was used to probe oscillatory activity, revealing that although the infants evoked-oscillations displayed differences between Stimulus 1 and 2, there were no group differences between infants of schizotypic and control mothers. Their mothers, however, displayed differences, with reduced amplitudes toward Stimulus 1 in schizotypic mothers; consistent with literature on early sensory processes, showing sensory gating is impaired in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.",

While recent evidence suggests that microtubules enriched in detyrosinated \u03b1-tubulin are responsible for these effects in healthy muscle, and for their excess in disease, the possible contribution from several other \u03b1-tubulin modifications has not been investigated. Here we used genetic or pharmacologic strategies in isolated cardiomyocytes or skeletal myofibers to increase the level of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin without altering the level of detyrosinated \u03b1-tubulin. We show that microtubules enriched in acetylated \u03b1-tubulin contribute to the cytoskeletal stiffness and viscoelastic resistance, showing slowed rates of contraction and relaxation during unloaded contraction, and increased activation of NADPH Oxidase 2 (Nox2) by mechanotransduction. Together these findings add to growing evidence that microtubules contribute to the mechanobiology of striated muscle in health and disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Two challenges to optimizing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are selecting between, often similar, electrode montages and accounting for inter-individual differences in response. These two factors are related by how tDCS montage determines current flow through the brain considered across or within individuals. MRI-based computational head models (CHMs) predict how brain anatomy determine electric field (EF) patterns for a given tDCS montage. Because conventional tDCS produces diffuse brain current flow, stimulation outcomes may be understood as modulation of global networks. Therefore, we developed network-led, rather than region-led, approach. We specifically considered two common frontal tDCS montages that nominally target the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; asymmetric unilateral (anode/cathode: F4/Fp1) and symmetric bilateral (F4/F3) electrode montages. CHMs of 66 participants were constructed. We showed that cathode location significantly affects EFs in the limbic network. Furthermore, using a finer parcellation of large-scale networks, we found significant differences in some of main nodes within a network, even if there is no difference at the network level. This study generally demonstrates a methodology for considering the components of large-scale networks in CHMs instead of targeting a single region and specifically provides insight into how symmetric vs asymmetric frontal tDCS may differentially modulate networks across a population.",

Herein, we utilized an inducible, conditional knockout of Tfap2c to elucidate the role of AP-2{gamma} in maintenance and differentiation of MaSCs.

    "abstract": "Background and AimsThe great diversity of floral characters among animal-pollinated plants is commonly understood as the result of coevolutionary interactions between plants and pollinators. Floral antagonists, such as nectar thieves, also have the potential to exert selection on floral characters, but adaptation against floral antagonists has attracted comparatively little attention. We found that the corollas of hornet-pollinated Codonopsis lanceolata (Campanulaceae) and the tepals of bee-pollinated Fritillaria koidzumiana (Liliaceae) are slippery to nectar-thieving ants living in the plants habitat; because the flowers of both species have exposed nectaries, slippery perianths may function as a defence against nectar-thieving ants.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a behavioural experiment and observed perianth surface microstructure by scanning electron microscopy to investigate the mechanism of slipperiness. Field experiments were conducted to test whether slippery perianths prevent floral entry by ants, and whether ant presence inside flowers affects pollination.\n\nKey ResultsScanning electron microscopy observations indicated that the slippery surfaces were coated with epicuticular wax crystals. The perianths lost their slipperiness when wiped with hexane. Artificial bridging of the slippery surfaces using non-slippery materials allowed ants to enter flowers more frequently. Experimental introduction of live ants to the Codonopsis flowers evicted hornet pollinators and shortened the duration of pollinator visits. However, no differences were found in the fruit or seed sets of flowers with and without ants.\n\nConclusionsSlippery perianths, most likely based on epicuticular wax crystals, prevent floral entry by ants that negatively affect pollinator behaviour. Experimental evidence of floral defence based on slippery surfaces is rare, but such a mode of defence may be widespread amongst flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "The tips in the tree of life serve as foci for conservation and management, yet clear delimitations are masked by inherent variance at the species-population interface. Analyses using thousands of nuclear loci can potentially sort inconsistencies, yet standard categories applied to this parsing are themselves potentially conflicting and/or subjective [e.g., DPS (distinct population segments); DUs (Diagnosable Units-Canada); MUs (management units); SSP (subspecies); Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs)]. One potential solution for consistent categorization is to create a comparative framework by accumulating statistical results from independent studies and evaluating congruence among data sets. Our study illustrates this approach in speckled dace (Cyprinidae: Rhinichthys osculus) endemic to two basins (Owens and Amargosa) in the Death Valley ecosystem (DVE). These fish persist in the Mojave Desert as isolated Pleistocene-relicts and are of conservation concern, but lack formal taxonomic descriptions/designations. Double-digest RAD (ddRAD) methods identified 14,355 SNP loci across 10 populations (N=140). Species delimitation analyses [multispecies coalescent (MSC) and unsupervised machine learning (UML)] delineated four putative ESUs. FST outlier loci (N=106) were juxtaposed to uncover the potential for localized adaptations. We detected one hybrid population that resulted from upstream reconnection of habitat following contemporary pluvial periods, whereas remaining populations represent relics of ancient tectonism within geographically-isolated springs and groundwater-fed streams. Our study offers three salient conclusions: A blueprint for a multi-faceted delimitation of conservation units; a proposed mechanism by which criteria for intraspecific biodiversity can be potentially standardized; and a strong argument for the proactive management of critically-endangered DVE fishes.",

    "abstract": "Among laboratory mouse strains many genes are differentially expressed in the same cell population. As consequence, gene targeting in 129-derived embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and backcrossing the modified mice onto the C57BL/6 (B6) background can introduce passenger mutations in the close proximity of the targeted gene. Here, we demonstrate that several 129-originating transgenic mice in which P2rx7-neighboring genes were targeted carry a P2rx7 passenger mutation that affects the vitality and function of T cells. By the example of P2rx4tm1Rass we demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells derived from these mice express higher levels of P2X7 when compared to corresponding cell populations in B6-WT mice. The increased T cell sensitivity towards the P2X7 activators adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) rendered these cells more vulnerable towards NAD-induced cell death (NICD) compared to their B6-WT counterparts. The enhanced NICD sensitivity significantly affected the outcome of functional assays e.g. cytokine production and cell migration. For P2rx4tm1Rass, we demonstrate that the expression of P2X7 is diminished in several innate immune cell populations, possibly as a side effect of P2rx4 targeting, and independent of the P2rx7 passenger mutation. These results need to be considered when working with P2rx4tm1Rass mice or other 129-based transgenic strains that target P2rx7 neighboring genes and might have implications for other mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Palmitic acid is the most abundant saturated fatty acid in human serum. In cell culture systems, palmitate overload is considered a toxic stimulus, and promotes lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, as well as cell death. An increased supply of fatty acids has also been shown to change the predominant form of the mitochondrial network, although the metabolic effects of this change are still unclear. Here, we aimed to uncover the early bioenergetic outcomes of lipotoxicity. We incubated hepatic PLC/PRF/5 cells with palmitate conjugated to BSA and followed real-time oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification for 6 hours. Palmitate increased glycolysis as soon as 1 hour after the stimulus, while oxygen consumption was not disturbed, despite overt mitochondrial fragmentation and cellular reductive imbalance. Palmitate only induced mitochondrial fragmentation if glucose and glutamine were available, while glycolytic enhancement did not require glutamine, showing it is not dependent on morphological changes. NAD(P)H levels were significantly abrogated in palmitate-treated cells. Knockdown of the mitochondrial NAD(P) transhydrogenase or addition of the mitochondrial oxidant-generator menadione in control cells modulated ATP production from glycolysis. Indeed, using selective inhibitors, we found that the production of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide at the IQ site of electron transport chain complex I is associated with the metabolic rewiring promoted by palmitate, while not changing mitochondrial oxygen consumption. In conclusion, we demonstrate that increased glycolytic flux linked to mitochondrially-generated redox imbalance is an early bioenergetic result of palmitate overload and lipotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Inosine is ubiquitous and essential in many biological processes, including RNA-editing. In addition, oxidative stress on RNA has been a topic of increasing interest due, in part, to its potential role in the development/progression of disease. In this work we probed the ability of three reverse transcriptases to catalyze the synthesis of cDNA in the presence of RNA templates containing inosine (I), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroinosine (8oxo-I), guanosine (G), or 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoG), and explored the impact that these purine derivatives have as a function of position. To this end, we used 29-mers of RNA (as template) containing the modifications at position-18 and reverse transcribed DNA using 17-mers, 18-mers, or 19-mers (as primers). Generally reactivity of the viral RTs, MMLV / AMV / HIV, towards cDNA synthesis was similar for templates containing G or I, as well as for those with 8-oxoG or 8-oxoI. Notable differences are 1) that templates containing I enabled the incorporation of dT when using 17-mers (for exploring incorporation of dNTPs opposite the site of interest); 2) that the use of 18-mers of DNA (to explore cDNA synthesis past the lesion) led to DNA elongation inhibition in the case when a G:dA wobble pair was present, while the presence of I, 8-oxoI, or 8-oxoG led to full synthesis of the corresponding cDNA, with the latter two displaying a more efficient process; 3) that HIV-RT is more sensitive to modified base pairs in the vicinity of cDNA synthesis; and 4) that the presence of a modification two positions away from transcription initiation has an adverse impact on the overall process. Steady-state kinetics were established to determine substrate specificities towards canonical dNTPs (N = G, C, T, A). Overall we found evidence that RNA templates containing inosine are likely to incorporate dC > dT > > dA, where reactivity in the presence of dA was found to be pH dependent (process abolished at pH 7.3); and that the absence of the C2-exocyclic amine, as displayed with templates containing 8-oxoI, leads to increased selectivity towards incorporation of dA over dC. The data will be useful in assessing the impact that the presence of inosine and/or oxidatively generated lesions have on viral processes and adds to previous reports where I codes exclusively like G.",

    "abstract": "Loss of P27 predominantly results in development of murine pituitary intermediate lobe (IL) tumours. We previously showed that the pleiotropic protein P27 can drive repression of the transcription factor Sox2. This interaction plays an important role during development of p27-/- IL tumours because loss of one copy of Sox2 diminishes tumorigenesis. Here, we have explored the cellular origin and mechanisms underlying melanotroph tumorigenesis in p27-/- IL. We show that IL hyperplasia is associated with reduced cellular differentiation, while levels of SOX2 increase in both stem cells (SC) and melanotrophs. Using loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches, we demonstrate that SOX2 is required cell-autonomously in p27-/- melanotrophs and SCs for tumorigenesis. This is supported by studies deleting the Sox2 regulatory region 2 (Srr2), which is the target of P27 repressive action. Single cell transcriptomic analysis reveals that activation of a SOX2-dependent MAPK pathway in SCs is important for p27-/- tumorigenesis. Our data highlight different roles of SOX2 following loss of p27, according to the cellular context. Furthermore, we uncover a tumor-promoting function for SCs, which is SOX2-dependant. In conclusion, our results imply that targeting SCs, in addition to tumour cells themselves, may represent an efficient anti-tumoral strategy in certain contexts.",

    "abstract": "Apex predators structure communities through consumptive and non-consumptive pathways. In the carnivore guild, this can result in a within-guild cascade through the suppression of mesocarnivores. As the top-down influences of apex predators wane due to human-driven declines, landscape level anthropogenic pressures are rising. Human impacts can be analogous to apex predators in that humans can drive increased mortality in both prey species and carnivores, and impact communities through indirect fear effects and food subsidies. Here, we evaluate whether anthropogenic top-down pressures can structure communities in a similar manner as apex predators in shaping the interactions of mesocarnivores. Specifically, we expect anthropogenic forces to induce comparable effects as occurrence of apex predators in driving spatiotemporal partitioning between two mesocarnivores. Using multiple camera-trap surveys, we compared the temporal response of a small carnivore, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), to the larger coyote (Canis latrans) at four sites across Michigan that represented opposing gradients of pressure from humans and apex predators. Contrary to our expectations, we found that raccoons shifted their activity pattern in response to coyotes at sites with higher anthropogenic pressures and exhibited no temporal response at sites with apex predators. Temporal shifts were characterized by raccoons being more diurnal in areas of high coyote activity. We conclude that despite superficial similarities, anthropogenic forces do not replace the function of native apex predators in structuring the mesocarnivore guild. As such, an intact and functioning native predator guild remains necessary to preserve spatiotemporal community structure, in natural and disturbed systems alike.",

Specifically, DN3e proved to be long-lived, they proliferated and differentiated in vivo, were necessary for autonomous thymopoiesis, and included DNA-label-retaining cells. Single cell RNAseq revealed a transcriptional program of thymopoiesis similar in autonomy and the controls. Nevertheless, a new population was identified in thymus autonomy that was enriched for an aberrant Notch target gene signature and bypassed the {beta}-selection checkpoint. In sum, DN3e have the potential to self-renew and differentiate in vivo if cell competition is compromised but this enables the accumulation of atypical cells, probably leading to leukemia.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSEBacillus endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening bacterial infection that sometimes requires enucleation. Inflammation in this disease is driven by activation of innate Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. Here, we explored the consequences of innate immune interference on intraocular inflammatory responses during Bacillus endophthalmitis.\n\nMETHODSEndophthalmitis was induced in mice by injecting 100 CFU Bacillus thuringiensis in to the mid-vitreous. We interfered with activation of the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways by 1) injecting a group of mice with S layer protein-deficient ({Delta}slpA) B. thuringiensis or 2) injecting a group of wild type (WT)-infected mice with a TLR2/4 inhibitor, oxidized phospholipid (OxPAPC). At 10 hours postinfection, infected eyes were removed and total RNA was purified. mRNA expression was then analyzed by NanoString using a murine inflammation panel. We compared findings with expression data from eyes infected with eyes injected with WT B. thuringiensis, eyes injected with OxPAPC alone, and uninfected eyes.\n\nRESULTSInterference of TLR2 and TLR4 pathways resulted in differential expression of mouse inflammatory genes compared to expression in WT-infected eyes. In WT-infected eyes, 56% of genes were significantly upregulated compared to that of uninfected controls. However, compared to WT-infected eyes, the expression of 27% and 50% of genes were significantly reduced in WT+OxPAPC and {Delta}slpA-infected eyes, respectively. The expression of 61 genes which were significantly upregulated in WT-infected eyes was decreased in WT+OxPAPC or {Delta}slpA-infected eyes. Interference with activation of the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways resulted in blunted expression of complement factors (C3, Cfb, and C6) and several innate genes such as TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, TLR8, MyD88, Nod2, Nlrp3, NF-{kappa}B, STAT3, RelA, RelB, and Ptgs2. Interference with activation of the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways also reduced the expression of several inflammatory cytokines such as CSF3, IL-6, IL-1{beta}, CSF2, IL-1, TNF, IL-23, TGF{beta}1, and IL-12{beta} and chemokines CCL2, CCl3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10. All of the aforementioned genes were significantly upregulated in WT-infected eyes.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThese results suggest that interfering with the activation of innate immune pathways during Bacillus endophthalmitis significantly reduced the intraocular inflammatory response. This positive clinical outcome could be a strategy for anti-inflammatory therapy of an infection typically refractory to corticosteroid treatment.",

    "abstract": "While measurement advances now allow extensive surveys of gene activity (large numbers of genes across many samples), interpretation of these data is often confounded by noise \u2014 expression counts can differ strongly across samples due to variation of both biological and experimental origin. Complimentary to perturbation approaches, we extract functionally related groups of genes by analyzing the standing variation within a sampled population. To distinguish biologically meaningful patterns from uninterpretable noise, we focus on correlated variation and develop a novel density-based clustering approach that takes advantage of a percolation transition generically arising in random, uncorrelated data. We apply our approach to two contrasting RNA sequencing data sets that sample individual variation \u2014 across single cells of fission yeast and whole animals of C. elegans worms \u2014 and demonstrate robust applicability and versatility in revealing correlated gene clusters of diverse biological origin, including cell cycle phase, development/reproduction, tissue-specific functions, and feeding history. Our technique exploits generic features of noisy high-dimensional data and is applicable, beyond gene expression, to feature-rich data that sample population-level variability in the presence of noise.Significance Statement Gene expression largely determines the fate of each cell and ultimately the development and behavior of the whole organism. Whereas most of our knowledge on gene regulatory networks has been obtained from perturbation experiments (e.g. manipulating environmental conditions, genotype, or other physiological variables), here we develop an alternative approach based on the analysis of naturally occurring variations across individuals within a population. Using both single-cell and whole-animal RNA sequencing data, we demonstrate how a rich set of co-regulated gene modules can be uncovered from transcriptomic variability of individuals within unperturbed populations. To robustly extract interpretable clusters from the strong noise background, we devise a novel, versatile clustering approach based on network theory. With a foundation in the generic behavior of random networks near their percolation critical point, our method is broadly applicable, beyond gene expression, to any noisy, high-dimensional data that sample variation across individuals within a population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Background Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are the most effective therapy to terminate malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and therefore to prevent sudden cardiac death. Until today, there is no way to predict the onset of such VA. Our aim was to develop a mathematical model that could predict VA in a timely fashion.Methods We analyzed the time series of R-R intervals from 3 groups. Two groups from the Spontaneous Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Database (v 1.0) were analyzed from a set of 81 pairs of R-R interval time series records from patients, each pair containing one record before the VT episode (Dataset 1A) and one control record which was obtained during the follow up visit (Dataset 1B). A third data set was composed of the RR interval time series of 54 subjects without a significant arrhythmia heart disease (Dataset 2). We developed a new method to transform a time series into a network for its analysis, the \u03b5 \u2212 regular graphs. This novel approach transforms a time series into a network which is sensitive to the quantitative properties of the time series, it has a single parameter (\u03b5) to be adjusted, and it can trace long-range correlations. This procedure allows to use graph theory to extract the dynamics of any time series.Results The average of the difference between the VT and the control record graph degree of each patient, at each time window, reached a global minimum value of \u22122.12 followed by a drastic increase of the average graph until reaching a local maximum of 5.59. The global minimum and the following local maxima occur at the windows 276 and 393, respectively. This change in the connectivity of the graphs distinguishes two distinct dynamics occurring during the VA, while the states in between the 276 and 393, determine a transitional state. We propose this change in the dynamic of the R-R intervals as a measurable and detectable \u201cearly warning\u201d of the VT event, occurring an average of 514.625 seconds (8 : 30 minutes) before the onset of the VT episode.Conclusions It is feasible to detect retrospectively early warnings of the VA episode using their corresponding \u03b5 \u2212 regular graphs, with an average of 8 : 30 minutes before the ICD terminates the VA event.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was recently declared a worldwide pandemic. Infection triggers the respiratory tract disease COVID-19, which is accompanied by serious changes of clinical biomarkers such as hemoglobin and interleukins. The same parameters are altered during hemolysis, which is characterized by an increase in labile heme. We present two approaches that aim at analyzing a potential link between available heme and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Four COVID-19 related proteins, i.e. the host cell proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as the viral protein 7a and S protein, were identified as potential heme binders. We also performed a detailed analysis of the common pathways induced by heme and SARS-CoV-2 by superimposition of knowledge graphs covering heme biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Herein, focus was laid on inflammatory pathways, and distinct biomarkers as the linking elements. Finally, the results substantially improve our understanding of COVID-19 infections and disease progression of patients with different clinical backgrounds and expand the diagnostic and treatment options.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected African American populations disproportionately in regards to both morbidity and mortality. A multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy. Gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment. To elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in COVID-19 vary in African Americans as compared to European Americans, we re-mine The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) RNA-Seq data. Multiple genes integral to infection, inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations. Most notably, F8A2 and F8A3, which encode the HAP40 protein that mediates early endosome movement in Huntingtons Disease, are more highly expressed by up to 24-fold in African Americans. Such differences in gene expression can establish prognostic signatures and have critical implications for precision treatment of diseases such as COVID-19. We advocate routine inclusion of information such as postal code, education level, and profession (as a proxies for socioeconomic condition) and race in the metadata about each individual sampled for sequencing studies. This relatively simple change would enable large-scale data-driven approaches to dissect relationships among race, socio-economic factors, and disease.",

    "abstract": "The current global pandemic COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in millions of infections worldwide in a few months. Global efforts to tackle this situation have produced a tremendous body of genomic data, which can be used for tracing transmission routes, characterization of isolates, and monitoring variants with potential for unusual virulence. Several groups have analyzed these genomes using different approaches. However, as new data become available, the research community needs a pipeline to perform a set of routine analyses, that can quickly incorporate new genome sequences and update the analysis reports. We developed a programmatic tool, CoVa, with this objective. It is a fast, accurate and user-friendly utility to perform a variety of genome analyses on hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Using CoVa, we define a modified sequence typing nomenclature and identify sites under positive selection. Further analysis identified some peptides and sites showing geographical patterns of selection. Specifically, we show differences in sequence type distribution between sequences from India and those from the rest of the world. We also show that several sites show signatures of positive selection uniquely in sequences from India. Preliminary evolutionary analysis, using features that will be incorporated into CoVa in the near future, show a mutation rate of 7.4 x 10-4 substitutions/site/year, confirm a temporal signal with a November 2019 origin of SARS-CoV-2, and a heterogeneity in the geographical distribution of Indian samples.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe world is going through the critical phase of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by human coronavirus, SARS-CoV2. Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon.\n\nMethodsTo have an idea of the global changes in 5 and 3-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by  RBPmap and  RNA22 v2 respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue.\n\nResultsWe identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs.\n\nConclusionOur results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.",

Mild cognitive impairment is also a significant risk factor to the onset of AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images have become widely used to detection and understand the natural progression not only AD but also neurodegenerative disorders. For this purpose, construct a reliable cognitive normal database is important. However, difference in magnetic field strength, sex and age between normal database and evaluation data-set can be affect the accuracy of detection and evaluation of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nTo solve this problem, we suggest a harmonized Z-score considering differences filed strength, sex and age derived from large cognitive normal subjects dataset ((1235 subjects)) including 1.5 T and 3T T1 brain MRI. And we evaluate our harmonized Z-score of discriminative power of AD, and classification accuracy between stable MCI and progressive MCI.\n\nThe harmonized Z-score of hippocampus achieved high accuracy (AUC=0.96) for detection AD and moderate accuracy (AUC=0.70) for classification stable MCI and progressive MCI. Theses results shows that our method not only can detect AD with high accuracy and high generalization capability, but also can be valid to classify stable MCI and progressive MCI.",

    "abstract": "The rostral forelimb area (RFA) in the rat is considered to be a premotor cortical region based primarily on its efferent projections to the primary motor cortex. The purpose of the present study was to identify corticocortical connections of RFA, and to describe the relative strength of connections with other cortical areas. This will allow us to better understand the broader cortical network in which RFA participates, and thus, determine its function in motor behavior. In the present study, the RFA of adult male Long-Evans rats (n=6) was identified using intracortical microstimulation techniques and injected with the tract tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). In post-mortem tissue, location of BDA-labeled terminal boutons and neuronal somata were plotted and superimposed on cortical field boundaries. The results demonstrated that the RFA has dense to moderate reciprocal connections with primary motor cortex, the frontal cortex medial and lateral to RFA, primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and lateral somatosensory areas. Importantly, S1 connections were dense to moderate in dysgranular zones, but sparse to negligible in granular zones. Cortical connections of RFA in rat are strikingly similar to cortical connections of the ventral premotor cortex in non-human primates, suggesting that these areas share similar functions.",

Previous studies have identified compounds that confer photosensitivity onto vertebrate TRPA1. However, the pharmacology of TRPA1-mediated non-visual photosensation remains poorly understood. To identify novel compounds that affect this process, we screened a large chemical library for compounds that increased light-elicited motor activity in larval zebrafish. We found structurally diverse hit compounds that were photoreactive and produced specific behavioral phenotypes. A subset of these compounds required functional TRPA1 to produce behavioral phenotypes in vivo. These findings provide novel prototype compounds for controlling TRPA1 with light and improve our understanding of non-visual TRPA1-mediated photosensation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a crucial role in binding the human cell receptor ACE2 that is required for viral entry. Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. A negatively charged tetrapeptide (GluGluLeuGlu) is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites. We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site. Our work enhances understanding of the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, which may aid the design of therapeutics for COVID-19 infection.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY TOC:\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex showing the polybasic cleavage sites\n\nC_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells are recognized drivers of aging-related decline in organ function, but deciphering the biology of senescence in vivo has been hindered by the paucity of tools to track and isolate senescent cells in tissues1-4. Deleting senescent cells from transgenic murine models have demonstrated therapeutic benefits in numerous age-related diseases5-11, but the identity, behavior, and function of the senescent cells deleted in vivo remain elusive. We engineered an ultra-sensitive reporter of p16INK4a, a biomarker of senescence12, to isolate and track p16INK4a+ cells in vivo. Surprisingly, p16INK4a+ mesenchymal cells appear in the basement membrane adjacent to epithelial progenitors in the lung shortly after birth, and these cells demonstrate senescent characteristics in vivo and ex vivo. Transcriptomic analysis of p16INK4a+ mesenchymal cells from non-aged lungs demonstrates a transition to a secretory phenotype upon airway epithelial injury. Heterotypic 3D organoid assays show that injured p16INK4a+ mesenchymal cells enhance epithelial progenitor proliferation, and we identified EREG as a novel airway progenitor mitogen produced by the secretory p16INK4a+ mesenchymal cells. Mesenchymal-specific deletion of the p16INK4a gene abrogates features of senescence in vivo, but also attenuates normal epithelial repair. Thus, p16INK4a+ mesenchymal cells can act as sentinels for the airway epithelial stem cell niche, poised to transition to a senescence-associated secretory phenotype to support barrier repair. Our data identify possible cellular targets in vivo for a rapidly growing list of senolytic therapies, but also raises important questions about the hidden cost of targeting senescent cells present in normal organs.",

Microbial, pharmacological, or optogenetic activation of Trpa1+EECs directly stimulates vagal sensory ganglia and activates cholinergic enteric neurons through 5-HT. We identified a subset of indole derivatives of tryptophan catabolism produced by E. tarda and other gut microbes that potently activates zebrafish EEC Trpa1 signaling and also directly stimulates human and mouse Trpa1 and intestinal 5-HT secretion.

    "abstract": "IntroductionFreezing of all good quality embryos and their transfer in subsequent cycles, named the freeze-all strategy (FAS), is widely used for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) prevention. Indeed, it increases live birth rates among high responders and prevents preterm birth and small for gestational age. Consequently, why shouldnt we extend it to all?\n\nMaterials and methodsA retrospective and monocentric study was conducted between January 2008 and January 2018 comparing the cumulative live birth rates (CLBR) between patients having undergone FAS and a control group using fresh embryo transfer (FET) and having at least one frozen embryo available. Analyses were made for the entire cohort (population 1) and for different subgroups according to confounding factors selected by a logistic regression (population 3), and to the BELRAP (Belgian Register for Assisted Procreation) criteria (population 2).\n\nResults2216 patients were divided into two groups: Freeze all (FA), 233 patients and control (C), 1983 patients. The CLBR was 50.2% vs 58.1% P=0.021 for population 1 and 53.2% vs 63.3% P=0.023 for population 2, including 124 cases and 1241 controls. The CLBR stayed in favour of the C group: 70.1% vs 55.9% P=0.03 even when confounding variables were excluded (FA and C group respectively 109 and 770 patients). The median time to become pregnant was equally in favour of the C group with a median of 5 days against 61 days.\n\nConclusionsCLBR is significantly lower in the FA group compared to the C group with a longer time to become pregnant. Nevertheless, the CLBR in the FA group remains excellent and superior to that observed in previous studies with similar procedures and population. These results confirm the high efficiency of FAS but underline the necessity to restrict the strategy to selected cases.",
