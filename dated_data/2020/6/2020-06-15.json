    "abstract": "The last 20 years have seen a surge in scientific activity and promising results in the study of aging and longevity. Many researchers have focused on telomeres, which are composed of a series of TTAGGG repeat nucleotide sequences at the ends of each chromosome. Measurements of the length of these telomere strands show that they decrease in length with increasing age, leading many authors to propose that when the length of these telomere strands decreases sufficiently, the cells enter into a state of replicative senescence, eventually leading to disease and death. These ideas are supported by evidence that short telomere length is correlated with increased mortality. In this paper, we extend this idea to make an actual calculation of the predicted mortality rate caused by short telomere length induced senescence (STLIS). We derive a simple equation for the mathematical relationship between telomere length and mortality rate. Using only 3 parameters based on telomere length measurement data of Canadians, we have calculated both the magnitude and the age dependence of the mortality rate, for both men and women. We show that these calculated data are in good quantitative agreement with the actual number of Canadians that die. This agreement provides strong evidence (but not proof) that the mechanism of STLIS plays an important role in the major diseases of aging (e.g., cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and diabetes mellitus) which dominate human mortality. This result represents significant progress in our understanding the factors behind the cause of aging.",

    "abstract": "The developmental origins and evolutionary histories of cell types, tissues and organ systems contribute to the ways in which their dysfunction leads to disease. In mammals for example, the nature and extent of maternal-fetal interactions, how those interactions develop, and their evolutionary history likely influence diseases of pregnancy such as infertility and preterm birth. Here we show genes that evolved to be expressed at the maternal-fetal interface in Eutherian ( Placental) mammals play essential roles in the evolution of pregnancy and are associated with immune system disorders and preterm birth. Among these genes is the transcription factor HAND2, which suppresses estrogen signaling, an innovation of Eutherians, thereby allowing blastocyst implantation. We found that HAND2 is dynamically expressed in the decidua throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, gradually decreasing to reach a low at term. HAND2 regulates a small but distinct set of target genes in endometrial stromal fibroblasts including the cytokine IL15, which was also dynamically expressed throughout the menstrual cycle and gestation, and promoted the migration of natural killer cells and extravillous cytotrophoblasts. Remarkably, we found that the HAND2 promoter loops to a distal enhancer containing SNPs implicated in the regulation of gestation length and birth weight. Collectively, these data connect HAND2 expression at the maternal-fetal interface with the evolution of implantation and gestation length regulation, and preterm birth.",

    "abstract": "Genome size of plants has long piqued the interest of researchers due to the vast differences among organisms. However, the mechanisms that drive size differences have yet to be fully understood. Two important contributing factors to genome size are expansions of repetitive elements, such as transposable elements (TEs), and whole-genome duplications (WGD). Although studies have found correlations between genome size and both TE abundance and polyploidy, these studies typically test for these patterns within a genus or species. The plant order Brassicales provides an excellent system to test if genome size evolution patterns are consistent across larger time scales, as there are numerous WGDs. This order is also home to one of the smallest plant genomes, Arabidopsis thaliana - chosen as the model plant system for this reason - as well as to species with very large genomes. With new methods that allow for TE characterization from low-coverage genome shotgun data and 71 taxa across the Brassicales, we find no correlation between genome size and TE content, and more surprisingly we identify no significant changes to TE landscape following WGD.",

    "abstract": "A novel isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.",

Unfortunately, an effective vaccine or therapeutic is not currently available, resulting in tens of thousands of hospitalizations per year. In an effort to discover a protective antibody against HPIV3, we screened the B cell repertoires from peripheral blood, tonsils, or spleen from healthy children and adults. These analyses yielded five monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralized HPIV3 in vitro. These HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies targeted two non-overlapping epitopes of the HPIV3 F protein, with most targeting the apex. Importantly, prophylactic administration of one of these antibodies, named PI3-E12, resulted in potent protection against HPIV3 infection in cotton rats. Additionally, PI3-E12 could also be used therapeutically to suppress HPIV3 in immunocompromised animals. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of PI3-E12 for the prevention or treatment of HPIV3 in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.",

    "abstract": "Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is an extracellular pathogen that causes polymerization of actin filaments at the site of bacterial attachment, referred to as  actin pedestals. Actin polymerization in the pedestal was believed to be solely regulated via the Nck-WASp-Arp2/3 pathway before formins were recently discovered to be associated with pedestals. Herein, we explored the collaborative role of formins in contributing to EPEC pedestal formation. In particular, we discovered that the formin FHOD1 preferentially localized to the pedestal base and its knockdown drastically reduced pedestal surface area. The pedestal localization of formin FHOD1 was found to be dependent on Tir phosphorylation at Y474, and on FHOD1 phosphorylation at Y99 from host Src family kinases (SFKs). Interestingly, differences in Arp2/3 and FHOD1 dynamics were observed. In large pedestals, Arp3 was nearly absent, but FHOD1 levels were high, suggesting that Arp2/3 and formins were segregated temporally. In line with this observation, as the pedestals grew in size, FHOD1 localization increased, while Arp3 localization decreased along the pedestals. Together, our results suggest that EPEC employs multiple actin nucleators that act at different stages of pedestal formation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=171 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/149344v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1711602org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c060dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@914447org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@119cf28_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

A total of 11 strains of Papiliotrema maritimi sp. nov. were obtained from macrophytes leaves collected in south Brazil. Papiliotrema maritimi sp. nov. differs by 12, 15, 25, 25, 25 and 29 substitutions in the D1/D2 domain from the related species P. fuscus, P. japonica, P. siamense, P. nemorosus, P. bandonii, and P. perniciosus, respectively. Concerning the ITS region, there are 11 substitutions and 52 or more substitutions when compared to P. teanensis and its closest relatives.

    "abstract": "Rhizobia are ecologically important, facultative plant symbiotic microbes. In nature there exists large variability in the association of rhizobial strains and host plant of the same species. Here, we evaluated whether plant and rhizobial genotypes influence the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium following perception of host plant. RNA-sequencing of the model rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti exposed to root exudates or luteolin was performed in a combination of three S. meliloti strains and three Medicago sativa varieties. The response to root exudates involved hundreds of changes in the rhizobium transcriptome. Of the differentially expressed genes, expression of 35% were influenced by strain genotype, 16% by the plant genotype, and 29% by strain x host plant genotype interactions. We also examined the response of a hybrid S. meliloti strain, in which the symbiotic megaplasmid (~ 20% of the genome) was mobilized between two of the above-mentioned strains. Dozens of genes resulted up-regulated in the hybrid strain, indicative of nonadditive variation in the transcriptome. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that transcriptional responses of rhizobia upon perception of legumes is influenced by the genotypes of both symbiotic partners, and their interaction, suggesting a wide genetic spectrum of partner choice selection in plant-rhizobium symbiosis.",

Even the  wild-type MG1655 and BW25113 strains can differ significantly in their ability to take up such dyes. We illustrate the highly differential uptake of our dyes into strains with particular lesions in, or overexpressed levels of, three particular transporters or transporter components (yhjV, yihN, and tolC).

Cerebellum is involved in a wide range of nonmotor cognitive functions and mental disorders. An important question thus centers on the extent to which cerebellar function can be linked to transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology. Here, this question is investigated using partial least squares to identify latent dimensions linking cerebellar connectome properties as assessed by macroscale spatial gradients of connectivity to a large set of clinical and behavioral measures in 198 participants across diagnostic categories. This analysis reveals significant correlated patterns of cerebellar connectivity gradients and behavioral measures that could be represented into four latent dimensions: general psychopathology, general lack of attention regulation, internalizing symptoms, and dysfunctional memory. Each dimension is associated with a distinct spatial pattern of cerebellar connectivity gradients. These findings highlight the relevance of cerebellar connectivity as a necessity for the study and classification of transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular entities are characterized by exquisite spatial patterns, intimately related to the functions they perform. Oftentimes these patterns emerge as periodic structures with a well-defined characteristic scale. A candidate mechanism to explain their origins was early introduced by Alan Turing through the interaction and diffusion of two so called morphogens. Unfortunately, most available evidence for Turing patterns in biology is usually obscured by the tangled nature of regulatory phenomena, making difficult to validate Turing\u2019s proposal in developmental processes. Here we follow a different approach, by designing synthetic genetic circuits in engineered E. coli strains that implement the essential activator-inhibitor motif (AIM) using a two-cell consortium. The two diffusible compartments are one cell type (activator, small-diffusion component) and a small signal molecule (a homoserine lactone, acting as the fast-diffusing inhibitor). Using both experimental results, we show that the AIM is capable of generating diffusion-induced instabilities leading to regular spatial patterns. The artificial construction taken here can help validate developmental theories and identify universal properties underpinning biological pattern formation. The implications of the work for the area of synthetic developmental biology are outlined.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry glycoproteomics is rapidly maturing, allowing unprecedented insights into the diversity and functions of protein glycosylation. However, quantitative glycoproteomics remains challenging. We developed GlypNirO, an automated software pipeline which integrates the complementary outputs of Byonic and Proteome Discoverer to allow high-throughput automated quantitative glycoproteomic data analysis. The output of GlypNirO is clearly structured, allowing manual interrogation, and is also appropriate for input into diverse statistical workflows. We used GlypNirO to analyse a published plasma glycoproteome dataset and identified changes in site-specific N- and O-glycosylation occupancy and structure associated with hepatocellular carcinoma as putative biomarkers of disease.",

    "abstract": "Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 4, the LPS receptor, plays a central role in the control of leptospirosis and absence of TLR4 results in lethal infection in mice. Because human TLR4 does not sense the atypical leptospiral-LPS, we hypothesized that TLR4/MD-2 humanized transgenic mice (huTLR4) may be more susceptible to leptospirosis than wild-type mice, and thus may constitute a model of acute human leptospirosis. Therefore, we infected huTLR4 mice, which express human TLR4 but not murine TLR4, with a high but sublethal dose of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni FioCruz (Leptospira) in comparison to C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) and, as a control, a congenic strain in which the tlr4 coding sequences are deleted (muTLR4Lps-del). We show that the huTLR4 gene is fully functional in the murine background. We found that dissemination of Leptospira in blood, shedding in urine, colonization of the kidney and overall kinetics of leptospirosis progression is equivalent between WT and huTLR4 C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, inflammation of the kidney appeared to be subdued in huTLR4 compared to WT mice in that we observed less infiltrates of mononuclear lymphocytes, less innate immune markers and no relevant differences in fibrosis markers. Contrary to our hypothesis, huTLR4 mice showed less inflammation and kidney pathology, and are not more susceptible to leptospirosis than WT mice. This study is significant as it indicates that one intact TLR4 gene, be it mouse or human, is necessary to control acute leptospirosis.\n\nContribution to the fieldDifferences of recognition exist between mouse and human TLR4, in that the anchor of LPS in the outer membrane of Leptospira (LipidA) activates murine, but not human TLR4. We hypothesized that if human TLR4 does not sense leptospiral-LPS, then transgenic mice in which murine TLR4 was replaced with human TLR4, should be more susceptible to Leptospira dissemination as compared to congenic wild-type mice, which could result in a more robust inflammatory response and pathology in the kidney. However, we found that impaired sensing of leptospiral-LPS in huTLR4 mice did not affect overall infection in comparison to wild-type mice and does not result in increased pathology of the kidney. Our study indicates that rather than leptospiral-LPS sensing, the presence of a fully functional TLR4 receptor is necessary to control acute leptospirosis.",
