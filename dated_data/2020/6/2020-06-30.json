    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate genetic structures and expression of blaOXA-58 gene in five Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates recovered from two hospitals in southern Vietnam during 2012-2014. A. baumannii isolates were identified by automated microbiology systems and confirmed by PCR. All isolates were characterized as multidrug resistant by antimicrobials testing using the disk diffusion method. Four imipenem susceptible and one non-susceptible isolates (MIC > 32 g.ml-1) were identified by E-test. PCR amplification of blaOXA-58 gene upstream and downstream sequences revealed the presence of ISAba3 at both locations in one multidrug resistant isolate. Semi quantitation of blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-58 gene expression was performed by the 2-{Delta}{Delta}Ct method. The blaOXA-51 gene expression of five isolates showed little difference but the isolate bearing ISAba3-blaOXA-58-ISAba3 exhibited significant higher blaOXA-58 mRNA level. Higher {beta}-lactamases activity in periplasmic than cytoplasmic fraction was found in most isolates. The isolate overexpressing blaOXA-58 gene possessed very high periplasmic enzyme activity. In conclusion, the A. baumannii isolate bearing ISAba3-blaOXA-58 gene exhibited high resistance to imipenem, corresponding to an overexpression of blaOXA-58 gene and very high periplasmic {beta}-lactamases activity.",

    "abstract": "The identification of RNAs that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RNA-BPs) using techniques such as \"Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation\" (CLIP) has revolutionized the genome-wide discovery of RNA-BP RNA targets. Among the different versions of CLIP that have been developed, the use of photoactivable nucleoside analogs incorporated into cellular RNA has resulted in high efficiency photoactivable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP). Nonetheless, PAR-CLIP has not yet been applied in prokaryotes. To determine if PAR-CLIP can be used in prokaryotes, we determined suitable conditions for the incorporation of 4-thiouridine (4SU), a photoactivable nucleoside, into E. coli RNA, and for the isolation of crosslinked RNA. Applying this technique to Hfq, a well-characterized regulator of small RNA (sRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions, we showed that PAR-CLIP identified most of the known sRNA targets of Hfq, as well as functionally relevant sites of Hfq-mRNA interactions at nucleotide resolution. Based on our findings, PAR-CLIP represents an improved method to identify both the RNAs and the specific regulatory sites that are recognized by RNA-BPs in prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular injury is a common pathological feature of a spectrum of neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, Alzheimers disease (AD), as well as aging. Vascular manifestations among these conditions are similar indeed, including the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, whether there is a common molecular mechanism underlying the vascular changes among these conditions remains elusive. Here, we report secondary transcriptomic analysis on cerebrovascular cells based single-cell RNA-seq datasets of mouse models of mild TBI and aging, with a focus on endothelial cells and pericytes. We identify several molecular signatures commonly found between mTBI and aging vasculature, including Adamts1, Rpl23a, Tmem252, Car4, Serpine2, and Ndnf in endothelial cells, and Rps29 and Sepp1 in pericytes. These markers may represent the shared endophenotype of microvascular injury and be considered as cerebrovascular injury responsive genes. Additionally, pathway analysis on differentially expressed genes demonstrated alterations in common pathways between mTBI and aging, including vascular development and extracellular matrix pathways in endothelial cells. Hence, our analysis suggests that cerebrovascular injury triggered by different neurological conditions may share common molecular signatures, which may only be detected at the single-cell transcriptome level.",

We have mapped the subcellular distribution of the lens aquaporins (AQP0, 1, & 5) in these water influx and efflux zones and investigated how their membrane location is affected by changes in tension applied to the lens by the zonules.\n\nMethodsImmunohistochemistry using AQP antibodies was performed on axial sections obtained from rat lenses that had been removed from the eye and then fixed, or were fixed in situ to maintain zonular tension. Zonular tension was pharmacologically modulated by applying either tropicamide (increased), or pilocarpine (decreased). AQP labelling was visualized using confocal microscopy.\n\nResultsModulation of zonular tension had no effect on AQP1 or AQP0 labelling in either the water efflux, or influx zones. In contrast, AQP5 labelling changed from membranous to cytoplasmic in response to both mechanical and pharmacologically induced reductions in zonular tension in both the efflux zone, and anterior (but not posterior) influx zone associated with the lens sutures.\n\nConclusionsAltering zonular tension dynamically regulates the membrane trafficking of AQP5 in the efflux and anterior influx zones to potentially change the magnitude of circulating water fluxes in the lens.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCell fate acquisition is a fundamental developmental process in all multicellular organisms. Yet, much is unknown regarding how a cell traverses the pathway from stem cell to terminal differentiation. Advances in single cell genomics1 hold promise for unraveling developmental mechanisms2\u20133 in tissues4, organs5\u20136, and organisms7\u20138. However, lineage tracing can be challenging for some tissues9 and integration of high-quality datasets is often necessary to detect rare cell populations and developmental states10,11. Here, we harmonized single cell mRNA sequencing data from over 110,000 cells to construct a comprehensive atlas for a stereotypically developing organ with indeterminate growth, the Arabidopsis root. To test the utility of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for two key transcriptional regulators at single cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow. Although both transcription factors are required for early specification of cell identity12, our results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway acting in mature cells to specify endodermal identity, for which SHORTROOT is required. Uncovering the architecture of this pathway will provide insight into specification and stabilization of the endodermis, a tissue analogous to the mammalian epithelium. Thus, the atlas is a pivotal advance for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate organ development in space and time.Competing Interest StatementPNB is the co-founder and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of Hi Fidelity Genetics, Inc, a company that works on crop root growth.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Queens of many social hymenoptera keep sperm alive within their specialized storage organ, the spermatheca, for years, defying the typical trade-off between lifespan and reproduction. However, whether honey bee queens experience a trade-off between reproduction and immunity is unknown, and the biochemical processes underlying sperm viability are poorly understood. Here, we survey quality metrics and viral loads of honey bee queens from nine genetic sources. Queens rated as  failed by beekeepers had lower sperm viability, fewer sperm, and higher levels of SBV and BQCV. Quantitative proteomics on N = 123 spermathecal fluid samples shows, after accounting for sperm count, health status, and apiary effects, five spermathecal fluid proteins significantly correlating with sperm viability: odorant binding protein (OBP)14, lysozyme, serpin 88Ea, artichoke, and heat-shock protein (HSP)10. The significant negative correlation of lysozyme--a conserved immune effector--with sperm viability is consistent with a reproduction vs. immunity trade-off in honey bee queens.",

    "abstract": "There are now many environments in which humans need to monitor moving displays and only rarely act, such as train control and driving autonomous vehicles; lapses of attention in these circumstances can have tragic consequences. Problematically, we know that it is difficult to sustain attention under these monitoring or vigilance conditions and performance drops: when target events are rare, we tend to miss them, or are slower to respond. This  rare target effect becomes more marked with longer tasks, known as a vigilance decrement. Despite the importance, we still have limited understanding of how the brain processes information during monitoring, particularly with dynamic stimuli, and how this processing changes when attention lapses. Here, we designed a multiple-object monitoring (MOM) paradigm that required sustained attention to dynamic stimuli, and used multivariate analyses of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to examine how the neural representation of the information in the display varied with target frequency and time on the task. Behavioural performance decreased over time for the rare target (monitoring) condition, but not for the frequent target (active) condition. This change was mirrored in the neural results: under monitoring conditions, there was weaker coding of the critical distance between objects during time periods when vigilance decrements in performance occurred. There was also weaker informational connectivity between peri-occipital and peri-frontal brain areas in rare versus frequent target conditions. We developed a new analysis which used the strength of information decoding to predict whether the participant was going to miss the target on a given trial. We could predict behavioural errors more than a second before they occurred. This provides a first step in developing methods to predict and pre-empt behavioural errors due to lapses in attention and provides new insight into how vigilance decrements are reflected in information coding in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Gambling and substance use disorders are highly comorbid. Both clinical populations are impulsive and exhibit risky decision-making. Drug-associated cues have long been known to facilitate habitual drug-seeking, and the salient audiovisual cues embedded within modern gambling products may like-wise encourage problem gambling. The dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are exquisitely sensitive to drugs of abuse, uncertain rewards, and reward-paired cues, and may therefore be the common neural substrate mediating synergistic features of both disorders. To test this hypothesis, we first gained specific inhibitory control over VTA dopamine neurons by transducing a floxed inhibitory DREADD (AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry) in rats expressing Cre recombinase in tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. We then trained rats in our cued rat gambling task (crGT), inhibiting dopamine neurons throughout task acquisition and performance, before allowing them to self-administer cocaine in the same diurnal period as crGT sessions. The trajectories of addiction differ in women and men, and the dopamine system may differ functionally across the sexes, therefore we used male and female rats here. We found that inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons decreased cue-induced risky choice and reduced motor impulsivity in males, but surprisingly, enhanced risky decision making in females. Inhibiting VTA dopamine neurons also prevented cocaine-induced deficits in decision making in both sexes, but nevertheless drove all animals to consume more cocaine. These findings show that chronic dampening of dopamine signalling can have both protective and deleterious effects on addiction-relevant behaviours, depending on biological sex and dependent variable of interest.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTMany cell surface and secreted proteins are modified by the covalent addition of glycans that play an important role in the development of multicellular organisms. These glycan modifications enable communication between cells and the extracellular matrix via interactions with specific glycan-binding lectins and the regulation of receptor-mediated signaling. Aberrant protein glycosylation has been associated with the development of several muscular diseases suggesting essential glycan- and lectin-mediated functions in myogenesis and muscle development but our molecular understanding of the precise glycans, catalytic enzymes and lectins involved remain only partially understood. Here, we quantified dynamic remodeling of the membrane-associated proteome during a time-course of myogenesis in cell culture. We observed wide-spread changes in the abundance of several important lectins and enzymes facilitating glycan biosynthesis. Glycomics-based quantification of released N-linked glycans confirmed remodeling of the glycome consistent with the regulation of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases responsible for their formation including a previously unknown di-galactose-to-sialic acid switch supporting a functional role of these glycoepitopes in myogenesis. Furthermore, dynamic quantitative glycoproteomic analysis with multiplexed stable isotope labelling and analysis of enriched glycopeptides with multiple fragmentation approaches identified glycoproteins modified by these regulated glycans including several integrins and growth factor receptors. Myogenesis was also associated with the regulation of several lectins most notably the up-regulation of galectin-1 (LGALS1). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Lgals1 inhibited differentiation and myotube formation suggesting an early functional role of galectin-1 in the myogenic program. Importantly, similar changes in N-glycosylation and the up-regulation of galectin-1 during postnatal skeletal muscle development were observed in mice. Treatment of new-born mice with recombinant adeno-associated viruses to overexpress galectin-1 in the musculature resulted in enhanced muscle mass. Our data form a valuable resource to further understand the glycobiology of myogenesis and will aid the development of intervention strategies to promote healthy muscle development or regeneration.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsAAV\nadeno-associated virusANOVAanalysis of variationCBDscarbohydrate binding domainsCDGscongenital disorders of glycosylationCRISPRclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatsCIDcollisional induced dissociationDTTdithiothreitolECMextracellular matrixEThcDelectron transfer dissociation with higher collisional dissociation supplemental activationFBSfetal bovine serumFDRfalse discovery rateFAformic acidGBPsglycan-binding proteinsHCDhigher collisional dissociationHILIChydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographyMCSmultiple cloning siteMeCNacetonitrileNMJneuromuscular junctionsPCAprincipal component analysisPGCporous graphitized carbonPSMpeptide spectral matchTEABtriethylammonium bicarbonateTFAtrifluoroacetic acidTMTtandem mass tagsView Full Text",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome sequencing is being used routinely in clinical and research applications, but subsequent variant interpretation pipelines can vary widely. A systematic approach for exploring parameter choices and selection plays an important role in designing robust pipelines for specific clinical applications.\n\nResultsWe present a framework to be applied in scenarios with limited data whereby expert knowledge informs pipeline refinement. Starting from initial reference variant interpretation pipelines with commonly used parameters, we derived pipelines by perturbing the parameters one by one to determine which parameters can yield meaningful changes in a pipelines performance. We updated the reference pipeline by fixing the value of parameters which have small impact on the pipelines performance. Then we conducted new rounds of perturbation as the process converged, yielding a stable pipeline which is robust. We applied the framework for genetic disease prediction in de-identified exomes from a cohort of 138 individuals with rare Mendelian inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) and systematically explored how perturbing different parameters affected the pipelines sensitivity and specificity. For this application, we perturbed commonly used parameters in variant interpretation pipelines, including choices of genes, variant callers, transcript models, databases of allele frequencies, databases of curated disease variants, and tools for variant impact prediction. Our analyses showed that choice of variant callers, variant impact prediction tools, MAF threshold, and MAF databases can meaningfully alter results from a pipeline. This work informs the development of exome analysis pipelines designed for newborn metabolic disorder screening and suggests the general application of perturbation analysis in genome interpretation pipeline design.",

    "abstract": "Biological membranes owe their strength and low permeability to the phospholipid bilayers at their core. Membrane strength is determined by the energetics and dynamics of membrane pores, whose tension-dependent nucleation and growth leads to rupture. Creation of nanoscale membrane pores is central to exocytosis, trafficking and other processes fundamental to life that require breaching of secure plasma or organelle membranes, and is the basis for biotechnologies using drug delivery, delivery of genetic material for gene editing and antimicrobial peptides. A prevailing view from seminal electroporation and membrane rupture studies is that pore growth and bilayer rupture are controlled by macroscopically long-lived metastable defect states that precede fully developed pores. It was argued that defect nucleation becomes rate-limiting at high tensions, explaining the exponential tension-dependence of rupture times [E. Evans et al., Biophys. J. 85, 2342-2350 (2003)]. Here we measured membrane pore free energies and bilayer rupture using highly coarse-grained simulations that probe very long time scales. We find no evidence of metastable pore states. At lower tensions, small hydrophobic pores mature into large hydrophilic pores on the pathway to rupture, with classical tension dependence of rupture times. Above a critical tension membranes rupture directly from a small hydrophobic pore, and rupture times depend exponentially on tension. Thus, we recover the experimentally reported regimes, but the origin of the high tension exponential regime is unrelated to macroscopically long-lived pre-pore defects. It arises because hydrophilic pores cannot exist above a critical tension, leading to radically altered pore dynamics and rupture kinetics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Indeed, \u03b2-catenin regulates Mitf-M transcription, the master regulator of this lineage. The first wave of melanocytes to colonize the skin is directly derived from neural crest cells, while a small number of second wave melanocytes is derived from Schwann-cell precursors (SCPs). We investigated the influence of \u03b2-catenin in the development of melanocytes of the first and second waves by generating mice expressing a constitutively active form of \u03b2-catenin in cells expressing tyrosinase. Constitutive activation of \u03b2-catenin did not affect the development of truncal melanoblasts, but led to a marked hyperpigmentation of the paws. By activating \u03b2-catenin at various stages of development (E8.5-E11.5), we showed that the activation of \u03b2-catenin in bipotent SCPs favored melanoblast specification at the expense of Schwann cells in the limbs within a specific temporal window. In addition, hyperactivation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway repressed FoxD3 expression, which is necessary for Schwann cell development, through Mitf-M activation. In conclusion, \u03b2-catenin overexpression promotes SCP cell-fate decisions towards the melanocyte lineage.Summary statement Activation of \u03b2-catenin in bipotent Schwann-cell precursors during a specific developmental window, induces MITF and represses FoxD3 to promote melanoblast cell fate at the expense of Schwann cells in limbs.View Full Text",

In addition, we also found the DSBs could be amplified in mouse oocytes, and the amplification could be inhibited by Rad51 inhibitor IBR2 and DNA replication inhibitor ddATP. Lastly, we found the DSB repair was relatively inefficiency in hybrid mouse oocytes compared with that of the purebred mouse oocytes. We found DSBs could induce BIR more easier in hybrid mouse oocytes, indicating the DNA repair in oocytes could be affected by the sequence differences between homologous chromatids. In summary, our results indicated that the condensed chromatin configuration in late G2 phase and the sequence similarity between broken DNA and template DNA are causing factors of BIR in mammalian genome, and the DNA damage could be amplified in late G2 phase cells.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important cause of multidrug resistant infections worldwide. Understanding the virulence mechanisms of K. pneumoniae is a priority and timely to design new therapeutics. Here we demonstrate that K. pneumoniae limits the SUMOylation of host proteins in epithelial cells and macrophages (mouse and human) to subvert cell innate immunity. Mechanistically, in lung epithelial cells Klebsiella increases the levels of the deSUMOylase SENP2 in the cytosol by affecting its K48-ubiquitylation and its subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome. This is dependent on Klebsiella preventing the NEDDylation of the Cullin-1 subunit of the ubiquitin ligase complex E3-SCF{beta}-TrCP by exploiting the CSN5 deNEDDylase. Klebsiella induces the expression of CSN5 in an EGFR-PI3K-AKT-ERK-GSK3{beta} signalling pathway dependent manner. In macrophages, TLR4-TRAM-TRIF induced type-I IFN via IFNAR1-controlled signalling mediates Klebsiella-triggered decrease in the levels of SUMOylation via let-7 miRNAs. Our results revealed the crucial role played by Klebsiella polysaccharides, the capsule and the LPS O-polysaccharide, to decrease the levels of SUMO-conjugated proteins in epithelial cells and macrophages. Klebsiella-induced decrease in SUMOylation promotes infection by limiting the activation of inflammatory responses and increasing intracellular survival in macrophages.\n\nIMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae has been singled out as an urgent threat to human health due to the increasing isolation of strains resistant to \"last line\" antimicrobials, narrowing the treatment options against Klebsiella infections. Unfortunately, at present, we cannot identify candidate compounds in late-stage development for treatment of multidrug Klebsiella infections; this pathogen is exemplary of the mismatch between unmet medical needs and the current antimicrobial research and development pipeline. Furthermore, there is still limited evidence on K. pneumoniae pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular level in the context of the interactions between bacterial pathogens and their hosts. In this research, we have uncovered a sophisticated strategy employed by Klebsiella to subvert the activation of immune defences by controlling the modification of proteins. Our research may open opportunities to develop new therapeutics based on counteracting this Klebsiella-controlled immune evasion strategy.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphMosquito-borne viruses have recently spread globally, with major impacts on human health. Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged from obscurity in 2013 to spread from Asia to the South Pacific and the Americas, where millions of people were infected. For the first time, severe clinical manifestations, including Guillain Barre syndrome and defects to the fetuses of pregnant women, were detected. Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV evolved in Africa and later spread to Asia, and that the Asian lineage is responsible for the recent epidemics. However, the reasons for the sudden emergence of ZIKV remain incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence on other arboviruses like chikungunya and West Nile suggest the likelihood that viral mutations could be determinants of change in ZIKV transmission efficiency responsible for efficient spread. Using evolutionary analyses, we determined that four mutations, which occurred just before ZIKV introduction to the Americas, represent direct reversions of previous mutations that accompanied spread many decades ago from ZIKVs native Africa to Asia and early circulation there. Experimental infections of mosquitoes, human cells, and mice using ZIKV strains with and without these mutations demonstrated that the original mutations reduced fitness for urban transmission, while the reversions restored fitness, increasing epidemic risk. Overall, our findings include the three newly identified, transmission-adaptive ZIKV mutations, and demonstration that these and one identified previously restored fitness for epidemic transmission soon before introduction into the America. The initial mutations may have followed founder effects and/or drift when the virus was introduced into Asia, or could be related to changes on host or vector utilization within Asia.",

This generates a highly localized source of endogenous single-photon illumination that can be tailored to match the optimal opsin absorbance. Through neuronal and vascular stimulation in the live mouse brain, we demonstrate the utility of this technique to achieve more efficient opsin stimulation, without loss of cellular resolution. We also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the potential advantages and constrains of this methodology, with suggestions for future improvements.

Thus, novel strategies are desired to allocate sequencing resources in genotyped livestock populations such that the entire population can be sequenced or imputed efficiently.\n\nMethodsWe present two applications of linear programming models called LPChoose for sequencing resources allocation. The first application is to identify the minimum number of animals for sequencing while meeting the criteria that each haplotype in the population is contained in at least one of the animals selected for sequencing. The second is to sequence a fixed number of animals whose haplotypes include as large a proportion as possible of the haplotypes present in the population given a limited sequencing budget.\n\nResultsIn both applications LPChoose has similar or better performance than some other methods.

    "abstract": "Biological evolution exhibits an extraordinary capability to adapt organisms to their environments. The explanation for this often takes for granted that random genetic variation produces at least some beneficial phenotypic variation for natural selection to act on. Such genetic evolvability could itself be a product of evolution, but it is widely acknowledged that the immediate selective gains of evolvability are small on short timescales. So how do biological systems come to exhibit such extraordinary capacity to evolve? One suggestion is that adaptive phenotypic plasticity makes genetic evolution find adaptations faster. However, the need to explain the origin of adaptive plasticity puts genetic evolution back in the driving seat, and genetic evolvability remains unexplained. To better understand the interaction between plasticity and genetic evolvability, we simulate the evolution of phenotypes produced by gene-regulation network-based models of development. First, we show that the phenotypic variation resulting from genetic and environmental change are highly concordant. This is because phenotypic variation, regardless of its cause, occurs within the relatively specific space of possibilities allowed by development. Second, we show that selection for genetic evolvability results in the evolution of adaptive plasticity and vice versa. This linkage is essentially symmetric but, unlike genetic evolvability, the selective gains of plasticity are often substantial on short, including within-lifetime, timescales. Accordingly, we show that selection for phenotypic plasticity is, in general, the most efficient and results in the rapid evolution of high genetic evolvability. Thus, without overlooking the fact that adaptive plasticity is itself a product of genetic evolution, this shows how plasticity can influence adaptive evolution and helps explain the genetic evolvability observed in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTCentromeres are chromosomal regions that are crucial for chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis, and failed centromere formation can contribute to chromosomal anomalies. Despite this conserved function, centromeres differ significantly between and even within species. Thus far, systematic studies into the organization and evolution of fungal centromeres remain scarce. In this study, we identified the centromeres in each of the ten species of the fungal genus Verticillium and characterized their organization and evolution. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the centromere-specific histone CenH3 (ChIP-seq) and chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) followed by high-throughput sequencing identified eight conserved, large (\u223c150 kb), AT-, and repeat-rich regional centromeres that are embedded in heterochromatin in the plant pathogen V. dahliae. Using Hi-C, we similarly identified repeat-rich centromeres in the other Verticillium species. Strikingly, a single repetitive element is strongly associated with centromeric regions in some but not all Verticillium species. Extensive chromosomal rearrangements occurred during Verticillium evolution, yet only a minority could be linked to centromeres, suggesting that centromeres played a minor role in chromosomal evolution. Nevertheless, the size and organization of centromeres differ considerably between species, and centromere size was found to correlate with the genome-wide repeat content. Overall, our study highlights the contribution of repetitive elements to the diversity and rapid evolution of centromeres within the fungal genus Verticillium.IMPORTANCE The genus Verticillium contains ten species of plant-associated fungi, some of which are notorious pathogens. Verticillium species evolved by frequent chromosomal rearrangements that contribute to genome plasticity. Centromeres are instrumental for separation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis, and failed centromere functionality can lead to chromosomal anomalies. Here, we used a combination of experimental techniques to identify and characterize centromeres in each of the Verticillium species. Intriguingly, we could strongly associate a single repetitive element to the centromeres of some of the Verticillium species. The presence of this element in the centromeres coincides with increased centromere sizes and genome-wide repeat expansions. Collectively, our findings signify a role of repetitive elements in the function, organization and rapid evolution of centromeres in a set of closely related fungal species.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Accurate antibiotic susceptibility testing is essential for successful tuberculosis treatment. Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) based phenotypic susceptibility methods in detecting other aspects of antibiotic susceptibilities in bacteria. Duration and peak of antibiotic exposure, at or above the MIC required for killing the bacterial population, has emerged as another important factor for determining the antibiotic susceptibility. This is broadly defined as antibiotic tolerance. Antibiotic tolerance can further facilitate the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Currently there are limited methods to quantify antibiotic tolerance among clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. In this study, we develop a most-probable number (MPN) based minimum duration of killing (MDK) assay to quantify the spectrum of M. tuberculosis rifampicin susceptibility within subpopulations, based on time duration of rifampicin exposure required for killing the bacterial population. MDK90-99 and MDK99.99 defined as the minimum time duration of antibiotic exposure at or above MIC required for killing 90-99% and 99.99% of the initial (pre-treatment) bacterial population respectively. Results from the rifampicin MDK assay applied to 28 laboratory and clinical M. tuberculosis isolates showed that there is variation in rifampicin susceptibility among isolates. Rifampicin MDK99/99.99 time for isolates varied from less than 2 to 10 days. MDK duration was correlated with larger sub-populations of M. tuberculosis from clinical isolates that were rifampicin tolerant. Our study demonstrates the utility of MDK assays to measure the variation in antibiotic tolerance among clinical M. tuberculosis isolates and further expands clinically important aspects of antibiotic susceptibility testing.",

    "abstract": "Research efforts of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have focused on viral genome sequence analysis to understand how the virus spread across the globe. Here, we assess three recently identified SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Beijing from June 2020 and attempt to determine the origin of these genomes, made available in the GISAID database. The database contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world. Including the three new samples and excluding samples with missing annotations, we analyzed 7, 643 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using principal component analysis computed on a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index, we find that the newly discovered virus genomes from Beijing are in a genetic cluster that consists mostly of cases from Europe and South(east) Asia. The sequences of the new cases are most related to virus genomes from a small number of cases from China (March 2020), cases from Europe (February to early May 2020), and cases from South(east) Asia (May to June 2020). These findings could suggest that the original cases of this genetic cluster originated from China in March 2020 and were re-introduced to China by transmissions from samples from South(east) Asia between April and June 2020.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous, opportunistic fungal pathogen that kills almost 200,000 people worldwide each year. It is acquired when mammalian hosts inhale the infectious propagules; these are deposited in the lung and, in the context of immunocompromise, may disseminate to the brain and cause lethal meningoencephalitis. Once inside the host, C. neoformans undergoes a variety of adaptive processes, including secretion of virulence factors, expansion of a polysaccharide capsule that impedes phagocytosis, and the production of giant (Titan) cells. The transcription factor Pdr802 is one regulator of these responses to the host environment. Expression of the corresponding gene is highly induced under host-like conditions in vitro and is critical for C. neoformans dissemination and virulence in a mouse model of infection. Direct targets of Pdr802 include the quorum sensing proteins Pqp1, Opt1 and Liv3; the transcription factors Stb4, Zfc3 and Bzp4, which regulate cryptococcal brain infectivity and capsule thickness; the calcineurin targets Had1 and Crz1, important for cell wall remodeling and C. neoformans virulence; and additional genes related to resistance to host temperature and oxidative stress, and to urease activity. Notably, cryptococci engineered to lack Pdr802 showed a dramatic increase in Titan cells, which are not phagocytosed and have diminished ability to directly cross biological barriers. This explains the limited dissemination of pdr802 mutant cells to the central nervous system and the consequently reduced virulence of this strain. The role of Pdr802 as a negative regulator of Titan cell formation is thus critical for cryptococcal pathogenicity.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans presents a worldwide threat to human health, especially in the context of immunocompromise, and current antifungal therapy is hindered by cost, limited availability, and inadequate efficacy. After the infectious particle is inhaled, C. neoformans initiates a complex transcriptional program that integrates cellular responses and enables adaptation to the host lung environment. Here we describe the role of the transcription factor Pdr802 in the response to host conditions and its impact on C. neoformans virulence. We identified direct targets of Pdr802 and also discovered that it regulates cellular features that influence movement of this pathogen from the lung to the brain, where it causes fatal disease. These findings advance our understanding of a serious disease.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTTripterygium wilfordii is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) from family Celastraceae and celastrol is one of the strongest active ingredients belonging to friedelane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid, which has a large clinical application value of anti-tumor, immunosuppression, and obesity treatment. The first committed biosynthesis step of celastrol is the cyclization of 2, 3-oxidosqualene to friedelin, catalyzed by the oxidosqualene cyclase, while the rest of this pathway is still unclear. In this study, we reported a reference genome assembly of T. wilfordii with high-quality annotation by using a hybrid sequencing strategy (Nanopore, Bionano, Illumina HiSeq, and Pacbio), which obtained a 340.12 Mb total size and contig N50 reached 3.09 Mb. In addition, we successfully anchored 91.02% sequences into 23 pseudochromosomes using Hi-C technology and the super-scaffold N50 reached 13.03 Mb. Based on integration genome, transcriptom and metabolite analyses, as well as in vivo and in vitro enzyme assays, two CYP450 genes, TwCYP712K1 and TwCYP712K2 have been proven for C-29 position oxidation of friedelin to produce polpunonic acid, which clarifies the second biosynthesis step of celastrol. Syntenic analysis revealed that TwCYP712K1 and TwCYP712K2 derived from the common ancestor. These results have provided insight into illustrating pathways for both celastrol and other bioactive compounds found in this plant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD), an incurable neurodegenerative disease, currently affecting 1.75% of the United States population, with projected growth to 3.46% by 2050. Identifying common genetic variants driving differences in transcript expression that confer AD-risk is necessary to elucidate AD mechanism and develop therapeutic interventions. We modify the FUSION Transcriptome Wide Association Study (TWAS) pipeline to ingest expression from multiple neocortical regions, provide a set of 6780 gene weights which are abstracatable across the neocortex, and leverage these to find 8 genes from six loci with associated AD risk validated through summary mendelian randomization (SMR) utilizing IGAP summary statistics.\n\nMethodA combined dataset of 2003 genotypes clustered to Central European (CEU) ancestry was used to construct a training set of 790 genotypes paired to 888 RNASeq profiles across 6 Neo-cortical tissues (TCX=248, FP=50, IFG=41, STG=34, PHG=34, DLPFC=461). Following within-tissue normalization and covariate adjustment, predictive weights to impute expression components based on a genes surrounding cis-variants were trained. The FUSION pipeline was modified to support input of pre-scaled expression values and provide support for cross validation with a repeated measure design arising from the presence of multiple transcriptome samples from the same individual across different tissues.\n\nResultsCis-variant architecture alone was informative to train weights and impute expression for 6780 (49.67%) autosomal genes, the majority of which significantly correlated with gene expression; FDR < 5%: N=6775 (99.92%), Bonferroni: N=6716 (99.06%). Validation of weights in 515 matched genotype to RNASeq profiles from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) was (72.14%) in DLPFC profiles. Association of imputed expression components from all 2003 genotype profiles yielded 8 genes significantly associated with AD (FDR < 0.05); APOC1, EED, CD2AP, CEACAM19, CLPTM1, MTCH2, TREM2, KNOP1.\n\nConclusionWe provide evidence of cis-genetic variation conferring AD risk through 8 genes across six distinct genomic loci. Moreover, we provide expression weights for 6780 genes as a valuable resource to the community, which can be abstracted across the neocortex and a wide range of neuronal phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Sex steroid hormones have been shown to alter regional brain activity, but the extent to which they modulate connectivity within and between large-scale functional brain networks over time has yet to be characterized. Here, we applied dynamic community detection techniques to data from a highly sampled female with 30 consecutive days of brain imaging and venipuncture measurements to characterize changes in resting-state community structure across the menstrual cycle. Four stable functional communities were identified consisting of nodes from visual, default mode, frontal control, and somatomotor networks. Limbic, subcortical, and attention networks exhibited higher than expected levels of nodal flexibility, a hallmark of between-network integration and transient functional reorganization. The most striking reorganization occurred in a default mode subnetwork localized to regions of the prefrontal cortex, coincident with peaks in serum levels of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone. Nodes from these regions exhibited strong intra-network increases in functional connectivity, leading to a split in the stable default mode core community and the transient formation of a new functional community. Probing the spatiotemporal basis of human brain-hormone interactions with dynamic community detection suggests that ovulation results in a temporary, localized patterns of brain network reorganization.\n\nAuthor SummarySex steroid hormones influence the central nervous system across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Estrogen and progesterone concentrations rise and fall throughout the menstrual cycle, but it remains poorly understood how day-to-day fluctuations in hormones shape human brain dynamics. Here, we assessed the structure and stability of resting-state brain network activity in concordance with serum hormone levels from a female who underwent fMRI and venipuncture for 30 consecutive days. Our results reveal that while network structure is largely stable over the menstrual cycle, there is temporary reorganization of several largescale functional brain networks during the ovulatory window. In particular, a default mode subnetwork exhibits increased connectivity with itself and with regions from temporoparietal and limbic networks, providing novel perspective into brain-hormone interactions.",

Stress fibers are thus critical for developmental morphogenesis. The most prominent actomyosin bundles, ventral stress fibers, are generated through coalescence of pre-existing stress fiber precursors. However, whether stress fibers can assemble through other mechanisms has remained elusive. We report that stress fibers can also form without requirement of pre-existing actomyosin bundles. These structures, which we named cortical stress fibers, are embedded in the cell cortex and assemble preferentially underneath the nucleus. In this process, non-muscle myosin II pulses orchestrate the reorganization of cortical actin meshwork into regular bundles, which promote reinforcement of nascent focal adhesions, and subsequent stabilization of the cortical stress fibers. These results identify a new mechanism by which stress fibers can be generated de novo from the actin cortex, and establish role for stochastic myosin pulses in the assembly of functional actomyosin bundles.",

Here we describe Fab-dimerized glycan (FDG)-reactive antibodies without VH-swapped domains from simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected macaques that neutralized heterologous HIV-1 isolates. FDG precursors were boosted by vaccination in macaques, and were present in HIV-1-na\u00efve humans with an average estimated frequency of one per 340,000 B cells. These data demonstrate frequent HIV-1 Env glycan-reactive bnAb B cell precursors in macaques and humans and reveal a novel strategy for their induction by vaccination.HighlightsDiscovery of Fab-dimerized HIV-1 glycan-reactive antibodies with a non-domain-swapped architectureFab-dimerized antibodies neutralize heterologous HIV-1 isolates.Antibodies with this architecture can be elicited by vaccination in macaques.Fab-dimerized antibodies are found in HIV-1 na\u00efve humans.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

By integrating drug-centric and disease-centric annotations as multiviews, we propose a multi-view graph attention network for indication discovery (MGATRx). Unlike most current similarity-based methods, we employ graph attention network on the heterogeneous drug and disease data to learn the representation of nodes and identify associations.

Mutant cochlin was seen to accumulate intracellularly, with the formation of aggregates both inside and outside the cells, in contrast to the wild-type cochlin that is normally secreted. While an additional recessive variant in the COCH gene (DFNB110) has recently been reported, the mechanism of the loss-of-function (LOF) effect of the COCH gene product remains unknown. In this study, we used COS7 cell lines to investigate the consequences of a novel homozygous frameshift variant on RNA transcription, and on cochlin translation. Our results indicate a LOF effect of the variant and a major decrease in cochlin translation. This data has a dramatic impact on the accuracy of genetic counseling for both heterozygote and homozygote carriers of LOF variants in COCH.",

There is a long-held assumption that nerve nets are  simple and random while lacking distinct organisational principles. We want to challenge this assumption and determine how stereotyped the structure of this network really is. We validated an approach to estimate body surface area in Pleurobrachia pileus using custom Optical Projection Tomography and Light Sheet Morphometry imaging systems. We used an antibody against tyrosylated -tubulin to visualise the nerve net in situ. We used an automated segmentation approach to extract the morphological features of the nerve net. We characterised organisational rules of the epithelial nerve net in P. pileus in animals of different sizes and at different regions of the body. We found that specific morphological features within the nerve net are largely un-changed during growth. These properties must be essential to the functionality of the nervous system and therefore are maintained during a change in body size. We have also established the principles of organisation of the network and showed that some of the geometric properties are variable across different parts of the body. This suggests that there may be different functions occurring in regions with different structural characteristics. This is the most comprehensive structural description of a nerve net to date. This study also demonstrates the amenability of the ctenophore P. pileus for whole organism network analysis and shows their promise as a model organism for neuroscience, which may provide insights into the foundational principles of nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOvarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) is important for fertility preservation and conservation. Delay in OTC may be required for transport or workflow management, however little is understood about the effect of processing delay on the tissue.\n\nObjectiveTo determine whether a delay of 24-48 hours to OTC affects primordial follicle (PF) health.\n\nMethodsOvaries (n=6 sheep) were processed immediately or after storage at 4{degrees}C (24h, 48h). Tissue was fixed fresh, after cryopreservation or 10-day xenotransplantation. Morphological assessment of follicle health and development was performed.\n\nFindingsA total of 1541 follicles were analysed. A 24h processing delay did not impact PF health in fresh or cryopreserved tissue. In fresh tissue a 48h delay had an adverse effect on follicle health (OR=2.47, 95% CI 1.29-4.71). Interestingly, a 48h delay resulted in cryopreserved tissue being less likely to be graded as unhealthy compared to control (OR=0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.87). There was no difference in PF health or development across groups following xenotransplantation.\n\nConclusionOvarian tissue can be stored for up to 48 hours prior to cryopreservation with no net impact on PF health.",

    "abstract": "Vacuolar-type H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are versatile proton pumps that control the pH of many intracellular compartments in all eukaryotic cells. The localization of the Arabidopsis V-ATPase was previously shown to be determined by the isoforms of subunit a (VHA-a). The incorporation of VHA-a1 targets the V-ATPase to the trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) whilst the incorporation of VHA-a2 or VHA-a3 targets the V-ATPase to the tonoplast. By employing chimeric proteins and site directed mutagenesis we identified a targeting domain (a1-TD) containing an acidic cluster in the N-terminus of VHA-a1 that serves as both an ER export signal and as a TGN retention motif. The a1-TD is conserved among seed plants and we confirmed experimentally that its presence is predictive of TGN/EE- localization. In contrast to many other non-seed plants, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha encodes only a single VHA-a subunit (MpVHA-a) and we show here that it is predominantly localized at the tonoplast. In our attempts to determine if MpVHA-a can functionally replace the Arabidopsis VHA-a isoforms, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate null-alleles lacking VHA-a1 and discovered that its function is essential for male gametophyte development but can be replaced by VHA-a2 and VHA-a3 during vegetative growth.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here, we show that S1-Fc antigen delivery targeting the Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cell compartment elicits anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-antigen specific IgG production in vivo exerting biologically functional and protective activity against live virus infection, assessed in a stringent experimental virus challenge assay in vitro. The S1-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was genetically fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc moiety, which contributes to mediate S1-Fc cellular internalization by Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells. Immediately upon administration intramuscularly, our novel vaccine candidate recombinant rS1-Fc homes to lymph nodes in vivo where Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells reside. Seroconversion is achieved as early as day 7, mounting considerably increased levels of anti-S1 IgGs in vivo. Interestingly, immunization at elevated doses with non-expiring S1-Fc encoding dsDNA favors the education of a desired antigen-specific adaptive T cell response. However, low-dose immunization, safeguarding patient safety, using recombinant rS1-Fc, elicits a considerably elevated protection amplitude against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our promising findings on rS1-Fc protein immunization prompted us to further develop an affordable and safe product for delivery to our communities in need for COVID-19 vaccinations.",

    "abstract": "Bats are a major \"viral reservoir\" in nature and there is a great interest in not only the cell biology of their innate and adaptive immune systems, but also in the expression patterns of receptors used for cellular entry by viruses with potential cross-species transmission. To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon {beta} and tumor necrosis factor- compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis. This compendium of transcriptome data provides a molecular foundation for understanding the cell identities, functions and cellular receptor characteristics for viral reservoirs and zoonotic transmission.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc. These data narrow the potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of ACE2-Fc.",

The spike (S) protein that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion is the current focus of vaccine and therapeutic antibody development efforts. The S protein, like many other viral fusion proteins such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is glycosylated with both complex and high mannose glycans. Here we demonstrate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by a category of Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). A 3.1 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the S protein ectodomain bound to glycan-dependent HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 revealed a quaternary glycan epitope on the spike S2 domain involving multiple protomers. These data reveal a new epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike that can be targeted for vaccine design.HighlightsFab-dimerized, glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1 bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 spike.3.1 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure reveals quaternary S2 epitope for HIV-1 bnAb 2G12.2G12 targets glycans, at positions 709, 717 and 801, in the SARS-CoV-2 spike.Our studies suggest a common epitope for FDG antibodies centered around glycan 709.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time, and highest TAT.",

In the lack of specific drugs or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, demands rapid diagnosis and management are crucial for controlling the outbreak in the community. Here we report the development of the first rapid-colorimetric assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the human nasopharyngeal RNA sample in less than 30 minutes. We utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range. Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19. The colloid retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects or human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women. The results were validated using nasopharangeal RNA samples from suspected COVID-19 subjects (n=136). Using RT-PCR as gold standard, the assay was found to have 85.29% sensitivity and 94.12% specificity. The optimized method has detection limit as little as 0.5 ng of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, the developed assay rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples in a cost-effective manner and would be useful in pandemic management by facilitating mass screening.",

    "abstract": "The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid international spread pose a global health emergency. The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-\u00c5 and 3.8-\u00c5-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The most severe and fatal infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with virions targeting the epithelium of the distal lung, particularly the facultative progenitors of this tissue, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s). Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed an antiviral dose-response to remdesivir and demonstrated the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a physiologically relevant platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, 30-kilobase RNA genome responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus. Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on native RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are functionally uncharacterized. Here we report secondary structure ensembles of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) and the algorithm  detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation-maximization clustering (DREEM). Our results reveal previously undescribed alternative RNA conformations across the genome, including structures of the frameshift stimulating element (FSE), a major drug target, that are drastically different from prevailing in vitro population average models. Importantly, we find that this structural ensemble promotes frameshifting rates (~40%) similar to in vivo ribosome profiling studies and much higher than the canonical minimal FSE (~20%). Overall, our result highlight the value of studying RNA folding in its native, dynamic and cellular context. The genomic structures detailed here lays the groundwork for coronavirus RNA biology and will guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing is the only method capable of delivering treatments on the shortened time-scale required for patients afflicted with lung disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Management of the COVID-19 pandemic requires widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing. A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among these, RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The retina, a highly metabolic tissue in the central nervous system, consumes the most oxygen and energy stores in the body by tissue mass/volume. Consequently, it is not surprising that retinal ischemia leads to a rapid loss of retinal light responses and electrical transmission. In this study, we show that despite a swift decline of retinal light responses after circulatory death (decay time constant {tau} = [~]1-2 min), we were able to restore mouse rod and cone photoreceptor light signals from enucleated eyes up to 3 h postmortem with significantly better postmortem recovery of cone versus rod light responses. We also demonstrate that both rod and cone phototransduction are more resistant to postmortem enucleation delay than synaptic transmission to second order neurons (bipolar cells). Encouraged by these analyses and the lack of previously successful postmortem retinal light recordings from human foveal/macular photoreceptors, we attempted to restore light responses in the human macula using donor eyes harvested 0.5 - 5 hours postmortem. Here we show successful recordings of human macular cone photoresponses in samples obtained from eyes enucleated up to 5 hours postmortem. Comparing  freshly enucleated non-human primate eyes with human eyes enucleated and reoxygenated at different times after death, we show the exponential decay of the light response amplitudes has a time constant of 74 min. We find that both cause of death and donor age are useful parameters for predicting the recovery of retinal light responses in postmortem human macular tissue. Moreover, we present evidence that hypoxia and secondary acidosis, two modifiable factors, are primary contributors to the rapid loss of retinal light signaling after death. Finally, we show postmortem hypoxia rather than acidosis is the major cause of irreversible decay of the light response amplitudes. The criteria and methodology that we have established here for reviving electrical photoresponses in the postmortem human eye will serve as a new starting point for studying neurophysiology and disease in the human retina.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic uses \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF) to control the expression levels of key viral proteins. Because modulating \u22121 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates \u22121 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect \u22121 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the \u22121 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of \u22121 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress \u22121 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal \u22121 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of \u22121 PRF.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTBackground The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major vector for the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Vector immune responses pose a major barrier to arboviral transmission, and transgenic insects with altered immunity have been proposed as tools for reducing the global public health impact of arboviral diseases. However, a better understanding of virus-immune interactions is needed to progress the development of such transgenic insects. Although the NF-\u03baB-regulated Toll and \u2018immunodeficiency\u2019 (Imd) pathways are increasingly thought to be antiviral, relevant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) remain poorly characterised in A. aegypti.Methodology/Principle Findings We developed novel RT-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays to measure induction of the Toll and Imd pathways in the commonly used A. aegypti-derived Aag2 cell line. We thus determined that the Toll pathway is not inducible by exogenous stimulation with bacterial, viral or fungal stimuli in Aag2 cells under our experimental conditions. We used our Imd pathway-specific assays to demonstrate that the viral dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) is sensed by the Imd pathway, likely through intracellular and extracellular PRRs. The Imd pathway was also induced during infection with the model insect-specific virus cricket paralysis virus (CrPV).Conclusions/Significance Our demonstration that a general PAMP shared by many arboviruses is sensed by the Imd pathway paves the way for future studies to determine how viral RNA is sensed by mosquito PRRs at a molecular level. Our data also suggest that studies measuring inducible immune pathway activation through antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression in Aag2 cells should be interpreted cautiously given that the Toll pathway is not responsive under all experimental conditions. With no antiviral therapies and few effective vaccines available to treat arboviral diseases, our findings provide new insights relevant to the development of transgenic mosquitoes as a means of reducing arbovirus transmission.AUTHOR SUMMARY The mosquito Aedes aegypti, found globally across the tropics and subtropics, transmits viral diseases with a significant global public health impact, including chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. There are no antiviral drugs to treat these diseases and few effective vaccines. One way of reducing the global burden of mosquito-borne diseases would be to develop genetically modified mosquitoes unable to transmit viruses. One approach would be to alter the mosquitoes\u2019 immune system to allow them to better fight viral infections. To do so, we first need to understand how viruses are detected by the mosquito immune system. We developed new methods of measuring immune responses in laboratory-cultured mosquito cells and used them to show that one specific arm of the immune system, called the \u2018Imd pathway\u2019, can detect the RNA that constitutes the genome of mosquito-borne viruses. These findings pave the way for future immune studies that could inform the development of transmission-incompetent mosquitoes. We also found that another arm of the immune system, called the \u2018Toll pathway\u2019, is not functional under any experimental conditions used in this study. This finding has implications for how different laboratories interpret data from these particular cultured cells.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHelicobacter pylori eradication rate with conventional standard therapy is decreasing owing to antibiotic resistance, necessitating novel antibacterial strategies against H. pylori. We evaluated the efficacy of a gentamicin-intercalated smectite hybrid (S-GM)-based treatment, and analyzed fecal microbiome composition in H. pylori-infected mice.\n\nMethodologyTo evaluate anti-H. pylori efficacy, mice were divided into eight groups, and H. pylori eradication was assessed by Campylobacter-like organism (CLO) test and PCR assay of H. pylori in gastric mucosa. One week after H. pylori eradication, proinflammatory cytokine levels and atrophic changes in gastric mucosa were examined. Stool specimens were collected and analyzed for microbiome changes. The S-GM-based triple regimen decreased bacterial burden in vivo, compared with that in untreated mice or mice treated with other regimens. The therapeutic reactions in the CLO test from gastric mucosa were both 90% in standard triple therapy and S-GM therapy group, respectively. Those of H. pylori PCR in mouse gastric mucosa were significantly lower in standard triple therapy and S-GM therapy groups than in non-treatment group. Toxicity test results showed that S-GM therapy reduced IL-8 level and atrophic changes in gastric mucosa. Stool microbiome analysis revealed that compared with mice treated with the standard triple therapy, mice treated with the S-GM therapy showed microbiome diversity and abundant microorganisms at the phylum level.\n\nConclusionOur results suggested that S-GM is a promising and effective therapeutic agent against H. pylori infection.\n\nAuthor summaryThe eradication rate on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) showed decreasing trend due to antibiotic resistance, especially clarithromycin. Therefore, we made a smectite hybrid as a drug delivery system using aminoglycosides antibiotic-gentamicin, and applied it to the mouse stomach wall to confirm the localized therapeutic effect, and set the different treatment duration to verify the effect. As a result, it was confirmed that the therapeutic efficacy of gentamicin (GM)-intercalated smectite hybrid (S-GM) was not inferior to the existing standard triple therapy, based on amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and preserved the diversity of gut microbiome composition. Therefore, a S-GM treatment is expected to be a new alternative regimen to H. pylori infection.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a human-restricted pathogen most often found in the human nasopharynx. Multiple bacterial factors are known to contribute to persistent colonization of this niche, and many are important in mucosal immunity and vaccine development. In this work, mice were infected intranasally with transcriptional regulator mutants of the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing (QS) system--a peptide-based signaling system conserved in sequenced isolates of S. pyogenes. Deletion of the QS systems transcriptional activator ({Delta}rgg2) dramatically diminished the percentage of colonized mice while deletion of the transcriptional repressor ({Delta}rgg3) increased the percentage of colonized mice compared to wild type. Stimulation of the QS system using synthetic pheromones prior to inoculation did not significantly increase the percentage of animals colonized, indicating that QS-dependent colonization is responsive to the intrinsic conditions within the host upper respiratory tract. Bacterial RNA extracted directly from oropharyngeal swabs and evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR subsequently confirmed QS upregulation within one hour of inoculation. In the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), a muted inflammatory response to the {Delta}rgg2 bacteria suggests that their rapid elimination failed to elicit the previously characterized response to intranasal inoculation of GAS. This work identifies a new transcriptional regulatory system governing the ability of S. pyogenes to colonize the nasopharynx and provides knowledge that could help lead to decolonization therapeutics.\n\nAuthor SummaryStreptococcus pyogenes is responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from common pharyngitis to infrequent invasive infections like necrotizing fasciitis. The ability of this microorganism to persist in the human oropharynx predisposes colonized individuals to a variety of superficial and invasive diseases which lead to significant morbidities and mortality. Identification of the regulatory systems that augment the bacterias ability to colonize the oropharynx provides potential targets against which molecular therapeutics can be designed. Here we show that the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing system, an interbacterial communication system, governs the ability of S. pyogenes to colonize the murine oropharynx. Disruption of the systems transcriptional activator reduced colonization dramatically, eliminated the transcription of two sets of genes known to be activated by the Rgg2/3 system, and tempered the innate immune response seen when S. pyogenes is intranasally infected into the mouse.",

    "abstract": "Proteases comprise an important class of enzymes, whose activity is central to many physiologic and pathologic processes. Detailed knowledge of protease specificity is key to understanding their function. Although many methodologies have been developed to profile specificities of proteases, few have the diversity and quantitative grasp necessary to fully define specificity of a protease, both in terms of substrate numbers and their catalytic efficiencies. We have developed a concept of \u201cselectome\u201d, which defines the set of substrates that uniquely represents specificity of a protease. We applied it to two closely related members of the Matrixin family \u2013 MMP-2 and MMP-9 by using substrate phage display coupled with Next Generation Sequencing and information theory-based data analysis. We have also derived a quantitative measure of substrate specificity, which accounts for both the numbers and relative catalytic efficiencies of substrates. Using these advances greatly facilitates uncovering selectivity between closely related members of protease families and provides insight into to the degree of contribution of catalytic cleft specificity to protein substrate recognition, thus providing basis to overcoming two of the major challenges in the field of proteolysis: 1) development of highly selective activity probes and inhibitors for studying proteases with overlapping specificities, and 2) distinguishing targeted proteolysis from bystander proteolytic events.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity within the premotor region HVC is tightly synchronized to, and crucial for, the articulate production of learned song in birds. Characterizations of this neural activity typically focuses on patterns of sequential bursting in small carefully identified subsets of single neurons in the HVC population. Much less is known about population dynamics beyond the scale of individual neurons. There is a rich history of using local field potentials (LFP), to extract information about behavior that extends beyond the contribution of individual cells. These signals have the advantage of being stable over longer periods of time and have been used to study and decode complex motor behaviors, such as human speech. Here we characterize LFP signals in the putative HVC of freely behaving male zebra finches during song production, to determine if population activity may yield similar insights into the mechanisms underlying complex motor-vocal behavior. Following an initial observation that structured changes in the LFP were distinct to all vocalizations during song, we show that it is possible to extract time varying features from multiple frequency bands to decode the identity of specific vocalization elements (syllables) and to predict their temporal onsets within the motif. This demonstrates that LFP is a useful signal for studying motor control in songbirds. Surprisingly, the time frequency structure of putative HVC LFP is qualitatively similar to well established oscillations found in both human and non-human mammalian motor areas. This physiological similarity, despite distinct anatomical structures, may give insight to common computational principles for learning and/or generating complex motor-vocal behaviors.\n\nAuthor SummaryVocalizations, such as speech and song, are a motor process that requires the coordination of several muscle groups receiving instructions from specific brain regions. In songbirds, HVC is a premotor brain region required for singing and it is populated by a set of neurons that fire sparsely during song. How HVC enables song generation is not well understood. Here we describe network activity in putative HVC that precedes the initiation of each vocal element during singing. This network activity can be used to predict both the identity of each vocal element (syllable) and when it will occur during song. In addition, this network activity is similar to activity that has been documented in human, non-human primate, and mammalian premotor regions tied to muscle movements. These similarities add to a growing body of literature that finds parallels between songbirds and humans in respect to the motor control of vocal organs. Given the similarities of the songbird and human motor-vocal systems these results suggest that the songbird model could be leveraged to accelerate the development of clinically translatable speech prosthesis.",
