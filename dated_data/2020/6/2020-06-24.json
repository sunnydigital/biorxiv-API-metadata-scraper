    "abstract": "Over millennia, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms have shaped macroecological distributions across the tree of life. Research describing patterns of regional and global biogeography has traditionally focussed on the study of conspicuous species. Consequently, there is limited understanding of cross-phyla biogeographic structuring, and an escalating need to understand the macroecology of both microscopic and macroscopic organisms. Here we used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to explore the biodiversity of marine metazoans, micro-eukaryotes and prokaryotes along an extensive and highly heterogeneous coastline. Our results showed remarkably consistent biogeographic structure across the kingdoms of life, which were underpinned by environmental and anthropogenic influence. Additionally, metazoan communities displayed biographic patterns that suggest regional biotic homogenisation of conspicuous species. Against the backdrop of global pervasive anthropogenic environmental change, our work highlights the importance of considering multiple domains of life to understand the maintenance and drivers of marine biodiversity across broad taxonomic, ecological and geographical scales.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are operonic sets of microbial genes that synthesize specialized metabolites with diverse functions, including siderophores and antibiotics, which often require export to the extracellular environment. For this reason, genes for transport across cellular membranes are essential for the production of specialized metabolites, and are often genomically co-localized with BGCs. Here we conducted a comprehensive computational analysis of transporters associated with characterized BGCs. In addition to known exporters, in BGCs we found many importer-specific transmembrane domains that co-occur with substrate binding proteins possibly for uptake of siderophores or metabolic precursors. Machine learning models using transporter gene frequencies were predictive of known siderophore activity, molecular weights, and a measure of lipophilicity (log P) for corresponding BGC-synthesized metabolites. Transporter genes associated with BGCs were often equally or more predictive of metabolite features than biosynthetic genes. Given the importance of siderophores as pathogenicity factors, we used transporters specific for siderophore BGCs to identify both known and uncharacterized siderophore-like BGCs in genomes from metagenomes from the infant and adult gut microbiome. We find that 23% of microbial genomes from the infant gut have siderophore-like BGCs, but only 3% of those assembled from adult gut microbiomes do. While siderophore-like BGCs from the infant gut are predominantly associated with Enterobactericaee and Staphylococcus, siderophore-like BGCs can be identified from taxa in the adult gut microbiome that have rarely been recognized for siderophore production. Taken together, these results show that consideration of BGC-associated transporter genes can inform predictions of specialized metabolite structure and function.",

Mitotic chromosome missegregation is an established stimulator of cGAS activity, however, it is unclear if progression through mitosis is required for cancer cell intrinsic activation of immune mediated anti-tumor responses. Moreover, it is unknown if disruption of cell cycle checkpoints can restore responses in cancer cells that are recalcitrant to DNA damage induced inflammation. Here we demonstrate that prolonged cell cycle arrest at the G2-mitosis boundary from either CDK1 inhibition or excessive DNA damage prevents inflammatory stimulated gene expression and immune mediated destruction of distal tumors. Remarkably, DNA damage induced inflammatory signaling is restored in a cGAS-and RIG-I-dependent manner upon concomitant disruption of p53 and the G2 checkpoint. These findings link aberrant cell progression and p53 loss to an expanded spectrum of damage associated molecular pattern recognition and have implications for the design of rational approaches to augment antitumor immune responses.",

    "abstract": "To enter the cell cycle, mammalian cells must cross a point of no return (the commitment point), after which they proceed through the cell cycle regardless of changes in external signaling. This process is tightly regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and downstream molecules such as retinoblastoma (Rb). Here we show that CDK2 activity coordinates the timing of cell-cycle commitment and DNA replication. CDK4/6 activation initiates Rb phosphorylation and E2F activity, causing a gradual increase in CDK2 activity. Once CDK2 activity reaches a threshold level, CDK2 triggers the commitment point by maintaining Rb phosphorylation and subsequently initiates DNA replication. While the timing of the commitment point is tightly coupled with DNA replication, our experiments, which acutely increased CDK2 activity, suggest that the timing of the commitment point is before DNA replication. These findings highlight how cells utilize a safety mechanism to maintain genome stability by protecting against incomplete DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Genetic correlations between traits can strongly impact evolutionary responses to selection, and may thus impose constraints on adaptation. Theoretical and empirical work has made it clear that, without strong linkage, genetic correlations at evolutionary equilibrium result from an interplay of correlated pleiotropic effects of mutations, and correlational selection favoring combinations of trait values. However, it is not entirely clear how the strength of stabilizing selection influences this compromise between mutation and selection effects on genetic correlations. Here, we show that the answer to this question crucially depends on the intensity of genetic drift. In large, effectively infinite populations, genetic correlations are unaffected by the strength of selection, regardless of whether the genetic architecture involves common small-effect mutations (Gaussian regime), or rare large-effect mutations (House-of-Cards regime). In contrast in finite populations, the strength of selection does affect genetic correlations, by shifting the balance from drift-dominated to selection-dominated evolutionary dynamics. The transition between these domains depends on mutation parameters to some extent, but with a similar dependence of genetic correlation on the strength of selection. Our results are particularly relevant for understanding how senescence shapes patterns of genetic correlations across ages, and genetic constraints on adaptation during colonization of novel habitats.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies showed that human cell line HEK293 lacking mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) exhibited decreased succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, and mice lacking MnSOD displayed significant reductions in SDH and aconitase activities. Since MnSOD has significant effects on SDH activity, and succinate is a key regulator of TET enzymes needed for proper differentiation, we hypothesized that SOD2 loss would lead to succinate accumulation, inhibition of TET activity, and impaired erythroid precursor differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we genetically disrupted the SOD2 gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic strategy in a human erythroleukemia cell line (HEL 92.1.7) capable of induced differentiation toward an erythroid phenotype. Cells obtained in this manner displayed significant inhibition of SDH activity and ~10-fold increases in cellular succinate levels compared to their parent cell controls. Furthermore, SOD2-/- cells exhibited significantly reduced TET enzyme activity concomitant with decreases in genomic 5-hmC and corresponding increases in 5-mC. Finally, when stimulated with {delta}-aminolevulonic acid ({delta}-ALA), SOD2-/- HEL cells failed to properly differentiate toward an erythroid phenotype, likely due to failure to complete the necessary global DNA demethylation program required for erythroid maturation. Together, our findings support the model of an SDH/succinate/TET axis and a role for succinate as a retrograde signaling molecule of mitochondrial origin that significantly perturbs nuclear epigenetic reprogramming and introduce MnSOD as a governor of the SDH/succinate/TET axis.",

An area of research interest is coronavirus transcription regulation that uses an RNA-RNA mediated template-switching mechanism. It is not known how different transcriptional stoichiometries of each viral gene are generated. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions. While similar both SARS viruses generated similar TRS independent transcripts they were more abundant in SARS-CoV-2. TRS independent gene regulation requires investigation to determine its relationship to viral pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "How cortical circuits build representations of complex objects is poorly understood. The massive dimensional expansion from the thalamus to the primary sensory cortex may enable sparse, comprehensive representations of higher order features to facilitate object identification. To generate such a code, cortical neurons must integrate broadly over space, yet simultaneously obtain sharp tuning to specific stimulus features. The logic of cortical integration that may synthesize such a sparse, high dimensional code for complex features is not known. To address this question, we probed the integration and population coding of higher order stimuli in the somatosensory and visual cortices of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging across cortical layers. We found that somatosensory and visual cortical neurons sum highly specific combinations of sensory inputs supra-linearly, but integrate other inputs sub-linearly, leading to selective responses to higher order features. This integrative process generates a sparse, but comprehensive code for complex stimuli from the earliest stages of cortical processing. These results from multiple sensory modalities imply that input-specific supra-linear summation may represent a widespread cortical mechanism for the synthesis of higher order feature codes. This new mechanism may explain how the brain exploits the thalamocortical expansion of dimensionality to encode arbitrary complex features of sensory stimuli.",

However, the mechanisms by which these factors control cell fate, and their interactions with one another are not fully understood. Here we combine biophysical and novel biochemical assays to assess how these factors interact with each other quantitatively. A confocal microscopy method to detect binding of a target protein to a fluorescently labelled partner (coimmunoprecipitated bead imaging microscopy [CBIM]) is presented and used to demonstrate homotypic binding of Nanog and heterotypic binding between Nanog and Sox2 and between Nanog and Oct4. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy we show that in solution, Nanog but not Oct4 or Sox2 can form homomultimers. However, both Sox2 and Oct4 can form heterotypic multimers with Nanog in a manner that depends on the presence of tryptophan residues within the Nanog tryptophan repeat. Fluorescence Cross Correlation Spectroscopy shows the affinity of Nanog for dimer formation is in the order Sox2 > Nanog > Oct4. Importantly, live cell analysis demonstrates the existence of Nanog homomultimers in vivo. Together these findings extend understanding of the molecular interactions occurring between these central mediators of the pluripotency gene regulatory network at the single-molecule level.",

Building on observations that mutations in the JIP3 (MAPK8IP3) gene result in lysosome-filled axonal swellings, we analyzed the impact of JIP3 depletion on the cytoskeleton of human neurons. Dynamic focal lysosome accumulations were accompanied by disruption of the axonal periodic scaffold (spectrin, F-actin and myosin II) throughout each affected axon. Additionally, axonal microtubule organization was locally disrupted at each lysosome-filled swelling. This local axonal microtubule disorganization was accompanied by accumulations of both F-actin and myosin II. These results indicate that transport of axonal lysosomes is functionally interconnected with mechanisms that control the organization and maintenance of the axonal cytoskeleton. They have potential relevance to human neurological disease arising from JIP3 mutations as well as for neurodegenerative diseases associated with the focal accumulations of lysosomes within axonal swellings such as Alzheimers disease.",

A better understanding of the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms mediating oxytocins anorexigenic effects may guide more effective obesity pharmacotherapy development. The present study examined the effects of central (lateral intracerebroventricular [ICV]) administration of oxytocin in rats on motivated responding for palatable food. Various conditioning procedures were employed to measure distinct appetitive behavioral domains, including food seeking in the absence of consumption (conditioned place preference expression), impulsive responding for food (differential reinforcement of low rates of responding), effort-based appetitive decision making (high-effort palatable vs. low-effort bland food), and postingestive reward value encoding (incentive learning). Results reveal that ICV oxytocin potently reduces food-seeking behavior, impulsivity, and effort-based palatable food choice, yet does not influence encoding of postingestive reward value in the incentive learning task. To investigate a potential neurobiological mechanism mediating these behavioral outcomes, we utilized in vivo fiber photometry in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons to examine oxytocins effect on phasic dopamine neuron responses to sucrose-predictive Pavlovian cues. Results reveal that ICV oxytocin significantly reduced food cue-evoked dopamine neuron activity. Collectively, these data reveal that central oxytocin signaling inhibits various obesity-relevant conditioned appetitive behaviors, potentially via reductions in food cue-driven phasic dopamine neural responses in the VTA.\n\nHighlightsO_LICentral oxytocin inhibits motivated responding for palatable food reinforcement\nC_LIO_LICentral oxytocin does not play a role in encoding postingestive reward value\nC_LIO_LICentral oxytocin blunts VTA dopamine neuron activity in response to food cues\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence from both human neuroimaging and animal studies has supported a model of mesolimbic processing in computing prediction errors, which form the basis of reward learning behaviors. However, direct evidence demonstrating how human dopamine signaling in the basal ganglia contributes to learning has been hampered by limitations of individual imaging modalities. Here, we present data from a large (N=81, 18-30 year olds), multi-modal neuroimaging study using simultaneously acquired task fMRI, affording temporal resolution of reward system function, and PET imaging with [11C]Raclopride (RAC) assessing striatal D2/3 receptor binding. Results indicated that task-related dopamine release in the ventral striatum, measured as a change in RAC binding, was greater among those who demonstrated successful reward learning on a probabilistic map learning task. This learning response was specific to the ventral striatum and was not present in fMRI BOLD reward response activation. This provides support for considering task-related DA release in ventral striatum as a key signal for translating reward outcomes into a learning signal, rather the representing the reward outcome in isolation. These data provide novel, human in vivo evidence that dopaminergic function may support reward reactivity as well as reward learning as distinct processes.",
