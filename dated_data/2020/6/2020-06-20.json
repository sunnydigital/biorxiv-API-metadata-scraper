    "abstract": "Carbohydrate-lectin interactions are involved in important cellular recognition processes, including viral and bacterial infections, inflammation, and tumor metastasis. Hence, the structural studies of lectin-synthetic glycan complexes are essential for understanding the lectin recognition processes and the further design of promising chemotherapeutics that interfere with sugar-lectin interactions.\n\nPlant lectins are excellent models for the study of the molecular recognition process. Among them, peanut lectin (PNA) is highly relevant in the glycobiology field, because of its specificity for {beta}-galactosides, showing high affinity towards the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen, a well-known tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen. Given this specificity, PNA is one of the most frequently used molecular probes for the recognition of tumor cell-surface O-glycans. Thus, it has been extensively used in glycobiology for inhibition studies with a variety of {beta}-galactoside and {beta}-lactoside ligands. Herein, crystal structures of PNA are reported in complex with six novel synthetic hydrolytically stable {beta}-N- and {beta}-S-galactosides. These complexes, along with computational simulations, disclosed key molecular binding interactions of the different sugars to PNA at the atomic level, revealing the role of specific water molecules in the protein-ligand recognition. Furthermore, binding affinity studies measured by isothermal titration calorimetry showed dissociation constant values in the micromolar range, as well as a positive glycoside cluster effect in terms of affinity in the case of the divalent compounds. Taken together, this work provides qualitative structural rationale for the upcoming synthesis of optimized glycoclusters, designed for the study of lectin-mediated biological processes. The understanding of the recognition of {beta}-N- and {beta}-S-galactosides with PNA represents a benchmark in protein-carbohydrate interactions since they are novel synthetic ligands not belonging to the family of O-linked glycosides.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapies for the treatment of several blood cancers in 2017, and efforts are underway to broaden CAR T technology to address other cancer types. Standard treatment protocols incorporate a preconditioning regimen of lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR T-cell infusion. However, the connection between preconditioning regimens and patient outcomes is still not fully understood. Optimizing patient preconditioning plans and reducing the CAR T-cell dose necessary for achieving remission could make therapy safer. In this paper, we test treatment regimens consisting of sequential administration of chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy on a system of differential equations that models the tumor-immune interaction. We use numerical simulations of treatment plans from within the scope of current medical practice to assess the effect of preconditioning plans on the success of CAR T-cell therapy. Model results affirm clinical observations that preconditioning can be crucial for some patients, not just to reduce side effects, but to even achieve remission at all. We demonstrate that preconditioning plans using the same CAR T-cell dose and the same total concentration of chemotherapy can lead to different patient outcomes due to different delivery schedules. Results from sensitivity analysis of the model parameters suggest that making small improvements in the effectiveness of CAR T-cells in attacking cancer cells, rather than targeting the recruitment and longevity of CAR T-cells, will significantly reduce the minimum dose required for successful treatment. Our modeling framework represents a starting point for evaluating the efficacy of patient preconditioning in the context of CAR T-cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "Using single-molecule imaging with enhanced time resolutions down to 5 ms, we found that CD59-cluster rafts and GM1-cluster rafts stably induced in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), which triggered the activation of Lyn, H-Ras, and ERK, continually recruited Lyn and H-Ras right beneath them in the inner leaflet, with dwell lifetimes of <0.1 s. The detection was possible due to the enhanced time resolutions employed here. The recruitment depended on the PM cholesterol and saturated alkyl chains of Lyn and H-Ras, whereas it was blocked by the non-raftophilic transmembrane protein moiety and unsaturated alkyl chains linked to the inner-leaflet molecules. Since GM1-cluster rafts recruited Lyn and H-Ras as efficiently as CD59-cluster rafts, and the protein moieties of Lyn and H-Ras were not required for the recruitment, we conclude that the transbilayer raft phases induced by the outer-leaflet stabilized rafts recruit lipid-anchored signaling molecules by lateral raft-lipid interactions, and thus serve as a key signal transduction platform.\n\nSummaryHigh-speed single-molecule imaging indicated that CD59-cluster rafts and GM1-cluster rafts stably induced in the plasma membrane outer leaflet generated nano-scale transbilayer raft phases, which continually and transiently recruited Lyn and H-Ras in the inner leaflet by cooperative raft-lipid interactions.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCoronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional nsp14 contains an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain. While the latter presumably operates during viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN-knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously found to have a crippled but viable hypermutation phenotype. Remarkably, using an identical reverse genetics approach, an extensive mutagenesis study revealed the corresponding ExoN-knockout mutants of another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), to be non-viable. This is in agreement with observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses. Only a single MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant could be recovered, likely because the introduced D191E substitution is highly conservative in nature. For 11 other MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants, not a trace of RNA synthesis could be detected, unless - in some cases - reversion had first occurred. Subsequently, we expressed and purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and established in vitro assays for both its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that were lethal when tested via reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity, while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study thus reveals an additional function for MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, thus differentiating it from the proofreading activity thought to boost long-term replication fidelity in MHV and SARS-CoV.\n\nIO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWThe bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, the ExoN domain was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating some form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are alive while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we now established that the equivalent knockout mutants of MERS-CoV ExoN are non-viable and completely deficient in RNA synthesis, thus revealing an additional and more critical function of ExoN in coronavirus replication. Both enzymatic activities of (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14 were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.",

However, there are few scalable and generalizable gene circuit architectures for the programming of sequential genetic perturbations. We describe a modular recombinase-based gene circuit architecture, comprising tandem gene perturbation cassettes (GPCs), that enables the sequential expression of multiple genes in a defined temporal order by alternating treatment with just two orthogonal ligands. We used tandem GPCs to sequentially express single-guide RNAs to encode transcriptional cascades and trigger the sequential accumulation of mutations. We built an all-in-one gene circuit that sequentially edits genomic loci, synchronizes cells at a specific stage within a gene expression cascade, and deletes itself for safety. Tandem GPCs offer a multi-tiered cellular programming tool for modeling multi-stage genetic changes, such as tumorigenesis and cellular differentiation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy targeting CD19 is an effective treatment for refractory B cell malignancies, especially B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The majority of patients achieve a complete response following a single infusion of CD19-targeted CAR-modified T cells (CAR-19 T cells); however, many patients suffer relapse after therapy, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To better understand the mechanism of tumor relapse, we developed an individual cell based computational model for tumor cell plasticity and the heterogeneous responses to the CAR-T treatment. Model simulations reproduced the process of tumor relapse, and predicted that CAR-T stress-induced cell plasticity can lead to tumor relapse in B-ALL. Model predictions were verified by applying the second-generation CAR-T cells to mice injected with NALM-6-GL leukemic cells, in which 60% of the mice relapse within 3 months, and relapsed tumors retained CD19 expression but exhibited a subpopulation of cells with CD34 transcription. These findings lead to a mechanism of tumor replace by which CAR-T treatment induced tumor cells to transition to hematopoietic stem-like cells (HSLCs) and myeloid-like cells and hence escape of CAR-T targeting. The computational model framework was successfully developed to recapitulate the individual evolutionary dynamics, which could predict clinical survival outcomes in B-ALL patients after CAR-T therapy.",

    "abstract": "Arctic plants are affected by many stressors. Root-associated fungi are thought to influence plant performance in stressful environmental conditions. However, the relationships are not transparent; do the number of fungal partners, their ecological functions and community composition mediate the impact of environmental conditions and/or influence host plant performance? To address these questions, we used a common arctic plant as a model system: Bistorta vivipara. Whole plants (including root system) were collected from nine locations in Spitsbergen (n=214). Morphometric features were measured as a proxy for performance and combined with metabarcoding datasets of their root-associated fungi (amplicon sequence variants, ASVs), edaphic and meteorological variables. Seven biological hypotheses regarding fungal influence on plant measures were tested using structural equation modelling. The best-fitting model revealed that local temperature affected plants both directly (negatively aboveground and positively below-ground) and indirectly - mediated by fungal richness and the ratio of symbio- and saprotrophic ASVs. Fungal community composition did not impact plant measurements and plant reproductive investment did not depend on any fungal parameters. The lack of impact of fungal community composition on plant performance suggests that the functional importance of fungi is more important than their identity. The influence of temperature on host plants is therefore complex and should be examined further.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYGenetic manipulation of mammalian cells is instrumental to modern biomedical research but is currently limited by poor capabilities of sequentially controlling multiple manipulations in cells. Currently, either highly multiplexed manipulations can be delivered to populations of cells all at one time, or gene regulatory sequences can be engineered to conditionally activate a few manipulations within individual cells. Here, we provide proof-of-principle for a new system enabling multiple genetic manipulations to be executed as a preprogrammed cascade of events. The system leverages the programmability of the S. pyogenes Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease and is based on flexible arrangements of individual modules of activity. The basic module consists of an inactive single guide RNA (sgRNA) - like component that is converted to an active state through the effects of another sgRNA. Modules can be arranged to bring about an algorithmic program of genetic manipulations without the need for engineering cell type specific promoters or gene regulatory sequences. With the expanding diversity of available tools that utilize spCas9 to edit, repress or activate genes, this sgRNA-based system provides multiple levels for interfacing with host cell biology. In addition, ability of the system to progress through multiple modules from episomal plasmid DNA makes it suitable for applications sensitive to the presence of heterologous genomic DNA sequences and broadly applicable to biomedical research and mammalian cell engineering.Competing Interest StatementThe following competing interests are declared for RC, ART, HP, MSM, MR, and BJM as shareholders in Cellgorithmics, Inc., RC, HP, MSM, and BJM as cofounders of Cellgorithmics, Inc., and RC, HP, MSM, and BJM inventors on patent application number PCT/US2018/052211.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulation therapy with the potential to treat a wide range of chronic conditions in which inflammation is implicated, including type 2 diabetes, obesity and atherosclerosis. Many of these diseases have well-established mouse models, but due to the significant surgical and engineering challenges that accompany a reliable interface for long-term VNS in mice, the therapeutic implications of this bioelectronic therapy remain unexplored. Here, we describe a long-term VNS implant in mice, developed at 3 research laboratories and validated for across-lab reproducibility. Implant functionality was evaluated over 3-8 weeks in 81 anesthetized or behaving mice by determining the stimulus intensity required to elicit a change in heart rate (heart rate threshold, HRT). HRT was also used as a method to standardize stimulation dosing. Overall, 60-90% of implants produced stimulus-evoked physiological responses for at least 4 weeks, with HRT values stabilizing after the second week of implantation. Furthermore, stimulation delivered through 6-week-old implants decreased TNF levels in a subset of mice with acute inflammation caused by endotoxemia. Histological examination of 4- to 6-week-old implants revealed fibrotic encapsulation and no gross fiber loss. This implantation and dosing approach provides a tool to systematically investigate the therapeutic potential of long-term VNS in chronic diseases modeled in the mouse, the most widely used vertebrate species in biomedical research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Members of the POU4F/Brn3 transcription factor family have an established role in the development of retinal ganglion cell types (RGCs), the projection sensory neuron conveying visual information from the mammalian eye to the brain. Our previous work using sparse random recombination of a conditional knock-in reporter allele expressing Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) and intersectional genetics had identified three types of Pou4f3/Brn3c positive (Brn3c+) RGCs. Here, we describe a novel Brn3cCre mouse allele generated by serial Dre to Cre recombination. We use this allele to explore the expression overlap of Brn3c with Brn3a and Brn3b and the dendritic arbor morphologies and visual stimulus properties of Brn3c+ RGC types. Furthermore, we explore Brn3c-expressing brain nuclei. Our analysis reveals a much larger number of Brn3c+ RGCs and more diverse set of RGC types than previously reported. The majority of RGCs having expressed Brn3c during development are still Brn3c positive in the adult, and all of them express Brn3a while only about half express Brn3b. Intersection of Brn3b and Brn3c expression highlights an area of increased RGC density, similar to an area centralis, corresponding to part of the binocular field of view of the mouse. Brn3c+ neurons and projections are present in multiple brain nuclei. Brn3c+ RGC projections can be detected in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN), Pretectal Area (PTA) and Superior Colliculus (SC) but also in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a visual circuit station that was not previously described to receive retinal input. Most Brn3c+ neurons of the brain are confined to the pretectum and the dorsal midbrain. Amongst theses we identify a previously unknown Brn3c+ subdivision of the deep mesencephalic nucleus (DpMe). Thus, our newly generated allele provides novel biological insights into RGC type classification, brain connectivity and midbrain cytoarchitectonic, and opens the avenue for specific characterization and manipulation of these structures.",

Two coelomocyte populations (here named P1 and P2) were identified by flow cytometry and subsequently studied in terms of abundance, morphology, ultrastructure, cell viability and cell cycle profiles. Ultrastructurally, P2 diploid cells showed two main morphotypes, similar to phagocytes and vertebrate thrombocytes, whereas the small P1 haploid cellular population was characterized by a low mitotic activity, relatively undifferentiated cytotype and a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. These last cells resemble stem-cell types present in other animals. P1 and P2 cells differ also in cell viability and cell cycle profiles.

    "abstract": "The cancer genome sequencing has led to important discoveries such as identifying cancer gene. However, challenges remain in the analysis of cancer genome sequencing. One significant issue is that mutations identified by multiple variant callers are frequently discordant even when using the same genome sequencing data. For insertion and deletion mutations, oftentimes there is no agreement among different callers. Identifying somatic mutations involves read mapping and variant calling, a complicated process that uses many parameters and model tuning. To validate the identification of true mutations, we developed a method using k-mer sequences. First, we characterized the landscape of unique versus non-unique k-mers in the human genome. Second, we developed a software package, KmerVC, to validate the given somatic mutations from sequencing data. Our program validates the occurrence of a mutation based on statistically significant difference in frequency of k-mers with and without a mutation from matched normal and tumor sequences. Third, we tested our method on both simulated and cancer genome sequencing data. Counting k-mer involving mutations effectively validated true positive mutations including insertions and deletions across different individual samples in a reproducible manner. Thus, we demonstrated a straightforward approach for rapidly validating mutations from cancer genome sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of cerebral perivascular spaces (PVS) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to explore in vivo their contributions to neurological disorders. To date the normal amount and distribution of PVS in healthy human brains are not known, thus hampering our ability to define with confidence pathogenic alterations. Furthermore, it is unclear which biological factors can influence the presence and size of PVS on MRI. We performed exploratory data analysis of PVS volume and distribution in a large population of healthy individuals (n = 897, age = 28.8 {+/-} 3.7). Here we describe the global and regional amount of PVS in the white matter, which can be used as a reference for clinicians and researchers investigating PVS and may help the interpretation of the structural changes affecting PVS in pathological states. We found a relatively high inter-subject variability in the PVS amount in this population of healthy adults (range: 1.31-14.49 cm3). We then identified body mass index, time of day, and genetics as new elements significantly affecting PVS in vivo under physiological conditions, offering a valuable foundation to future studies aimed at understanding the physiology of perivascular flow.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive division of labor in insect societies is regulated through multiple concurrent mechanisms, primarily chemical and behavioral. Here, we examined if the Dufours gland secretion in the primitively eusocial bumble bee Bombus impatiens signals information about caste, social condition, and reproductive status. We chemically analyzed Dufours gland contents across castes, age groups, social and reproductive conditions, and examined worker behavioral and antennal responses to gland extracts.\n\nWe found that workers and queens each possess caste-specific compounds in their Dufours glands. Queens and gynes differed from workers based on the presence of diterpene compounds which were absent in workers, whereas four esters were exclusive to workers. These esters, as well as the total amounts of hydrocarbons in the gland, provided a separation between castes and also between fertile and sterile workers. Olfactometer bioassays demonstrated attraction of workers to Dufours gland extracts that did not represent a reproductive conflict, while electroantennogram recordings showed higher overall antennal sensitivity in queenless workers. Our results demonstrate that compounds in the Dufours gland act as caste- and physiology-specific signals and are used by workers to discriminate between workers of different social and reproductive status.",

    "abstract": "Plant NLR immune receptors are multidomain proteins that can function as specialized sensor/helper pairs. Paired NLR immune receptors are generally thought to function via negative regulation, where one NLR represses the activity of the second and detection of pathogen effectors relieves this repression to initiate immunity. However, whether this mechanism is common to all NLR pairs is not known. Here, we show that the rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2, which confers resistance to strains of the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) expressing the AVR-PikD effector, functions via receptor cooperation, with effector-triggered activation requiring both NLRs to trigger the immune response. To investigate the mechanism of Pikp-1/Pikp-2 activation, we expressed truncated variants of these proteins, and made mutations in previously identified NLR sequence motifs. We found that any domain truncation, in either Pikp-1 or Pikp-2, prevented cell death in the presence of AVR-PikD, revealing that all domains are required for activity. Further, expression of individual Pikp-1 or Pikp-2 domains did not result in cell death. Mutations in the conserved P-loop and MHD sequence motifs in both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 prevented cell death activation, demonstrating that these motifs are required for the function of the two partner NLRs. Finally, we showed that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 associate to form homo- and hetero-complexes in planta in the absence of AVR-PikD; on co-expression the effector binds to Pikp-1 generating a tripartite complex. Taken together, we provide evidence that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 form a fine-tuned system that is activated by AVR-PikD via receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis of any human malignancy and leukocyte infiltration is a major prognostic marker of the disease. As current immunotherapies confer negligible survival benefits, there is a need to better characterise leukocytes in pancreatic cancer to identify better therapeutic strategies.\n\nIn this study, we analysed 32 human pancreatic cancer patients from two independent cohorts. A multi-parameter mass-cytometry analysis was performed on 32,000 T-cells from eight patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing dataset analysis was performed on a cohort of 24 patients. Multiplex immunohistochemistry imaging and spatial analysis were performed to map immune infiltration into the tumour microenvironment.\n\nRegulatory T-cell populations demonstrated highly immunosuppressive states with high TIGIT, ICOS and CD39 expression. CD8+ T-cells were found to be either in senescence or an exhausted state. The exhausted CD8 T-cells had low PD-1 expression but high TIGIT and CD39 expression. These findings were corroborated in an independent pancreatic cancer single-cell RNA dataset from additional 24 patients.\n\nThese data suggest that T-cells are major players in the suppressive microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. Our work identifies novel therapeutic targets that should form the basis for rational design of a new generation of clinical trials in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "In high-level visual shape areas in the human brain, preference for inanimate objects is observed regardless of stimulation modality (visual/auditory/tactile) and subjects visual experience (sighted/blind individuals), whereas preference for animate entities seems robust only in the visual modality. Here, we test a hypothesis explaining this effect: visual shape representations can be reliably activated through different sensory modalities when they are systematically related to action system representations. We studied fMRI activations in congenitally blind and sighted subjects listening to animal, object, and human sounds. We found that, in blind individuals, the typical anatomical location of the fusiform face area responds to human facial expression sounds, with a clear mapping between the facial motor action and the resulting face shape, but not to speech or animal sounds. Using face areas activation in the blind subjects we could distinguish between specific facial expressions used in the study, but not between specific speech sounds. We conclude that auditory stimulation can reliably activate visual representations of those stimuli - inanimate or animate - for which shape and action computations are transparently related. Our study suggests that visual experience is not necessary for the development of functional preference for face-related information in the fusiform gyrus.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in brain connectivity has been shown for many disease states and groups of people from different levels of cognitive training. To study dynamic functional connectivity, we propose a method for a personalized connectomic state space called Thought Chart. Experienced meditators are an interesting group of healthy subjects for brain connectivity analyses due to their demonstrated differences in resting state dynamics, and altered brain connectivity has been implicated as a potential factor in several psychiatric disorders. Three distinct techniques of meditation are explored: Isha Yoga, Himalayan Yoga, and Vipassana, as well as a meditation-naive group of individuals. All individuals participated in a breath awareness task, an autobiographical thinking task, and one of three different meditation practices according to their expertise, while being recorded by a 64-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG). The functional brain connectivity was estimated using weighted phase lag index (WPLI) and the connectivity dynamics were investigated using a within-individual formulation of Thought Chart, a previously proposed dimensionality reduction method which utilizes manifold learning to map out a state space of functional connectivity. Results showed that the two meditation tasks (breath awareness task and own form of meditation) in all groups were found to have consistently different functional connectivity patterns relative to those of the instructed mind-wandering (IMW) tasks in each individual, as measured using the Hausdorff distance in the state space. The specific meditation state was found to be most similar to the breath awareness state in all groups, as expected in these meditation traditions which all incorporate breath awareness training in their practice trajectory. The difference in connectivity was found to not be solely driven by specific frequency bands. These results demonstrate that the within-individual form of Thought Chart consistently and reliably separates similar tasks among healthy meditators and non-meditators during resting state-like EEG recordings. Unexpectedly, we found the dissimilarity between breath awareness/meditation and IMW, measured via Hausdorff distance, regardless of meditation experience or tradition, with no significant group differences.",

    "abstract": "Many magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices are being studied longitudinally to explore topics such as biomarker detection and clinical staging. A pertinent concern to longitudinal work is MRI scanner upgrades. When upgrades occur during the course of a longitudinal MRI neuroimaging investigation, there may be an impact on the compatibility of pre- and post-upgrade measures. Similarly, subject motion is another issue that may be detrimental to longitudinal MRI work; however, embedding volumetric navigators (vNavs) within acquisition sequences has emerged as a technique that allows for prospective motion correction. Our research group recently implemented an upgrade from a Siemens MAGNETOM 3T Trio system to a Siemens MAGNETOM 3T Prisma Fit system. The goals of the current work were to: 1) investigate the impact of this upgrade on commonly used structural imaging measures and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy indices (\"Prisma Upgrade protocol\") and 2) examine structural imaging measures in a sequence with vNavs alongside a standard acquisition sequence (\"vNav protocol\"). In both protocols, while high reliability was observed for most of the investigated MRI outputs, suboptimal reliability was observed for certain indices. Across the scanner upgrade, increases in frontal, temporal, and cingulate cortical thickness (CT) and thalamus volume, along with decreases in parietal CT, amygdala, globus pallidus, hippocampus, and striatum volumes were observed across the Prisma upgrade, and were linked to increases in signal-to-noise ratios. No significant impact of the upgrade was found in 1H-MRS analyses. Further, CT estimates were found to be larger in MPRAGE acquisitions compared to vNav-MPRAGE acquisitions mainly within temporal areas, while the opposite was found mostly in parietal brain regions. The results from this work should be considered in longitudinal study designs and comparable prospective motion correction investigations are warranted in cases of marked head movement.",
