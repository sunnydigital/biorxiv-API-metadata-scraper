    "abstract": "Anthocyanins are the principal color-producing compounds synthesized in developing fruits of strawberry (Fragaria spp.). Substantial natural variation in color have been observed in fruits of diploid and octoploid accessions, resulting from distinct accumulation and distribution of anthocyanins in fruits. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled by a clade of R2R3 MYB transcription factors, among which MYB10 has been shown as the main activator in strawberry fruit. Here, we show that MYB10 mutations cause most of the anthocyanin variation observed in diploid woodland strawberry (F. vesca) and octoploid cultivated strawberry (F. xananassa). Using a mapping-by-sequencing approach, we identified a gypsy-transposon insertion in MYB10 that truncates the protein and knocks out anthocyanin biosynthesis in a white-fruited F. vesca ecotype. Two additional loss-of-function MYB10 mutations were identified among geographically diverse white-fruited F. vesca ecotypes. Genetic and transcriptomic analyses in octoploid Fragaria spp. revealed that FaMYB10-2, one of three MYB10 homoeologs identified, residing in the F. iinumae-derived subgenome, regulates the biosynthesis of anthocyanins in developing fruit. Furthermore, independent mutations in MYB10-2 are the underlying cause of natural variation in fruit skin and flesh color in octoploid strawberry. We identified a CACTA-like transposon (FaEnSpm-2) insertion in the MYB10-2 promoter of red-fleshed accessions that was associated with enhanced expression and anthocyanin accumulation. Our findings suggest that putative cis regulatory elements provided by FaEnSpm-2 are required for high and ectopic MYB10-2 expression and induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in fruit flesh. We developed MYB10-2 (sub-genome) specific DNA markers for marker-assisted selection that accurately predicted anthocyanin phenotypes in octoploid segregating populations.",

    "abstract": "Ecological specialization is widely thought to influence patterns of species richness by affecting rates at which species multiply and perish. Quantifying specialization is challenging, and using only one or a small number of ecological axes could bias estimates of overall specialization. Here, we calculate an index of specialization, based on seven measured traits, and estimate its effect on speciation and extinction rates in a large clade of birds. We find that speciation rate is independent of specialization, suggesting independence of local ecology and the geographic distributions of populations that promote allopatric species formation. Although some analyses suggest that more specialized species have higher extinction rates, leading to negative net diversification, this relationship is not consistently identified across our analyses. Our results suggest that specialization may drive diversification dynamics only on local scales or in specific clades, but is not generally responsible for macroevolutionary disparity in lineage diversification rates.",

    "abstract": "Excitatory inputs arriving at the dendrites of a neuron can engage active mechanisms that nonlinearly amplify the depolarizing currents. Interneuron-mediated inhibition can modulate this active process, in a subtype-dependent manner. For example, dendrite-targeting inhibition is hypothesized to increase the amplitude of synaptic input required to activate voltage-dependent nonlinear synaptic integration. To examine how inhibition influences active synaptic integration, we optogenetically manipulated the activity of two different subtypes of interneurons: dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SOM) and perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. In acute slices of mouse primary visual cortex, electrical stimulation evoked nonlinear synaptic integration that depended on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Optogenetic activation of SOM neurons in conjunction with electrical stimulation resulted in predominantly divisive inhibitory gain control, reducing the magnitude of the nonlinear response without affecting its threshold. PV activation, on the other hand, had a minimal effect on dendritic nonlinearities, resulting in a small subtractive effect. Furthermore, we found that mutual inhibition among SOM interneurons was strong and more prevalent than previously thought, while mutual inhibition among PV interneurons was minimal. These results challenge previous models of inhibitory modulation of active synaptic integration. The major effect of SOM inhibition is not a shift in threshold for activation of nonlinear integration, but rather a decrease the amplitude of the nonlinear response.",

The mechanisms underlying how this same fusion protein results in diverse leukemia phenotypes among different individuals is not well understood. Given emerging evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that genetic risk factors contribute to MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis, here we tested the impact of genetic background on survival and phenotype of a well-characterized Mll-AF9 knockin mouse model. We crossed this model to five distinct inbred strains (129, A/J, C57BL/6, NOD, CAST), and tested their F1 hybrid progeny for dominant genetic effects on Mll-AF9 phenotypes. We discovered that genetic background altered peripheral blood composition, with Mll-AF9 CAST F1 demonstrating significantly increased B lymphocyte frequency while the remainder of the strains exhibited myeloid-biased hematopoiesis, similar to the parental line. Genetic background also impacted overall survival, with Mll-AF9 A/J F1 and Mll-AF9 129 F1 having significantly shorter survival, and Mll-AF9 CAST F1 having longer survival, compared to the parental line. Furthermore, we observed a range of hematologic malignancies, with Mll-AF9 A/J F1, Mll-AF9 129 F1 and Mll-AF9 B6 F1 developing exclusively myeloid cell malignancies (myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) and AML) whereas a subset of Mll-AF9 NOD F1 developed MPAL and Mll-AF9 CAST F1 developed ALL. This study provides a novel in vivo experimental model to evaluate the underlying mechanisms by which MLL-AF9 results in diverse leukemia phenotypes and provides definitive experimental evidence that genetic risk factors contribute to survival and phenotype of MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by detection and cleavage of invading foreign DNA. Modified versions of this system can be exploited as a biotechnological tool for precise genome editing at a targeted locus. Here, we developed a novel, replicative plasmid that carries the CRISPR-Cas9 system for RNA-programmable, genome editing by counterselection in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Specifically, we demonstrate an approach for making targeted, marker-less gene knockouts and large genome deletions. After a precise double-stranded break (DSB) is introduced, the cells DNA repair mechanism of homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway is being exploited to select successful transformants. This is achieved through the transformation of a template DNA fragment that will recombine in the genome and eliminate recognition of the target of the Cas9 endonuclease. Next, the newly engineered strain, can be easily cured from the plasmid that is temperature-sensitive for replication, by growing it at the non-permissive temperature. This allows for consecutive rounds of genome editing. Using this system, we engineered a strain with three major virulence factors deleted. The here developed approaches should be readily transportable to other Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nImportanceStreptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is an important opportunistic human pathogen killing over a million people each year. Having the availability of a system capable of easy genome editing would significantly facilitate drug discovery and vaccine candidate efforts. Here, we introduced an easy to use system to perform multiple rounds of genome editing in the pneumococcus by putting the CRISPR-Cas9 system on a temperature-sensitive replicative plasmid.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) significantly reduce quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. Tracking these infections is critical for monitoring patient health and informing treatments. We are working toward the development of novel breath-based biomarkers to track chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in situ. Using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), we characterized the in vitro volatile metabolomes (or volatilomes) of 81 P. aeruginosa isolates collected from 17 CF patients over at least a five-year period of their chronic lung infections. We detected 539 volatiles produced by the P. aeruginosa isolates, 69 of which were core volatiles that were highly conserved. We found that each early infection isolate has a unique volatilome, and as infection progresses, the volatilomes of isolates from the same patient become increasingly dissimilar, to the point that these intra-patient isolates are no more similar to one another than to isolates from other patients. We observed that the size and chemical diversity of P. aeruginosa volatilomes do not change over the course of chronic infections; however, the relative abundances of core hydrocarbons, alcohols, and aldehydes do change, and are correlated to changes in phenotypes associated with chronic infections. This study indicates that it may be feasible to track P. aeruginosa chronic lung infections by measuring changes to the infection volatilome, and lays the groundwork for exploring the translatability of this approach to direct measurement using patient breath.\n\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF), and are correlated with lung function declines. Significant clinical efforts are, therefore, aimed at detecting infections and tracking them for phenotypic changes, such as mucoidy and antibiotic resistance. Both the detection and tracking of lung infections relies on sputum cultures, but due to improvements in CF therapies, sputum production is declining though risks for lung infections persist. Therefore, we are working toward the development of breath-based diagnostics for CF lung infections. In this study we characterized of the volatile metabolomes of 81 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from 17 CF patients over a duration of at least five years of a chronic lung infection. We found that the volatilome of P. aeruginosa adapts over time, and correlates to infection phenotype changes, suggesting it may be possible to track chronic CF lung infections with a breath test.",

Ethylene-exposed dark-grown seedlings exhibit dramatic growth reduction, yet the seedlings rapidly return to the basal growth rate when ethylene gas is removed. However, the underlying mechanism governing this reversible acclimation of dark-grown seedlings to ethylene remains enigmatic. Here, we report that ethylene triggers the translocation of the Raf-like protein kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus. Nuclear-localized CTR1 stabilizes the ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) transcription factor via interaction with the EIN3-BINDING F-box (EBF) proteins, thus enhancing the ethylene response and delaying growth recovery.

    "abstract": "Bacterial protein degradation is a regulated process aided by protease adaptors that alter specificity of energy dependent proteases. In Caulobacter crescentus, cell-cycle dependent protein degradation depends on a hierarchy of adaptors, such as the dimeric RcdA adaptor which binds multiple cargo and delivers substrates to the ClpXP protease. RcdA itself is degraded in the absence of cargo and how RcdA recognizes its targets is unknown. Here we show that RcdA dimerization and cargo binding compete for a common interface. Cargo binding separates RcdA dimers and a monomeric variant of RcdA fails to be degraded, suggesting that RcdA degradation is a result of self-delivery. Based on HDX-MS studies showing that different cargo rely on different regions of the dimerization interface, we generate RcdA variants that are selective for specific cargo and show cellular defects consistent with changes in selectivity. Using the same interface for dimerization and cargo binding offers an ability to limit excess protease adaptors by self-degradation, while providing capacity for binding a range of substrates.\n\nSignificance StatementEnergy-dependent proteases broadly regulate bacterial physiology and development. Adaptor proteins tune the substrate specificity of proteases to only degrade selective substrates during the bacterial life cycle and during times of cellular stress. In the process of delivering cargo to their respective proteases, adaptor proteins are inherently protected from degradation until the delivery is complete. How protease adaptors can recognize a wide range of cargo while maintaining stringent specificity and how this process results in stabilization of adaptors remains unclear. Here, we show that direct competition for distinct regions of the dimer interface of the RcdA adaptor by its cargo protects RcdA from degradation by the ClpXP protease, and that this interface can be selectively perturbed in a rational manner with biochemical and physiological consequences.\n\nHighlightsO_LICargo binding of RcdA cargo competes with dimerization\nC_LIO_LIDimerization of RcdA is necessary for self-degradation by ClpXP\nC_LIO_LIRcdA can deliver either cargo or other RcdA subunits to ClpXP\nC_LIO_LIDifferent regions of the dimerization interface are needed for different cargo\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Metabolic rewiring is a hallmark of cancer that supports tumor growth, survival and chemotherapy resistance. While normal cells often rely on extracellular serine and glycine supply, a significant subset of cancers becomes addicted to intracellular serine/glycine synthesis, offering an attractive drug target. Previously developed inhibitors of serine/glycine synthesis enzymes did not reach clinical trials due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles, implying that further efforts to identify clinically applicable drugs targeting this pathway are required. In this study, we aimed to develop therapies that can rapidly enter the clinical practice by focusing on drug repurposing, as their safety and cost-effectiveness have been optimized before. Using a yeast model system, we repurposed two compounds, sertraline and thimerosal, for their selective toxicity against serine/glycine synthesis addicted breast cancer and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Isotope tracer metabolomics, computational docking studies and an enzymatic activity assay revealed that sertraline and thimerosal inhibit serine/glycine synthesis enzymes serine hydroxymethyltransferase and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, respectively. In addition, we demonstrated that sertralines anti-proliferative activity was further aggravated by mitochondrial inhibitors, such as the antimalarial artemether, by causing G1-S cell cycle arrest. Most notably, this combination also resulted in serine-selective antitumor activity in breast cancer mouse xenografts. Collectively, this study provides molecular insights into the repurposed mode-of-action of the antidepressant sertraline and allows to delineate a hitherto unidentified group of cancers being particularly sensitive to treatment with sertraline. Furthermore, we highlight the simultaneous inhibition of serine/glycine synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism as a novel treatment strategy for serine/glycine synthesis addicted cancers.",

    "abstract": "The ability to metabolize both endogenous and exogenous compounds to a variety of metabolic products is not exclusive to our human cells. In fact, the bacterial communities that inhabit our digestive system are responsible for a network of steroid transformations that can produce hormones in the gut, which are then absorbed to act in the host. These communities have been shown to impact our health in numerous ways, affecting disease predisposition, pathogenesis, physical fitness, and dietary responsiveness. Steroid biotransformations by gut bacteria are predicted to impact the host endocrine system. A particular set of transformations facilitated by microbial enzymes has been shown to result in the formation of 11-oxy-androgens from host-derived cortisol. Since androgens have been implicated in disease and immune modulations, understanding the structure and catalytic mechanism of enzymes involved in cortisol metabolism is a key step to hasten the development of strategies that reduce the formation of disease-promoting bioactive steroids in certain individuals. Here, we combine experimental and computational techniques to describe DesC, an enzyme capable of creating 20-dihydrocortisol and siphoning cortisol away from pathways that produce androgens. DesC diverges significantly from previously described bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts, catalyzing an NADH-dependent 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reaction but presenting little sequence and structure similarity to them. The structural information obtained by X-ray crystallography and hybrid QM/MM simulations, validated through mutagenesis studies, show the reaction occurs through a multi-step proton relay mechanism. Free energy calculations were then used to describe the kinetics of the reaction mechanism. The mechanistic information presented here can be employed in the development of therapeutics to divert microbial pathways away from disease-promoting steroids.",

    "abstract": "Two-pore voltage-gated CLC chloride channels control neuronal and muscle excitability. They share a dimeric structure but their activation mechanism remains unresolved. Here we determine the step-by-step activation mechanism of the broadly expressed CLC-2 channel using homology modelling, molecular dynamic simulations and functional studies. We establish that a two-leaf gate formed by Tyr561-H2O-Glu213 flanked by Lys568/Glu174 and Lys212 closes the canonical pore. Activation begins when a hyperpolarization-propelled intracellular chloride occupies the pore and splits Tyr561-H2O-Glu213 by electrostatic/steric repulsion. Unrestrained Glu213 rotates outwardly to bind Lys212 but the pore remains closed. Protonation breaks the Glu213-Lys212 interaction while another chloride occupies the pore thus catalysing chloride exit via Lys212. Also, we found that the canonical pore is uncoupled from a cytosolic cavity by a Tyr561-containing hydrophobic gate that prevents Glu213 protonation by intracellular protons. Our data provide atomistic details about CLC-2 activation but this mechanism might be common to other CLC channels.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Seamounts are often covered with Fe and Mn oxides, known as ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts. Future mining of these crusts is predicted to have significant effects on biodiversity in mined areas. Although microorganisms have been reported on Fe-Mn crusts, little is known about the role of crusts in shaping microbial communities. Here, we investigated microbial community based on 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from Fe-Mn crusts, coral skeleton, calcarenite and biofilm at crusts of the Rio Grande Rise (RGR). RGR is a prominent topographic feature in the deep southwestern Atlantic Ocean with Fe-Mn crusts. Our results revealed that crust field of the RGR harbors a usual deep-sea microbiome. We observed differences of microbial structure according to the sampling location and depth, suggesting an influence of water circulation and availability of particulate organic matter. Bacterial and archaeal groups related to oxidation of nitrogen compounds, such as Nitrospirae, Nitrospinae phyla, Nitrosopumilus within Thaumarchaeota group were present on those substrates. Additionally, we detected abundant assemblages belonging to methane oxidation, i. e. Ca. Methylomirabilales (NC10) and SAR324 (Deltaproteobacteria). The chemolithoautotrophs associated with ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria potentially play an important role as primary producers in the Fe-Mn substrates from RGR. These results provide the first insights into the microbial diversity and potential ecological processes in Fe-Mn substrates from the Atlantic Ocean. This may also support draft regulations for deep-sea mining in the region.",

    "abstract": "The soil bacterium and metabolic engineering platform Pseudomonas putida tolerates high levels of endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress, yet the ultimate reason of such property remains unknown. To shed light on this question, NADPH generation routes--the metabolic currency that fuels redox stress responses--were assessed when P. putida KT2440 was challenged with H2O2 as proxy of oxidative conditions. 13C-tracer experiments, metabolomics and flux analysis, together with inspection of physiological parameters and measurement of enzymatic activities, revealed a substantial flux reconfiguration under oxidative stress. In particular, periplasmic glucose processing was rerouted to cytoplasmic oxidation, and cyclic operation of the pentose phosphate pathway led to significant NADPH fluxes, exceeding biosynthetic demands by ~50%. This NADPH surplus, in turn, fuelled the glutathione system for H2O2 reduction. These properties not only contribute to the tolerance of P. putida to environmental stresses, but they also highlight the value of this host for harsh biotransformations.",

    "abstract": "Obesity induces an adaptive expansion of \u03b2 cell mass and insulin secretion abnormality. Here, we explore a novel role of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in mediating obesity-induced \u03b2 cell function and proliferation through releasing miRNA-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs). ATM EVs derived from obese mice notably suppress insulin secretion in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, whereas there are more proliferating \u03b2 cells in the islets treated with obese ATM EVs. Depletion of miRNAs blunts the ability of obese ATM EVs to regulate \u03b2 cell responses. miR-155, a highly enriched miRNA within obese ATM EVs, exerts profound regulation on \u03b2 cell functions, as evidenced by impaired insulin secretion and increased \u03b2 cell proliferation after miR-155 overexpression in \u03b2 cells. By contrast, knockout of miR-155 can attenuate the regulation of obese ATM EVs on \u03b2 cell responses. We further demonstrate that the miR-155-Mafb axis plays a critical role in controlling \u03b2 cell responses. Taken together, these studies show a novel mechanism by which ATM-derived EVs act as endocrine cargoes delivering miRNAs and subsequently mediating \u03b2 cell adaptation and functional dysfunction in obesity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Fibrillar collagens are structural proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and migration, have been linked to the orientation (directionality) and alignment (anisotropy) of collagen fibers. Given the importance of cell-substrate interactions in driving biological functions, several microfluidic approaches have demonstrated three-dimensional (3D) collagen gels with defined fiber properties that enable quantitative correlations between structural cues and observed cell responses. Although existing methods provide excellent definition over collagen fiber anisotropy, independent control over both anisotropy and directionality (that we collectively refer to as the collagen landscape) has not been demonstrated. Therefore, to advance collagen microengineering capabilities, we present a user-friendly approach that uses controlled fluid flows within a non-uniform microfluidic channel network to create well-defined collagen landscapes. We demonstrate capabilities including i) control over fiber anisotropy, ii) spatial gradients in fiber anisotropy, iii) defined fiber directionality, and iv) multi-material interfaces. We then show that cells respond to the microengineered topographic cues by aligning along the anisotropy domains and following fiber directionality. Finally, this platforms modular capability is demonstrated by integrating an ultrathin porous parylene (UPP) membrane on the microengineered collagen as a mask to control cell-substrate interactions.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution electron microscopy of nervous systems enables the reconstruction of connectomes. A key piece of missing information from connectomes is the synaptic sign. We show that for D. melanogaster, artificial neural networks can predict the transmitter type released at synapses from electron micrographs and thus add putative signs to connections. Our network discriminates between six transmitters (acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, octopamine) with an average accuracy of 87%/94% for synapses/entire neurons. We developed an explainability method to reveal which features our network is using and found significant ultrastructural differences between the classical transmitters. We predict transmitters in two connectomes and characterize morphological and connection properties of tens of thousands of neurons classed by predicted transmitter expression. We find that hemilineages in D. melanogaster largely express only one fastacting transmitter among their neurons. Furthermore, we show that neurons with different transmitters may differ in features like polarization and projection targets.",

    "abstract": "Because the positioning and clustering of biomolecules within the extracellular matrix dictates cell behaviors, the engineering of biomaterials incorporating bioactive epitopes with spatial organization tunable at the nanoscale is of primary importance. Here we used a highly modular composite approach combining peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers and silica nanoparticles, which are both easily functionalized with one or several bioactive signals. We show that the surface of silica nanoparticles allows the clustering of RGDS bioactive signals leading to improved adhesion and spreading of fibroblast cells on composite hydrogels at an epitope concentration much lower than in PA-only based matrices. Most importantly, by combining the two integrin-binding sequences RGDS and PHSRN on nanoparticle surfaces, we improved cell adhesion on the PA nanofiber/particle composite hydrogels, which is attributed to synergistic interactions known to be effective only for peptide intermolecular distance of ca. 5 nm. Such composites with soft and hard nanostructures offer a strategy for the design of advanced scaffolds to display multiple signals and control cell behavior.",

    "abstract": "The development of new approaches to control cardiac arrhythmias requires a deep understanding of spiral wave dynamics. Optogenetics offers new possibilities for this. Preliminary experiments show that sub-threshold illumination affects electrical wave propagation in the mouse heart. However, a systematic exploration of these effects is technically challenging. Here, we use state-of-the-art computer models to study the dynamic control of spiral waves in a two-dimensional model of the adult mouse ventricle, using stationary and non-stationary patterns of sub-threshold illumination. Our results indicate a light intensity-dependent increase in cellular resting membrane potentials, which together with diffusive cell-cell coupling leads to the development of spatial voltage gradients over differently illuminated areas. A spiral wave drifts along the positive gradient. These gradients can be strategically applied to ensure drift-induced termination of a spiral wave, both in optogenetics and in conventional methods of electrical defibrillation.",
