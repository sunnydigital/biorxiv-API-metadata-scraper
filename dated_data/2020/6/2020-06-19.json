    "abstract": "Aging leads to a progressive functional decline of the immune system, which renders the elderly increasingly susceptible to disease and infection. The degree to which immune cell senescence contributes to this functional decline, however, remains unclear since methods to accurately identify and isolate senescent immune cells are missing. By measuring senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity, a hallmark of senescent cells, we demonstrate here that healthy humans develop senescent T lymphocytes in peripheral blood with advancing age. Particularly senescent CD8+ T cells increased in abundance with age, ranging from 30% of the total CD8+ T cell population in donors in their 20s and reaching levels of 64% in donors in their 60s. Senescent CD8+ T cell populations displayed features of telomere dysfunction-induced senescence as well as p16-mediated senescence, developed in various T cell differentiation states and established gene expression signatures consistent with the senescence state observed in other cell types. On the basis of our results we propose that cellular senescence of T lymphocytes is a major contributing factor to the observed decline of immune cell function with advancing age and that immune cell senescence, therefore, plays a significant role in the increased susceptibility of the elderly to age-associated diseases and infection.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome doubling (WGD) occurs early in tumorigenesis and generates genetically unstable tetraploid cells that fuel tumor development. Cells that undergo WGD (WGD+) must adapt to accommodate their abnormal tetraploid state; however, the nature of these adaptations, and whether they confer vulnerabilities that can subsequently be exploited therapeutically, is unclear. Using sequencing data from [~]10,000 primary human cancer samples and essentiality data from [~]600 cancer cell lines, we show that WGD gives rise to common genetic traits that are accompanied by unique vulnerabilities. We reveal that WGD+ cells are more dependent on spindle assembly checkpoint signaling, DNA replication factors, and proteasome function than WGD- cells. We also identify KIF18A, which encodes for a mitotic kinesin, as being specifically required for the viability of WGD+ cells. While loss of KIF18A is largely dispensable for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis in WGD- cells, its loss induces dramatic mitotic errors in WGD+ cells, ultimately impairing cell viability. Collectively, our results reveal new strategies to specifically target WGD+ cancer cells while sparing the normal, non-transformed WGD- cells that comprise human tissue.",

    "abstract": "Shaping embryonic tissues into their functional morphologies requires cells to control the physical state of the tissue in space and time. While regional variations in cellular forces or cell proliferation have been typically assumed to be the main physical factors controlling tissue morphogenesis, recent experiments have revealed that spatial variations in the tissue physical (fluid/solid) state play a key role in shaping embryonic tissues. Here we theoretically study how the regional control of fluid and solid tissue states guides morphogenetic flows to shape the extending vertebrate body axis. Our results show that both the existence of a fluid-to-solid tissue transition along the anteroposterior axis and the tissue surface tension determine the shape of the tissue and its ability to elongate unidirectionally, with large tissue tensions preventing unidirectional elongation and promoting blob-like tissue expansions. We predict both the tissue morphogenetic flows and stresses that enable unidirectional axis elongation. Our results show the existence of a sharp transition in the structure of morphogenetic flows, from a flow with no vortices to a flow with two counter-rotating vortices, caused by a transition in the number and location of topological defects in the flow field. Finally, comparing the theoretical predictions to quantitative measurements of both tissue flows and shape during zebrafish body axis elongation, we show that the observed morphogenetic events can be explained by the mere existence of a fluid-to-solid tissue transition along the anteroposterior axis. These results highlight the role of spatiotemporally-controlled fluid-to-solid transitions in the tissue state as a physical mechanism of embryonic morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hue and luminance contrast are basic visual features, yet the timing of the neural computations that extract them, and whether they depend on common neural circuits, is not well established. Using multivariate analyses of magnetoencephalography data, we show that hue and luminance-contrast polarity can be decoded from MEG data and, with lower accuracy, both features can be decoded across changes in the other feature. These results are consistent with the existence of both common and separable neural mechanisms. The decoding time course is earlier and more temporally precise for luminance polarity than hue, a result that does not appear to depend on task, suggesting that luminance contrast is an updating signal that separates visual events. Meanwhile, cross-temporal generalization is slightly greater for representations of hue compared to luminance polarity, providing a neural correlate of the preeminence of hue in perceptual grouping and memory. Finally, decoding of luminance polarity varies depending on the hues used to obtain training and testing data; the pattern of results suggests that luminance contrast is mediated by both L-M and S cone sub-cortical mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the wired connectivity of a nervous system is a prerequisite for full understanding of function. In this respect, such endeavours can be likened to genome sequencing projects. These projects similarly produce impressive amounts of data which, whilst a technical tour-de-force, remain under-utilised without validation. Validation of neuron synaptic connectivity requires electrophysiology which has the necessary temporal and spatial resolution to map synaptic connectivity. However, this technique is not common and requires extensive equipment and training to master, particularly when applied to the small CNS of the Drosophila larva. Thus, validation of connectivity in this CNS has been more reliant on behavioural analyses and, in particular, activity imaging using the calcium-sensor GCaMP. Whilst both techniques are powerful, they each have significant limitations for this purpose. Here we use electrophysiology to validate an array of driver lines reported to label specific premotor interneurons that the Drosophila connectome project suggests are monosynaptically connected to an identified motoneuron termed the anterior corner cell (aCC). Our results validate this proposition for four selected lines. Thus, in addition to validating the connectome with respect to these four premotor interneurons, our study highlights the need to functionally validate driver lines prior to use.",

    "abstract": "Unfolded proteins ubiquitously collapse into a compact yet dynamic state1,2. While this compaction is pivotal to protein folding3, aggregation4,5, intrinsic disorder6, and phase separation7, its role in protein quality control mechanisms remains obscure8. Collapse has been characterized mainly for polypeptides that are free in solution, in terms of kinetics, chain expansion, and effect on folding9,10. Yet, theory suggests that the solvent-mediated forces driving collapse can be altered near hydrophobic and charged surfaces, which are observed for many proteins including GroEL-ES11,12. Notably, while GroEL-ES is the archetypal protein-folding chaperone, its folding mechanism remains unresolved13,14. GroEL-ES is proposed to sterically confine polypeptides within its closed chamber15, unfold misfolded states16,17, or promote folding indirectly by suppressing aggregation18,19. Here, using integrated protein manipulation and imaging, we show that GroEL-ES can strengthen the collapse of polypeptide substrates, and hence stimulate folding directly. Strikingly, attractive forces pull substrate chains into the open GroEL cavity -unclosed by GroES-, and hence trigger a gradual compaction and discrete folding transitions, even for slow-folding proteins. This collapse enhancement is strongest in the nucleotide-bound states of GroEL, and is aided by GroES binding to the cavity rim, and by the amphiphilic C-terminal tails at the cavity bottom. Peptides corresponding to these C-termini alone are sufficient to strengthen the collapse. The results show a mechanism that allows folding to be stimulated: by strengthening the collapse, residues are brought together that must contact to fold. The notion that one protein can modulate the collapse of another may be generally important in protein conformation and coacervation control, for systems ranging from the GroEL-ES homologue TRiC/CCT20, to the oncogenic c-Myc/Max complex21, and the nuclear pore transporter transportin22.",

    "abstract": "Underage alcohol drinking increases the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). In rodents, adolescent ethanol exposure augments ethanol consumption and anxiety-like behavior while reducing social interaction. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these adaptations are not understood. The dopamine and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) systems in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are implicated in affective disorders and AUD, with studies showing augmented KOR function and reduced dopamine transmission in ethanol-dependent adult animals. Thus, this study, we examined the impact of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure on dopamine transmission and KOR function. Rats were exposed to water or ethanol (4 g/kg, intragastrically) every-other-day during early (PD25-45) or late (PD45-65) adolescence. While AIE exposure during early-mid adolescence (early AIE) did not alter dopamine release in male and female rats, AIE exposure during late adolescence (late AIE) resulted in greater dopamine release in males and lower dopamine release in females. To determine the impact of AIE exposure on KOR function, we bath applied cumulative concentrations of KOR agonist, U50,488 (0.01-1.0 M), and measured its effect on dopamine release. Early AIE exposure potentiated KOR-mediated inhibition of dopamine release in female rats, while late AIE exposure attenuated this effect in male rats. Together these data suggest that AIE-exposure impact on neural processes is dependent on sex and exposure timing. These differences likely arise from differential developmental timing in males and females. This is the first study to show changes in KOR function following AIE exposure.",

The surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the process of coronavirus entry into human cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Due to the critical role in viral-host interaction and the exposure of spike protein, it has been a focus of most vaccines developments. However, the structural and biochemical studies of the spike protein are challenging because it is thermodynamically metastable1. Here, we develop a new pipeline that automatically identifies mutants that thermodynamically stabilize the spike protein. Our pipeline integrates bioinformatics analysis of conserved residues, motion dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations, and other structural analysis to identify residues that significantly contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the spike protein. We then utilize our previously developed protein design tool, Eris, to predict thermodynamically stabilizing mutations in proteins. We validate the ability of our pipeline to identify protein stabilization mutants through known prefusion spike protein mutants. We finally utilize the pipeline to identify new prefusion spike protein stabilization mutants.",

Despite the discovery of ipRGCs nearly two decades ago, there is still little information about how or if conventional RGCs (non-ipRGCs) target ipRGC-recipient nuclei to influence subconscious visual behavior. Using a dual recombinase color strategy, we showed that conventional RGCs innervate many subconscious ipRGC-recipient nuclei, apart from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We revealed previously unrecognized stratification patterns of retinal innervation from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs in the ventral portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, we found that the percent innervation of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs across ipsi- and contralateral nuclei differ.

    "abstract": "Team flow occurs when a group of people reaches high task engagement while sharing a common goal as in sports teams and music bands. While team flow is a superior enjoyable experience to individuals experiencing flow or regular socialization, the neural basis for such superiority is still unclear. Here, we addressed this question utilizing a music rhythm task and electroencephalogram hyper-scanning. Experimental manipulations held the motor task constant while disrupted the hedonic musical correspondence to blocking flow or occluded the partners body and task feedback to block social interaction. The manipulations effectiveness was confirmed using psychometric ratings and an objective measure for the depth of flow experience through the inhibition of the auditory-evoked potential to a task-irrelevant stimulus. Spectral power analysis revealed higher beta/gamma power specific to team flow at the left temporal cortex. Causal interaction analysis revealed that the left temporal cortex receives information from areas encoding individual flow or socialization. The left temporal cortex was also significantly involved in integrated information at both the intra- and inter-brains levels. Moreover, team flow resulted in enhanced global inter-brain integrated information and neural synchrony. Thus, our report presents neural evidence that team flow results in a distinct brain state and suggests a neurocognitive mechanism by which the brain creates this unique experience.\n\nData AvailabilityAll data and analysis codes used in the preparation of this article are available at https://osf.io/3b4hp.",

    "abstract": "Impaired memory is a hallmark of prodromal Alzheimers Disease (AD). Prior knowledge associated with the memoranda has proved to have a powerful effect on memory in healthy subjects. Yet, barely nothing is known about its effect in early AD. We used functional MRI to ask whether prior knowledge enhanced memory encoding in early AD and whether the nature of prior knowledge mattered. Early AD patients and healthy controls underwent a task-based fMRI experiment, being scanned while learning face-scene associations. Famous faces carried Pre-Experimental Knowledge (PEK) while unknown faces repeatedly familiarized prior to learning carried Experimental Knowledge (EK). As expected, PEK increased subsequent memory in healthy elderly. However, patients did not benefit from PEK. Partly non-overlapping brain networks supported PEK vs. EK encoding in healthy controls. Patients displayed impaired activation in a right subhippocampal region where activity predicted successful associative memory formation of PEK stimuli.

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity in sensory cortex fluctuates over time and across repetitions of the same input. This variability is often considered detrimental to neural coding. The theory of neural sampling proposes instead that variability encodes the uncertainty of perceptual inferences. In primary visual cortex (V1), modulation of variability by sensory and non-sensory factors supports this view. However, it is unknown whether V1 variability reflects the statistical structure of visual inputs, as would be required for inferences correctly tuned to the statistics of the natural environment. Here we combine analysis of image statistics and recordings in macaque V1 to show that probabilistic inference tuned to natural image statistics explains the widely observed dependence between spike-count variance and mean, and the modulation of V1 activity and variability by spatial context in images. Our results show that the properties of a basic aspect of cortical responses -- their variability -- can be explained by a probabilistic representation tuned to naturalistic inputs.",

    "abstract": "Larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an ideal organism to study color vision, as their eye possesses four types of cone photoreceptors, covering most of the visible range and into the UV [1,2]. Additionally, their entire eye and nervous system are accessible to imaging, given they are naturally transparent [3-5]. Relying on this advantage, recent research has found that, through a set of color specific horizontal, bipolar and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) [6-8], the eye then relays tetrachromatic information to several retino-recipient areas (RAs) [9,10]. The main RA is the optic tectum, receiving 97% of the RGC axons via the neuropil mass termed Arborization Field 10 (AF10) [11,12]. In this work, we aim to understand the processing of color signals at the interface between RGCs and their targets in the brain. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to separately measure the responses of RGCs and neurons in the dorsal brain to stimulation with four different colors in awake animals. We find that color information is widespread throughout the larval brain, with a large variety of color responses among RGCs, and an even greater diversity in their targets. Specific combinations of response types are localized to specific nuclei, but we observe no single color processing structure. In the main interface in this pathway, the connection between Arborization Field 10 and the tectum, we observe key elements of color processing such as enhanced signal decorrelation and improved decoding [13,14]. Finally, when presenting a richer set of stimuli, we identify parallel processing of color, motion and luminance information in the same cells/terminals, evidence of a rich color vision machinery in this small vertebrate brain.",

    "abstract": "Cortical atrophy is a common manifestation in Parkinsons disease, particularly in later disease stages. Here, we investigated patterns of cortical thickness using T1-weighted anatomical MRI data of 149 Parkinsons disease patients and 369 controls. To elucidate the molecular underpinnings of cortical thickness changes in Parkinsons disease, we performed an integrated analysis of brain-wide healthy transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas and neuroimaging features. For this purpose, we used partial least squares regression to identify gene expression patterns correlated with cortical thickness changes. In addition, we identified gene expression patterns underlying the relationship between cortical thickness and clinical domains of Parkinsons disease. Our results show that genes whose expression in the healthy brain is associated with cortical thickness changes in Parkinsons disease are enriched in biological pathways related to sumoylation, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, mitochondrial translation, DNA damage responses, and ER-Golgi traffic. The associated pathways were highly related to each other and all belong to cellular maintenance mechanisms. The expression of genes within most pathways was negatively correlated with cortical thickness changes, showing higher expression in regions associated with decreased cortical thickness (atrophy). On the other hand, sumoylation pathways were positively correlated with cortical thickness changes, showing higher expression in regions with increased cortical thickness (hypertrophy). Our findings suggest that alterations in the balanced interplay of these mechanisms play a role in changes of cortical thickness in Parkinsons disease and possibly influence motor and cognitive functions.",

We modified the epiGBS (epiGenotyping By sequencing) technique to explore changes in genome-wide cytosine methylation to a repeated acute stress challenge in the nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). This species is widely studied in both the natural and farmed environments, including issues regarding health and welfare.\n\nResultsWe retrieved 501,108,033 sequencing reads after trimming, with a mean mapping efficiency of 73.0% (unique best hits). Fifty-seven differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) close to 51 distinct stress-related genes distributed on 17 of 24 linkage groups (LGs) were detected between RBCs of pre- and post-stress individuals. Literature surveys indicated that thirty-eight of these genes were previously reported as differentially expressed in the brain of zebrafish, most of them involved in stress coping differences. DMC-related genes associated to the Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor, a protein that favors stress adaptation and fear memory, are especially relevant.\n\nConclusionWe provide an improved epiGBS protocol with increased multiplexing and sequencing capacities that offer new opportunities to improve data acquisition and to investigate important biological processes at a genome-wide level, such as the stress response. Minimally invasive RBCs deserve more attention to investigate the epigenetic response to stress without sacrificing fish.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and is characterized by the death of retinal ganglion cells. Reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only therapeutic mechanism available to slow disease progression. However, glaucoma can continue to progress despite normalization of IOP. New treatments are needed to reduce vision loss and improve outcomes for patients who have exhausted existing therapeutic avenues. Recent studies have implicated neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases of both the retina and the brain, including glaucoma and Parkinsons disease. Pro-inflammatory A1 astrocytes contribute to neuronal cell death in multiple disease processes and have been targeted therapeutically in mouse models of Parkinsons disease. Microglial release of pro-inflammatory cytokines C1q, IL-1, and TNF- is sufficient to drive the formation of A1 astrocytes. The role of A1 astrocytes in glaucoma pathogenesis has not been explored. Using a mouse model of glaucoma, we demonstrated that IOP elevation was sufficient to trigger production of C1q, IL-1, and TNF- by infiltrating macrophages followed by resident microglia. These three cytokines drove the formation of A1 astrocytes in the retina. Furthermore, cytokine production and A1 astrocyte transformation persisted following IOP normalization. Ablation of this pathway, by either genetic deletions of C1q, IL-1, and TNF-, or treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist NLY01, reduced A1 astrocyte transformation and RGC death. Together, these results highlight a new neuroinflammatory mechanism behind glaucomatous neurodegeneration that can be therapeutically targeted by NLY01 administration.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how one-shot learning can be accomplished through synaptic plasticity in neural networks of the brain is a major open problem. We propose that approximations to BPTT in recurrent networks of spiking neurons (RSNNs) such as e-prop cannot achieve this because their local synaptic plasticity is gated by learning signals that are rather ad hoc from a biological perspective: Random projections of instantaneously arising losses at the network outputs, analogously as in Broadcast Alignment for feedforward networks. In contrast, synaptic plasticity is gated in the brain by learning signals such as dopamine, which are emitted by specialized brain areas, e.g. VTA. These brain areas have arguably been optimized by evolution to gate synaptic plasticity in such a way that fast learning of survival-relevant tasks is enabled. We found that a corresponding model architecture, where learning signals are emitted by a separate RSNN that is optimized to facilitate fast learning, enables one-shot learning via local synaptic plasticity in RSNNs for large families of learning tasks. The same learning approach also supports fast spike-based learning of posterior probabilities of potential input sources, thereby providing a new basis for probabilistic reasoning in RSNNs. Our new learning approach also solves an open problem in neuromorphic engineering, where on-chip one-shot learning capability is highly desirable for spike-based neuromorphic devices, but could so far not be achieved. Our method can easily be mapped into neuromorphic hardware, and thereby solves this problem.",

    "abstract": "The human linguistic system is characterized by modality invariance and attention selectivity. Previous studies have examined these properties independently and reported perisylvian region involvement for both; however, their relationship and the linguistic information they harbor remain unknown. Participants were assessed by functional MRI, while spoken narratives (auditory) and written texts (visual) were presented, either separately or simultaneously. Participants were asked to attend to one stimulus when both were presented. We extracted phonemic and semantic features from these auditory and visual modalities, to train multiple, voxel-wise encoding models. Cross-modal examinations of the trained models revealed that perisylvian regions were associated with modality-invariant semantic representations. Attentional modulation was quantified by examining the modeling performance for attended and unattended conditions. We have determined that perisylvian regions exhibited attention selectivity. Both modality invariance and attention selectivity are both prominent in models that use semantic but not phonemic features. Modality invariance was significantly correlated with attention selectivity in some brain regions; however, we also identified cortical regions associated with only modality invariance or only attention selectivity. Thus, paying selective attention to a specific sensory input modality may regulate the semantic information that is partly processed in brain networks that are shared across modalities.",

Using multiple experimental approaches, in combination with biophysical modeling and dynamical systems theory, we analyzed, for the first time, the mechanisms underlying the electrophysiological properties of V1R during early embryonic development of the spinal cord locomotor networks (E11.5-E16.5). We found that these interneurons are subdivided into several functional clusters from E11.5 and then display an unexpected transitory involution process during which they lose their ability to sustain tonic firing. We demonstrated that the essential factor controlling the diversity of the discharge pattern of embryonic V1R is the ratio of a persistent sodium conductance to a delayed rectifier potassium conductance. Taken together, our results reveal how a simple mechanism, based on the synergy of two voltage-dependent conductances that are ubiquitous in neurons, can produce functional diversity in V1R and control their early developmental trajectory.",

While the involvement of the PFC in this task has been established, limited information exists regarding the recruitment of broader circuitry, especially under the low- versus high-WM load. We sought to address this question by using a variable-delay operant DMS task. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained and tested to determine their baseline WM performance across all (0-24s) delays. Next, rats were tested in a single DMS test with either 0s or 24s fixed delay, to assess low-/high-load WM performance. c-Fos mRNA expression was quantified within cortical and subcortical regions and correlated with WM performance. High WM load upregulated overall c-Fos mRNA expression within the PrL, as well as within a subset of mGlu5+ cells, with load-dependent, local activation of protein kinase C as the proposed underlying molecular mechanism. The PrL activity negatively correlated with choice accuracy during high load WM performance. A broader circuitry, including several subcortical regions, was found to be activated under low and/or high load conditions. These findings highlight the role of mGlu5 and/or PKC dependent signaling within the PrL, and corresponding recruitment of subcortical regions during high-load WM performance.",

    "abstract": "Signaling mediated by the Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway is critical for maintaining cellular and functional homeostasis in the lung. Thus, chronically activated JAK/STAT signaling is causally associated with lung diseases such as lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To elucidate the molecular processes that transform increased JAK/STAT signaling in airway epithelial cells into the known pathological states, we used a highly simplified model system, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here, the JAK/STAT pathway is permanently active in almost all airway cells and responds to airborne stressors with increased activity. Silencing of this signaling pathway in epithelial cells resulted in apoptosis. Since the above-mentioned lung diseases are commonly associated with increased JAK/STAT signaling, we assessed this by its ectopic activation in the respiratory epithelium of Drosophila. This intervention triggered cell-autonomous structural changes in epithelial cells. These structural changes included phenotypes associated with asthma, namely, thickening of the epithelium, substantial narrowing of the air-conducting space, and impairment of the secretory epicuticular structure of the tracheae. Pharmacological manipulation of JAK/STAT signaling reversed this pathological phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that several biological processes were affected, which is consistent with the impairment of junction protein trafficking also observed in this study. These results indicate that balanced JAK/STAT signaling is essential for the functionality of the respiratory epithelium and, by extension, the entire organ. In contrast, chronic overactivation of this signaling leads to massive structural changes that are closely associated with pathologies typical of chronic inflammatory lung diseases.\n\nHighlightsO_LIJAK/STAT signaling is active in the entire Drosophila respiratory system in all developmental stages.\nC_LIO_LIThe signaling pathway is indispensable for the survival of the tracheal cell.\nC_LIO_LIOveractivation of the signaling has significant effects on tracheal development and also displays a human disease-associated phenotype in Drosophila trachea.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/160929v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f82913org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@150a79corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c1130org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11c7cf8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This lifespan extension has been explained as diet-mediated changes in the trade-off between lifespan and reproduction, with survival favoured with scarce resources. Another evolutionary hypothesis suggests the selective benefit of the response is the maintenance of reproduction. This hypothesis predicts that lifespan extension is a side effect of benign laboratory conditions, where DR individuals are frailer and unable to deal with additional stressors, and thus lifespan extension should disappear under more stressful conditions. We tested this by rearing outbred female Drosophila melanogaster on 10 different protein:carbohydrate diets. Flies were either infected with a bacterial pathogen (Pseudomonas entomophila), injured or unstressed. We monitored lifespan, fecundity and ageing measures. DR extended lifespan and reduced reproduction irrespective of injury and infection. These results do not support lifespan extension under DR being a side effect of benign laboratory conditions.",

    "abstract": "Music listening plays a pivotal role for children and adolescents, yet surprisingly few neuroimaging studies have studied the underlying functional dynamics. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 17 preadolescents aged 10-11 years old while listening to music. We subsequently tracked the occurrence of functional brain networks over time by using a recent method that detects recurrent BOLD phase-locking states: the Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA). In particular, we compared the probabilities of occurrence and switching profiles of different patterns of BOLD phase-locking between music and no music. Moreover, we used an adapted version of the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ) to measure the music reward sensitivity of the participants. Our results showed significantly increased occurrence of a BOLD phase-locking pattern during music listening compared to no music, characterized by a phase-shift in the BOLD signals of the medial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices - a brain subsystem associated to reward processing - from the rest of the brain. Moreover, we observed a significantly higher probability of switching to this pattern while listening to music. We also found a positive correlation between the individual musical reward sensitivity and the tendency to switch to this reward state during music. Our findings highlight the involvement of a brain subsystem involved in hedonic processing during music listening in the early adolescent brain. These results offer novel insight into the neural underpinnings of musical reward in early adolescence and may help us to understand the importance of music at this delicate age.",

    "abstract": "Establishing how wildlife viewing pressure is distributed across individual animals within a population can inform the management of this activity, and ensure targeted individuals or groups are sufficiently protected. Here, we used social media data to quantify whether tourism pressure varies in a loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) population and elucidate potential implications. Laganas Bay (Zakynthos, Greece) supports both breeding (migratory, and hence transient) and foraging (resident) turtles, with turtle viewing representing a major component of the tourism industry. Social media entries spanning two seasons (April to November, 2018 and 2019) were evaluated, and turtles were identified via photo-identification. For both years, 1684 and 2105 entries of 139 and 122 unique turtles were obtained from viewings, respectively (boats and underwater combined). However, while residents represented less than one-third of uniquely identified turtles, they represented 81.9% and 87.9% of all entries. Even when the seasonal breeding population was present (May to July), residents represented more than 60% entries. Of note, the same small number of resident turtles (<10), mostly males, were consistently viewed in both years; however, different individuals were targeted by boats versus underwater. Thus, turtles appear to use and remain in the area despite high viewing intensity, possibly indicating low disturbance. However, photo-identification records revealed a high risk of propeller and boat strike to residents (30%) leading to trauma and mortality. To reduce this threat and ease viewing pressure, we recommend the compulsory use of propeller guards for all boats and the creation of temporary \"refuge\" zones for resident animals at viewing hotspots, with these suggestions likely being relevant for other wildlife with similar population dynamics. In conclusion, social media represents a useful tool for monitoring individuals at a population scale, evaluating the pressure under which they are placed, and providing sufficient data to refine wildlife viewing guidelines and/or zoning.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are abundant inhabitants of the near-surface atmosphere in urban areas. The distribution of microbial communities may benefit or hinder human wellbeing and ecosystem function. Surveys of airborne microbial diversity are uncommon in both natural and built environments and those that investigate diversity are stationary in the city, thus missing continuous exposure to microbes that covary with three-dimensional urban structure. Individuals in cities are generally mobile and would be exposed to diverse urban structures outdoors and within indoor-transit systems in a day. We used mobile monitoring of microbial diversity and geographic information system spatial analysis, across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA in outdoor and indoor-transit (subways and train cars) environments. This study identifies to the role of the three-dimensional urban landscape in structuring atmospheric microbiomes and employs mobile monitoring over ~1920 kilometers to measure continuous biodiversity. We found more diverse communities outdoors that significantly differ from indoor-transit air in microbial community structure, function, likely source environment, and potentially pathogenic fraction of the community. Variation in the structure of the urban landscape was associated with diversity and function of the near-surface atmospheric microbiome in outdoor samples.\n\nImportanceGlobal nutrient cycling and human health depend on the rich biodiversity of microorganisms. The influence of the urban environment on microbiomes remains poorly described despite cities being the fastest growing ecosystems. All life is exposed to the atmosphere and thus discerning what microbes are present and what their functions may be is critical to create resistant and resilient cities under climate change. This study combines a spatially explicit analysis of urban structure with mobile monitoring of the atmospheric microbiome.",

However, limited information was known about the interaction of this next-generation nanomaterial with biomolecules, which might hamper its applications in living tissues. Here, by using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigated the interaction between a C3N nanosheet and the prototypical protein villin headpiece (HP35), in order to identify the mechanistic determinants of such interaction; this knowledge will provide guidelines about C3Ns biocompatibility. Our MD simulations revealed that the C3N-based nanomaterial caused the partial denaturation of HP35 once the protein was bound on its surface. That is, upon adsorption, we observed the loss of the proteins interior hydrogen bonds and the native contacts, which were related with unwinding events in the proteins helices. The protein/C3N nanosheet interacting process was dominated by vdW contributions to the energy and the stepwise changes observed in the values of this energy term suggested a gradual unfolding pattern of HP35 during the absorption event. Furthermore, we also found that the interaction energy showed a linear correlation with the native Q ratio of HP35, suggesting that the degree of HP35 unfolding was linearly time-dependent to the interaction energy. Our findings shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism of the potential consequences of C3N-based nanostructures to proteins, which might delineate the future applications of these nanomaterials in biomedicine.",

However, imperfect knowledge of how oscillations in ecosystem processes regulate fluctuations in exploited populations can obscure the risk of missing management targets. We illustrate how the harvest policy to suppress short-term yield fluctuation inadvertently disrupts population cycles and yield stability of exploited, long-lived predators under stochastically fluctuating environmental forces (food availability and regional climate) using Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua, an apex predatory fish) as a case study. We use a stochastic, empirically parameterized multispecies model to simulate NEA cod population dynamics through life-history processes; Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus, a pelagic forage fish) modulates cod productivity through density-dependent cannibalism-predation dynamics, whereas sea temperature regulates cod consumption, growth, and recruitment. We first test how capelin and sea temperature fluctuations regulate patterns in cod yield fluctuation and then quantitatively assess how fishing pattern designed to limit yield between-year variance (within 50-5%) perturbs cod population-catch dynamics. Simulations suggest that capelin and temperature interactively contribute to shifting cyclic patterns in cod yield fluctuation primarily through cod cannibalism-predation dynamics. Wavelet analyses further show that muffling yield variance (30 % or less) reshapes the cyclicity (shorter period and greater amplitude) of cod population size and demography, thereby becoming progressively unsynchronized with fishing pressure.

    "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a common health concern with significant social, psychological, and cognitive implications. Moderate levels of acoustic overstimulation associated with tinnitus and impaired speech perception cause cochlear synaptopathy, characterized physiologically by reduction in wave I of the suprathreshold auditory brainstem response (ABR) and reduced number of synapses between sensory hair cells and auditory neurons. The unfolded protein response (UPR), an endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of NIHL as well as neurodegeneration and synaptic damage in the brain. In this study, we used the small molecule UPR modulator ISRIB (Integrated Stress Response InhiBitor) to treat noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy in a mouse model. Mice pretreated with ISRIB prior to noise-exposure were protected against noise-induced synapse loss. Male, but not female, mice also exhibited ISRIB-mediated protection against noise-induced suprathreshold ABR wave-I amplitude reduction. Female mice had higher baseline wave-I amplitudes but greater sensitivity to noise-induced wave-I reduction. Our results suggest that the UPR is implicated in noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, and can be targeted for treatment.",

    "abstract": "Type IV secreted effectors (T4SEs) can be translocated into the cytosol of host cells via type IV secretion system (T4SS) and cause diseases. However, experimental approaches to identify T4SEs are time- and resource-consuming, and the existing computational tools based on machine learning techniques have some obvious limitations such as the lack of interpretability in the prediction models. In this study, we proposed a new model, T4SE-XGB, which uses the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm for accurate identification of type IV effectors based on optimal features based on protein sequences. After trying 20 different types of features, the best performance was achieved when all features were fed into XGBoost by the 5-fold cross validation in comparison with other machine learning methods. Then, the ReliefF algorithm was adopted to get the optimal feature set on our dataset, which further improved the model performance. T4SE-XGB exhibited highest predictive performance on the independent test set and outperformed other published prediction tools. Furthermore, the SHAP method was used to interpret the contribution of features to model predictions. The identification of key features can contribute to improved understanding of multifactorial contributors to host-pathogen interactions and bacterial pathogenesis. In addition to type IV effector prediction, we believe that the proposed framework can provide instructive guidance for similar studies to construct prediction methods on related biological problems.

    "abstract": "Disease transmission and behavior change are both fundamentally social phenomena. Behavior change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favor the more rapid adoption of behavioral innovations. We analyze a simple model of coupled behavior-change and infection in a structured population characterized by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioral divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behavior-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a \"second wave\" in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarized populations such as the United States.",

    "abstract": "It has been established that an overactive orexin (OX) system is associated with neurogenic hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). However, the chronology and mechanism of such association between orexin system and hypertension is unclear. We hypothesized that an aberrant surge of OX neurons in SHRs precedes the aberrant increase of arterial blood pressure (ABP) during postnatal development, which was primarily contributed by the exaggerated postnatal OX neurogenesis. We found that (1) SHRs experienced a greater surge in the number of orexin neurons than normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats before P16, which led to significantly more OX neurons than age-matched controls by P15-16 (3680{+/-}219 vs 2407{+/-}182, respectively, P=0.002). (2) Exaggerated OX neurogenesis, marked by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), was the primary contributor to excessive OX neurons in SHRs during development. (3) In contrast, SHRs and normotensive control rats have similar mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) at P15, and a significantly higher ABP in SHR than WKY emerges at P20 (74.8 {+/-} 2.5 vs 66.9 {+/-} 4.4 mmHg in wakefulness, respectively, P<0.05), a few days following the surge of OX activity. (4) Selectively eliminating excess ([~]30%) orexin neurons, via a targeted neurotoxin, in SHRs between P30 and P40 results in a significantly lowered ABP compared to non-lesioned SHRs at P40. We suggest that the postnatal surge of OX neurons, primarily attributed to the exaggerated postnatal OX neurogenesis, may be necessary for the development of higher ABP in SHRs, and modulation of the overactive OX system may have a preventative effect during the pre-hypertensive period.\n\nNew FindingsO_ST_ABSWhat is the central question of this study?C_ST_ABSExcess orexin neurons have been associated with hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats, however, the association and mechanism between developing excess orexin neurons and high blood pressure are unknown.\n\nWhat is the main finding and its importance?Using spontaneously hypertensive rats in anatomical and physiological studies, we provided evidence showing that the excess OX neurons, primarily via exaggerated OX neurogenesis, may be necessary in developing a higher ABP in SHRs during development, and modulation of the overactive orexin system may be beneficial in treating hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeCocaine addiction causes serious health problems and no effective treatment is available yet. We previously identified a genetic risk variant for cocaine addiction in the PLCB1 gene and found this gene upregulated in postmortem brains of cocaine abusers and in human dopaminergic neuron-like cells after an acute cocaine exposure. Here, we functionally tested the contribution of PLCB1 gene to cocaine addictive properties in mice.\n\nExperimental approachWe used heterozygous Plcb1 knockout mice (Plcb1+/-) and characterized their behavioral phenotype. Subsequently, mice were trained for operant conditioning and self-administered cocaine for 10 days. Plcb1+/- mice were assessed for cocaine motivation, followed by 26 days of extinction and finally evaluated for cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Gene expression alterations after reinstatement were assessed in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) by RNAseq.\n\nKey ResultsPlcb1+/- mice showed normal behavior, although they had increased anxiety and impaired short-term memory. Importantly, after cocaine self-administration and extinction, we found a reduction in the cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in Plcb1+/- mice. After reinstatement, we identified transcriptomic alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex of Plcb1+/- mice, mostly related to pathways relevant to addiction like the dopaminergic synapse and long-term potentiation.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsTo conclude, we found that heterozygous deletion of the Plcb1 gene decreases cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, pointing at PLCB1 as a possible therapeutic target for preventing relapse and treating cocaine addiction.",

Here we show that SasA also engages directly with KaiB and KaiC proteins to regulate the period and enhance robustness of the reconstituted circadian oscillator in vitro, particularly under limiting concentrations of KaiB. In contrast to its role regulating gene expression, oscillator function does not require SasA kinase activity; rather, SasA uses structural mimicry to cooperatively recruit the rare, fold-switched conformation of KaiB to the KaiC hexamer to form the nighttime repressive complex. Cooperativity gives way to competition with increasing concentrations of SasA to define a dynamic window by which SasA directly modulates clock robustness.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySasA controls the assembly of clock protein complexes through a balance of cooperative and competitive interactions.",

    "abstract": "In response to corpus callosum (CC) demyelination, subventricular zone-derived neural progenitors (SVZdNP) are mobilized and generate new myelinating oligodendrocytes. Here, we examine the putative immunomodulatory properties of endogenous SVZdNP during demyelination in the cuprizone model. We observed that SVZdNP density is higher in the lateral and rostral CC regions that show weaker demyelination and is inversely correlated with activated microglia density and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels. Single-cell RNA-sequencing further revealed CC areas with high SVZdNP mobilization are enriched in a microglial cell subpopulation with immunomodulatory signature. We identified ligand/receptor couple MFGE8 (milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-8)/integrin {beta}3 as a ligand/receptor couple implicated in SVZdNP/microglia dialog. MFGE8 is highly enriched in immature SVZdNP mobilized to the demyelinated CC and promotes myelin debris phagocytosis in vitro. Altogether these results demonstrate that beyond their cell replacement capacity endogenous progenitors display immunomodulatory properties highlighting a new role for endogenous SVZdNP in myelin regeneration.",

    "abstract": "-Synuclein (-Syn) is a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD). It is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds acidic phospholipids. Growing evidence supports a role for -Syn in membrane trafficking, including, mechanisms of endocytosis and exocytosis, although the exact role of -Syn in these mechanisms is currently unclear. Here we have investigated the role of -Syn in membrane trafficking through its association with acidic phosphoinositides (PIPs), such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI3,4P2). Our results show that -Syn colocalizes with PIP2 and the phosphorylated active form of the clathrin adaptor AP2 at clathrin-coated pits. Using endocytosis of transferrin, an indicator of clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME), we find that -Syn involvement in endocytosis is specifically mediated through PI4,5P2 levels. We further show that the rate of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis is differentially affected by -Syn mutations. In accord with their effects on PI4,5P2 levels at the plasma membrane, the PD associated E46K and A53T mutations further enhance SV endocytosis. However, neither A30P mutation, nor Lysine to Glutamic acid substitutions at the KTKEGV repeat domain of -Syn, that interfere with phospholipid binding, affect SV endocytosis. This study provides evidence for a critical involvement of PIPs in -Syn-mediated membrane trafficking.\n\nSignificance Statement-Synuclein (-Syn) protein is known for its causative role in Parkinsons disease. -Syn is normally involved in mechanisms of membrane trafficking, including endocytosis, exocytosis and synaptic vesicles cycling. However, a certain degree of controversy regarding the exact role of -Syn in these mechanisms persists. Here we show that -Syn acts to increase plasma membrane levels PI4,5P2 and PI3,4P2 to facilitate clathrin mediated and synaptic vesicles endocytosis. Based on the results, we suggest that -Syn interactions with the acidic phosphoinositides facilitate a shift in their homeostasis to support endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Molecular tests for viral diagnostics are essential to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, but their production and distribution cannot satisfy the current high demand. Early identification of infected people and their contacts is the key to being able to isolate them and prevent the dissemination of the pathogen; unfortunately, most countries are unable to do this due to the lack of diagnostic tools. Dogs can identify, with a high rate of precision, unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during an infection; as a result, dogs can diagnose infectious agents by smelling specimens and, sometimes, the body of an infected individual. We trained six dogs of three different breeds to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory secretions of infected patients and evaluated their performance experimentally, comparing it against the gold standard (rRT-PCR). Here we show that viral detection takes one second per specimen. After scent-interrogating 9,200 samples, our six dogs achieved independently and as a group very high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, and likelihood ratio, with very narrow confidence intervals. The highest metric was the negative predictive value, indicating that with a disease prevalence of 7.6%, 99.9% of the specimens indicated as negative by the dogs did not carry the virus. These findings demonstrate that dogs could be useful to track viral infection in humans, allowing COVID-19 free people to return to work safely.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019. With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus was able to infect millions of people. To date, close to half a million patients succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The high need for treatment options, together with the lack of small animal models of infection has led to clinical trials with repurposed drugs before any preclinical in vivo evidence attesting their efficacy was available. We used Syrian hamsters to establish a model to evaluate antiviral activity of small molecules in both an infection and a transmission setting. Upon intranasal infection, the animals developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs and pathology similar to that observed in mild COVID-19 patients. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine (with and without azithromycin) resulted in respectively a mild or no reduction in viral RNA and infectious virus. Micro-CT scan analysis of the lungs showed no improvement compared to non-treated animals, which was confirmed by histopathology. In addition, both compounds did not prevent virus transmission through direct contact and thus failed as prophylactic treatments. By modelling the PK profile of hydroxychloroquine based on the trough plasma concentrations, we show that the total lung exposure to the drug was not the limiting factor. In conclusion, we here characterized a hamster infection and transmission model to be a robust model for studying in vivo efficacy of antiviral compounds. The information acquired using hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir in this model is of critical value to those designing (current and) future clinical trials. At this point, the data here presented on hydroxychloroquine either alone or combined with azithromycin (together with previously reported in vivo data in macaques and ferrets) provide no scientific basis for further use of the drug in humans.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encode multifunctional proteases that are essential for viral replication and evasion of host innate immune mechanisms. The papain-like protease PLpro cleaves the viral polyprotein, and reverses inflammatory ubiquitin and anti-viral ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein modifications1,2. Drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (hereafter, SARS2 PLpro) may hence be effective as treatments or prophylaxis for COVID-19, reducing viral load and reinstating innate immune responses3. We here characterise SARS2 PLpro in molecular and biochemical detail. SARS2 PLpro cleaves Lys48-linked polyubiquitin and ISG15 modifications with high activity. Structures of PLpro bound to ubiquitin and ISG15 reveal that the S1 ubiquitin binding site is responsible for high ISG15 activity, while the S2 binding site provides Lys48 chain specificity and cleavage efficiency. We further exploit two strategies to target PLpro. A repurposing approach, screening 3727 unique approved drugs and clinical compounds against SARS2 PLpro, identified no compounds that inhibited PLpro consistently or that could be validated in counterscreens. More promisingly, non-covalent small molecule SARS PLpro inhibitors were able to inhibit SARS2 PLpro with high potency and excellent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infection models.",

    "abstract": "Human coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which cause respiratory diseases ranging in severity from the seasonal common cold to SARS and COVID-19. Of the 7 human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses, including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors.\n\nImportanceIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.",

Here, we generated a replication competent recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of VSV was replaced by the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. In vitro characterization of the recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike indicated expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. A golden Syrian hamster in vivo model for COVID-19 was implemented. We show that vaccination of hamsters with recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike results in rapid and potent induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination was able to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss of the immunized hamsters compared to unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs of infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage and high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed only minor lung pathology, and no viral load. Taken together, we suggest recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike as a safe, efficacious and protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "How neurons encode natural stimuli is a fundamental question for sensory neuroscience. In the early visual system, standard encoding models assume that neurons linearly filter incoming stimuli through their receptive fields, but artificial stimuli, such as reversing gratings, often reveal nonlinear spatial processing. We investigated whether such nonlinear processing is relevant for the encoding of natural images in ganglion cells of the mouse retina. We found that standard linear receptive field models fail to capture the spiking activity for a large proportion of cells. These cells displayed pronounced sensitivity to fine spatial contrast, and local signal rectification was identified as the dominant nonlinearity. In addition, we also observed a class of nonlinear ganglion cells with opposite tuning for spatial contrast and a particular sensitivity for spatially homogeneous stimuli. Our work highlights receptive field nonlinearities as a crucial component for understanding early sensory encoding in the context of natural stimuli.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 induces a wide range of disease severity ranging from asymptomatic infection, to a life-threating illness, particularly in the elderly and persons with comorbid conditions. Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 induced ARDS and evaluate therapeutic strategies. Here we report ARDS in two aged African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. We also report a comparatively mild COVID-19 phenotype characterized by minor clinical, radiographic and histopathologic changes in the two surviving, aged AGMs and four rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found dramatic increases in circulating cytokines in three of four infected, aged AGMs but not in infected RMs. All of the AGMs showed increased levels of plasma IL-6 compared to baseline, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results show that both RM and AGM are capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that aged AGMs may be useful for modeling severe disease manifestations including ARDS.",

    "abstract": "The etiologic agent of the Covid-19 pandemic is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2 surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA transcription and is essential for viral replication. Here we show that RNA induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase separation generates high-density protein/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.",

Alternative methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostic that would not require specific reagents are worth to investigate not only for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. Simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions. These results pave the way for the development of time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on mass spectrometry.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a crucial need for effective therapies that are immediately available to counteract COVID-19 disease. Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy.\n\nMethodsThe neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%).\n\nResultsAll IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV.\n\nConclusionIn cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.",

Here, we develop novel severe disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by the respiratory route. Both the CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than in immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only). Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and uniformly lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving. Prior studies have focused on high case-density locations, such as the Northern and Western metropolitan areas in the U.S. This study demonstrates continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution in a suburban Southern U.S. region by high-density amplicon sequencing of symptomatic cases. 57% of strains carried the spike D614G variant. The presence of D614G was associated with a higher genome copy number and its prevalence expanded with time. Four strains carried a deletion in a predicted stem loop of the 3 untranslated region. The data are consistent with community spread within the local population and the larger continental U.S. No strain had mutations in the target sites used in common diagnostic assays. The data instill confidence in the sensitivity of current tests and validate \"testing by sequencing\" as a new option to uncover cases, particularly those not conforming to the standard clinical presentation of COVID-19. This study contributes to the understanding of COVID-19 by providing an extensive set of genomes from a non-urban setting and further informs vaccine design by defining D614G as a dominant and emergent SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the U.S.",

In an attempt to address this we used a rapidly growing genomic dataset of SARS-CoV-2 with relevant metadata information. Remarkably, by simply ordering SARS-CoV-2 genomes by their date of collection, we find a progressive increase of C-to-U substitutions resulting in 5'-UCG-3' motif reduction that in turn have reduced the CpG frequency over just a few months of observation. This is consistent with APOBEC-mediated RNA editing resulting in CpG reduction, thus allowing the virus to escape ZAP-mediated RNA degradation. Our results thus link the dynamics of target sequences in the viral genome for two known host molecular defense mechanisms, mediated by the APOBEC and ZAP proteins.",

    "abstract": "The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families - Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our  upstream market chain samples suggests that these detections in  downstream animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.",

The paired CD4 conserved residues, including the matched CD4 interacting MHC-II epitopes of the structural viral protein domains, were chosen for the protein modelling using the SWISS-MODEL online server. Energy minimization and structural validation of the modelled viral protein domains, including the CD4 and MHC-II protein were achieved by CHIMERA and PROCHECK-Ramachandran Plot respectively. Protein-protein docking was performed by the HADDOCK online tool. The binding affinity score was measured using the PRODIGY online server.\n\nAs per our docking report, the Env gp120 of HIV-1 with three identical and three conserved residues of CD4 exhibited the highest binding affinity (-13.9 kcal/mol) with MHC-II than the second-highest RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2 (-12.5 kcal/mol) with three identical and a single conserved residue of CD4. With a noticeable single salt bridge formation identified at the interacting residues Lys305 (of Env gp120-HIV-1) and Glu139 (of MHC-II); the Env gp120 interaction with MHC-II occupied the crucial His144 and Glu194 (salt-bridge) interacting residues of CD4 with the measured buried surface area 2554.8{+/-}40.8 [A]2. Similarly, the RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2-MHC-II complex showed two salt bridge formations at the residue sites: 1) Arg567 (of SARS-CoV-2)-Glu194 (of MHC-II) 2) 2) Asp568(of SARS-CoV-2)-Arg165 (of MHC-II) with the increased buried surface area of 1910.9{+/-}97.1 [A]2 over the SARS-CoV score 1708.2{+/-}50.8 [A]2; that camouflaged all crucial CD4 interacting residues of MHC-II. In conclusion, the noticeable conserved residues of CD4 at the RBD-S1 sites of SARS-CoV-2 could interrupt the aspired CD4-MHC-II interactions of adaptive immune activation.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 Gag protein is responsible for genomic RNA (gRNA) packaging and immature viral particle assembly. While the presence of gRNA in virions is required for viral infectivity, in its absence, Gag can assemble around cellular RNAs and form particles resembling gRNA-containing particles. When gRNA is expressed, it is selectively packaged despite the presence of excess host RNA, but how it is selectively packaged is not understood. Specific recognition of a gRNA packaging signal (Psi) has been proposed to stimulate the efficient nucleation of viral assembly. However, the heterogeneity of Gag-RNA interactions renders capturing this transient nucleation complex using traditional structural biology approaches challenging. Here, we used native mass spectrometry to investigate RNA binding of wild-type Gag and Gag lacking the p6 domain (Gag{Delta}p6). Both proteins bind to Psi RNA primarily as dimers, but to a control RNA primarily as monomers. The dimeric complexes on Psi RNA require an intact dimer interface within Gag. Gag{Delta}p6 binds to Psi RNA with high specificity in vitro and also selectively packages gRNA in particles produced in mammalian cells. These studies provide direct support for the idea that Gag binding to Psi specifically nucleates Gag-Gag interactions at the early stages of immature viral particle assembly in a p6-independent manner.",

    "abstract": "Viruses commonly use specifically folded RNA elements that interact with both host and viral proteins to perform functions important for diverse viral processes. Examples are found at the 3' termini of certain positive-sense ssRNA virus genomes where they partially mimic tRNAs, including being aminoacylated by host cell enzymes. Valine-accepting tRNA-like structures (TLSVal) are an example that share some clear homology to canonical tRNAs but have several important structural differences. Although many examples of TLSVal have been identified, we lacked a full understanding of their structural diversity and phylogenetic distribution. To address this, we undertook an in-depth bioinformatic and biochemical investigation of these RNAs, guided by recent high-resolution structures of a TLSVal. We cataloged many new examples in plant-infecting viruses but also in unrelated insect-specific viruses. Using biochemical and structural approaches, we verified the secondary structure of representative TLSVal substrates and tested their ability to be valylated, finding structural heterogeneity within this class. In a few cases, large stem-loop structures are inserted within distinct variable regions located in an area of the TLS distal to known host cell factor binding sites. In addition, we identified one virus whose TLS has switched its anticodon away from valine; the implications of this remain unclear. These results refine our understanding of the structural and functional mechanistic details of tRNA mimicry and how this may be used in viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the underlining mechanisms underpinning successful fertilisation is imperative in optimising IVF treatments, and may lead to a specific diagnosis and therefore potential treatment for some infertile couples. One of the critical steps involves paternal chromatin reprogramming, in which compacted sperm chromatin packed by protamines is removed by oocyte factors and new histones, including histone H3.3, are incorporated. This step is critical for the formation of the male pronucleus, without which the zygote contains only 1 pronucleus (1PN), in contrast to normally fertilised zygotes with two-pronuclei (2PN). 1PN zygotes are a frequently observed phenomenon in IVF treatments, therefore aberrant mechanism of action controlling paternal chromatin repackaging may be an important cause of abnormal fertilisation. Hira is the main H3.3 chaperone that governs this protamine-to-histone exchange. In this study, we investigated the maternal functions of two other molecules of the Hira complex, Cabin1 and Ubn1 in the mouse. Loss-of-function Cabin1 and Ubn1 mouse models were developed: their zygotes displayed abnormal 1PN zygote phenotypes, similar to the phenotype of Hira mutants. We then studied human 1PN zygotes, and found that the Hira complex was absent in 1PN zygotes which were lacking the male pronucleus. This result confirms that the role of the Hira complex in male pronucleus formation has coherence from mice to humans. Furthermore, rescue experiments showed that the abnormal 1PN phenotype derived from Hira mutants could be resolved by overexpression of Hira in the mouse oocytes. In summary, we have provided evidence of the role of Hira complex in regulating male pronucleus formation in both mice and humans, that both Cabin1 and Ubn1 components of the Hira complex are equally essential for male pronucleus formation, and that this can be rescued. We present a proof-of-concept experiment that could potentially lead to a personalised IVF therapy for oocyte defects.",

We compiled a list of both pro-viral and anti-viral proteins involved in BHV-1 replication; here we provide further analysis of those that are potentially involved in viral entry into the host cell. These entry related factors include the cell surface proteins PVR and PVRL2, a group of enzymes directly or indirectly associated with the biosynthesis of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPG), and proteins that reside in the Golgi apparatus engaging in intra-Golgi trafficking. For the first time, we provide evidence that PVRL2 serves a receptor for BHV-1, mediating more efficient entry than the previously identified PVR. By knocking out two enzymes that catalyze HSPG chain elongation, HST2ST1 and GLCE, we demonstrated the significance of HSPG in BHV-1 entry. Another intriguing cluster of genes, COG1, COG2 and COG4-7 encodes for six subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. MDBK cells lacking COG6 were less infectable by BHV-1 but release newly produced virions more efficiently as evidenced by fewer but bigger plaques compared to control cells, suggesting impaired HSPG biosynthesis. To facilitate candidate validation, we devised a one-step multiplex CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system named CRISPR3i that enables quick and simultaneous deployment of three CRISPRs for efficient gene inactivation. Using CRISPR3i, we verified an additional 23 candidates, with many implicated in cellular entry.",

    "abstract": "Great strides have been made in understanding and treating Hepatitis C virus (HCV) thanks in part to the development of the full-length cell-culture system, the pseudoparticle system and soluble envelope glycoproteins. The HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) system is a platform used extensively in studies of cell entry, screening of novel entry inhibitors, assessing the phenotypes of clinically observed E1 and E2 glycoproteins and, most pertinently, in characterising neutralizing antibody breadth induced upon vaccination and natural infection in patients. Nonetheless, some patient-derived clones fail to produce infectious particles or produce particles that exhibit infectivity too low for meaningful phenotyping. The mechanisms governing whether any particular clone produces infectious pseudoparticles are poorly understood. Here we show that endogenous expression of CD81, an HCV receptor and a cognate binding partner of E2, in producer HEK 293T cells is detrimental to the infectivity of recovered HCVpp for most strains. Many HCVpp clones exhibited increased infectivity or had their infectivity rescued when they were produced in HEK 293T cells CRISPR/Cas9 engineered to ablate CD81 expression (293TCD81KO). Clones made in 293TCD81KO cells were antigenically very similar to their matched counterparts made parental cells and appear to honour the accepted HCV entry pathway. Deletion of CD81 did not appreciably increase the recovered titres of soluble E2 (sE2). However, we did, unexpectedly, find that monomeric sE2 made in 293T and 293F exhibit important differences. We found that 293F-produced sE2 harbours mostly complex type glycans whilst 293T-produced sE2 displays a heterogeneous mixture of both complex type glycans and highmannose or hybrid type glycans. Moreover, sE2 produced in HEK 293T cells is antigenically superior; exhibiting increased binding to conformational antibodies and the large extracellular loop of CD81. In summary, this work describes an optimal cell line for the production of HCVpp and reveals that sE2 made in 293T and 293F cells are not antigenic equals. Our findings have implications for functional studies of E1E2 and the production of candidate immunogens.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells that stop growing but maintain viability and the capacity to regrow are termed dormant and have been shown to transiently tolerate high concentrations of antimicrobials. The proposed mechanism behind the enhanced survival capabilities of these cells is the reduced energy supply. However, not all reported results are in agreement, and the exact role of energetics remains unsolved. Because dormancy merely indicates growth arrest, which can be induced by various stimuli, we hypothesise that dormant cells may exist in a range of energetic states that depend on the environment. We first establish conditions that are capable of inducing dormancy, and subsequently measure the energy profiles they elicit in single dormant cells. Our simultaneous measurements of proton motive force (PMF), cytoplasmic pH and ATP concentrations confirm that dormant cells exhibit characteristic energetic profiles that can vary in level and dynamics, depending on the stimulus leading to growth arrest. We test whether the energetic makeup is associated with survival to antibiotics of different classes and find that, while growth arrest remains the dominant mechanism enabling survival, some correlations with cellular energetics exist. Our results pave the way to a classification of dormant states based on energy profiles, support a novel relationship between environment and drug susceptibility of dormant cells and suggest that knowledge of the conditions present at the infection site is necessary to design appropriate treatments.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is a maternally transmitted bacterium that manipulates arthropod and nematode biology in myriad ways. The Wolbachia strain colonizing Drosophila melanogaster creates sperm-egg incompatibilities and protects its host against RNA viruses, making it a promising tool for vector control. Despite successful trials using Wolbachia-transfected mosquitoes for Dengue control, knowledge of how Wolbachia and viruses jointly affect insect biology remains limited. Using the Drosophila model, transcriptomics and gene expression network analyses revealed pathways with altered expression and splicing due to Wolbachia colonization and virus infection. Included are metabolic pathways previously unknown to be important for Wolbachia-host interactions. Additionally, Wolbachia-colonized flies exhibit a dampened transcriptomic response to virus infection, consistent with early blocking of virus replication. Finally, using Drosophila genetics, we show Wolbachia and expression of nucleotide metabolism genes have interactive effects on virus replication. Understanding the mechanisms of pathogen blocking will contribute to the effective development of Wolbachia-mediated vector control programs.",

MreB directs the localization of cell wall synthesis and loss of MreB results in round cells and death. Using the MreB depolymerizing drug, A22, we show that changes to central metabolism through deletion of malate dehydrogenase from the TCA cycle results in cells with an increased tolerance to A22. We hypothesize that deletion of malate dehydrogenase leads to the upregulation of gluconeogenesis resulting in an increase in cell wall precursors. Consistent with this idea, metabolite analysis revealed that mdh deletion cells possess elevated levels of several glycolysis/gluconeogenesis compounds and the cell wall precursor, UDP-NAG. In agreement with these results, the increased A22 resistance phenotype can be recapitulated through the addition of glucose to the media. Finally, we show that this increase in antibiotic tolerance is not specific to A22 but also applies to the cell wall-targeting antibiotic, mecillinam.",

    "abstract": "Malaria remains a huge global health burden and control of this disease has run into a severe bottleneck. To defeat malaria and reach the goal of eradication, a deep understanding of parasite biology is urgently needed. The mitochondrion of the malaria parasite is essential throughout the parasites lifecycle and has been validated as a clinical drug target. In the asexual development of Plasmodium spp., the single mitochondrion grows from a small tubular structure to a complex branched network. At the end of schizogony when 8-32 merozoites are produced, the branched mitochondrion is precisely divided, distributing one mitochondrion to each forming daughter merozoite. In mosquito and liver stages, the giant mitochondrial network is split into thousands of pieces then daughter mitochondria are segregated into individual progeny. Despite the significance of mitochondrial fission in Plasmodium, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Studies of mitochondrial fission in model eukaryotes have revealed that several mitochondrial fission adaptor proteins are involved in recruiting dynamin GTPases to physically split mitochondrial membranes. Apicomplexan parasites, however, share no identifiable homologs of mitochondrial fission adaptor proteins of yeast or human, except for Fis1. Here, we investigated the localization and essentiality of the Fis1 homolog in Plasmodium falciparum, PfFis1 (PF3D7_1325600), during the asexual lifecycle. We found that PfFis1 requires an intact C-terminus for mitochondrial localization but is not essential for parasite development or mitochondrial fission. The dispensable role of PfFis1 indicates Plasmodium contains additional fission adaptor proteins on the mitochondrial outer membrane that could be essential for mitochondrial fission.\n\nImportanceMalaria is responsible for over 230 million clinical cases and [~] half a million deaths each year. The single mitochondrion of the malaria parasite functions as a metabolic hub throughout the parasites developmental cycle as well as a source of ATP in certain stages. To pass on its essential functions, the parasites mitochondrion needs to be properly divided and segregated into all progeny during cell division via a process named mitochondrial fission. Due to the divergent nature of Plasmodium spp., molecular players involved in mitochondrial fission and their mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. We found that Fis1, the only identifiable mitochondrial fission adaptor protein evolutionarily conserved in the phylum of Apicomplexa, however, is not essential for Plasmodium falciparum. Our data suggest that malaria parasites use redundant fission adaptor proteins on the mitochondrial outer membrane to mediate the fission process.",

    "abstract": "There have been incerases in antibiotic resistant strains of human pathogens and causing treatment of microbial infections difficult. These days more attention is given to seraching new antimicrobial drugs to combat pathogenic microbes. Traditional fermented cottage of Metata Ayib which is naturally enriched with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and used to preserve cheese for long time in Northern Ethiopia, may have antimicrobial activity against various human pathogens. However, there was no scientific report on the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Metata Ayib. The objective of this study is to evaluate antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria from Metata Ayib against clinical and standard human pathogens. The study was laboratory based experiment. Antibiotic production by the LAB was performed by inoculating the LAB isolates into 6.0 ml MRS medium and incubating at 30 {degrees}C. Cell free supernatants (CFS) were collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 {degrees}C) of the six day fermented broth cultures. The pH of the CFS was adjusted to 6.5 with 4 N NaOH to eliminate the effect of organic acids.The susceptibility of produced antibiotic against test organisms was done by growing on Muller Hinton agar in triplicate using well diffusion method and the inhibition zone was recorded. Preceddingly, MIC and MBC was determined using standard methods. The antibiotic substance exhibited antimicrobial activity towards standard and drug resistant bacteral strains with the inhibition zone ranges upto 25.33{+/-}3.21 mm. The result of MIC against tested ornaisnms showed a considerable antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic substance withn the range values 6.25% to12.5%. In addition, the result of this study showed that LAB obtained from Metata Ayib exhibits antimicrobial activity against standard and pathogenic pathogenic test bacterial species ranged from 12.5-25% of MBC value. This might be due to the production of organic acids, but also other compounds, such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl, reuterin and bacteriocins. The results of this investigation can also provide baseline for information for future studies about the application of antibacterial substances produced by LAB from fermented Metata ayib.",

    "abstract": "PurposeCyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) lead to cell-cycle arrest but also demonstrate antineoplastic activity through triggering T cell-mediated immunity. One of the potential mechanisms responsible for this immunological effect might be qualitative and quantitative changes in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands on the cell surface after treatment with CDK4/6i. These changes may increase the immunogenicity of breast cancer cells offering potential synergies for combinations with cancer immunotherapies.\n\nExperimental DesignWe investigated the ability of two CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), Abemaciclib and Palbociclib, to alter the immunopeptidome at subclinical, non-toxic, levels in different breast cancer cell lines. Biochemical isolation of HLA ligands, identification by mass spectrometry and subsequent network analysis after drug treatment were used to characterize the changes in the immunopeptidome. The mechanisms for altered CDK4/6 presentation were explored.\n\nResultsLow-dose treatment with 100nM of Abemaciclib and Palbociclib led to upregulation of cell surface HLA levels and induced hundreds of HLA ligands in breast cancer cell lines. These new ligands were significantly and most strongly enriched for peptides derived from proteins involved in the \"G1/S phase transition of cell cycle\" pathway and included among others, HLA ligands from CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1. An increase in transcript, protein, and subsequent ubiquitination for Cyclin D1, which could lead to enhanced degradation of the target protein, was identified as a potential mechanism for the altered presentation of peptides.\n\nConclusionsCDK4/6i treatment gave rise to drug-induced antigens through cell cycle disruption and increased antigen presentation. Interestingly, these induced HLA ligands are often sourced from the proteins of the CDK4/CDK6/CCND1 complex or more downstream interaction partners, providing evidence that inhibition of a distinct cellular pathway leads to increased presentation of the proteins involved. These findings suggested CDK4/6i provided a tool for highly selective induction of HLA ligands that may be targeted by T cell-based immunotherapeutics.\n\nTranslational RelevanceThese data demonstrated that low-dose treatment of breast cancer cells with CDK4/6 inhibitors, Abemaciclib and Palbociclib, induced marked changes in presentation of HLA ligands, especially from proteins involved in the G1/S phase transition, the phase in which these drugs arrest the cells. Enhanced ubiquitination and degradation was identified as a mechanism for the altered presentation for one of the relevant proteins. The induced HLA ligands may provide ideal specific targets for combination immunotherapies. The data show for the first time that selective inhibition of a distinct pathway can lead to specific presentation of HLA ligands in breast cancer cells. This work supports the rationale for testing the combination of low-dose CDK4/6i with immunotherapeutic agents, such as immune checkpoint blockade antibodies or T-cell-based approaches specifically directed against one of the induced HLA ligands.",

This study sought to provide the first genomic analysis of a pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii from Uganda and Africa, and to tell a story of mobile genetic element-mediated antibiotic resistance evolution in the isolate. It was an in-silico study in which intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance genes, and/or chromosomal resistance mutations were identified using PATRIC, CARD, NDARO and ResFinder. Screening for insertion sequences was done using ISfinder. Also, plasmid screening, phylogenetic analysis and sequence typing were performed using PlasmidFinder, PATRIC and Gubbin, and MLST respectively.\n\nThe isolate belonged to the Sequence type 136, belonging to Clonal complex 208 and Global complex 2. This isolate shared close homology with strains from Tanzania. Resistance in the isolate was chromosomally and mobile genetic element-mediated by Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases and carbapenem hydrolyzing class D {beta}-lactamses, blaOXA-2, 51, 5 88, 317, blaADC-2, 25. Colistin resistance was associated with previously documented mutants, lpxA and lpxC.

    "abstract": "Adoptive transfer of anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells is a novel form of cancer immunotherapy, and a key challenge is to ensure the survival and function of the transferred T cells. Immune cell survival requires adaptation to different micro-environments, and particularly to the hypoxic milieu of solid tumors. The HIF transcription factors are an essential aspect of this adaptation, and we undertook experiments to define structural determinants of HIF that would potentiate anti-tumor efficacy in cytotoxic T cells. We created retroviral vectors to deliver ectopic expression of HIF-1\u0251 and HIF-2\u0251 in mouse CD8+ T cells, together or individually, and with or without sensitivity to their oxygen-dependent inhibitors Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH). We found that HIF-2\u0251, but not HIF-1\u0251, drives broad transcriptional changes in CD8+ T cells, resulting in increased cytotoxic differentiation and cytolytic function against tumor targets. We further found that a specific mutation replacing the hydroxyl group acceptor site for FIH in the HIF-2\u0251 isoform gives rise to the most effective anti-tumor T cells after adoptive transfer in vivo. Lastly, we show that co-delivering an FIH-insensitive form of HIF-2\u0251 with an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor greatly enhances cytolytic function of human CD8+ T cells against lymphoma cells. These experiments provide a means to increase the anti-tumor efficacy of therapeutic CD8+ T cells via ectopic expression of the HIF transcription factor.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Mosquito physiology and immunity are integral determinants of malaria vector competence. This includes the principal role of hormonal signaling in Anopheles gambiae initiated shortly after blood-feeding, which stimulates immune induction and promotes vitellogenesis through the function of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Previous studies demonstrated that manipulating 20E signaling through the direct injection of 20E or the application of a 20E agonist can significantly impact Plasmodium infection outcomes, reducing oocyst numbers and the potential for malaria transmission. In support of these findings, we demonstrate that a 20E agonist, halofenozide, is able to induce anti-Plasmodium immune responses that limit Plasmodium ookinetes. We demonstrate that halofenozide requires the function of ultraspiracle (USP), a component of the canonical heterodimeric ecdysone receptor, to induce malaria parasite killing responses. Additional experiments suggest that the effects of halofenozide treatment are temporal, such that its application only limits malaria parasites when applied prior to infection. Unlike 20E, halofenozide does not influence cellular immune function or AMP production. Together, our results further demonstrate the potential of targeting 20E signaling pathways to reduce malaria parasite infection in the mosquito vector and provide new insight into the mechanisms of halofenozide-mediated immune activation that differ from 20E.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial pathogen that causes a variety of diseases, ranging from wound infections to severe bacteremia or food poisoning. The course and severity of the disease are mainly dependent on the bacterium genotype as well as host factors. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is currently the most extensive genotyping method available, followed by bioinformatic sequence analysis.\n\nMethodsA total of 253 uncharacterized staphylococcus genome sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (August 2012 to March 2020) from different studies. Samples were clustered based on core and accessory pairwise distances between isolates and then analyzed by multilocus sequence typing tool (MLST). Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec), spa typing, variant calling, core genome alignment, and recombination sites prediction were performed on detected S. aureus isolates. S. aureus isolates were also analyzed for the presence of genes coding for virulence factors and antibiotic resistance.\n\nResults and conclusionUncategorized genome sequences were clustered into 24 groups. About 182 uncharacterized Staphylococcus genomes were identified at the species level based on MLST, including 32 S. lugdunensis genome sequence, thus doubling the number of the publicly accessible S. lugdunensis genome sequence in Genbank. MLST identified another four species (S. epidermidis (33/253), S. lugdunensis (32/253), S. haemolyticus (41/253), S. hominis (24/253) and S. aureus (52/253)). Among the 52 S. aureus isolates, 21 (40.38%) isolates carried mecA gene, with 57.14% classified as SCCmec IV. The results of this study provide knowledge that facilitates evolutionary studies of staphylococcal species and other bacteria at the genome level.",

    "abstract": "Many promising pharmaceutically active compounds have low solubility in aqueous environments and their encapsulation into efficient drug delivery vehicles is crucial to increase their bioavailability. Lipodisq nanoparticles are approximately 10 nm in diameter and consist of a circular phospholipid bilayer, stabilized by an annulus of SMA (a hydrolysed copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride). SMA is used extensively in structural biology to extract and stabilize integral membrane proteins for biophysical studies. Here, we assess the potential of these nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles, determining their cytotoxicity and the in vivo excretion pathways of their polymer and lipid components. Doxorubicin-loaded Lipodisqs were cytotoxic across a panel of cancer cell lines, whereas nanoparticles without the drug had no effect on cell proliferation. Intracellular doxorubicin release from Lipodisqs in HeLa cells occurred in the low-pH environment of the endolysosomal system, consistent with the breakdown of the discoidal structure as the carboxylate groups of the SMA polymer become protonated. Biodistribution studies in mice showed that, unlike other nanoparticles injected intravenously, most of the Lipodisq components were recovered in the colon, consistent with rapid uptake by hepatocytes and excretion into bile. These data suggest that Lipodisqs have the potential to act as delivery vehicles for drugs and contrast agents.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsDLPE1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDLPE-Cy5Cy5 dye covalently conjugated to 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDLSdynamic light scatteringDMPC1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDMPG1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2019-rac-glycerol)DOXDoxorubicinEPRenhanced permeability and retention effectLipodisqLQNMRnuclear magnetic resonanceNPnanoparticleRTroom temperatureSMAhydrolysed co-polymer of styrene and maleic anhydrideSMA-Cy5Cy5 dye covalently conjugated to a thiol derivative of SMASMAnhnon-hydrolysed co-polymer of styrene and maleic anhydrideSMAnh-SHthiol derivative of SMAnhSMA-SHthiol derivative of SMAView Full Text",

Here, we determined the system-wide pleiotropic effects that redress the significant perturbations caused by the deletion of global transcriptional regulator CRP in Escherichia coli when evolved in the presence of glucose. We elucidated that absence of CRP results in alterations in key metabolic pathways instrumental for the precise functioning of protein biosynthesis machinery that subsequently corroborated with intracellular metabolite profiles. Apart from acquiring mutations in the promoter of glucose transporter ptsG, the evolved populations recovered the metabolic pathways to their pre-perturbed state with amelioration of protein biosynthesis machinery coupled with fine-tuned proteome re-allocation that enabled growth recovery. However, ineffective utilization of carbon towards biomass as perceived from ATP maintenance flux and costly amino acid accumulations poses a limitation.

    "abstract": "Keratins play multiple significant biological roles in epithelium. K1 / keratin 10 (K10) heterodimer is a hallmarker for keratinocyte differentiation. While keratins are absent in normal melanocyte, keratins have been found in both melanoma cell lines and human melanoma. The biological significance of the keratins in melanoma cells has remained unclear. In our current study we applied K1 siRNA to investigate the biological significance of the K1 in B16-F10 melanoma cells. We found that as low as a 16% decrease in the K1 level led to significant increases in both apoptosis and necrosis of the cells. Moreover, the mild K1 decrease led to significant increases in both dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and ethidium signals - two indicators of oxidative stress - in the cells. Collectively, our findings have provided the first evidence indicating both a critical role of the K1 in maintaining the survival of melanoma cells and an important role of the K1 in modulating the oxidative stress state of the cells. These findings have exposed new functions of keratins in cancer cells, suggesting that K1 may become a novel therapeutic target for melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To determine the efficacy of nanoparticle-encapsulated FL2 siRNA (FL2-NPsi), a novel therapeutic agent targeting the Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2) gene, for the treatment of corneal alkaline chemical injury.Methods Eighty 12-week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided evenly into 8 treatment groups: prednisolone, empty nanoparticles, control-NPsi (1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 20 \u03bcM) and FL2-NPsi (1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 20 \u03bcM). An alkaline burn was induced onto the cornea of each rat, which was then treated for 14 days according to group assignment. Clinical (N=10 per group), histopathologic (N=6 per group), and immunohistochemical (N=4 per group) analyses were conducted to assess for wound healing. FL2-NPsi-mediated knockdown of FL2 was confirmed by in vitro qPCR. Toxicity assays were performed to assess for apoptosis (TUNEL assay, N=3 per group) and nerve damage (whole mount immunochemical staining, N=2 per group). Statistical analyses were performed using student\u2019s t-test and ANOVA.Results Compared to controls, FL2-NPsi-treated groups demonstrated enhanced corneal wound healing, with the 10 and 20 \u03bcM FL2-NPsi-treated groups demonstrating maximum rates of corneal re-epithelialization (p=0.0003 at Day 4 and p&lt;0.0001 at Day 8) as assessed by ImageJ software, enhanced corneal transparency, and improved stromal organization on histology. Immunohistochemical analysis of vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils did not show significant differences between treatment groups. FL2-NPsi was not found to be toxic to nerves or induce apoptosis (p=0.917).Conclusion Dose-response studies found both 10 and 20 \u03bcM FL2-NPsi to be efficacious in this rat model. FL2-NPsi may offer a novel treatment for corneal alkaline chemical injuries.Competing Interest StatementDr. Wang, Dr. Kramer, Dr. Baker, and Dr. Dey are employees of MicroCures, Inc.

    "abstract": "Unc-51-like kinase 4 (ULK4) is a pseudokinase that has been linked to the development of several diseases. Even though sequence motifs required for ATP binding in kinases are lacking, ULK4 still tightly binds ATP and the presence of the cofactor is required for structural stability of ULK4. Here we present a high-resolution structure of a ULK4-ATP{gamma}S complex revealing a highly unusual ATP binding mode in which the lack of the canonical VAIK motif lysine is compensated by K39, located N-terminal to C. Evolutionary analysis suggests that degradation of active site motifs in metazoan ULK4 has co-occurred with an ULK4 specific activation loop, which stabilizes the C-helix. In addition, cellular interaction studies using BioID and biochemical validation data revealed high confidence interactors of the pseudokinase and armadillo repeat domains. Many of the identified ULK4 interaction partners were centrosomal and tubulin associated proteins and several active kinases suggesting new roles for ULK4.\n\nHighlightsStructure of the ULK4 ATP complex reveals a unique ATP binding mode.\n\nDisease associated mutations modulate ATP binding and ULK4 stability\n\nDegradation of active site motifs co-occurred in evolution with an ULK4 specific activation loop\n\nBioID suggests a role of ULK4 regulating centrosomal and cytoskeletal functions",

    "abstract": "The adult heart is a terminally differentiated tissue that depends on mitochondria for its energy supply. Respiratory chain energy supply deficits due to alterations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) or in nuclear genome (nDNA)-encoded mtDNA regulators are associated with cardiac pathologies ranging from primary mitochondrial cardiomyopathies to heart failure. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is an nDNA-encoded regulator of mtDNA transcription, replication, and maintenance. Insufficiency of this protein in embryonic and postnatal cardiomyocytes causes cardiomyopathy and/or lethality, establishing TFAM as indispensable to the developing heart; its role in adult tissue has been inferred from these findings. Here, we provide evidence that challenges this long-standing paradigm using Tfam ablation in the adult heart. Unexpectedly, loss of Tfam in adult cardiomyocytes resulted in a prolonged period of functional resilience characterized by preserved mtDNA content, mitochondrial function, and cardiac function despite mitochondrial structural alterations and decreased transcript abundance. Remarkably, TFAM protein levels did not directly dictate mtDNA content in the adult heart, and mitochondrial translation was preserved with acute TFAM inactivation, suggesting a mechanism whereby respiratory chain assembly and function can be sustained, which we term  functional resilience. Finally, long-term Tfam inactivation induced a coordinated downregulation of the core mtDNA transcription and replication machinery that ultimately resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy. Taken together, adult-onset cardiomyocyte-specific Tfam inactivation reveals a striking resilience of the adult heart to acute insults to mtDNA regulatory mechanisms and provides insight into critical differences between the developing versus differentiated heart.",

    "abstract": "Livestock keeping forms main occupation in arid and semi-arid lands. Increase in drought frequency and intensity globally negatively affect livestock production and livelihood. Cattle are the most drought sensitive livestock due to size, grazing behavior and nutritional requirements. Factors for vulnerability of cattle to droughts are individual cattle parameters, health and husbandry practices. This cross sectional study aimed to those factors in semi-arid Kaloleni sub-county. Data on household (HH) head demographics, cattle and production collected from 194 enrolled HH using structured questionnaires. Cattle ages were grouped into young (<1 year old), growers (1-2 years old) and adults (>2years old). Data was analyzed using STATA 12 software. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis conducted and reported in Crude Odds Ratio (cOR), Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) and Confidence Interval (CI). We used Pearson product-moment correlation to determine relationship between HH head, cattle herd, individual cattle characteristics and drought characteristics, p = <0.05 being significant. Mean age HH heads was 40.7 {+/-} 12.6 years, 44.3% (86) had basic education, males were 65.3% (n=126). Mixed livestock production was practiced by 69.1% (134), while 86.1% (167) practiced free range communal grazing. Adult cattle were 54.1% (1295). Female cattle were 72.7% (1741). Average body condition score was 3.0 {+/-} 0.6, and calves had 2.6 {+/-} 1.3. About 20.6% had various forms of illness, calves mostly affected at 29.1%. Up to 63.4% HH, spray cattle at home, 93.3% HH reported no vaccination history. Home straying was protective (cOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.14 - 0.53). Herd size (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5 - 5.5) and having no disease control method (aOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.85 - 9.19) were contributing to reporting disease. We report positive correlation between drought outcomes and HH head (r=0.076, p>0.01), cattle herd (r=0.216, p=0.003 and individual cattle characteristics(r=0.139, p>0.01). The findings on cattle conditions exacerbate their vulnerability in presence of stressful conditions like droughts especially in calves and cows. This study demonstrates weak disease control efforts and unorganized husbandry practices. We propose strategic and focused disease control plans to improve cattle resilience and further research on livestock based factors as drought response metrics for the livestock livelihood.",

    "abstract": "Swelling of lymph nodes is commonly observed during the adaptive immune response, yet the impact on T cell trafficking and subsequent immune response is not well known. To better understand the effect of macro-scale alterations, we developed an agent-based model of the lymph node para-cortex, describing T cell trafficking and response to antigen-presenting dendritic cells alongside swelling-induced changes in T cell recruitment and egress, and regulation of expression of egress-modulating T cell receptor Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1. Analysis of effector T cell response under varying swelling conditions showed that swelling consistently aided T cell activation. However, subsequent effector CD8+ T cell production could be reduced if swelling occurred too early in the T cell proliferative phase or if T cell cognate frequency was low due to increased opportunity for T cell exit. Temporarily extending retention of newly differentiated effector T cells, mediated by Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 expression, mitigated any negative effects of swelling by allowing facilitation of activation to outweigh increased access to exit areas. These results suggest targeting temporary effector T cell retention and egress associated with swelling may offer new ways to modulate effector TC responses in, for example, immuno-suppressed patients and optimisation of vaccine design.",

Fossil shells from archeological excavations of the ancient settlements dating from the Neolithic period to Medieval and also from a drill hole of the Neopleistocene alluvial deposits were collected. In total nine species of bivalve molluscs from the families Margaritiferidae, Unionidae, Limnocardiidae, Glycymerididae, including one marine species, and two gastropod species from families Viviparidae and Planorbidae were identified. The time of the existence of each fossil species was determined by radiocarbon dating. It was found that the species ranged in age from more 50,000 and 2,080-1,210 years ago. Five species inhabited the Transbaikal region and are locally extirpated in the present. Their disjunctive ranges in the past included southern Europe and Western and Eastern Siberia to Transbaikalia and in the east to Far East and Primorye of Russia. The time of existence and extirpation of the thermophilic species of genera Adacna, Planorbis, Lanceolaria and Amuropaludina corresponds to cycles of the warming and cooling in Pleistocene and Holocene according to regional climate chronological scales. It was possible to separate these species as indicators of paleoclimate. Change of the species composition of the malacofauna of region connected with natural cycles of climatochrons in the Pleistocene and Holocene is the appearance of the climatogenic succession. In the course of this succession the disappearance of the stenothermal species occurred on a regional level and decreasing their global ranges.",

We identify 33 distinct 8-mer/9-mer peptides that are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes, along similar extents of viral mimicry observed in other viruses. Interestingly, 20 novel peptides have not been observed in any previous human coronavirus (HCoV) strains.

This mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made salient by the targeted genes being focally expressed in arteries, lungs, esophagus, pancreas, and macrophages.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEscherichia coli O157 is an emerging foodborne pathogen of great public health concern. It has been associated with bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. Most human infections have been traced to cattle and the consumption of contaminated cattle products. In order to understand the risk associated with the consumption of cattle products, this study sought to investigate the prevalence and identify virulence genes in E. coli O157 from cattle in Cameroon.\n\nMethodA total of 512 rectal samples were obtained and analysed using conventional bacteriological methods (enrichment on modified Tryptone Soy Broth and selective plating on Cefixime-Tellurite Sorbitol Mac-Conkey Agar) for the isolation of E. coli O157. Presumptive E. coli O157 isolates were confirmed serologically using E. COLIPRO O157 latex agglutination test and molecularly using PCR targeting the rfb gene in the isolates. Characterisation of the confirmed E. coli O157 strains was done by amplification of stx1, stx2, eaeA and hlyA virulence genes using both singleplex and multiplex PCR.\n\nResultsE. coli O157 was detected in 56 (10.9%) of the 512 samples examined. The presence of the virulence genes stx2, eaeA and hylA was demonstrated in 96.4% (54/56) of the isolates and stx1 in 40 (71.4%) of the 54. The isolates exhibited three genetic profiles (I-III) with I (stx1, stx2, eaeA and hlyA) being the most prevalent (40/56; 71.4%) while two isolates had none of the virulence genes tested.\n\nConclusionA proportion of cattle slaughtered in abattoirs in Buea are infected with pathogenic E. coli O157 and could be a potential source of human infections.

    "abstract": "BackgroundChaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) is one of the most promising antioxidants with incredible health-promoting effects. Chaga polysaccharides (IOP) have been reported to enhance immune response and alleviate oxidative stress during development. However, the effects of IOP on the genotoxicity in model organisms are yet to be clarified.\n\nMethodsZebrafish embryos (12 hours post fertilization, hpf) were exposed to transient UVB (12 J/m2/s, 310 nm) for 10 secs using a UV hybridisation chamber, followed by IOP treatment (2.5 mg/mL) at 24 hpf for up to 7 days post fertilization (dpf). The genotoxic effects were assessed using acridine orange staining, alkaline comet assay, and qRT-PCR for screening DNA repair genes.\n\nResultsWe found significant reduction in DNA damage and amelioration of the deformed structures in the IOP-treated zebrafish exposed to UVB (p < 0.05) at 5 dpf and thereafter. In addition, the relative mRNA expressions of XRCC-5, XRCC-6, RAD51, P53, and GADD45 were significantly upregulated in the IOP-treated UVB-exposed zebrafish. Pathway analysis demonstrated coordinated regulation of DNA repair genes, suggesting collective response during UVB exposure.\n\nConclusionsOverall, IOP treatment ameliorated the genotoxic effects in UVB-exposed zebrafish embryos, which eventually assisted in normal development. The study suggested the efficacy of Chaga mushroom polysaccharides in mitigating UV-induced DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "The acoustic startle response is an evolutionary conserved avoidance behavior. Disruptions in startle behavior, in particular startle magnitude, are a hallmark of several human neurological disorders. While the neural circuitry underlying startle behavior has been studied extensively, the repertoire of genes and genetic pathways that regulate this locomotor behavior has not been explored using an unbiased genetic approach. To identify such genes, we took advantage of the stereotypic startle behavior in zebrafish larvae and performed a forward genetic screen coupled with whole genome analysis. This identified mutants in eight genes critical for startle behavior, including two genes encoding proteins associated with human neurological disorders, Dolichol kinase (Dolk), a broadly expressed regulator of the glycoprotein biosynthesis pathway, and the potassium Shaker-like channel subunit Kv1.1. We demonstrate that Kv1.1 acts independently of supraspinal inputs to regulate locomotion, suggesting its site of action is within spinal circuitry. Moreover, we show that Kv1.1 protein is mis-localized in dolk mutants, suggesting they act in a common genetic pathway to regulate movement magnitude. Combined, our results identify a diverse set of eight genes all associated with human disorders that regulate zebrafish startle behavior and reveal a previously unappreciated role for Dolk and Kv1.1 in regulating movement magnitude via a common genetic pathway.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderlying all animal behaviors are neural circuits, which are controlled by numerous molecular pathways that direct neuron development and activity. To identify and study these molecular pathways that control behavior, we use a simple vertebrate behavior, the acoustic startle response, in the larval zebrafish. In response to an intense noise, larval zebrafish will quickly turn and swim away to escape. From a genetic screen, we have identified a number of mutants that behave in abnormal ways in response to an acoustic stimulus. We cloned these mutants and identified eight genes that regulate startle behavior. All eight genes are associated with human disorders, and here we focus on two genes, dolk and kcna1a, encoding Dolk, a key regulator of protein glycosylation, and the potassium channel Kv1.1, respectively. We demonstrate that loss of dolk or kcna1a causes larval zebrafish to perform exaggerated swim movements and that Dolk is required for Kv1.1 protein localization to axons of neurons throughout the nervous system, providing strong evidence that dolk and kcna1a act in a common molecular pathway. Combined, our studies provide new insights into the genetic regulation of startle behavior.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyzed the relationship between isokinetic knee and hip peak torques and Roundhouse-kick velocities and expertise level (Elite vs. Subelite) of Taekwondo athletes. Seven elite and seven sub-elite athletes were tested for kick kinematic, power of impact and for isokinetic peak torque (PT) at slow (60\u00b0/s) and high (240\u00b0/s) concentric mode. PTs were compared between groups and correlated with the data of kick performance. It was found inter-group differences in hip flexors and extensors PT at the isokinetic fast speed. The hip flexion PT at 60\u00b0/s and 240\u00b0/s were negatively correlated with the kick time (R = \u22120.46, and R = \u22120.62, respectively). Hip flexion torque at 60\u00b0/s was also positively correlated (R = 0.52) with the peak of linear velocity of the foot (LVF) and the power of impact (R = 0.51). Peak torque of hip extension at 60\u00b0/s and hip abduction at 240\u00b0/s were correlated with the LVF (R= 0.56 and R = 0.46). Discriminant analysis presented an accuracy of 85.7% in predicting expertise level based on fast torques of hip flexion and extension and on the knee extension velocity during the kick. This study demonstrated that hip muscles strength is probably the dominant muscular factor for determining kick performance. Knee angular velocity combined with hip torques are the best discriminators for the competitive level in taekwondo athletes.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The meaning of a word depends on its lexical semantics and on the context in which it is embedded. At the basis of this lays the distinction between lexical retrieval and integration, two basic operations supporting language comprehension. In this paper, we investigate how lexical retrieval and integration are implemented in the brain by comparing MEG activity to word representations generated by computational language models. We test both non-contextualized embeddings, representing words independently from their context, and contextualized embeddings, which instead integrate contextual information in their representations. Using representational similarity analysis over cortical regions and over time, we observed that brain activity in the left anterior temporal pole and inferior frontal regions shows higher similarity with contextualized word embeddings compared to non-contextualized embeddings, between 300 and 500 ms after word presentation. On the other hand, non-contextualized word embeddings show higher similarity with brain activity in the left lateral and anterior temporal lobe at earlier latencies - areas and latencies related to lexical retrieval. Our results highlight how lexical retrieval and context integration can be tracked in the brain using word embeddings obtained with computational models. These results also suggest that the distinction between lexical retrieval and integration might be framed in terms of context-independent and contextualized representations.",
