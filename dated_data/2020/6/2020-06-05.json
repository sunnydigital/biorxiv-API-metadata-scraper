    "abstract": "Bismuth compounds are known for their activity against multiple microorganisms; yet, the antibiotic properties of bismuth nanoparticles (BiNPs) remain poorly explored. The objective of this work is to further the research of BiNPs for nanomedicine, particularly as a disinfectant and for future treatments. Stable PVP-coated BiNPs were produced by a chemical reduction process, in less than 30 minutes, in a heated alkaline glycine solution, by the chelation and reduction of the bismuth (III) ion; resulting in the generation of small, spheroid particles with a crystalline organization. We assessed the antibacterial and antifungal activity of bismuth nanoparticles. PVP-BiNPs showed potent antibacterial activity against the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and antifungal activity against the opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, both under planktonic and biofilm growing conditions. Our results indicate that BiNPs represent promising antimicrobial nanomaterials, and this facile synthetic method may allow for further investigation of their activity against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Endolysins are bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases targeting the cell wall of host bacteria via their cell wall-binding domains (CBDs). The molecular basis for selective recognition of surface carbohydrate ligands by CBDs remains elusive. Here, we describe, in atomic detail, the interaction between the Listeria phage endolysin domain CBD500 and its cell wall teichoic acid (WTA) ligands. We show that 3 O-acetylated GlcNAc residues integrated into the WTA polymer chain are the key epitope recognized by a CBD binding cavity located at the interface of tandem copies of beta-barrel, pseudo-symmetric SH3b-like repeats. This cavity consists of multiple aromatic residues making extensive interactions with two GlcNAc acetyl groups via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, while permitting the docking of the diastereomorphic ligands. The multidisciplinary approach described here delineates a previously unknown recognition mechanism by which a phage endolysin specifically recognizes and targets WTA, suggesting an adaptable model for regulation of endolysin specificity.",

    "abstract": "Non-genetic mechanisms have recently emerged as important drivers of therapy failure in cancer (Salgia and Kulkarni, 2018), where some cancer cells can enter a reversible drug-tolerant persister state in response to treatment (Vallette et al., 2019). While most cancer persisters, like their bacterial counterparts, remain arrested in the presence of drug, a rare subset of cancer persisters can re-enter the cell cycle under constitutive drug treatment (Sharma et al., 2010). Little is known about the non-genetic mechanisms that enable cancer persisters to maintain proliferative capacity in the presence of drug. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we found that cycling persisters emerge early in the course of treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells with the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. To study this rare, transiently-resistant, proliferative persister population we developed Watermelon, a new high-complexity expressed barcode lentiviral library for simultaneous tracing each cells clonal origin, proliferative state, and transcriptional state. Analysis of Watermelon-transduced PC9 cells demonstrated that cycling and non-cycling persisters arise from different pre-existing cell lineages with distinct transcriptional and metabolic programs. The proliferative capacity of persisters is associated with an upregulation of antioxidant gene programs and a metabolic shift to fatty acid oxidation in specific subpopulations of tumor cells. Mitigating oxidative stress or blocking metabolic reprograming significantly alters the fraction of cycling persister cells. In human tumors, programs associated with cycling persisters were induced in malignant cells in response to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The Watermelon system enabled the identification of rare persister lineages, that are preferentially poised through specific gene programs to proliferate under drug pressure, thus exposing new vulnerabilities that can be targeted to delay or even prevent disease recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth and development involves an intricate program of cell division and cell expansion to generate different cell types, tissue patterns and organ shapes. Plant cells are stuck together by their cell walls and the spatial context of cells within tissues plays a critical role in cell fate specification and morphogenesis. An in vitro model system to study plant development and its regulation by various extrinsic and intrinsic factors requires the ability to mimic the physical interactions between cells and their environment. Here, we present a set of artificial scaffolds to which cultured tobacco BY-2 cells adhere without causing morphological abnormalities. These scaffolds mimic native plant cell walls in terms of their fibrous nature, charge, hydrophobicity and piezoelectricity. We found that the extent of plant cell adhesion was essentially insensitive to the stiffness, fiber dimension, and fiber orientation of the scaffolds, but was affected by the piezoelectric properties of scaffolds where adhesion increased on piezoelectric materials. We also found that the plant cell wall polysaccharide, pectin, is largely responsible for adhesion to scaffolds, analogous to pectin-mediated adhesion of plant cells in tissues. Together, this work establishes biomimetic scaffolds that realistically emulate the plant tissue environment and provide the capability to develop microfluidic devices to study how cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions affect plant developmental pathways.",

    "abstract": "Naked mole-rats are extraordinarily long-lived rodents that do not develop age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Remarkably, they do not accumulate amyloid plaques, even though their brains contain high concentrations of amyloid beta peptide, even from a young age Therefore, these animals offer an opportunity to investigate mechanisms of resistance against the neurotoxicity of amyloid beta aggregation. Working in this direction, here we examine the composition, phase behaviour, and amyloid beta interactions of naked mole-rat brain lipids. Relative to mouse, naked mole-rat brain lipids are rich in cholesterol and contain sphingomyelin in lower amounts and of shorter chain lengths. Proteins associated with metabolism of ceramides, sphingomyelin and ceramide receptor activity were also found to be decreased in naked mole-rat brain lysates. Correspondingly, we find that naked mole-rat brain lipid membranes exhibit a high degree of phase separation, with the liquid ordered phase occupying up to 80% of the supported lipid bilayer. These observations are consistent with the  membrane pacemaker hypothesis of ageing, according to which long-living species have lipid membranes particularly resistant to oxidative damage. However, we found that exposure to amyloid beta disrupts the naked mole-rat brain lipid membranes while those formed from mouse brain lipids exhibit small, well-defined footprints, whereby the amyloid beta penetrates deeply into the lipid membranes. These results suggest that in naked mole-rats the lipid composition of cell membranes may offer neuroprotection through resistance to oxidative processes rather than through mechanical effects.",

    "abstract": "In mitosis and meiosis, chromosome segregation is triggered by the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation, leading to the separation of chromatids. APC/C activation requires phosphorylation of its APC3 and APC1 subunits, which allows the APC/C to bind its Cdc20 co-activator. The identity of the kinase(s) responsible for APC/C activation in vivo is unclear. Cyclin B3 is required for meiotic anaphase in flies, worms and vertebrates, but whether it activates the APC/C is unclear. We found that Drosophila Cyclin B3 (CycB3) collaborates with PP2A-B55/Tws in embryonic development, indicating that CycB3 also promotes anaphase in mitosis. Moreover, CycB3 promotes APC/C activity and anaphase in cells in culture. We show that CycB3 physically associates with the APC/C, is required for phosphorylation of APC3, and promotes APC/C association with its co-activators. We propose that CycB3-Cdk1 directly phosphorylates the APC/C to activate it in both meiosis and mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of stable growth arrest that acts as a tumor suppressive mechanism. Several anti-cancer interventions function partly by inducing malignant cells into senescence. However, because of systemic administration and lack of specificity, anti-cancer treatments are associated with premature senescence of various non-malignant cells. Therapy-induced non-malignant senescent cells can have profound detrimental pro-tumorigenic and pro-disease functions via activation of a pro-inflammatory and NF-{kappa}B-mediated secretory phenotype (SASP). Inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6i) has recently shown to have potent cytostatic effects with reduced toxicities. Here, we show that CDK4/6i lead non-malignant cells to a senescent state that lacks the pro-inflammatory and NF-{kappa}B-associated SASP. Interestingly, CDK4/6i-induced senescence overexpressed a number of genes encoding for secreted proteins, which we show being dependent on p53 transcriptional activity. CDK4/6i-induced p16+ senescent cells with a p53-associated (PASP), but not NF-{kappa}B-associated (NASP), secretory phenotype do not exert detrimental and pro-tumorigenic functions, but still retain the capacity to induce paracrine senescence and undergo clearance in vivo. Our data suggest that that senescent cells with a PASP but without a NASP may be well-tolerated and may represent a less toxic outcome for cancer interventions.",
