    "abstract": "By means of the density functional theory (DFT) framework, the longstanding problem of the polymer brush bilayers at thermal equilibrium is studied. The calculated density profiles reveal that the brushes balance compression and interpenetration when they come into contact. The equation of state of the polymer brush bilayers is obtained and it represents scaling of the pressure with molecular parameters and distance between substrates. The results of this study may shed light in our understanding of some severe Musculoskeletal diseases which degrade the synovium. The significance of this study lays on the fact that the molecular structure is investigated through fundamental physical laws. So, this study bridges between theoretical biological physics and medicine.",

In this study, we collected gut microbiome activity (i.e., metatranscriptomic) data and measured the glycemic responses of 550 adults who consumed more than 30,000 meals from omnivore or vegetarian/gluten-free diets. We demonstrate that gut microbiome activity makes a statistically significant contribution to individual variation in glycemic response, in addition to anthropometric factors and the nutritional composition of foods. We describe predictive models (multilevel mixed-effects regression and gradient boosting machine) of variation in glycemic response among individuals ingesting the same foods. We introduce functional features aggregated from microbial activity data as candidates for association with mechanisms of glycemic control. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that metatranscriptomic activity of the gut microbiome is correlated with glycemic response among adults.",

    "abstract": "The importance of increasing photosynthetic efficiency for sustainable crop yield increases to feed the growing world population is well recognized. The natural genetic variation for leaf photosynthesis in crop plants is largely unexploited for increasing genetic yield potential. The genus Oryza, including cultivated rice and wild relatives, offers tremendous genetic variability to explore photosynthetic differences, and underlying biochemical, photochemical, and developmental bases. We quantified leaf photosynthesis and related physiological parameters for six cultivated and three wild rice genotypes, and identified photosynthetically efficient wild rice accessions. Fitting A/Ci curves and biochemical analyses showed that the leaf photosynthesis in cultivated rice varieties, IR64 and Nipponbare, was limited due to leaf nitrogen content, Rubisco activity, and electron transport rate compared to photosynthetically efficient accessions of wild rice Oryza australiensis and Oryza latifolia. The selected wild rice accessions with high leaf photosynthesis per unit area had striking anatomical features, such as larger mesophyll cells with more chloroplasts, fewer mesophyll cells between two consecutive veins, and higher mesophyll cell and chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular space. Our results show the existence of desirable variations in Rubisco activity, electron transport rate, and leaf anatomical features in the rice system itself that could be targeted for increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of cultivated rice varieties.\n\nHighlightDistinct leaf biochemical, photochemical, and developmental features contribute to efficient photosynthesis in the selected wild rice accessions that could potentially be exploited to increase rice leaf photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a key biomarker of automatic deviance detection thought to emerge from two cortical sources. First, the auditory cortex (AC) encodes spectral regularities and reports frequency-specific deviances. Then, more abstract representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) allow to detect contextual changes of potential behavioral relevance. However, the precise location and time asynchronies between neuronal correlates underlying this fronto-temporal network remain unclear and elusive. Our study presented auditory oddball paradigms along with  no-repetition controls to record mismatch responses in neuronal spiking activity and local field potentials at the rat medial PFC. Whereas mismatch responses in the auditory system are mainly induced by stimulus-dependent effects, we found that auditory responsiveness in the PFC was driven by unpredictability, yielding context-dependent, comparatively delayed, more robust and longer-lasting mismatch responses mostly comprised of prediction error signaling activity. This characteristically different composition discarded that mismatch responses in the PFC could be simply inherited or amplified downstream from the auditory system. Conversely, it is more plausible for the PFC to exert top-down influences on the AC, since the PFC exhibited flexible and potent predictive processing, capable of suppressing redundant input more efficiently than the AC. Remarkably, the time course of the mismatch responses we observed in the spiking activity and local field potentials of the AC and the PFC combined coincided with the time course of the large-scale MMN-like signals reported in the rat brain, thereby linking the microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic levels of automatic deviance detection.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe arrival of novel predators can trigger trophic cascades driven by shifts in prey numbers. Predators also elicit behavioural change in prey populations, via phenotypic plasticity and/or rapid evolution, and such changes may also contribute to trophic cascades. Here we document rapid demographic and behavioural changes in populations of a prey species (grassland melomys Melomys burtoni, a granivorous rodent) following the introduction of a novel marsupial predator (northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus). Within months of quolls appearing, populations of melomys exhibited reduced survival and population declines relative to control populations. Quoll-invaded populations (n = 4) were also significantly shyer than nearby, quoll-free populations (n = 3) of conspecifics. This rapid but generalised response to a novel threat was replaced over the following two years with more threat-specific antipredator behaviours (i.e. predator-scent aversion). Predator-exposed populations, however, remained more neophobic than predator-free populations throughout the study. These behavioural responses manifested rapidly in avoidance of seeds associated with quoll scent, with discrimination playing out over a spatial scale of tens of metres. Presumably the significant and novel predation pressure induced by quolls drove melomys populations to fine-tune behavioural responses to be more predator-specific through time. These behavioural shifts could reflect individual plasticity (phenotypic flexibility) in behaviour or may be adaptive shifts from natural selection imposed by quoll predation. Our study provides a rare insight into the rapid ecological and behavioural shifts enacted by prey to mitigate the impacts of a novel predator and shows that trophic cascades can be strongly influenced by behavioural changed rates of seed predation by melomys across treatments. Quoll-invaded melomys populations exhibited lower per-capita seed take rates, and rapidly developed an as well as numerical responses.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific crossing experiments have shown that sex chromosomes play a major role in reproductive isolation between many pairs of species. However, their ability to act as reproductive barriers, which hamper interspecific genetic exchange, has rarely been evaluated quantitatively compared to Autosomes. This genome-wide limitation of gene flow is essential for understanding the complete separation of species, and thus speciation. Here, we develop a mainland-island model of secondary contact between hybridizing species of an XY (or ZW) sexual system. We obtain theoretical predictions for the frequency of introgressed alleles, and the strength of the barrier to neutral gene flow for the two types of chromosomes carrying multiple interspecific barrier loci. Theoretical predictions are obtained for scenarios where introgressed alleles are rare. We show that the same analytical expressions apply for sex chromosomes and autosomes, but with different sex-averaged effective parameters. The specific features of sex chromosomes (hemizygosity and absence of recombination in the heterogametic sex) lead to reduced levels of introgression on the X (or Z) compared to autosomes. This effect can be enhanced by certain types of sex-biased forces, but it remains overall small (except when alleles causing incompatibilities are recessive). We discuss these predictions in the light of empirical data comprising model-based tests of introgression and cline surveys in various biological systems.",

However, most methodological reform attempts suffer from similar mistakes and over-generalizations to the ones they aim to address. We argue that this can be attributed in part to lack of formalism and first principles. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for formal statistical rigor and scientific nuance in methodological reform. To attain this rigor and nuance, we propose a five-step formal approach for solving methodological problems. To illustrate the use and benefits of such formalism, we present a formal statistical analysis of three popular claims in the metascientific literature: (a) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (b) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (c) that exploratory projects imply poor statistical practice. We show how our formal approach can inform and shape debates about such methodological claims.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriocins are proteinaceous antimicrobials produced by bacteria which are active against other strains of the same species. R-type pyocins are phage tail-like bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to their anti-pseudomonal activity, R-pyocins have potential as therapeutics in infection. P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and is particularly problematic for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). P. aeruginosa from CF lung infections develop increasing resistance to antibiotics, making new treatment approaches essential. P. aeruginosa populations become phenotypically and genotypically diverse during infection, however, little is known of the efficacy of R-pyocins against heterogeneous populations. R-pyocins vary by subtype (R1-R5), distinguished by binding to different residues on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Each type varies in killing spectrum, and each strain produces only one R-type. To evaluate the prevalence of different R-types, we screened P. aeruginosa strains from the International Pseudomonas Consortium Database (IPCD) and from our biobank of CF strains. We found that (i) R1-types were the most prevalent R-type among strains from respiratory sources; (ii) there is a large number of strains lacking R-pyocin genes, and (iii) isolates collected from the same patient have the same R-type. We then assessed the impact of intra-strain diversity on R-pyocin susceptibility and found a heterogenous response to R-pyocins within populations, likely due to differences in the LPS core. Our work reveals that heterogeneous populations of microbes exhibit variable susceptibility to R-pyocins and highlights that there is likely heterogeneity in response to other types of LPS-binding antimicrobials, including phage.\n\nImportanceR-pyocins have potential as alternative therapeutics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic infection, however little is known about the efficacy of R-pyocins in heterogeneous bacterial populations. P. aeruginosa is known to become resistant to multiple antibiotics, as well as evolve phenotypic and genotypic diversity over time; thus it is particularly difficult to eradicate in chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa populations from CF lungs maintain the same R-pyocin genotype but exhibit heterogeneity in susceptibility to R-pyocins from other strains. Our findings suggest there is likely heterogeneity in response to other types of LPS-binding antimicrobials, such as phage, highlighting the necessity of further studying the potential of LPS-binding antimicrobial particles as alternative therapies in chronic infections.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInter-individual variation in voluntary ethanol consumption and ethanol response is partially influenced by genetic variation. Discovery of the genes and allelic variants that affect these phenotypes may clarify the etiology and pathophysiology of problematic alcohol use, including alcohol use disorder. Genetically diverse mouse populations also demonstrate heritable variation in ethanol consumption and can be utilized to discover the genes and gene networks that influence this trait. The Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred strains, Diversity Outbred (DO) population and their eight founder strains are complementary mouse resources that capture substantial genetic diversity and can demonstrate expansive phenotypic variation in heritable traits. These populations may be utilized to discover candidate genes and gene networks that moderate ethanol consumption and other ethanol-related traits.\n\nMethodsWe characterized ethanol consumption, preference and pharmacokinetics in the eight founder strains and ten CC strains in 12-hour drinking sessions during the dark phase of the circadian cycle.\n\nResultsEthanol consumption was found to be substantially heritable, both early in ethanol access and over a chronic intermittent access schedule. Ethanol pharmacokinetics were also found to be heritable; however, no association between strain-level ethanol consumption and pharmacokinetics was detected. The PWK/PhJ strain was found to be the highest drinking strain, with consumption substantially exceeding C57BL/6J, a strain commonly used as a model of \"high\" or \"binge\" drinking. Notably, we found strong evidence that sex moderated genetic effects on voluntary ethanol drinking.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, this research may serve as a foundation for expanded genetic study of ethanol consumption in the CC/DO and related populations; moreover, we have identified reference strains with extreme consumption phenotypes that effectively represent polygenic models of hazardous ethanol use.",

    "abstract": "Methods to repair bone defects arising from trauma, resection, or disease, continue to be sought after. Cyclic mechanical loading is well established to influence bone (re)modelling activity, in which bone formation and resorption are correlated to micro-scale strain. Based on this, the application of mechanical stimulation across a bone defect could improve healing. However, if ignoring the mechanical integrity of defected bone, loading regimes have a high potential to either cause damage or be ineffective. This study explores real-time finite element (rtFE) methods that use three-dimensional structural analyses from micro-computed tomography images to estimate effective peak cyclic loads in a subject-specific and time-dependent manner. It demonstrates the concept in a cyclically loaded mouse caudal vertebral bone defect model. Using rtFE analysis combined with adaptive mechanical loading, mouse bone healing was significantly improved over non-loaded controls, with no incidence of vertebral fractures. Such rtFE-driven adaptive loading regimes demonstrated here could be relevant to clinical bone defect healing scenarios, where mechanical loading can become patient-specific and more efficacious. This is achieved by accounting for initial bone defect conditions and spatio-temporal healing, both being factors that are always unique to the patient.",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in sensing mechanical stress during muscle formation remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of the mechano-sensitive ion channel Piezo1 during myogenic progression. Direct manipulation of Piezo1 in muscle stem cells alters their myogenic progression. Indeed, Piezo1 knockdown suppresses myoblast fusion leading to smaller myotubes. Such event is accompanied by significant downregulation of the fusogenic protein Myomaker. In parallel, while Piezo1 knockdown also lowers Ca2+ influx in response to stretch, Piezo1 activation increases Ca2+ influx in response to stretch and enhances myoblasts fusion. We believe these findings may help understand molecular defects present in some muscle diseases. Altogether our study shows that Piezo1 is essential for terminal muscle differentiation acting on myoblast fusion, suggesting that Piezo1 deregulation may have implications in muscle aging and degenerative diseases including muscular dystrophies.",

In an age-varying sample of N = 68 healthy human participants, we characterise the covariation of saliva cortisol with perceptual sensitivity in an auditory pitch-discrimination task at five time points across the sleep--wake cycle. First, momentary saliva cortisol levels were captured well by the time relative to wake-up and overall sleep duration. Second, within individuals, higher cortisol level just prior to behavioural testing predicted better pitch discrimination ability, expressed as a steepened psychometric curve. This effect of glucocorticoids held under a set of statistical control models.

Furthermore, the measurement- and sampling uncertainties are separated from the process uncertainty, which is important when generating ecological predictions. Generally, increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition leads to more grass-dominated acid grassland habitats at the expense of the cover of forbs. Sandy soils are relatively more acidic, and the effect of soil type on the vegetation includes both direct effects of soil type and indirect effects mediated by the effect of soil type on soil pH. Both soil type and soil pH affected the vegetation of acid grasslands.

    "abstract": "A powerful tool to improve tissue integration with biomaterial scaffolds for the regeneration of damaged tissues is to promote cell migration using chemotactic gradients of growth factors. This approach has been realized by the exogenous delivery of growth factors, which unfortunately also limits the scaffolds ability to meet each wounds unique spatial and temporal regenerative needs. To address this limitation, we present a new approach to gradient generation by incorporating heparin microislands, which are spatially isolated heparin-containing microparticles that create chemotactic microgradients through reorganization of endogenous local growth factors. We incorporated heparin microislands within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds, which allows us to tune their incorporation ratiometrically to create a heterogenous microenvironment. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the ability of heparin microislands to organize uniform growth factors into spontaneous microgradients and control downstream cell migration in vitro. Further, we present their ability to significantly improve wound healing outcomes (epidermal regeneration and vascularization) in a diabetic wound model relative to two clinically relevant controls.",

    "abstract": "The current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic wreaks medical and socioeconomic havoc. Despite the availability of vaccines, cost-effective acute treatment options preventing morbidity and mortality are urgently needed. To identify affordable, ubiquitously available, and effective treatments, we tested herbs consumed worldwide as herbal teas regarding their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Aqueous infusions prepared by boiling leaves of the Lamiaceae perilla and sage elicit potent and sustained antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimens. The herbal infusions exerted antiviral effects comparable to interferon-{beta} and remdesivir but outperformed convalescent sera and interferon-2 upon short-term treatment early after infection. Based on protein fractionation analyses, we identified caffeic acid, perilla aldehyde, and perillyl alcohol as antiviral compounds. Global mass spectrometry (MS) analyses performed comparatively in two different cell culture infection models revealed changes of the proteome upon treatment with herbal infusions and provided insights into the mode of action. As inferred by the MS data, induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) was confirmed as effector mechanism by the antiviral activity of the HMOX-1-inducing compounds sulforaphane and fraxetin. In conclusion, herbal teas based on perilla and sage exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron.",

    "abstract": "Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are helical repeat-proteins that bind RNA in a modular fashion with a sequence-specificity that can be manipulated by the use of an amino acid code. As such, PPR repeats are promising scaffolds for the design of RNA binding proteins for synthetic biology applications. However, the in vivo functional capabilities of artificial PPR proteins built from consensus PPR motifs are just starting to be explored. Here, we report in vivo functions of an artificial PPR protein, dPPRrbcL, made of consensus PPR motifs that were designed to bind a sequence near the 5 end of rbcL transcripts in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. We used a functional complementation assay to demonstrate that this protein bound its intended RNA target with specificity in vivo and that it substituted for a natural PPR protein by stabilizing processed rbcL mRNA. We targeted a second protein of analogous design to the petL 5 UTR, where it substituted for the native stabilizing PPR protein PGR3, albeit inefficiently. These results showed that artificial PPRs can be engineered to functionally mimic the class of native PPR proteins that serve as physical barriers against exoribonucleases.",

Among therapeutic options6-8, the use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin (IVM), has been proposed, given its possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity9. Ivermectin is a positive allosteric modulator of the -7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor10, which has been suggested to represent a target for the control of Covid-19 infection11, with a potential immunomodulatory activity12. We assessed the effects of IVM in SARS-CoV-2-intranasally-inoculated golden Syrian hamsters. Even though ivermectin had no effect on viral load, SARS-Cov-2-associated pathology was greatly attenuated. IVM had a sex-dependent and compartmentalized immunomodulatory effect, preventing clinical deterioration and reducing olfactory deficit in infected animals. Importantly, ivermectin dramatically reduced the Il-6/Il-10 ratio in lung tissue, which likely accounts for the more favorable clinical presentation in treated animals. Our data support IVM as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS), is becoming the facto standard for bacterial typing and outbreak surveillance of resistant bacterial pathogens. We performed a three-center ring trial to assert if inter-laboratory harmonization of WGS is achievable, for this goal. To this end, a set of 30 bacterial isolates comprising of various species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus genera were selected and sequenced using the same protocol on the Illumina MiSeq platform in each individual centre. All generated sequencing data was analysed by 1 centre using BioNumerics (6.7.3) for i) genotyping origin of replications & antimicrobial resistance genes, ii) core-genome (cgMLST) for E. coli and K. pneumoniae & whole-genome multi locus sequencing typing (wgMLST) for all species. Additionally, a split k-mer analysis was performed to determine the number of SNPs between samples. A precision of 99.0% and an accuracy of 99.2% was achieved for genotyping. Based on cgMLST, only in 2/27 and 3/15 comparisons a discrepant allele was called between two genomes, for E. coli and K. pneumonia, respectively. Based on wgMLST, the number of discrepant alleles ranged from 0 to 7 (average 1.6). For SNPs, this ranged from 0-11 SNPs (average 3.4). Furthermore, we demonstrate that using different de novo assemblers to analyse the same dataset introduces up to 150 SNPs, which surpasses most thresholds for bacterial outbreaks. This shows the importance of harmonisation of data processing surveillance of bacterial outbreaks. Summarizing, multi-center WGS for bacterial surveillance is achievable, but only if protocols are harmonized.",

    "abstract": "The aspirin derivative salicylate selects against bacterial multidrug efflux pumps of Escherichia coli K-12 such as MdtEF-TolC and EmrAB-TolC, and acid stress regulators such as GadE. Salicylate uptake is driven by the transmembrane pH gradient ({Delta}pH) and the proton motive force (PMF) which drives many efflux pumps. We used flow cytometry to measure the fitness tradeoffs of salicylate, bile acids, and extreme low pH for E. coli cultured with pump deletants. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump conferred a fitness advantage in the presence of bile acids, an efflux substrate. Without bile acids, AcrA incurred a small fitness cost. The fitness advantage with bile acids was eliminated by the PMF uncoupler CCCP. The Gad acid fitness island encodes components of MdtEF-TolC (an acid-adapted efflux pump) as well as acid regulator GadE. The fitness advantage of E. coli cocultured with a Gad deletant ({Delta}slp-gadX) was lost in the presence of salicylate. Salicylate caused an even larger fitness cost for GadE. MdtE incurred negative or neutral fitness under all media conditions, as did EmrA. But when the competition cycle included two hours at pH 2, MdtE conferred a fitness advantage. The MdtE advantage required the presence of bile acids. Thus, the MdtEF-TolC pump is useful to E. coli for transient extreme acid exposure comparable to passage through the acidic stomach. Salicylate selects against some multidrug efflux pumps, whereas bile acids selects for them; and these fitness tradeoffs are amplified by extreme acid.\n\nIMPORTANCEControl of drug resistance in gut microbial communities is a compelling problem for human health. Growth of gut bacteria is limited by host-produced acids such as bile acids, and may be modulated by plant-derived acids such as salicylic acid. Membrane-soluble organic acids can control bacterial growth by disrupting membranes, decreasing cell pH, and depleting PMF. Our flow cytometry assay measures the fitness effects of exposure to membrane-soluble organic acids, with growth cycles that may include a period of extreme acid. We find that extreme-acid exposure leads to a fitness advantage for a multidrug pump, MdtEF-TolC, which otherwise incurs a large fitness cost. Thus, organic acids and stomach acid may play important roles in controlling multidrug resistance in the gut microbiome. Therapeutic acids might be developed to limit the prevalence of multidrug resistance pumps in environmental and host-associated communities.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has initiated a global pandemic and vaccines are being rapidly developed. Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To assess the durability of immunity, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-primary infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets against infection, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity.\n\nImportanceThe SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.",

    "abstract": "The marine roseobacter-clade Affiliated cluster (RCA) represents one of the most abundant groups of bacterioplankton in the global oceans, particularly in temperate and sub-polar regions. They play a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of various elements and are important players in oceanic climate-active trace gas metabolism. In contrast to copiotrophic roseobacter counterparts such as Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 and Phaeobacter sp. MED193, RCA bacteria are truly pelagic and have smaller genomes. We have previously shown that RCA bacteria do not appear to encode the PlcP-mediated lipid remodelling pathway, whereby marine heterotrophic bacteria remodel their membrane lipid composition in response to phosphorus (P) stress by substituting membrane glycerophospholipids with alternative glycolipids or betaine lipids. In this study, we report lipidomic analysis of six RCA isolates. In addition to the commonly found glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine, RCA bacteria synthesise a relatively uncommon phospholipid, acylphosphatidylglycerol, which is not found in copiotrophic roseobacters. Instead, like the abundant SAR11 clade, RCA bacteria upregulate ornithine lipid biosynthesis in response to P stress, suggesting a key role of this aminolipid in the adaptation of marine heterotrophs to oceanic nutrient limitation.",

    "abstract": "Metals are essential to all forms of life and their concentration and distribution in the organisms are tightly regulated. Indeed, in their free form, metal ions are toxic. Therefore, an excess of physiologic metal ions or the uptake of non-physiologic metal ions can be highly detrimental for the organisms. It is thus fundamental to understand metals distribution and dynamics in physiologic or disrupted conditions, for instance in metal-related pathologies or upon environmental exposure to metals. Elemental imaging techniques can serve this purpose, by allowing the visualization and the quantification of metal species in a tissue or down to the interior of a cell. Among these techniques, synchrotron radiation-based X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) microscopy is the most sensitive to date, and great progresses were made to reach spatial resolutions as low as 20x20 nm2. Until recently, 2D XRF mapping was used on whole cells, thus summing up the signal from the whole thickness of the cell. In the last two years, we have developed a methodology to work on thin cell sections, in order to analyze the metal content at the level of the organelle. Herein, we propose a correlative method to couple SR-XRF to electron microscopy, with the aim to quantify the elemental content in an organelle of interest. As a proof-of-concept, the technique was applied to the analysis of mitochondria from hepatocytes exposed to silver nanoparticles. It was thus possible to identify mitochondria with higher concentration of Ag(I) ions compared to the surrounding cytosol. The versatility of the method makes it suitable to answer a large panel of biological questions, for instance related to metal homeostasis in biological organisms.",

In Cnidaria, the frequency of appendage regeneration in the moon jellyfish Aurelia was increased by feeding with the amino acid L-leucine and the growth hormone insulin. In insects, the same strategy induced tibia regeneration in adult Drosophila. Finally, in mammals, L-leucine and sucrose administration induced digit regeneration in adult mice, including dramatically from mid-phalangeal amputation. The conserved effect of L-leucine and insulin/sugar suggests a key role for energetic parameters in regeneration induction. The simplicity by which nutrient supplementation can induce appendage regeneration provides a testable hypothesis across animals.",

    "abstract": "Hazara population across Durand-line has experienced extensive interaction with Central Asian and East Asian populations. Hazara individuals have typical Mongolian facial appearances and they called themselves descendants of Genghis Khans army. The people who speak the Balochi language are called Baloch. Previously, a worldwide analysis of Y-chromosomal haplotype diversity for rapidly mutating (RM) Y-STRs and with PowerPlex Y23 System (Promega Corporation Madison, USA) kit was created with collaborative efforts, but Baloch and Hazara population from Pakistan and Hazara population from Afghanistan were missing. A limited data with limited number of markers and samples is available which poorly define these populations. So, in the current study, Yfiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit loci were examined in 260 unrelated Hazara individuals from Afghanistan, 153 Hazara individuals, and 111 Balochi individuals from Baluchistan Pakistan. For the Hazara population from Afghanistan and Pakistan overall, 380 different haplotypes were observed on these 27 Y-STR loci, gene diversities ranged from 0.51288 (DYS389I) to 0.9257 (DYF387S1) and haplotype diversity was 0.9992 +/- 0.0004. For the Baloch population, every individual was unique at 27 Y-STR loci, gene diversity ranged from 0.5718 (DYS460) to 0.9371(DYF387S1). Twelve haplotypes shared between 178 individuals while only two haplotypes among these twelve were shared between 87 individuals in Hazara populations. Rst and Fst pairwise genetic distance analyses, multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot, Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree, linear discriminatory analysis (LDA), and median-joining network (MJNs) were performed, which shed light on the history of Hazara and Baloch populations. Interestingly null alleles were observed at DYS448 with specific mutation patterns in Hazara populations. The results of our study showed that the Yfiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit marker set provided substantially stronger discriminatory power in the Baloch population of Pakistan and the Hazara population across the Durand-line.",

    "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA methylating agent, is the primary chemotherapeutic drug used in glioblastoma treatment. TMZ induces mostly N-alkylation adducts (N7-methylguanine and N3-methyladenine) and some O6-methylguanine (O6mG). Current models propose that during DNA replication, thymine is incorporated across from O6mG, promoting a futile cycle of mismatch repair (MMR) that leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). To revisit the mechanism of O6mG processing, we reacted plasmid DNA with N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), a temozolomide mimic, and incubated it in Xenopus egg extracts. We show that in this system, mismatch repair (MMR) proteins are enriched on MNU-treated DNA and we observe robust, MMR-dependent, repair synthesis. Our evidence also suggests that MMR, initiated at O6mG:C sites, is strongly stimulated in cis by repair processing of other lesions, such as N-alkylation adducts. Importantly, MNU-treated plasmids display DSBs in extracts, the frequency of which increased linearly with the square of alkylation dose. We suggest that DSBs result from two independent repair processes, one involving MMR at O6mG:C sites and the other involving BER acting at a nearby N-alkylation adducts. We propose a new, replication-independent mechanism of action of TMZ, that operates in addition to the well-studied cell cycle dependent mode of action.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule (MT) nucleation is regulated by the {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}TuRC), conserved from yeast to humans. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {gamma}TuRC is composed of seven identical {gamma}-tubulin small complex ({gamma}TuSC) sub-assemblies which associate helically to template microtubule growth. {gamma}TuRC assembly provides a key point of regulation for the MT cytoskeleton. Here we combine cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structures of both monomeric and dimeric {gamma}TuSCs, and open and closed helical {gamma}TuRC assemblies in complex with Spc110p to elucidate the mechanisms of {gamma}TuRC assembly. {gamma}TuRC assembly is substantially aided by the evolutionarily conserved CM1 motif in Spc110p spanning a pair of adjacent {gamma}TuSCs. By providing the highest resolution and most complete views of any {gamma}TuSC assembly, our structures allow phosphorylation sites to be mapped, surprisingly suggesting that they are mostly inhibitory. A comparison of our structures with the CM1 binding site in the human {gamma}TuRC structure at the interface between GCP2 and GCP6 allows for the interpretation of significant structural changes arising from CM1 helix binding to metazoan {gamma}TuRC.",

    "abstract": "The replication of chromosomes during S phase is critical for cellular and organismal function. Replicative stress can result in genome instability, which is a major driver of cancer. Yet how chromatin is made accessible during eukaryotic DNA synthesis is poorly understood.\n\nHere, we report the identification of a novel class of chromatin remodeling enzyme, entirely distinct from classical SNF2-ATPase family remodelers. Yta7 is a AAA+-ATPase that assembles into ~ 1 MDa hexameric complexes capable of segregating histones from DNA. Yta7 chromatin segregase promotes chromosome replication both in vivo and in vitro. Biochemical reconstitution experiments using purified proteins revealed that Yta7s enzymatic activity is regulated by S phase-forms of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (S-CDK). S-CDK phosphorylation stimulates ATP hydrolysis by Yta7, promoting nucleosome disassembly and chromatin replication.\n\nOur results present a novel mechanism of how cells orchestrate chromatin dynamics in co-ordination with the cell cycle machinery to promote genome duplication during S phase.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays an important role in health and disease, but the archaeal diversity therein remains largely unexplored. Here we report the pioneering analysis of 1,167 non-redundant archaeal genomes recovered from human gastrointestinal tract microbiomes across countries and populations. We identified three novel genera and 15 novel species including 52 previously unknown archaeal strains. Based on distinct genomic features, we warrant the split of the Methanobrevibacter smithii clade into two separate species, with one represented by the novel Candidatus M. intestini.\n\nPatterns derived from 1.8 million proteins and 28,851 protein clusters coded in these genomes showed substantial correlation with socio-demographic characteristics such as age and lifestyle. We infer that archaea are actively replicating in the human gastrointestinal tract and are characterized by specific genomic and functional adaptations to the host. We further demonstrate that the human gut archaeome carries a complex virome, with some viral species showing unexpected host flexibility. Our work furthers our current understanding of the human archaeome, and provides a large genome catalogue for future analyses to decipher its role and impact on human physiology.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/392621v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3e0060org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8adb45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41c087org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c6fdf9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe human gut archaeome analysis reveals a previously unseen active diversity\nC_LIO_LIThe most abundant methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, splits into two species\nC_LIO_LIArchaeal protein catalogue can predict geography, demographics and health aspects\nC_LIO_LIHost-associated and environmental archaea show distinct genomic & functional traits\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutations in PRESENILIN 2 (PSEN2) cause early disease onset familial Alzheimers disease (EOfAD) but their mode of action remains elusive. One consistent observation for all PRESENILIN gene mutations causing EOfAD is that a transcript is produced with a reading frame terminated by the normal stop codon - the \"reading frame preservation rule\". Mutations that do not obey this rule do not cause the disease. The reasons for this are debated.\n\nMethodsA frameshift mutation (psen2N140fs) and a reading frame-preserving mutation (psen2T141_L142delinsMISLISV) were previously isolated during genome editing directed at the N140 codon of zebrafish psen2 (equivalent to N141 of human PSEN2). We mated a pair of fish heterozygous for each mutation to generate a family of siblings including wild type and heterozygous mutant genotypes. Transcriptomes from young adult (6 months) brains of these genotypes were analysed. Bioinformatics techniques were used to predict cellular functions affected by heterozygosity for each mutation.\n\nResultsThe reading frame preserving mutation uniquely caused subtle, but statistically significant, changes to expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, long term potentiation and the cell cycle. The frameshift mutation uniquely affected genes involved in Notch and MAPK signalling, extracellular matrix receptor interactions and focal adhesion. Both mutations affected ribosomal protein gene expression but in opposite directions.\n\nConclusionA frameshift and frame-preserving mutation at the same position in zebrafish psen2 cause discrete effects. Changes in oxidative phosphorylation, long term potentiation and the cell cycle may promote EOfAD pathogenesis in humans.",

They demonstrated that modulating miR-34 and its downstream target Eip74EF showed beneficial effects on age-related diseases using a Drosophila model of SCA3trQ78. These results imply that miR-34 could be a general genetic modifier and therapeutic candidate for age-related diseases. Therefore, we examined the effect of miR-34 and Eip74EF on another age-related Drosophila disease model. Using a Drosophila model expressing mutant Drosophila VCP that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), we demonstrated that abnormal eye phenotypes generated by Drosophila VCP R152H were rescued when expressed with Eip74EF siRNA. Contrary to our expectation, miR-34 overexpression resulted in lethality when expressed with mutant VCP. Our data indicate that the other downstream targets of miR-34 might more significantly interact with mutant VCP, causing lethality. Identifying transcriptional targets of Eip74EF might provide valuable insights into diseases caused by mutations in VCP such as ALS, FTD, and MSP.",

    "abstract": "In cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling can formally adjudicate between theories and affords quantitative fits to behavioral/brain data. Pragmatically, however, the space of plausible generative models considered is dramatically limited by the set of models with known likelihood functions. For many models, the lack of a closed-form likelihood typically impedes Bayesian inference methods. As a result, standard models are evaluated for convenience, even when other models might be superior. Likelihood-free methods exist but are limited by their computational cost or their restriction to particular inference scenarios. Here, we propose neural networks that learn approximate likelihoods for arbitrary generative models, allowing fast posterior sampling with only a one-off cost for model simulations that is amortized for future inference. We show that these methods can accurately recover posterior parameter distributions for a variety of neurocognitive process models. We provide code allowing users to deploy these methods for arbitrary hierarchical model instantiations without further training.",

The results showed that number of previous childbirths was negatively associated with WM brain age, potentially indicating a protective effect of parity on brain WM later in life. Both global WM and grey matter brain age estimates showed unique contributions to the association with previous childbirths, suggesting partly independent processes. Corpus callosum contributed uniquely to the global WM association with previous childbirths, and showed a stronger relationship relative to several other tracts.

    "abstract": "The dynamical organization of brain networks is essential to support human cognition and emotion for rapid adaption to ever-changing environment. As the core nodes of emotion-related brain circuitry, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) as two major amygdalar nuclei, are recognized to play distinct roles in affective functions and internal states, via their unique connections with cortical and subcortical structures in rodents. However, little is known how the dynamical organization of emotion-related brain circuitry reflects internal autonomic responses in humans. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with K-means clustering approach in a total of 79 young healthy individuals (cohort 1: 42; cohort 2: 37), we identified two distinct states of BLA- and CMA-based intrinsic connectivity patterns, with one state (integration) showing generally stronger BLA- and CMA-based intrinsic connectivity with multiple brain networks, while the other (segregation) exhibiting weaker yet dissociable connectivity patterns. In an independent cohort 2 of fMRI data with concurrent recording of skin conductance, we replicated two similar dynamic states and further found higher skin conductance level in the integration than segregation state. Moreover, machine learning-based Elastic-net regression analyses revealed that time-varying BLA and CMA intrinsic connectivity with distinct network configurations yield higher predictive values for spontaneous fluctuations of skin conductance level in the integration than segregation state. Our findings highlight dynamic functional organization of emotion-related amygdala nuclei circuits and networks and its links to spontaneous autonomic arousal in humans.",

    "abstract": "VirB is a key regulator of virulence genes located on the large virulence plasmid (pINV) of the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri. VirB is unusual in that it is not related to other transcriptional regulators, instead, it belongs to a protein family that primarily functions in plasmid and chromosome partitioning; exemplified by ParB. Despite this, VirB does not function to segregate DNA, but rather counters transcriptional silencing of virulence genes mediated by the nucleoid structuring protein, H-NS. Since ParB localizes subcellularly as discrete foci in the bacterial cytoplasm, we chose to investigate the subcellular localization of VirB to gain novel insight into how VirB functions as a transcriptional anti-silencer. To do this, a GFP-VirB fusion that retains the regulatory activity of VirB and yet, does not undergo significant protein degradation in S. flexneri, was used. Surprisingly, discrete fluorescent foci were observed in live wild-type S. flexneri cells and an isogenic virB mutant using fluorescence microscopy. In contrast, foci were rarely observed (<10%) in cells cured of pINV. Moreover, in the context of the fusion, amino acid substitutions in the DNA binding domain of VirB resulted in the fluorescent signal becoming entirely diffuse. Combined, these data demonstrate that the VirB:DNA interactions required for the transcriptional anti-silencing activity of VirB on pINV are a prerequisite for the subcellular localization of VirB in the bacterial cytoplasm. The significance of these findings, in light of the anti-silencing activity of VirB, is discussed.\n\nImportanceThis study reveals the subcellular localization of VirB, a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes found on the large virulence plasmid in Shigella. Fluorescent signals generated by an active GFP-VirB fusion form 2, 3, or 4 discrete foci in the bacterial cytoplasm, predominantly at the quarter cell position. These signals are completely dependent upon VirB interacting with its DNA binding site found either on the virulence plasmid or an engineered surrogate. Our findings: 1) provide novel insight into VirB:pINV interactions, 2) suggest that VirB may have utility as a DNA marker, and 3) raise questions about how and why this anti-silencing protein that controls virulence gene expression on pINV of Shigella spp. forms discrete foci/hubs within the bacterial cytoplasm.",

Phages in Cluster AZ and Microbacterium Cluster EH, as well as the former Microbacterium singleton Zeta1847, exhibited low nucleotide similarity but gene content similarity in excess of the recently adopted Microbacterium clustering parameter, which resulted in the reassignment of Zeta1847 to Cluster EH. Additionally, Clusters AZ and EH phages encode a shared integrase indicative of a lysogenic life cycle; in the first experimental verification of a Cluster AZ phages life cycle, we show that phage Powerpuff is a true temperate phage and forms stable lysogens that exhibit immunity to superinfection by related phages, despite lacking identifiable repressors typically required for lysogenic maintenance and superinfection immunity. The ability of phage Powerpuff to undergo and maintain lysogeny suggests that other closely related phages encoding an integrase but lacking an identified repressor may be temperate as well. Our findings further highlight the importance of using multiple metrics to capture phage relatedness, provide additional evidence of significant shared phage genomic content spanning multiple actinobacterial host genera, and demonstrate the continued need for verification and characterization of life cycles in newly isolated phages.",

    "abstract": "About 150 post-transcriptional RNA modifications have been identified in all kingdoms of life. During RNA catabolism, most modified nucleosides are resistant to degradation and are released into the extracellular space. In this study, we explored the physiological role of these extracellular modified nucleosides and found that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), widely known as an epigenetic mark in RNA, acts as a ligand for the adenosine A3 receptor, for which it has greater affinity than unmodified adenosine. Structural modeling defined the amino acids required for specific binding of m6A to the A3 receptor. m6A is dynamically released in response to cytotoxic stimuli and facilitates type I allergy. Our findings shed light on m6A as a signaling molecule with the ability to activate GPCRs, a previously unreported property of RNA modifications.",

    "abstract": "Human DNA methylation data have previously been used to develop highly accurate biomarkers of aging (\"epigenetic clocks\"). Subsequent studies demonstrate that similar epigenetic clocks can also be developed for mice and many other mammals. Here, we describe epigenetic clocks for common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) based on novel DNA methylation data generated from highly conserved mammalian CpGs that were profiled using a custom Infinium array (HorvathMammalMethylChip40). From these, we developed and present here, two epigenetic clocks for marmosets that are applicable to whole blood samples. We find that the human-marmoset clock for relative age exhibits moderately high age correlations in two other non-human primate species: vervet monkeys and rhesus macaques. In a separate cohort of marmosets, we tested whether intervention with rapamycin, a drug shown to extend lifespan in mice, would alter the epigenetic age of marmosets, as measured by the marmoset epigenetic clocks. These clocks did not detect significant effects of rapamycin on the epigenetic age of marmoset blood. The common marmoset stands out from other mammals in that it is not possible to build accurate estimators of sex based on DNA methylation data: the accuracy of a random forest predictor of sex (66%) was substantially lower than that observed for other mammals (which is close to 100%). Overall, the epigenetic clocks developed here for the common marmoset are expected to be useful for age estimation of wild-born animals and for anti-aging studies in this species.",

    "abstract": "Biofertilization via the inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), combined with rhizobia and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), are beginning to become established as an effective and sustainable measure to improve yields. Biofertilization might have a particular potential to boost the yield of intercropping systems in rainfed areas because AMF can form a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) that can transfer nutrients and water between two plants and balance as such belowground competition. In this study, we tested if biofertilizers can enhance the yield of intercropping systems using a pigeon pea (PP) - finger millet (FM) intercropping system grown for two consecutive growing seasons (2016/17 and 2017/18) at two contrasting sites in Bengaluru and Kolli Hills, India. To validate the process of bioirrigation (transfer of water between rhizosphere of two plants), we tested, for the first time, if the spatial arrangement of intercropped plants using either a row-wise or a mosaic design affected yield and water relations with and without biofertilizers. Our results demonstrate that intercropping can improve the straw and grain yield in PP-FM intercropping compared to the respective monocultures but that intercropping effects vary depending on the site characteristic such as climate and soil type. Spatial arrangement of component plants affected the total, straw and grain biomass in intercropping treatments, but this effect also varied across sites. Most importantly, the results from the 2017-18 growing season clearly demonstrated a positive effect of biofertilizer on biomass yield, and this effect was irrespective of site, spatial arrangement, mixed or monoculture. Despite a yield increase in intercropping, we did not see a positive effect of biofertilization on water relations of FM possibly due to interspecific competition for soil moisture where PP dominated. In summary, our study shows the potential of biofertilizers to increase the yield of intercropping systems in rainfed dryland agriculture.",

The algorithm analyses a video of a beehive with 13,624 frames, acquired at 25 frames/second. The algorithm employs the following traditional image processing steps: conversion to grayscale, low pass filtering, background subtraction, thresholding, tracking and clustering to detect run of bees that perform waggle dances. The algorithm detected 44,530 waggle events, i.e. one bee waggling in one time frame, which were then clustered into 511 waggle runs. Most of these were concentrated in one section of the hive. The accuracy of the tracking was 90% and a series of metrics like intra-dance variation in angle and duration were found to be consistent with literature. Whilst this algorithm was tested on a single video, the ideas and steps, which are simple as compared with Machine and Deep Learning techniques, should be attractive for researchers in this field who are not specialists in more complex techniques.",

As such, it offers an unprecedented window onto the neural mechanisms governing the evolution of behavior. Here we report adaptations to gray matter morphology resulting from selection for tameness vs. aggressive response toward humans. Contrasting with prior work in other domesticated species, tame foxes did not show reduced brain volume. Rather, gray matter volume in both the tame and aggressive strains was increased relative to foxes bred without selection on behavior. Furthermore, tame- and aggressive-enlarged regions overlapped substantially, including portions of motor, somatosensory, and prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum. We also observed differential morphological covariation across distributed gray matter networks. In one prefrontal-hypothalamic network, this covariation differentiated the tame and aggressive foxes together from the conventional strain. These findings indicate that selection for opposite behaviors can influence brain morphology in a similar way.",

    "abstract": "1The arrival of submillimetre ultra high-field fMRI makes it possible to compare activation profiles across cortical layers. However, the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal measured by Gradient-Echo fMRI is biased towards superficial layers of the cortex, which is a serious confound for laminar analysis. Several univariate and multivariate analysis methods have been proposed to correct this bias. We compare these methods using computational simulations and example human 7T fMRI data from Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) during a visual attention paradigm. The simulations show that two methods - the ratio of ROI means across conditions and a novel application of Deming regression - offer the most robust correction for superficial bias. Deming regression has the additional advantage that it does not require that the conditions differ in their mean activation over voxels within an ROI. When applied to the example dataset, these methods suggest that attentional modulation of activation is similar across cortical layers within the ventral visual stream, despite a naive activation-based analysis producing stronger modulation in superficial layers. Our study demonstrates that accurate correction of superficial bias is crucial to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions from laminar analyses of Gradient-Echo fMRI data.",

Real time quantitative PCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry Assay were used to detect the expression and localization of related genes. CO-IP was used to detect direct protein interactions between Myocardin and STAT3. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to detect the binding of Myocardin to the promoter of a downstream target gene. Microinjection of zebrafish embryos was used to examine the effects of STAT3 and Myocardin interactions on cardiac development in vivo\n\nResultsThe N-terminus of STAT3 directly binds to the basic domain of myocardin and inhibits the transcriptional activity of Myocardin-mediated cardiac-specific genes ANF and -actinin, thereby inhibiting their expression, and further inhibit myocardin-mediated cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, our report states that signal transduction and transcriptional activation factor 3 (STAT3) are inhibitors of the major cardiac hypertrophic transcription factor Myocardiin, which is required for cardiomyocyte differentiation. The STAT3-cardiacin interaction identified nuclear hormone receptor-mediated and cardiac-specific gene-regulated convergence sites and suggested a possible mechanism for cardioprotective effects.",

    "abstract": "As obligatory parasites, plant viruses alter host cellular metabolism. There is a lack of information on the variability of virus-induced metabolic responses among genetically diverse plants in a natural context with daily changing conditions. To decipher the metabolic landscape of plant-virus interactions in a natural setting, one hundred and thirty-two and twenty-six accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana were inoculated with Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), in two field experiments over 2 years. The accessions were phenotyped for viral accumulation, above-ground biomass, targeted and untargeted metabolic profiles. The accessions revealed quantitative response to the virus, from susceptibility to resistance. Susceptible accessions accumulate primary and secondary metabolites upon infection, at the cost of hindered growth. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed that the primary metabolites sucrose, glucose and glutamate discriminate susceptible and resistant accessions. Twenty-one metabolic signatures were found to significantly accumulate in resistant accessions whereas they maintained their growth at the same level as mock-inoculated plants without biomass penalty.\n\nMetabolic content was demonstrated to discriminate and to be highly predictive of the susceptibility of inoculated Arabidopsis. The PLS coefficient estimated in the training data set reveals, after cross-validation, a correlation of 0.61 between predicted and true viral accumulation. This study is the first to describe the metabolic landscape of plant-virus interactions in a natural setting and its predictive link to susceptibility. It reveals that, in this undomesticated species and in ecologically realistic conditions, growth and resistance are in a permanent conversation and provides new insights on plant-virus interactions.",

We performed seed-based analyses, using the left inferior frontal gyrus and left posterior temporal gyrus as seeds. Then, we analyzed connectivity between executive control networks and language network in each group. Finally, we used multivariate pattern analyses to test whether the two groups could be distinguished based on the pattern of atrophy within the language network; atrophy within the executive control networks, as well as the pattern of functional connectivity within the language network; and functional connectivity within executive control networks. AD participants had language impairment during standardized language tasks and connected-speech production. Univariate analyses were not able to discriminate participants at this stage, while multivariate pattern analyses could significantly predict the group membership of prodromal patients and healthy controls, both when classifying atrophy patterns or connectivity patterns of the language network. Language functional networks could discriminate AD participants better than executive control networks. Most notably, they revealed an increased connectivity at a prodromal stage. Multivariate analyses represent a useful tool for investigating the functional and structural (re-)organization of the neural bases of language.\n\nHighlightsLanguage network connectivity discriminates prodromal AD from healthy controls\n\nLanguage network connectivity increases in prodromal AD\n\nAtrophy patterns in the language network do not correlate with connectivity patterns in AD",

    "abstract": "The Shox2 homeodomain transcriptional regulator is known for its critical functions during mouse embryogenesis, enabling accurate development of limbs, craniofacial structures, neural populations and the cardiac conduction system. At the genomic level, the Shox2 gene is flanked by an extensive gene desert, a continuous non-coding genomic region spanning over 500 kilobases that contains a multitude of evolutionarily conserved elements with predicted cis-regulatory activities. However, the transcriptional enhancer potential of the vast majority of these elements in combination with the biological necessity of the gene desert have not yet been explored. Using transgenic reporter assays in mouse embryos to validate an extensive set of stringent epigenomic enhancer predictions, we identify several novel gene desert enhancers with distinct tissue-specific activities in Shox2 expressing tissues. 4C-seq chromatin conformation capture further uncovers a repertoire of gene desert enhancers with overlapping activities in the proximal limb, in a compartment essential for Shox2-mediated stylopod formation. Leveraging CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the gene desert region contained in the Shox2 topologically associated domain (TAD), we demonstrate that this complex cis-regulatory platform is essential for embryonic survival and required for control of region-specific Shox2 expression in multiple developing tissues. While transcription of Shox2 in the embryonic limb is only moderately affected by gene desert loss, Shox2 expression in craniofacial and cardiac domains is nearly abolished. In particular, Shox2 transcripts in the sinus venosus (SV) encompassing the sinoatrial node (SAN) were depleted in embryos lacking the gene desert, likely accounting for the embryonic lethality due to Shox2-dependency of the SAN pacemaker. Finally, we discover a 1.5kb SV enhancer within the deleted gene desert region, which may act as a genomic module controlling the development of the cardiac conduction system. In summary, our results identify a gene desert indispensable for pleiotropic patterning and highlight the importance of these extensive regulatory landscapes for embryonic development and viability.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSAnopheles coluzzii is one of the primary vectors of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, it has colonized the main cities of Central Africa threatening vector control programs. The adaptation of An. coluzzii to urban environments is partly due to an increased tolerance to organic pollution and insecticides. While some of the molecular mechanisms for ecological adaptation, including chromosome rearrangements and introgressions, are known, the role of transposable elements (TEs) in the adaptive processes of this species has not been studied yet. To assess the role of TEs in rapid urban adaptation, the first step is to accurately annotate TE insertions in the genomes of natural populations collected in urban settings.\n\nResultsWe sequenced using long-reads six An. coluzzii genomes from natural breeding sites in two major Central Africa cities. We de novo annotated the complete set of TEs in these genomes and in an additional high-quality An. coluzzii genome available and identified 64 previously undescribed TE families. TEs were non-randomly distributed throughout the genome with significant differences in the number of insertions of several superfamilies across the studied genomes. We identified seven putatively active families with insertions near genes with functions related to vectorial capacity. Moreover, we identified several TE insertions providing promoter and transcription factor binding sites to insecticide resistance and immune-related genes.\n\nConclusionsThe analysis of multiple genomes sequenced using long-read technologies allowed us to generate the most comprehensive TE annotations in this species to date. We identified several TE insertions that could potentially impact both genome architecture and the regulation of functionally relevant genes in An. coluzzii. These results provide a basis for future studies of the impact of TEs on the biology of An. coluzzii.",

    "abstract": "A road-map of the genetic and phenotypic diversities in both crops and their wild-related species can help identifying valuable genetic resources for further crop breeding. The clary sage (Salvia sclarea L.), a perfume, medicinal and aromatic plant, is used for sclareol production and ornamental purposes. Despite its wide use in the field of cosmetics, the phenotypic and genetic diversity of wild and cultivated clary sage remains to be explored. We characterized the genetic and phenotypic variation of a collection of six wild S. sclarea populations from Croatia, sampled along an altitudinal gradient, and of populations of three S. sclarea cultivars. We showed low level of genetic diversity for the two S. sclarea traditional cultivars used for essential oil production and for ornamental purposes, respectively. In contrast, a recent cultivar resulting from new breeding methods, which involve hybridizations among several genotypes rather than traditional recurrent selection and self-crosses over time, showed high genetic diversity. We also observed a marked phenotypic differentiation for the ornamental clary sage compared with other cultivated and wild clary sages. Instead, the two cultivars used for essential oil production, a traditional and a recent, respectively, were not phenotypically differentiated from the wild Croatian populations. Our results also featured some wild populations with high sclareol content and early-flowering phenotypes as good candidates for future breeding programs. This study opens up perspectives for basic research aiming at understanding the impact of breeding methods on clary sage evolution, and highlights interesting avenues for clary breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "In human occipitotemporal cortex, brain responses to depicted inanimate objects have a large-scale organization by real-world object size. Critically, the size of objects in the world is systematically related to behaviorally-relevant properties: small objects are often grasped and manipulated (e.g., forks), while large objects tend to be less motor-relevant (e.g., tables), though this relationship does not always have to be true (e.g., picture frames and wheelbarrows). To determine how these two dimensions interact, we measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants viewed a stimulus set of small and large objects with either low or high motor-relevance. The results revealed that the size organization was evident for objects with both low and high motor-relevance; further, a motor-relevance map was also evident across both large and small objects. Targeted contrasts revealed that typical combinations (small motor-relevant vs. large non-motor-relevant) yielded more robust topographies than the atypical covariance contrast (small non-motor-relevant vs. large motor-relevant). In subsequent exploratory analyses, a factor analysis revealed that the construct of motor-relevance was better explained by two underlying factors: one more related to manipulability, and the other to whether an object moves or is stable. The factor related to manipulability better explained responses in lateral small-object preferring regions, while the factor related to object stability (lack of movement) better explained responses in ventromedial large-object preferring regions. Taken together, these results reveal that the structure of neural responses to objects of different sizes further reflect behavior-relevant properties of manipulability and stability, and contribute to a deeper understanding of some of the factors that help the large-scale organization of object representation in high-level visual cortex.\n\nHighlights- Examined the relationship between real-world size and motor-relevant properties in the structure of responses to inanimate objects.\n- Large scale topography was more robust for contrast that followed natural covariance of small motor-relevant vs. large non-motor-relevant, over contrast that went against natural covariance.\n- Factor analysis revealed that manipulability and stability were, respectively, better explanatory predictors of responses in small- and large-object regions.",

Dysfunction in the sense of agency has been suggested as a cause of auditory hallucinations (AHs), an important diagnostic criterion for schizophrenia. However, agency over speech has not been extensively characterized in previous empirical studies. Here, we examine both implicit and explicit measures of the sense of agency and reveal bottom-up and top-down components that constitute self-agency during speech. The first is action-outcome causality, which is perceived based on a low-level sensorimotor process when hearing their own voice following their speech. The second component is self-voice identity, which is embedded in the acoustic quality of voice and dominantly influences agency over speech at the cognitive judgment level. Our findings provide profound insight into the sense of agency over speech and present an informative perspective for understanding aberrant experience in AHs.",

We demonstrate here that overexpression of the patatin-like phospholipase variant CapVQ329R but not CapV causes pronounced sulA-independent pyridoxine-inhibited cell filamentation and restriction of swimming and flagella production of Escherichia coli K-12 derivative MG1655. Mutational analyses of CapVQ329R indicated conserved amino acids in canonical patatin-like phospholipase A motifs, but not the nucleophilic serine to be required for the observed phenotypes. Furthermore, CapVQ329R alters rdar biofilm formation including expression of the biofilm activator CsgD. Moreover, commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains and Salmonella typhimurium also responded with cell filamentation and alteration in biofilm formation. In conclusion, this work identifies the CapV variant CapVQ329R as a pleiotropic regulator, emphasizes a scaffold function for patatin-like phospholipases and highlights the role of a single amino acid change for the evolution of protein functionality.",

The only known post-translational modification of Api5 is acetylation at lysine 251 (K251). K251 acetylation of Api5 is responsible for maintaining its stability while de-acetylated form of Api5 is unstable. This study aimed to find out the enzymes regulating acetylation and deacetylation of Api5 and the effect of acetylation on its function. Our studies suggest that acetylation of Api5 at lysine 251 is mediated by p300 histone acetyltransferase while de-acetylation is carried out by HDAC1. Inhibition of acetylation by p300 leads to reduction in Api5 levels while inhibition of deacetylation by HDAC1 results in increased levels of Api5. This dynamic switch between acetylation and deacetylation regulate the localization of Api5 in the cell. This study also demonstrates that the regulation of acetylation and deacetylation of Api5 is an essential factor for the progression of the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Lipid Droplet (LD) is a ubiquitous cellular organelle that stores natural lipids as an energy and carbon source. It has emerged as a highly active organelle, engaged in lipid synthesis, protein storage, protein degradation, transportation, and metabolism. It stores natural lipids in the form of triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters. TAGs consider promising biotechnological importance to produce biodiesel; thus, LD is considered a tremendous scientific concern in the modern era. The TAG accumulation is found in various feedstocks, but amongst the microorganisms becomes an evident alternative against animal and plant-derived sources due to economic reasons. Amid microorganisms, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a better alternative for industrial utilization but has low production of TAGs. Thus, to enhance the LD concentration, novel research was designed to induce alternate high and low sound frequency at a regular interval on a yeast model organism. The control and treated yeast samples further investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and computational tools to conclude that cells increase lipid droplet production under regulative noise exposure. The results endorsed that noise induces yeast LD yield is significantly higher than control, which could be considered a milestone in the biodiesel industry development and the biodiesel policy. This analysis also helps researchers to understand the novel function of LDs and their regulation in cell metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Cell replacement therapy is emerging as an important approach in novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Many problems remain, in particular improvements are needed in the survival of transplanted cells and increasing functional integration into host tissue. These problems arise because of immune rejection, suboptimal precursor cell type, trauma during cell transplantation, toxic compounds released by dying tissues and nutritional deficiencies. We recently developed an ex vivo system to facilitate identification of factors contributing to the death of transplanted neuronal (photoreceptor) and showed 2.8-fold improvement in transplant cell survival after pre-treatment with a novel glycopeptide (PKC-100). In this study we extended these studies to look at cell survival, maturation and functional integration in an in vivo rat model of rhodopsin-mutant retinitis pigmentosa causing blindness. We found that only when human photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) were pre-incubated with PKX-100 prior to transplantation, did the cells integrate and mature into cone photoreceptors expressing S-opsin or L/M opsin. In addition, ribbon synapses were observed in the transplanted cells suggesting they were making synaptic connections with the host tissue. Furthermore, optokinetic tracking and electroretinography responses in vivo were significantly improved compared to cell transplants without PKX-100 pre-treatment. These data demonstrate that PKX-100 promotes significant long-term stem cell survival in vivo, providing a platform for further investigation towards the clinical application to repair damaged or diseased retina.",

Caenorhabditis elegans germline stem cells (GSCs) are distinctly accessible for intravital imaging; however, long-term image acquisition and analysis of dividing GSCs can be technically challenging. Here we present a systematic investigation into the technical factors impacting GSC physiology during live imaging and provide an optimized method for monitoring GSC mitosis under minimally disruptive conditions. We describe CentTracker, an automated and generalizable image analysis tool that uses machine learning to pair mitotic centrosomes and which can extract a variety of mitotic parameters rapidly from large-scale datasets. We employ CentTracker to assess a range of mitotic features in GSCs and show that subpopulations with distinct mitotic profiles are unlikely to exist within the stem cell pool. We further find evidence for spatial clustering of GSC mitoses within the germline tissue and for biases in mitotic spindle orientation relative to the germlines distal-proximal axis, and thus the niche. The technical and analytical tools provided herein pave the way for large-scale screening studies of multiple mitotic processes in GSCs dividing in situ, in an intact tissue, in a living animal, under seemingly physiological conditions.",

Individuals of one species can invade a nearest-neighbor site in the lattice, while individuals of the other species are able to invade sites at any distance but are less competitive locally, i.e., they establish with a probability g[&le;] 1. The model also accounts for immigration, modeled as an external noise that may spontaneously replace an individual at a lattice site by another individual of the other species. This combination of mechanisms gives rise to a rich variety of outcomes for species competition, including exclusion of either species, mono-stable coexistence of both species at different population proportions, and bi-stable coexistence with proportions of populations that depend on the initial condition. Remarkably, in the bi-stable phase, the system undergoes a discontinuous transition as the intensity of immigration overcomes a threshold, leading to an irreversible loop dynamics that may cause the loss of the species with shorter dispersal range.",

    "abstract": "In the era of emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne diseases, a high throughput trap-based insect monitoring is essential for the identification of invasive species, study of mosquito populations and risk assessment of disease outbreaks. Insect DNA metabarcoding technology has emerged as a highly promising methodology for unbiased and large-scale surveillance. Despite significant attempts to introduce DNA metabarcoding in mosquito or other insect surveillance qualitative and quantitative metabarcoding remains a challenge. In the present study, we have developed a methodology of in-tandem identification and quantification using cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) combined with a secondary multilocus identification and quantification involving three loci of 28S ribosomal DNA. The presented methodology was able to identify individual species in pools of mosquitoes with 95.94% accuracy and resolve with high accuracy (p = 1,{chi} 2 = 2.55) mosquito population composition providing a technology capable of revolutionizing mosquito surveillance through metabarcoding. The methodology, given the respective dataset, has the potential to be applied to various small animal populations.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient involved in a large diversity of cellular metabolism, included in the physiology of nervous system and pain modulation. There is little evidence for the role of Zn nutritional alternations to the onset and progression of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. We investigate the effects of a zinc restricted diet on the development of pain. Weaned mice were submitted to different diets: AIN-93 (38mg/kg of Zn) and Zn-deficient (AIN-93 with 11mg/kg of Zn), during four weeks. Mechanical allodynia was measured weekly using Von Frey hairs. Plantar assays for cold and heat allodynia, formalin-induced nociception and carrageenan-induced mechanical allodynia were performed at the 4th week. Plasma, DRG and livers samples were obtained for biochemical and metabolomics analysis. Zn deficient diet completely changed mice sensitivity pattern, inducing an intense allodynia evoked by mechanical, cold and heat stimulus since weaning and during four weeks. Showed also an increased sensitivity of neurogenic phase of formalin test but the inflammatory pain behavior was drastically reduced. Zn restriction increased the ATF-3 and SOD-1 levels at DRG and reduced that of GFAP, leading an increase of neuronal activation and oxidative stress, and reduced neuroimmune activity. Plasma TNF was also reduced and metabolomics analyses suggest a downregulation of lipid metabolism of arachidonic acid, reinforcing the impact of Zn restriction to the inflammatory response. Reduction of Zn intake interferes in pain circuits, reducing inflammatory pain, however enhancing nociceptive pain. Accordingly, Zn imbalance could be predisposing factor for NP development. Therefore, dietary zinc supplementation and its monitoring present clinical relevance.",

Genetically encoded Forster Resonance Energy Transfer sensors for glucose have been designed and optimized extensively, and a full series of affinity mutants is available for in vivo studies. However, to date, only a single improved sensor FLIPsuc-90{micro}{Delta}1 with a Km for sucrose of [~]90 {micro}M is available for sucrose monitoring. This sucrose sensor was engineered on the basis of an Agrobacterium tumefaciens sugar binding protein. Here, we took a two-step approach to first systematically improve the dynamic range of the FLIPsuc nanosensor and then expand the detection range from micromolar to millimolar sucrose concentrations by mutating a key residue in the binding site. The resulting series of sucrose sensors may allow systematic investigation of sucrose transporter candidates and comprehensive in vivo analyses of sucrose concentration in plants. Since FLIPsuc-90{micro} also detects trehalose in animal cells, the new series of sensors can be used to investigate trehalose transporter candidates and monitor trehalose steady-state levels in vivo as well.",

However, probabilistic models for indel evolution are under-developed due to their computational complexity. Here we introduce several improvements to indel modeling: (1) while previous models for indel evolution assumed that the rates and length distributions of insertions and deletions are equal, here, we propose a richer model that explicitly distinguishes between the two; (2) We introduce numerous summary statistics that allow Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) based parameter estimation; (3) We develop a neural-network model-selection scheme to test whether the richer model better fits biological data compared to the simpler model. Our analyses suggest that both our inference scheme and the model-selection procedure achieve high accuracy on simulated data. We further demonstrate that our proposed indel model better fits a large number of empirical datasets and that, for the majority of these datasets, the deletion rate is higher than the insertion rate. Finally, we demonstrate that indel rates are negatively correlated to the effective population size across various phylogenomic clades.",

Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole body of a multicellular organism. As core of this framework, we introduce our tool cell2cell, which uses the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs to compute the potential for intercellular interactions, and we test it across the Caenorhabditis elegans body. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C. elegans cells, we also implement a genetic algorithm to identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells. Validating the spatial code extracted with this strategy, the resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the inferred cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, for selected cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the communicatory behavior inferred with cell2cell and the genetic algorithm. Thus, our framework helps identify a code that predicts the spatial organization of cells across a whole-animal body.",

Uncovering the genetic variations associated with the diversity in rice populations is the key to breed stable and high yielding rice varieties.

Our studies reveal various chromosomal regions that are significantly associated with different traits in Bangladeshi rice varieties. We also identified various candidate genes, which are associated with these traits. This study reveals multiple candidate genes within short intervals. We also identified SNP loci, which are significantly associated with multiple yield-related traits. The results of these association studies support previous findings as well as provide additional insights into the genetic diversity of rice. This is the first known GWAS study on various yield-related traits in the varieties of Oryza sativa available in Bangladesh - the fourth largest rice producing country. We believe this study will accelerate rice genetics research and breeding stable high-yielding rice in Bangladesh.",

As compared to known marker genes, we have found more orthologous genes of these new marker genes in corresponding rice single cell clusters.

Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is an imaging technique that allows interrogation of tissue stiffness in-vivo and has found utility in the imaging of several cancers. We investigate the relationship between MRI features, MRE features, and growth parameters derived from an established mathematical model of glioma proliferation and invasion. Results suggest that both the relationship between tumor volume and tumor stiffness as well as the relationship between the parameters derived from the mathematical model and tumor stiffness are sex-dependent.

    "abstract": "ER bodies are endoplasmic reticulum-derived organelles present in plants belonging to the Brassicales order. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ER bodies are ubiquitous in cotyledons and roots, and present only in certain cell types in rosette leaves. However, both wounding and jasmonic acid treatment induce the formation of ER bodies in leaves. Formation of this structure is dependent on the transcription factor NAI1. The main components of the ER bodies are {beta}-glucosidases (BGLUs), enzymes that hydrolyze specialized compounds. In Arabidopsis, PYK10 (BGLU23) and BGLU18 are the most abundant ER body proteins. In this work, we found that ER bodies are downregulated as a consequence of the immune responses induced by bacterial flagellin perception. Arabidopsis mutants defective in ER body formation show enhanced responses upon flagellin perception and enhanced resistance to bacterial infections. Furthermore, the bacterial toxin coronatine induces the formation of de novo ER bodies in leaves and its virulence function is partially dependent on this structure. Finally, we show that performance of the polyphagous beet armyworm herbivore, Spodoptera exigua, increases in plants lacking ER bodies. Altogether, we provide new evidence for the role of the ER bodies in plant immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Decoding the dynamics of cellular decision-making and cell differentiation is a central question in cell and developmental biology. A common network motif involved in many cell-fate decisions is a mutually inhibitory feedback loop between two self-activating  master regulators A and B, also called as toggle switch. Typically, it can allow for three stable states - (high A, low B), (low A, high B) and (medium A, medium B). A toggle triad - three mutually repressing regulators A, B and C, i.e. three toggle switches arranged circularly (between A and B, between B and C, and between A and C) - can allow for six stable states: three  single positive and three  double positive ones. However, the operating principles of larger toggle polygons, i.e. toggle switches arranged circularly to form a polygon, remain unclear. Here, we simulate using both discrete and continuous methods the dynamics of different sized toggle polygons. We observed a pattern in their steady state frequency depending on whether the polygon was an even or odd numbered one. The even-numbered toggle polygons result in two dominant states with consecutive components of the network expressing alternating high and low levels. The odd-numbered toggle polygons, on the other hand, enable more number of states, usually twice the number of components with the states that follow  circular permutation patterns in their composition. Incorporating self-activations preserved these trends while increasing the frequency of multistability in the corresponding network. Our results offer insights into design principles of circular arrangement of regulatory units involved in cell-fate decision making, and can offer design strategies for synthesizing genetic circuits.",

    "abstract": "The last common ancestor of Bilateria and Cnidaria is believed to be one of the first animals to develop a nervous system over 500 million years ago. Many of the genes involved in the neural function of the advanced nervous system in Bilateria are well conserved in Cnidaria1. Thus, Cnidarian representative species, Hydra, is considered to be a living fossil and a good model organism for the study of the putative primitive nervous system in its last common ancestor. The diffuse nervous system of Hydra consists of several peptidergic neuron subsets. However, the specific functions of these subsets remain unclear. Using calcium imaging, here we show that the neuron subsets that express neuropeptide, Hym-1762,3 function as motor neurons to evoke longitudinal contraction. We found that all neurons in a subset defined by the Hym-176 gene (Hym-176A) or its paralogs (Hym-176B) expression4 are excited simultaneously, which is then followed by longitudinal contraction. This indicates not only that these neuron subsets are motor neurons but also that a single molecularly defined neuron subset forms a single coactive motor circuit. This is in contrast with the Bilaterian nervous system, where a single molecularly defined neuron subset harbors multiple coactive circuits, showing a mixture of neurons firing with different timings5. Furthermore, we found that the two motor circuits, one expressing Hym-176B in the body column and the other expressing Hym-176A in the foot, are coordinately regulated to exert region-specific contraction. Our results demonstrate that one neuron subset is likely to form a monofunctional circuit as a minimum functional unit to build a more complex behavior in Hydra. We propose that this simple feature (one subset, one circuit, one function) found in Hydra is a fundamental trait of the primitive nervous system.",

Previous studies have reported age-related domain-specific changes in older adults, showing increased difficulty encoding and processing object information but minimal to no impairment in processing spatial information compared to younger adults.\n\nHowever, few of these studies have examined age-related changes in the encoding of concurrently presented object and spatial stimuli, specifically the integration of both spatial and non-spatial (object) information. To more closely resemble real-life memory encoding and the integration of both spatial and non-spatial information, the current study developed a new experimental paradigm with novel environments that allowed for the placement of different objects in different positions within the environment. The current findings show that older adults have decreased performance in recognizing changes of the object position within the spatial context but no significant differences in recognizing changes in the identity of the object within the spatial context compared to younger adults. These findings suggest there may be potential age-related differences in the mechanisms underlying the representations of complex environments and furthermore, the integration of spatial and non-spatial information may be differentially processed relative to independent and isolated representations of object and spatial information.",

In everyday self-touch, as when stroking the left arm with the right hand, these elements are inextricably linked, meaning that tactile and motor contributions to spatial perception cannot readily be disentangled. Here, we developed a robot-mediated form of self-touch in order to decouple the spatial extent of active or passive movements from their tactile consequences. Participants judged the spatial extent of either the movement of the right hand, or of the resulting tactile stimulation to their left forearm. Across five experiments, we found bidirectional interference between motor and tactile information. Crucially, both directions of interference were stronger during active than passive movements. Thus, voluntary motor commands produced stronger integration of multiple signals relevant to spatial perception.",

Our data in sham-operated young and aged mice show the normal age-associated decline in cerebral blood flow and differential gene expression. BCAS and ageing caused broadly similar effects, however, BCAS-induced changes in hippocampal gene expression differed between young and aged mice. Specifically, transcriptomic analysis indicated that in comparison to young sham mice, many pathways altered by BCAS in young mice resembled those present in sham aged mice. Immunoblot analyses confirmed these findings. Finally, relative to young sham mice the cell type-specific profile of genes in both young BCAS and old sham animals further revealed common cell-specific genes. Our data provide a genetic-based molecular framework for chronic hypoperfusion-induced hippocampal damage and reveal common cellular signaling pathways likely to be important in the pathophysiology of VaD.",

    "abstract": "Human perception of touch is mediated by inputs from multiple channels. Classical theories postulate independent contributions of each channel to each tactile feature, with little or no interaction between channels. In contrast to this view, we show that inputs from two sub-modalities of mechanical input channels interact to determine tactile perception. The flutter-range vibration channel was activated anomalously using hydroxy--sanshool, a bioactive compound of Szechuan pepper, which chemically induces tingling sensations. We tested whether this tingling sensation on the lips was modulated by sustained mechanical pressure. Across four experiments, we show that sustained touch inhibits sanshool tingling sensations in a location-specific, pressure-level and time-dependent manner. Additional experiments ruled out mediation of nociceptive or affective (C-tactile) channels underlying this interaction. These results reveal novel inhibitory influence from steady-pressure onto flutter-range tactile perceptual channels, consistent with early-stage interactions between mechanoreceptor inputs within the somatosensory pathway.",

    "abstract": "Low-level states of consciousness are characterised by disruptions of brain dynamics that sustain arousal and awareness. Yet, how structural, dynamical, local and network brain properties interplay in the different levels of consciousness is unknown. Here, we studied the fMRI brain dynamics from patients that suffered brain injuries leading to a disorder of consciousness and from subjects undergoing propofol-induced anaesthesia. We showed that pathological and pharmacological low-level states of consciousness displayed less recurrent, less diverse, less connected, and more segregated synchronization patterns than conscious states. We interpreted these effects using whole-brain models built on healthy and injured connectomes. We showed that altered dynamics arise from a global reduction of network interactions, together with more homogeneous and more structurally constrained local dynamics. These effects were accentuated using injured connectomes. Notably, these changes lead the hub regions to lose their stability during low-level states of consciousness, thus attenuating the core-periphery structure of brain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex constituted of TASOR, MPP8 and Periphilin is involved in the spreading of H3K9me3 repressive marks across genes and transgenes such as ZNF encoding genes, ribosomal DNAs, LINE-1, Retrotransposons and Retroelements or the integrated HIV provirus1-5. The deposit of these repressive marks leads to heterochromatin formation and inhibits gene expression. The precise mechanisms of silencing mediated by HUSH is still poorly understood. Here, we show that TASOR depletion increases the accumulation of transcripts derived from the HIV-1 LTR promoter at a post-transcriptional level. By counteracting HUSH, Vpx from HIV-2 mimics TASOR depletion. With the use of a Yeast-Two-Hybrid screen, we identified new TASOR partners involved in RNA metabolism including the RNA deadenylase CCR4-NOT complex scaffold CNOT1. TASOR and CNOT1 interact in vivo and synergistically repress HIV expression from its LTR. In fission yeast, the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex presents structural homology with HUSH. During transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II, RITS recruits a TRAMP-like RNA degradation complex composed of CNOT1 partners, MTR4 and the exosome, to ultimately repress gene expression via H3K9me3 deposit. Similarly, we show that TASOR interacts and cooperates with MTR4 and the exosome, in addition to CNOT1. We also highlight an interaction between TASOR and RNA Polymerase II, predominantly under its elongating state, and between TASOR and some HUSH-targeted nascent transcripts. Furthermore, we show that TASOR overexpression facilitates the association of the aforementioned RNA degradation proteins with RNA polymerase II. Altogether, we propose that HUSH operates at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to repress HIV proviral gene expression.",

While non-parametric methods for quantifying and comparing hypervolumes are popular, they do not support a partitioning of the different components and drivers of hypervolume variation. Here, we propose as alternative the use of multivariate normal distributions for the assessment and comparison of niche hypervolumes and introduce this as the multivariate-normal hypervolume (MVNH) framework.\nC_LIO_LIThe framework provides parametric measures of the size and dissimilarity of niche hypervolumes, each of which can be partitioned into biologically interpretable components. Specifically, We use 1) the determinant of the covariance matrix (i.e. the generalized variance) of a MVNH as a measure of total niche size, which can be partitioned into the components of univariate niche variances and a correlation component; and 2) the Bhattacharyya distance between two MVNHs as a measure of niche dissimilarity, which can be partitioned into the components of Mahalanobis distance between hypervolume centroids and the determinant ratio which measures hypervolume size difference.\nC_LIO_LIWe use empirical examples of community- and species-level analysis to demonstrate the new insights provided by these metrics. We show that the newly proposed framework enables us to quantify the relative contributions of different hypervolume components and to identify the drivers of functional diversity and environmental niche variation.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach overcomes several operational and computational limitations of non-parametric methods and provides a framework that offers both unification and granularity in the assessment of niche volumes and differences, which has wide implications for understanding niche evolution, niche shifts and expansion during biotic invasions etc.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Although vaccination has been remarkably effective against some pathogens, for others, rapid antigenic evolution results in vaccination conferring only weak and/or short-lived protection. Consequently, considerable effort has been invested in developing more evolutionarily robust vaccines, either by targeting highly conserved components of the pathogen (universal vaccines) or by including multiple immunological targets within a single vaccine (multi-epitope vaccines). An unexplored third possibility is to vaccinate individuals with one of a number of qualitatively different vaccines, creating a  mosaic of individual immunity in the population. Here we explore whether a mosaic vaccination strategy can deliver superior epidemiological outcomes to  conventional vaccination, in which all individuals receive the same vaccine. We suppose vaccine doses can be distributed between distinct vaccine  targets (e.g., different surface proteins against which an immune response can be generated) and/or immunologically-distinct variants at these targets (e.g., strains); the pathogen can undergo antigenic evolution at both targets. Using simple mathematical models, we show that mosaic vaccination often outperforms conventional vaccination, leading to fewer infected individuals, improved vaccine efficacy, and lower individual risks over the course of the epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Biological scaffold or implant is a popular choice for the preparation of tissue-engineered organs and has the potential to address donor shortage in the clinics. However, biological scaffolds prepared by physical or chemical agents cause damage to the extracellular matrix by potentially inducing immune responses after implantation. The current study explores an alternative route for the preparation of acellular scaffolds and explores the fate of the prepared scaffolds in a milieu of immune cells following implantation without using immunosuppressant. Using the syngeneic (Lewis male-Lewis female) and allogeneic (Brown Norway male-Lewis female) models and different tissue routes (subcutaneous vs omentum) for transplantation, normal blood vascular scaffolds were implanted which was converted to acellular vascular scaffolds by in vivo natural decellularization at the end of 2 months of observation. We also prepared chemically decellularized acellular scaffolds from normal untreated blood vascular scaffolds using a cocktail of chemicals which was also similarly placed in subcutaneous and omentum sites. Here, we applied in-depth quantitative proteomics along with histology and image analysis to comprehensively describe and compare the proteome of the natural and chemically decellularized scaffold. Our data confirm that site-specific advantages exist in modulating the ECM and regulating the immune responses (macrophage and T cells) following implantation, which possibly led to the production of an acellular scaffold (natural decellularization) under in vivo conditions. The current approach opens up the possibility to create tailor-made acellular scaffolds to build functional blood vessels. In addition, the identification of different tissue sites facilitates differential immune response against the scaffolds. This study provides a rich resource aimed toward an enhanced mechanistic understanding to study immune responses under similar settings in the field of transplantation and regenerative medicine.\n\nImpact statementThe development of a scaffold helps in the preparation of a functional organ in the clinics. In the current study, we prepared an acellular vascular scaffold by utilizing site specific tissue changes and vis-a-vis compared with a conventionally chemically prepared biological scaffold at genomic and protein level, which helped us to identify immunological trigger following implantation. The current study which was carried out without any immunosuppressive agents could help to establish (a) alternative strategies for preparing biological scaffolds as well as (b) implantable sites as potential bioreactors to circumvent any adverse immune reactions for acceptance of the scaffold/implant post implantation.",

    "abstract": "Multiciliated cells (MCCs) in the brain include the ependymal cells and choroid plexus (CP) epithelial cells. The CP secretes cerebrospinal fluid that circulates within the ventricular system, driven by ependymal cilia movement. However, the mechanisms and functional significance of multiciliogenesis in the CP remain unknown. Deregulated oncogenic signals cause CP carcinoma (CPC), a rare but aggressive pediatric brain cancer. Here we show that aberrant NOTCH and Sonic Hedgehog signaling in mice drive tumors that resemble CPC in humans. NOTCH-driven CP tumors were monociliated, whereas disruption of the NOTCH complex restored multiciliation and decreased tumor growth. NOTCH suppressed multiciliation in tumor cells by inhibiting the expression of GEMC1 and MCIDAS, early regulators of multiciliogenesis. Consistently, GEMC1-MCIDAS function is essential for multiciliation in the CP, and is critical for correcting multiciliation defect in tumor cells by a NOTCH inhibitor. Disturbances to the GEMC1 program are commonly observed in human CPCs characterized by solitary cilia. Consistently, CPC driven by deletion of Trp53 and Rb1 in mice exhibits a cilia deficit consequent to loss of Gemc1-Mcidas expression. Taken together, these findings reveal a GEMC1-MCIDAS multiciliation program in the CP critical for inhibiting tumorigenesis, and it may have therapeutic implications for the treatment of CPC.",

    "abstract": "Many mutagenic processes leave characteristic imprints on cancer genomes known as mutational signatures. These signatures have been of recent interest regarding their applicability in studying processes shaping the mutational landscape of cancer. In particular, pinpointing the presence of altered DNA repair pathways can have important therapeutic implications. However, mutational signatures of DNA repair deficiencies are often hard to infer. This challenge emerges as a result of deficient DNA repair processes acting by modifying the outcome of other mutagens. Thus, they exhibit non-additive effects that are not depicted by the current paradigm for modeling mutational processes as independent signatures. To close this gap, we present RO_SCPLOWEPAIRC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOW, a method that accounts for interactions between DNA damage and repair and is able to uncover unbiased signatures of deficient DNA repair processes. In particular, RO_SCPLOWEPAIRC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOW was able to replace three MMR deficiency signatures previously proposed to be active in breast cancer, with just one signature strikingly similar to the experimentally derived signature. As the first method to model interactions between mutagenic processes, RO_SCPLOWEPAIRC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWIGC_SCPLOW is an important step towards biologically more realistic modeling of mutational processes in cancer.
