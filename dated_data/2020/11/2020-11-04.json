    "abstract": "In vertebrates, the ontogeny of microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, initiates early during development from primitive macrophages. While murine embryonic microglia then persist through life, in zebrafish these cells are transient, as they are fully replaced by an adult population originating from larval hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived progenitors. Colony-stimulating factor receptor 1 (csf1r) is a fundamental regulator of microglia ontogeny in vertebrates, including zebrafish which possess two paralogous genes: csf1ra and csf1rb. While previous work showed invalidation of both genes completely abrogates microglia development, the specific contribution of each paralog remains largely unknown. Here, using a fate-mapping strategy to discriminate between the two microglial waves, we uncover non-overlapping roles for csf1ra and csf1rb in hematopoiesis, and identified csf1rb as an essential regulator of adult microglia development. Notably, we demonstrate that csf1rb positively regulates HSC-derived myelopoiesis, resulting in macrophage deficiency, including microglia, in adult mutant animals. Overall, this study contributes to new insights into evolutionary aspects of Csf1r signaling and provides an unprecedented framework for the functional dissection of embryonic versus adult microglia in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of Perkinsus marinus as the cause of dermo disease in Crassostrea virginica, salinity and temperature have been identified as the main environmental drivers of parasite prevalence. However, little is known about how these variables affect the movement of parasites from host to water column. In order to elucidate how environmental factors can influence the abundance of this parasite in the water column, we conducted a series of experiments testing the effects of time of day, temperature, and salinity on release of P. marinus cells from infected oysters. We found that P. marinus cells were released on a diurnal cycle, with most cells released during the hottest and brightest period of the day (12:00-18:00). Temperature also had a strong and immediate effect on number of cells released, but salinity did not, only influencing the intensity of infection over the course of several months. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 1) the number of parasites in the water column fluctuates according to a diurnal cycle, 2) temperature and salinity act on different timescales to influence parasite abundance, and 3) live infected oysters may substantially contribute to the abundance of transmissive parasites in the water column under particular environmental conditions.",

Phylogenetic relationships within the group have been historically difficult to elucidate. Here, we provide the first phylogenomic perspective into the Ledebouriinae. Using the Angiosperms353 targeted enrichment probe set, we consistently recovered four major clades (i.e., two Ledebouria clades, Drimiopsis, and Resnova). The two Ledebouria clades closely align with geography, either consisting almost entirely of sub-Saharan African taxa (Ledebouria Clade A), or East African and non-African taxa (Ledebouria Clade B). Our results suggest that the Ledebouriinae likely underwent a rapid radiation leading to rampant incomplete lineage sorting. We additionally find evidence for potential historical hybridization between Drimiopsis and a subclade within Ledebouria Clade A.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrates kidneys contribute to the homeostasis by regulating electrolyte, acid-base balance, and prevent protein loss into the urine. Glomerular podocytes constitute blood-urine barrier and podocyte slit-diaphragm, a modified tight junction contributes to the glomerular permselectivity. Nephrin, podocin, CD2AP, and TRPC6 are considered to be crucial members, which largely interact with each other and contribute to the structural and functional integrity of the slit-diaphragm. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of these four-key slit-diaphragm proteins across the organisms for which the genome sequence is available. We found that nephrin has a diverse distribution ranging from nematodes to higher vertebrates whereas podocin, CD2AP, and TRPC6 are predominantly restricted to the vertebrates. In the invertebrates nephrin and its orthologs consist of more immunoglobulin-3 and immunoglobulin-5 domains when compared to the vertebrates wherein, CD80-like C2-set Ig2 domains were predominant. Src Homology-3 (SH3) domain of CD2AP and SPFH domain of podocin are highly conserved among vertebrates. Although the majority of the TRPC6 and its orthologs had conserved ankyrin repeats, TRP, and ion transport domains, the orthologs of TRPC6 present in Rhincodon typus and Acanthaster planci do not possess the ankyrin repeats. Intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs), which are considered to contribute to the interactions among these proteins are largely conserved among orthologs of these proteins, suggesting the importance of IURs in the protein complexes that constitute slit-diaphragm. This study for the first time reports the evolutionary insights of vertebrate slit-diaphragm proteins and its invertebrate orthologs.",

MGMT, a DNA repair protein, and the methylation at its gene promoter, plays an important role in TMZ resistance. However, some evidences have suggested a MGMT-independent mechanisms underlying TMZ resistance. Here, we used MGMT enhancer as a model and discovered that its deletion in glioma cells of low MGMT expression induced increased sensitivity to temozolomide. Analysis of a combination of RNA-seq and Capture Hi-C further suggested multiple long-range target genes regulated by the MGMT enhancer and that interactions may play important roles in glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ. This study reveals a novel mechanism of regulation of TMZ sensitivity in glioma cells.",

    "abstract": "Estimation of the direct genetic effect of an individuals own genotype on their phenotype, independent of any contaminating indirect parental genetic effects is becoming increasingly important. These conditional estimates are of interest in their own right, but are also useful for downstream analyses such as intergenerational Mendelian randomization. We compare several available multivariate methods that utilize summary results statistics from genome-wide association studies to determine how well they estimate conditional direct and indirect genetic effects, while accounting for sample overlap. Using robustly associated birth weight variants and data from the UK Biobank, we contrasted the point estimates and their standard errors at each of the individual loci compared to those obtained using individual level genotype data, in addition to comparing the computational time, inflation of the test statistics and number of genome-wide significant SNPs identified by each of the methods. We show that Genomic SEM outperforms the other methods in accurately estimating conditional genetic effects and their standard errors. We subsequently applied Genomic SEM to fertility data in the UK Biobank and partitioned the genetic effect into female and male fertility in addition to a sibling specific effect. This analysis identified one novel locus for fertility and replicated seven previously identified loci. We also identified genetic correlations between fertility and educational attainment, risk taking behaviour, autism and subjective well-being. We therefore recommend Genomic SEM to be used to partition genetic effects across the genome into direct and indirect components.",

    "abstract": "The tuna meat is a nutritious food that possesses high content of protein, its low content of saturated fatty acids makes it a high demand food in the world. The Thunnus genus is composed of eight species, albacore (T. alalunga), bigeye (T. obesus), long tail tuna (T. tonggol), yellowfin tuna (T. albacares), pacific bluefin tuna (T. orientalis), bluefin tuna (T. maccoyii), Atlantic bluefin tuna (T. thynnus) and blackfin tuna (T. atlanticus). The blackfin tuna (BFT) (Thunnus atlanticus) represent the smallest species within the Thunnus genus. This species inhabits the warm waters of the West Atlantic Ocean, from the shore of Massachusetts in the north, to Rio De Janeiro in Brazil. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional composition of BFT captured in the Gulf of Mexico, we determined ash, moisture, fat, protein and carbohydrates in BFT muscle and compared the obtained data with the nutritional reports from commercial tuna species including yellowfin tuna, Atlantic bluefin tuna and salmon (Salmo salar).\n\nSecondly, we report the genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of BFT within its geographical distribution range using the Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and control region sequenced data and from specimens collected in the Gulf of Mexico. We observed a nucleotide diversity {pi}=0.001, 24 segregating sites and 10 parsimony informative. Within the CR we found nine different haplotypes {pi}=0.044, 39 segregating sites, 16 parsimony informative sites. We concluded that according with the haplotype distribution there are differences among the BFT from the Gulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic compared to the South Atlantic. The Caribbean Sea is a migration point of the BFT, where all except the South Atlantic haplotypes were found.",

We analyzed the transcriptomes of human airway epithelial cells transformed with mutant KRAS to define the landscape of KRAS-regulated noncoding RNAs. We found that oncogenic KRAS upregulates noncoding transcripts throughout the genome, many of which arise from transposable elements. These repetitive noncoding RNAs exhibit differential RNA editing in single cells, are released in extracellular vesicles, and are known targets of KRAB zinc-finger proteins, which are broadly down-regulated in mutant KRAS cells and lung adenocarcinomas. Moreover, mutant KRAS induces IFN-stimulated genes through both epigenetic and RNA-based mechanisms. Our results reveal that mutant KRAS remodels the noncoding transcriptome through epigenomic reprogramming, expanding the scope of genomic elements regulated by this fundamental signaling pathway and revealing how mutant KRAS induces an intrinsic IFN-stimulated gene signature often seen in ADAR-dependent cancers.",

CAMDAC copy number profiles parallel those derived from genome sequencing and highlight widespread chromosomal instability. Deconvolved polymorphism-independent methylation rates enable unbiased tumor-normal and tumor-tumor differential methylation calling. Read-phasing validates CAMDAC methylation rates and directly links genotype and epitype. We show increased epigenetic instability in adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma, frequent hypermethylation at sites carrying somatic mutations, and parallel copy number losses and methylation changes at imprinted loci.

    "abstract": "Exposure to environmental factors can affect DNA methylation at a CpG site or a genomic region, which can then affect an outcome. In other words, environmental effects on an outcome could be mediated by DNA methylation. To date, single CpG site-based mediation analysis has been employed extensively. More recently, however, there has been considerable interest on studying differentially methylated regions (DMRs), both because DMRs are more likely to have functional effects than single CpG sites and because testing DMRs reduces multiple testing. In this report, we propose a novel causal mediation approach under the counterfactual framework to test the significance of total, direct and indirect effects of predictors on response variable with a methylated region (MR) as the mediator (denoted as MR-Mediation). Functional linear transformation is used to reduce the possible high dimension of the CpG sites in a predefined methylated region and to account for their location information. In our simulation studies, MR-Mediation retained the desired Type I error rates for total, direct and indirect effect tests, for both continuous and binary outcomes. Furthermore, MR-Mediation had better power performance than testing mean methylation level as the mediator in most considered scenarios, especially for indirect effect (i.e., mediated effect) test, which could be more interesting than the other two effect tests. We further illustrate our proposed method by analyzing the methylation mediated effect of exposure to gun violence on total immunoglobulin E (IgE) or atopic asthma among participants in the Epigenetic Variation and Childhood Asthma in Puerto Ricans (EVA-PR) study.",

    "abstract": "Predictive models mapping double-stranded DNA to signals of regulatory activity should, in principle, produce analogous (or \"equivariant\") predictions whether the forward strand or its reverse complement (RC) is supplied as input. Unfortunately, standard neural networks can produce highly divergent predictions across strands, even when the training set is augmented with RC sequences. Two strategies have emerged to enforce equivariance: conjoined/\"siamese\" architectures, and RC parameter sharing or RCPS. However, the connections between the two remain unclear, comparisons to strong baselines are lacking, and neither has been adapted to base-resolution signal profile prediction. Here we extend conjoined & RCPS models to base-resolution signal prediction, and introduce a strong baseline: a standard model (trained with RC data augmentation) that is made conjoined only after training, which we call \"post-hoc\" conjoined. Through benchmarks on diverse tasks, we find post-hoc conjoined consistently performs best or second-best, surpassed only occasionally by RCPS, and never underperforms conjoined-during-training. We propose an overfitting-based hypothesis for the latter finding, and study it empirically. Despite its theoretical appeal, RCPS shows mediocre performance on several tasks, even though (as we prove) it can represent any solution learned by conjoined models. Our results suggest users interested in RC equivariance should default to post-hoc conjoined as a reliable baseline before exploring RCPS. Finally, we present a unified description of conjoined & RCPS architectures, revealing a broader class of models that gradually interpolate between RCPS and conjoined while maintaining equivariance.",

Multiple signaling pathways converge to activate ERK, with different pathways being required for different stimulation patterns. To answer whether and how different temporal patterns select different signaling pathways for ERK activation, we developed a computational model of five signaling pathways (including two novel pathways) leading to ERK activation during L-LTP induction. We show that calcium and cAMP work synergistically to activate ERK and that stimuli given with large inter-trial intervals activate more ERK than shorter intervals. Furthermore, these pathways contribute to different dynamics of ERK activation. These results suggest that signaling pathways with different temporal sensitivity facilitate ERK activation to diversity of temporal patterns.",

    "abstract": "Life in Movile Cave (Romania) relies entirely on carbon fixation by bacteria. The microbial community in the surface water of Movile Caves hypoxic air bells is dominated by large spherical-ovoid bacteria we identified as Thiovulum sp. (Campylobacterota). These form a separate phylogenetic cluster within the Thiovulaceae, consisting mostly of freshwater cave bacteria. We compared the closed genome of this Thiovulum to that of the marine strain Thiovulum ES, and to a genome we assembled from public data from the sulfidic Frasassi caves. The Movile and Frasassi Thiovulum were very similar, differing greatly from the marine strain. Based on their genomes, cave Thiovulum can switch between aerobic and anaerobic sulfide oxidation using O2 and NO3- as electron acceptors, respectively. NO3-, is likely reduced to NH3 via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia using periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap) and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Thus, Thiovulum, is likely important to both S and N cycles in sulfidic subterranean aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, we suggest that the short peritrichous flagella-like structures typical of Thiovulum are type IV pili, for which genes were found in all Thiovulum genomes. These pili may play a role in veil formation, connecting adjacent cells and the exceptionally fast swimming of these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is a recently described multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungus that is increasingly responsible for healthcare associated outbreaks across the world. Bloodstream infections of this fungus cause death in up to 70% of the cases. Aggravating this scenario, C. auris disease-promoting mechanisms are poorly understood. Fungi release extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying a broad range of molecules including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, pigments, and RNA, many of which are virulence factors. Here, we carried out a comparative molecular characterization of C. auris and C. albicans EVs and evaluated their capacity to modulate effector mechanisms of host immune defense. Using proteomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics, we found that C. auris released EVs with payloads that were strikingly different from EVs released by C. albicans. EVs released by C. auris potentiated the adhesion of this yeast to an epithelial cell monolayer. C. auris EVs also induced the expression of surface activation markers and cytokines by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Altogether, our findings show distinct profiles and properties of EVs released by C. auris and by C. albicans, and highlight the potential contribution of C. auris EVs to the pathogenesis of this emerging pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Woronin bodies are membrane-bound organelles of filamentous ascomycetes that mediate hyphal compartmentalization by plugging septal pores upon hyphal damage. Their major component is the peroxisomal protein Hex1, which has also been implicated in additional cellular processes in fungi. Here, we analyzed the Hex1 homolog of Verticillium dahliae, an important asexual plant pathogen, and we report its pleiotropic involvement in fungal growth, physiology, stress response and pathogenicity. Alternative splicing of the Vdhex1 gene can lead to the production of two Hex1 isoforms, which are structurally similar to their Neurospora crassa homolog. We show that VdHex1 is targeted to the septum, consistently with its demonstrated function in sealing hyphal compartments to prevent excessive cytoplasmic bleeding upon injury. Furthermore, our investigation provides direct evidence for significant contributions of Hex1 in growth and morphogenesis, as well as in asexual reproduction capacity. We discovered that Hex1 is required both for normal responses to osmotic stress and factors that affect the cell wall and plasma membrane integrity, and for normal resistance to oxidative stress and ROS homeostasis. The Vdhex1 mutant exhibited diminished ability to colonize and cause disease on eggplant. Overall, we show that Hex1 has fundamentally important multifaceted roles in the biology of V. dahliae.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics has enabled rapid increases in virus discovery, in turn permitting revisions of viral taxonomy and our understanding of the ecology of viruses and their hosts. Inspired by recent discoveries of large viruses prevalent in the environment, we re-assessed the longstanding approach of filtering water through small pore-size filters to separate viruses from cells before sequencing. We studied assembled contigs derived from < 0.45 m and > 0.45 m size fractions that were annotated as viral to determine the diversity and relative abundances of virus groups from each fraction. Virus communities were vastly different when comparing the size fractions, indicating that analysis of either fraction alone would provide only a partial perspective of environmental viruses. At the level of virus order/family we observed highly diverse and distinct virus communities in the > 0.45 m size fractions, whereas the < 0.45 m size fractions were comprised primarily of highly diverse Caudovirales. The relative abundances of Caudovirales for which hosts could be inferred varied widely between size fractions with higher relative abundances of cyanophages in the > 0.45 m size fractions potentially indicating replication within cells during ongoing infections. Many of the Mimiviridae and Phycodnaviridae, and all Iridoviridae and Poxviridae were detected exclusively in the often disregarded > 0.45 m size fractions. In addition to observing unique virus communities associated with each size fraction, we detected viruses common to both fractions and argue that these are candidates for further exploration because they may be the product of ongoing or recent lytic events.\n\nIMPORTANCEMost studies of aquatic virus communities analyze DNA sequences derived from the smaller, \"free virus\" size fraction. Our study demonstrates that analysis of virus communities using only the smaller size fraction can lead to erroneously low diversity estimates for many of the larger viruses such as Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Iridoviridae, and Poxviridae, whereas analyzing only the larger, > 0.45 m size fraction can lead to underestimates of Caudovirales diversity and relative abundance. Similarly, our data shows that examining only the smaller size fraction can lead to underestimation of virophage and cyanophage relative abundances that could, in turn, cause researchers to assume their limited ecological importance. Given the considerable differences we observed in this study, we recommend cautious interpretations of environmental virus community assemblages and dynamics when based on metagenomic data derived from different size fractions.",

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent RNA modification that plays a key role in regulating eukaryotic cellular mRNA functions. RNA m6A modification is regulated by two groups of cellular proteins, writers and erasers that add or remove m6A, respectively. HIV-1 RNA contains m6A modifications that modulate viral infection and gene expression in cells. However, it remains unclear whether m6A modifications of HIV-1 RNA modulate innate immune responses in cells or HIV-1-infected individuals. Here we show that m6A modification of HIV-1 RNA suppresses the expression of antiviral cytokine type-I interferon (IFN-I) in human monocytic cells. Transfection of differentiated monocytic cells with HIV-1 RNA fragments containing a single m6A-modification significantly reduced IFN-I mRNA expression relative to their unmodified RNA counterparts. We generated HIV-1 with altered RNA m6A levels by manipulating the expression of the m6A erasers or pharmacological inhibition of m6A addition in virus-producing cells. RNA transfection and viral infection of differentiated monocytic cells demonstrated that HIV-1 RNA with decreased m6A levels enhanced IFN-I expression, whereas HIV-1 RNA with increased m6A modifications had opposite effects. Our mechanistic studies revealed that m6A of HIV-1 RNA escaped the RIG-I-mediated RNA sensing and activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 that drive IFN-I gene expression. Moreover, RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1 viremic patients showed increased m6A levels that correlated with increased IFN-I mRNA expression compared to levels from HIV-1-suppressed patients on antiretroviral therapy. Together, our results suggest that RNA m6A modifications regulate viral replication and antiviral innate immune responses in HIV-1-infected individuals.\n\nAuthor SummaryHIV-1 is known as a weak inducer of antiviral cytokines including IFN-I, but it is unclear how HIV-1 evades innate immunity. Different types of RNA modifications including m6A within the HIV-1 genome modulate viral replication; however, the role of m6A modifications of HIV-1 RNA in regulating innate immune responses remains elusive. In this study, we found that HIV-1 RNA modified with m6A suppresses the expression of IFN-I in differentiated monocytic cells by avoiding innate immune detection of viral RNA mediated by RIG-I, an RNA sensor in host cells. We also observed significantly increased RNA m6A modifications of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1 viremic patients compared to virally suppressed patients on combined antiretroviral therapy, suggesting a functional link between m6A modifications and antiretroviral treatment. Investigating the functions of m6A modifications of HIV-1 RNA in regulating innate immune sensing and IFN-I induction in monocytic cells can help understand the mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence.",

    "abstract": "Lake Superior has recently begun experiencing cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Dolichospermum lemmermannii near the Apostle Islands and along the southern shore of the western arm. Little is known about the origin of these blooms. Experiments were conducted during the summers of 2017 and 2018 to identify sources of propagules and characteristics of sites that were potential sources. The 2017 experiments were conducting using a factorial design with three source zones (Harbor, River, and Lake), two nutrient conditions (high and low N:P), and three temperatures (15, 20, and 25 {degrees}C). At the end of the experiment, cyanobacteria were most abundant from the  River and  Harbor zones at low N:P and 20 and 25 {degrees}C, with D. lemmermannii most abundant at 20 {degrees}C. Subsequently in 2018 we evaluated 26 specific inland locations from three waterbody types (Coastal, Lake/Pond, and River) and explored similarities among those sites that produced cyanobacteria in high abundance when samples were incubated under optimal conditions (low N:P and 25 {degrees}C). Under these growing conditions, we found high cyanobacteria abundance developed in samples from river sites with low ambient temperatures and high conductivity. Field monitoring showed that Lake Superior nearshore temperatures were higher than rivers. These observations suggest that blooms of D. lemmermannii in Lake Superior are initiated by fluvial seeding of propagules and highlight the importance of warmer temperatures and favorable nutrient and light conditions for subsequent extensive cyanobacterial growth. We argue that the watershed is an important source of biological loading of D. lemmermannii to Lake Superior, and that when those cells reach the nearshore where there is warmer water temperatures and increased light, they can grow in abundance to produce blooms.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in gene regulatory networks acting in early development. There has been rapid turnover of lncRNA loci during vertebrate evolution, with few human lncRNAs conserved beyond mammals. The sequences of these rare deeply conserved lncRNAs are typically not similar to each other. Here, we characterize HOXA-AS3 and HOXB-AS3, lncRNAs produced from the central regions of the HOXA and HOXB clusters. Sequence-similar homologs of both lncRNAs are found in multiple vertebrate species and there is evident sequence similarity between their promoters, suggesting that the production of these lncRNAs predates the duplication of the HOX clusters at the root of the vertebrate lineage. This conservation extends to similar expression patterns of the two lncRNAs, in particular in cells transiently arising during early development or in the adult colon, and their co-regulation by the CDX1/2 transcription factors. Functionally, the RNA products of HOXA-AS3 and HOXB-AS3 regulate the expression of their overlapping HOX5-7 genes both in HT-29 cells and during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. Beyond production of paralogous protein-coding and microRNA genes, the regulatory program in the HOX clusters therefore also relies on paralogous lncRNAs acting in restricted spatial and temporal windows of embryonic development and cell differentiation.",

Phylogenetic models that allow accounting for and quantifying this heterogeneity in diversification rates have proven particularly useful for understanding clades diversification. Recently, we introduced the cladogenetic diversification rate shift model (ClaDS), which allows inferring subtle rate variations across lineages. Here we present a new inference technique for this model that considerably reduces computation time through the use of data augmentation and provide an implementation of this method in Julia. In addition to drastically reducing computation time, this new inference approach provides a posterior distribution of the augmented data, that is the tree with extinct and unsampled lineages as well as associated diversification rates. In particular, this allows extracting the distribution through time of both the mean rate and the number of lineages. We assess the statistical performances of our approach using simulations and illustrate its application on the entire bird radiation.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Rad51 paralogs fulfill a conserved, but undefined role in HR, and their mutations are associated with increased cancer risk in humans. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to reveal that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 paralog complex Rad55-Rad57 promotes the assembly of Rad51 recombinase filaments through transient interactions, providing evidence that it acts as a classical molecular chaperone. Srs2 is an ATP-dependent anti-recombinase that downregulates HR by actively dismantling Rad51 filaments. Contrary to the current model, we find that Rad55- Rad57 does not physically block the movement of Srs2. Instead, Rad55-Rad57 promotes rapid re- assembly of Rad51 filaments after their disruption by Srs2. Our findings support a model in which Rad51 is in flux between free and ssDNA-bound states, the rate of which is dynamically controlled though the opposing actions of Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2.",

    "abstract": "Hsp90 is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that mediates the folding and maturation of hundreds of \"client\" proteins. Although Hsp90s generally function as homodimers, recent discoveries suggested that the mitochondrion specific Hsp90 (TRAP1) also forms functionally relevant tetramers. The structural mechanism of tetramer formation remains elusive. Here we used a combination of solution, biochemical and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) approaches to confirm that, independent of nucleotide state, a subpopulation of TRAP1 exists as tetramers. Unexpectedly, cryo-EM reveals multiple tetramer conformations having TRAP1 dimers arranged in orthogonal, parallel, or antiparallel configurations. The cryo-EM structure of one of the orthogonal tetrameric states was determined at 3.5 [A] resolution. Each of the two TRAP1 dimers is in a symmetric AMP{middle dot}PNP-bound closed state with the tetramer being stabilized through three distinct dimer-dimer interaction sites. In unique ways, each of the three TRAP1 domains contributes to tetramer formation. In addition to tetramerization via direct dimer-dimer contacts, our structure suggests that additional stabilization could come from domain swapping between the dimers. These results expand our understanding of TRAP1 biology beyond the conventional view of a functional dimer and provide a platform to further explore the function and regulation of tetrameric TRAP1 in mitochondria.",

Motivated by promising results in prostate cancer there is growing interest in extending this approach to other cancers. Here we present a theoretical study of intra-tumoral competition during adaptive therapy, to identify under which circumstances it will be superior to aggressive treatment; (2) Methods: We use a 2-D, on-lattice, agent-based tumour model to examine the impact of different microenvironmental factors on the comparison between continuous drug administration and adaptive therapy. (3) Results: We show that the degree of crowding, the initial resistance fraction, the presence of resistance costs, and the rate of tumour cell turnover are key determinants of the benefit of adaptive therapy, and we study in detail how these factors alter competition between cells. We find that intra-specific competition between resistant cells plays an unexpectedly important role in the ability to control resistance. To conclude we show how differences in resistance cost and turnover change the tumours spatial organisation and may explain differences in cycling speed observed in a cohort of 67 prostate cancer patients undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy; (4) Conclusion: Our work provides insights into how adaptive therapy leverages inter- and intra-specific competition to control resistance, and shows that the tumours spatial architecture will likely be an important factor in determining the quantitative benefit of adaptive therapy in patients.",

However, the absence of reliable experimental models dramatically impacts the understanding of mechanisms underlying malignant progression. Here we established an in vivo genetic platform to rapidly generate somatic mosaic genetically engineerd immune-competent mouse models of renal tumors, recapitulating the genomic and phenotypic features of these malignancies. Leveraging somatic chromosomal engineering, we demonstrated that ablation of the murine locus syntenic to human 9p21 drives the rapid expansion of aggressive mesenchymal clones with prominent metastatic behavior, characterized by early emergence of chromosomal instability, whole-genome duplication, and conserved patterns of aneuploidy. This model of punctuated equilibrium provides a remarkable example of cross-species convergent evolution.\n\nSignificanceTo better understand the role of 9p21 in malignant progression, we generated a somatic mosaic GEMM of renal cancer, capturing the histological, genomic and evolutionary features of human disease.

    "abstract": "BackgroundTumors are complex tissues containing collections of phenotypically diverse malignant and nonmalignant cells. We know little of the mechanisms that govern heterogeneity of tumor cells nor of the role heterogeneity plays in overcoming stresses, such as adaptation to different microenvironments. Osteosarcoma is an ideal model for studying these mechanisms--it exhibits widespread inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, predictable patterns of metastasis, and a lack of clear targetable driver mutations. Understanding the processes that facilitate adaptation to primary and metastatic microenvironments could inform the development of therapeutic targeting strategies.\n\nResultsWe investigated single-cell RNA-sequencing profiles of 47,977 cells obtained from cell line and patient-derived xenograft models as cells adapted to growth within primary bone and metastatic lung environments. Tumor cells maintained phenotypic heterogeneity as they responded to the selective pressures imposed during bone and lung colonization. Heterogenous subsets of cells defined by distinct transcriptional profiles were maintained within bone- and lung-colonizing tumors, despite high-level selection. One prominent heterogenous feature involving glucose metabolism was clearly validated using immunofluorescence staining. Finally, using concurrent lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics, we found that lung colonization enriches for multiple clones with distinct transcriptional profiles that are preserved across cellular generations.\n\nConclusionsResponse to environmental stressors occurs through complex and dynamic phenotypic adaptations. Heterogeneity is maintained, even in conditions that enforce clonal selection. These findings likely reflect the influences of developmental processes promoting diversification of tumor cell subpopulations, which are retained, even in the face of selective pressures.",

    "abstract": "Legumes balance nitrogen acquisition from soil nitrate with symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation requires establishment of a new organ, which is a cytokinin dependent developmental process in the root. We found cytokinin biosynthesis is a central integrator, balancing nitrate signalling with symbiotic acquired nitrogen. Low nitrate conditions provide a permissive state for induction of cytokinin by symbiotic signalling and thus nodule development. In contrast, high nitrate is inhibitory to cytokinin accumulation and nodule establishment in the root zone susceptible to nodule formation. This reduction of symbiotic cytokinin accumulation was further exacerbated in cytokinin biosynthesis mutants, which display hypersensitivity to nitrate inhibition of nodule development, maturation and nitrogen fixation. Consistent with this, cytokinin application can rescue nodulation and nitrogen fixation of biosynthesis mutants in a concentration dependent manner. These inhibitory impacts of nitrate on symbiosis occur in a Nlp1 and Nlp4 dependent manner and contrast with the positive influence of nitrate on cytokinin biosynthesis that occurs in non-symbiotic species. Altogether this shows that legumes, as exemplified by Lotus japonicus, have evolved a different cytokinin response to nitrate compared to non-legumes.\n\nOne sentence summaryCytokinin biosynthesis is suppressed by nitrate in Lotus japonicus, providing a mechanism for nitrate inhibition of symbiotic nodule organogenesis.",

To investigate the contributions of glia to Huntingtons disease (HD), we studied transcriptomic changes in HD human, HD mice, and Drosophila expressing human mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) in either glia, neurons or both. A large portion of conserved genes are concordantly dysregulated across the three species; we tested these genes in a high-throughput behavioral assay and found that downregulation of genes involved in synapse assembly mitigated pathogenesis and behavioral deficits. To our surprise, mitigating glial pathogenesis by dNRXN3 knockdown was sufficient to improve the phenotype of flies expressing mHTT in neurons, suggesting that mHTTs toxic effects in glia ramify throughout the brain.

    "abstract": "Through their roots, trees interact with a highly complex community of microorganisms belonging to various trophic guilds and contributing to tree nutrition, development and protection against stresses. Tree roots select for specific microbial species from the bulk soil communities. The root microbiome formation is a dynamic process but little is known on how the different microorganisms colonize the roots and how the selection occurs. To decipher if the final composition of the root microbiome is the product of several waves of colonization by different guilds of microorganisms, we planted sterile rooted cuttings of Gray Poplar obtained from plantlets propagated in axenic conditions in natural soil taken from a poplar stand. We analyzed the root microbiome at different time points between 2 and 50 days of culture by combining high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of fungal rDNA ITS and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope observations. The microbial colonisation of poplar roots took place in three stages but the dynamic was different between bacteria and fungi. Root bacterial communities were clearly different from the soil after two days of culture. By contrast, if fungi were also already colonizing roots after two days, the initial communities were very close to the one of the soil and were dominated by saprotrophs. Those were slowly replaced by endophytes and ectomycorhizal fungi. The replacement of the most abundant fungal and bacterial community members observed in poplar roots along time suggest potential competition effect between microorganisms and/or a selection by the host.\n\nImportanceThe tree root microbiome is composed of a very diverse set of bacterial and fungal communities. These microorganisms have a profound impact on tree growth, development and protection against different types of stress. They mainly originate from the bulk soil and colonize the root system which provides a unique nutrient rich-environment for a diverse assemblage of microbial communities. In order to better understand how the tree root microbiome is shaped along time, we observed the composition of root-associated microbial communities of naive plantlets of poplar transferred in natural soil. The composition of the final root microbiome rely on a series of colonization stages characterized by the dominance of different fungal guilds and bacterial community members along time. Our observations suggest an early stabilization of bacterial communities, whereas fungal communities are established following a more gradual pattern.",

RNA isolated using the in-house RIR resulted in a similar quantity and quality compared to the commercial TRIzol. Furthermore, the commercial RNA isolation kits with silica-based columns recommend genomic DNA digestion during or after RNA purification, adding time and cost to RNA purification.

Additionally, our method purifies total RNA along with the small RNA fraction, including miRNAs, which usually require a separate kit for extraction. Additionally, the RNA prepared with our method was equally suitable for mRNA and miRNA expression analysis using RT-qPCR.

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in biological and digital technologies are revolutionizing the population control of invasive disease vectors such as Aedes aegypti. Methods such as the sterile and incompatible insect techniques (SIT/IIT) rely on modified males to seek out and successfully mate with females, and in doing so outcompete the wild male population for mates. Currently, these interventions infer the success of mating interactions between male and female insects through area-wide population surveillance and observations of mating competitiveness are rare. Furthermore, little is known about male Ae. aegypti behaviours and biology in field settings. In preparation for a large, community scale IIT program, we undertook a series of mark-release-recapture experiments using rhodamine B to mark male Ae. aegypti sperm and measure mating interactions with females. We also developed the Spatial and Temporally Evolving Isotropic Kernel (STEIK) framework to assist researchers to estimate the movement of individuals through space and time. Results showed that ~40% of daily females captured were unmated, suggesting interventions will need to release males regularly to be effective at suppressing Ae. aegypti populations. Males moved rapidly through the landscape, particularly when released during the night. Although males moved further than what is typically observed in females of the species, survival was considerably lower. These unique insights will lead to a greater understanding of mating interactions in wild insect populations and lay the foundation for robust suppression strategies in the future.\n\nAuthor SummaryModern scientific techniques for controlling populations of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, utilize the mating biology of adult male mosquitoes to achieve suppression through a sterilization process. As the study of Ae. aegypti control has typically focused on adult female mosquitoes, knowledge on male movement, survival and mating interactions in the field is lacking. Here we undertook several mark-release-recapture experiments on adult male Ae. aegypti in Innisfail, Australia, and measured important biological parameters. For the first time in large field experiments, we employed rhodamine B as a marker that when fed to adult males, identified both marked males and the wild females they mated with. We observed males moving further through the landscape, but surviving for a shorter period, than previous measurements undertaken on females in a field setting. A high proportion (~40%) of unmated females suggests individuals are constantly available for mating. As such, sterile male strategies may need to release at regular intervals to achieve effective population suppression. The unique insights provided by this study will assist in designing future sterile male field interventions.",

    "abstract": "Allele substitution effects at quantitative trait loci (QTL) are part of the basis of quantitative genetics theory and applications such as association analysis and genomic prediction. In the presence of non-additive functional gene action, substitution effects are not constant across populations. We develop an original approach to model the difference in substitution effects across populations as a first order Taylor series expansion from a \"focal\" population. This expansion involves the difference in allele frequencies and second-order statistical effects (additive by additive and dominance). The change in allele frequencies is a function of relationships (or genetic distances) across populations. As a result, it is possible to estimate the correlation of substitution effects across two populations using three elements: magnitudes of additive, dominance and additive by additive variances; relationships (Neis minimum distances or Fst indexes); and assumed heterozygosities. Similarly, the theory applies as well to distinct generations in a population, in which case the distance across generations is a function of increase of inbreeding. Simulation results confirmed our derivations. Slight biases were observed, depending on the non-additive mechanism and the reference allele. Our derivations are useful to understand and forecast the possibility of prediction across populations and the similarity of GWAS effects.",

To assess the inter- and intra-species variability, we de novo assembled the region in non-human primates by a combination of optical mapping techniques. Orangutan carries three LCR22-mediated inversions of which one is the ancient haplotype since it is also present in macaque. Using fiber-FISH, lineage-specific differences in LCR22 composition were mapped. The smallest and likely ancient haplotype is present in the chimpanzee, bonobo and rhesus macaque. The absence of intra-species variation in chimpanzee indicates the LCR22-A expansion to be unique to the human population. Further, we demonstrate that LCR22-specific genes are expressed in both human and non-human primate neuronal cell lines and show expression of several primate LCR22 transcripts for the first time. The human-specificity of the expansions suggest an important role for the region in human evolution and adaptation.\n\nAuthor summaryLow copy repeats or segmental duplications are DNA segments composed of various subunits which are duplicated across the genome. Due to the high level of sequence identity between these segments, homologous regions can misalign, resulting in reciprocal deletions and duplications, classified as genomic disorders. These regions are subject to structural variation in the human population. We recently detected extreme structural variation in one of the most complex segmental duplication regions of the human genome, the low copy repeats on chromosome 22 (LCR22s). Rearrangements between the LCR22s result in the 22q11.2 deletion/duplication syndrome, the most common human genomic disorder. However, it remains unknown whether this variability is human-specific. In this study, we investigated those LCR22s in several individuals of the different great apes and macaque. We show only the smallest haplotype is present without any intra-species variation in the Pan genus, our closest ancestors. Hence, LCR22 expansions are human-specific, suggesting a role of these LCR22s in human evolution and adaptation and hypothesize the region contributes to the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome inter-patient phenotypic variability.",

    "abstract": "Although there have been numerous expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, the effect of genetic variants on the levels of multiple plasma proteins still warrants more systematic investigation. To identify genetic modifiers that influence the levels of clinically relevant plasma proteins, we performed protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) mapping on 92 proteins using the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population and identified 12 significant cis and 6 trans pQTL. Among them, we discovered coding variants in a cis-pQTL in Ahr and a trans-pQTL in Rfx1 for the IL-17A protein. Our study reports an innovative pipeline for the identification of genetic modifiers that may be targeted for drug development.\n\nAuthor SummaryBlood plasma is a body fluid that can be collected in a noninvasive way to detect diseases, such as autoimmune disease. However, it is known that plasma protein levels are affected by both the environment and genetic background. To determine the effect of genetics on plasma protein levels in human, one needs a rather large sample size. To overcome this critical issue, a mouse model, the Diversity Outbred (DO), was established that is genetically as diverse as the human population. In this study, we used N=140 DO mice and genotyped over 140,000 variants. In addition, we measured the levels of 92 proteins in plasma of these DO mice using Olink Proteomics technology. The proteins detected in this panel are known to be detectable in human plasma, making our study translatable to human. We identified 18 significant protein quantitative trait loci. Furthermore, we describe an analysis pipeline that allows for the detection of a single gene in the locus that is responsible for the differences in protein levels. We identified how variants in the Regulatory Factor X1 (Rfx1) gene regulates Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) plasma levels. Our study reports an innovative approach to identify genetic modifiers that may be targeted for drug development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHealth workers involved in COVID-19 response might be at risk of developing fear and psychological distress. This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 fear among health workers in Nepal during the early phase of pandemic.\n\nMethodsA web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the month of April-May 2020 among 475 health workers directly involved in COVID-19 management. The Fear Scale of COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used to measure the status of fear. Scatter plots were used to observe the relationship between fear and other psychological outcomes: anxiety, depression and insomnia. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with COVID fear.\n\nResultsCOVID-19 fear score was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression, and weakly correlated with insomnia (p<0.001). Nurses (AOR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.23-4.26), health workers experiencing stigma (AOR=1.83; 95% CI: 1.12-2.73), those working in affected district(AOR=1.76; 95% CI: 1.12-2.77) and presence of family member with chronic diseases (AOR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.01-2.25) was associated with higher odds of developing COVID-19 fear as compared to other health workers, health workers not experiencing stigma, working in non-affected district and not having family member with chronic diseases respectively.\n\nConclusionNurses, health workers facing stigma, those working in affect district and having family member with chronic diseases were more at risk of developing COVID-19 fear. It is thus recommended to improve work environment to reduce fear among health workers, employ stigma reduction interventions, and ensure personal and family support for those having family member with chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L) is one of main staple food crops worldwide contributing 20% calories in human diet. Drought stress is the main factor limiting yields and threatening to food security, with climate change resulting in more frequent and intense drought. Developing drought-tolerant wheat cultivars is a promising way forward. The use of a holistic approaches that include high-throughput phenotyping and genetic makers in selection could help in accelerating genetic gains. Fifty advanced breeding lines were selected from the CIMMYT Turkey winter wheat breeding program and studied under irrigated and semiarid conditions for two years. High-throughput phenotyping were done for wheat crown root traits using shovelomics techniques and canopy green area and senescence dynamics using vegetation indices (green area using RGB images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index using spectral reflectance). In addition, genotyping by KASP markers for adaptability genes was done. Overall, under semiarid conditions compared to irrigated conditions yield reduced by 3.09 t ha-1 (-46.8%). Significant difference between the treatment and genotype was observed for grain yield and senescence traits. Genotypes responded differently under drought stress. Root traits including shallower nodal root angle under irrigated conditions and root number per shoot under semiarid conditions were associated with increased grain yield. RGB based vegetation index measuring canopy green area at anthesis was more strongly associated with GY than NDVI under drought. Five established functional genes (PRR73.A1 - flowering time, TEF-7A - grain size and weight, TaCwi.4A - yield under drought, Dreb1-drought tolerance, and ISBW11.GY.QTL.CANDIDATE- grain yield) were associated with different drought-tolerance traits in this experiment. We conclude that a combination of high-throughput phenotyping and selection for genetic markers can help to develop drought-tolerant wheat cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Ammonium (NH4+), a key nitrogen form, becomes toxic when it accumulates to high levels. Ammonium transporters (AMTs) are the key transporters responsible for NH4+ uptake. AMT activity is under allosteric feedback control, mediated by phosphorylation of a threonine in the cytosolic C-terminus (CCT). However, the kinases responsible for the NH4+-triggered phosphorylation remain unknown. In this study, a functional screen identified protein kinase CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase15 (CIPK15) as a negative regulator of AMT1;1 activity. CIPK15 was able to interact with several AMT1 paralogs at the plasma membrane. Analysis of AmTryoshka, an NH4+ transporter activity sensor for AMT1;3 in yeast, and a two-electrode-voltage-clamp (TEVC) of AMT1;1 in Xenopus oocytes showed that CIPK15 inhibits AMT activity. CIPK15 transcript levels increased when seedlings were exposed to elevated NH4+ levels. Notably, cipk15 knockout mutants showed higher 15NH4+ uptake and accumulated higher amounts of NH4+ compared to the wild-type. Consistently, cipk15 was hypersensitive to both NH4+ and methylammonium but not nitrate (NO3-). Taken together, our data indicate that feedback inhibition of AMT1 activity is mediated by the protein kinase CIPK15 via phosphorylation of residues in the CCT to reduce NH4+-accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus due to their work exposure in the healthcare settings. Practicing appropriate preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is one of the most important interventions that healthcare workers are expected to use. The aim of this study was to assess the level of risk perception and practices of preventive measures of COVID-19 among health workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing (91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family. The mean score of overall fear and worry of COVID-19 was 2.37 on a scale of 1 to 3. Respondents who ever provided clinical care to COVID-19 patients were more likely to report fear and worry (adjusted OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91), however those who ever participated in Ebola or SARS outbreaks were less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=0.66, 95% CI:0.48-0.90). This study has revealed widespread practices of preventive measures and the highest perceived risk of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Therefore, an effective risk communication intervention should be implemented to ensure the maintenance of appropriate practices during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (or phages) play major roles in the evolution of bacterial pathogens via horizontal gene transfer. Multiple phages are often integrated in a host chromosome as prophages, not only carrying various novel virulence-related genetic determinants into host bacteria but also providing various possibilities for prophage-prophage interactions in bacterial cells. In particular, Escherichia coli strains such as Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing E. coli (STEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains have acquired more than 10 PPs (up to 21 PPs), many of which encode type III secretion system (T3SS) effector gene clusters. In these strains, some prophages are present at a single locus in tandem, which is usually interpreted as the integration of phages that use the same attachment (att) sequence. Here, we present prophages integrating into T3SS effector gene cluster-associated loci in prophages, which are widely distributed in STEC and EPEC. Some of the prophages integrated into prophages are Stx-encoding prophages and have induced the duplication of Stx-encoding phages in a single cell. The identified att sequences in prophage genomes are apparently derived from host chromosomes. In addition, two or three different att sequences are present in some prophages, which results in the generation of prophage clusters in various complex configurations. These \"prophages-in-prophages\" represent a medically and biologically important type of inter-phage interaction that promotes the accumulation of T3SS effector genes in STEC and EPEC, the duplication of Stx-encoding prophages in STEC, and the conversion of EPEC to STEC and that may be distributed in other types of E. coli strains as well as other prophage-rich bacterial species.\n\nAuthor summaryMultiple prophages are often integrated in a bacterial host chromosome and some are present at a single locus in tandem. The most striking examples are Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (STEC and EPEC) strains, which usually contain more than 10 prophages (up to 21). Many of them encode a cluster of type III secretion system (T3SS) effector genes, contributing the acquisition of a large number of effectors (>30) by STEC and EPEC. Here, we describe prophages integrating into T3SS effector gene cluster-associated loci in prophages, which are widely distributed in STEC and EPEC. Two or three different attachment sequences derived from host chromosomes are present in some prophages, generating prophage clusters in various complex configurations. Of note, some of such prophages-in-prophages are Stx-encoding prophages and have induced the duplication of Stx-encoding prophages. Thus, these \"prophages-in-prophages\" represent an important inter-phage interaction as they can promote not only the accumulation of T3SS effectors in STEC and EPEC but also the duplication of Stx-encoding prophages and the conversion of EPEC to STEC.",

    "abstract": "Throughout its enzootic cycle, the Lyme disease spirochete Borreliella (Borrelia) burgdorferi, senses and responds to changes in its environment by using a small repertoire of transcription factors which coordinate the expression of genes required for infection of Ixodes ticks and various mammalian hosts. Among these transcription factors, the DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in B. burgdorferi during periods of nutrient limitation and is required for mammalian infectivity. In many pathogenic bacteria, the gene regulatory activity of DksA along with the alarmone guanosine penta- and tetra-phosphate ((p)ppGpp) coordinates the stringent response to various environmental stresses including nutrient limitation. In this study, we sought to characterize the role of DksA in regulating the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase and in the regulation of RpoS-dependent gene expression required for B. burgdorferi infectivity. Using in vitro transcription assays, we observed recombinant DksA inhibits RpoD-dependent transcription by B. burgdorferi RNA polymerase independent of ppGpp Additionally, we determined the pH-inducible expression of RpoS-dependent genes relies on DksA, but is independent of (p)ppGpp produced by Relbbu. Subsequent transcriptomic and western blot assays indicated DksA regulates the expression of BBD18, a protein previously implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of RpoS. Moreover, we observed DksA was required for infection of mice following intraperitoneal inoculation or for transmission of B. burgdorferi by Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Together, these data suggest DksA plays a central role in coordinating transcriptional responses of B. burgdorferi required for infectivity through its interactions with RNA polymerase and post-transcriptional control of RpoS.\n\nAuthor SummaryLyme disease, caused by the spirochetal bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common vector-borne illness in North America. The ability of B. burgdorferi to establish infection is predicated by its ability to coordinate the expression of virulence factors in response to diverse environmental stimuli encountered within Ixodes ticks and mammalian hosts. Previous studies have shown an essential role for the alternative sigma factor RpoS in regulating the expression of genes required for the successful transmission of B. burgdorferi by Ixodes ticks and infection of mammalian hosts. The DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) is a global gene regulator in B. burgdorferi that also contributes to the expression of RpoS-dependent genes. In this study, we determined DksA exerts its gene regulatory function through direct interactions with the B. burgdorferi RNA polymerase using in vitro transcription assays and controls the expression of RpoS-dependent genes required for mammalian infection by post-transcriptionally regulating cellular levels of RpoS. Our results demonstrate the utility of in vitro transcription assays to determine how gene regulatory proteins like DksA control gene expression in B. burgdorferi, and reveal a novel role for DksA in the infectious cycle of B. burgdorferi.",
