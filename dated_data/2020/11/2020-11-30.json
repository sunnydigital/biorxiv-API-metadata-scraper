    "abstract": "While initially highly successful, targeted therapies eventually fail as populations of tumor cells evolve mechanisms of resistance, leading to resumption of tumor growth. Historically, cell-intrinsic mutational changes have been the major focus of experimental and clinical studies to decipher origins of therapy resistance. While the importance of these mutational changes is undeniable, a growing body of evidence suggests that non-cell autonomous interactions between sub-populations of tumor cells, as well as with non-tumor cells within tumor microenvironment, might have a profound impact on both short term sensitivity of cancer cells to therapies, as well as on the evolutionary dynamics of emergent resistance. In contrast to well established tools to interrogate the functional impact of cell-intrinsic mutational changes, methodologies to understand non-cell autonomous interactions are largely lacking.\n\nEvolutionary Game Theory (EGT) is one of the main frameworks to understand the dynamics that drive frequency changes in interacting competing populations with different phenotypic strategies. However, despite a few notable exceptions, the use of EGT to understand evolutionary dynamics in the context of evolving tumors has been largely confined to theoretical studies. In order to apply EGT towards advancing our understanding of evolving tumor populations, we decided to focus on the context of the emergence of resistance to targeted therapies, directed against EML4-ALK fusion gene in lung cancers, as clinical responses to ALK inhibitors represent a poster child of limitations, posed by evolving resistance. To this end, we have examined competitive dynamics between differentially labelled therapy-naive tumor cells, cells with cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms, and cells with cell-extrinsic resistance, mediated by paracrine action of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), within in vitro game assays in the presence or absence of front-line ALK inhibitor alectinib. We found that producers of HGF were the fittest in every pairwise game, while also supporting the proliferation of therapy-naive cells. Both selective advantage of these producer cells and their impact on total population growth was a linearly increasing function of the initial frequency of producers until eventually reaching a plateau. Resistant cells did not significantly interact with the other two phenotypes. These results provide insights on reconciling selection driven emergence of subpopulations with cell non-cell autonomous resistance mechanisms, with lack of evidence of clonal dominance of these subpopulations. Further, our studies elucidate mechanisms for co-existence of multiple resistance strategies within evolving tumors. This manuscript serves as a technical report and will be followed up with a research paper in a different journal.",

    "abstract": "In order to behave appropriately in a rapidly changing world, individuals must be able to detect when changes occur in that environment. However, at any given moment, there are a multitude of potential changes of behavioral significance that could occur. Here we investigate how knowledge about the space of possible changes affects human change point detection. We used a stochastic auditory change point detection task that allowed model-free and model-based characterization of the decision process people employ. We found that subjects can simultaneously apply distinct timescales of evidence evaluation to the same stream of evidence when there are multiple types of changes possible. Informative cues that specified the nature of the change led to improved accuracy for change point detection through mechanisms involving both the timescales of evidence evaluation and adjustments of decision bounds. These results establish three important capacities of information processing for decision making that any proposed neural mechanism of evidence evaluation must be able to support: the ability to simultaneously employ multiple timescales of evidence evaluation, the ability to rapidly adjust those timescales, and the ability to modify the amount of information required to make a decision in the context of flexible timescales.",

    "abstract": "INPP5E (pharbin) is a ubiquitously-expressed, farnesylated phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase which modulates the phosphoinositide composition of membranes. INPP5E resides in primary cilia, and mutations or loss of INPP5E are associated with ciliary dysfunction. INPP5E missense mutations of the phosphatase catalytic domain cause Joubert syndrome in humans, a syndromic ciliopathy affecting multiple tissues including brain, liver, kidney and retina. We show that, differing from other primary cilia, INPP5E is present in the wildtype photoreceptor inner segment and absent in the outer segment--a modified primary cilium dedicated to phototransduction. We generated Inpp5eF/F;Six3Cre (in short, retInpp5e-/-) mice which exhibit a rapidly progressing rod-cone degeneration nearly completed by postnatal day 21 (P21) in the central retina. Mutant cone outer segments contain vesicles instead of discs as early as P8. While P10 mutant outer segments contain phototransduction and structural proteins, they do not form axonemes and fail to elaborate disc membranes. Connecting cilia of retInpp5e-/- rods appear normal, although IFT-B/A particles accumulate at their distal ends suggesting disrupted intraflagellar transport. These results show that ablation of INPP5E does not impair the secretory pathway responsible for delivery of outer segment-specific proteins, but blocks axonemal extension and prevents disc morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Erythroid terminal differentiation entails cell divisions that are coupled to progressive decreases in cell size. EpoR signaling is essential for the survival of erythroid precursors, but it is unclear whether it has other functions in these cells. Here we endowed mouse precursors that lack the EpoR with survival signaling, finding that this was sufficient to support their differentiation into enucleated red cells, but that the process was abnormal. Precursors underwent fewer and slower cell cycles and yet differentiated into smaller red cells. Surprisingly, EpoR further accelerated cycling of early erythroblasts, the fastest cycling cells in the bone marrow, while simultaneously increasing their cell size. EpoR-mediated formation of larger red cells was independent of the established pathway regulating red cell size by iron through Heme-regulated eIF2 kinase (HRI). We confirmed the effect of Epo on red cell size in human volunteers, whose mean corpuscular volume (MCV) increased following Epo administration. This increase persisted after Epo declined and was not the result of increased reticulocytes. Our work reveals a unique effect of EpoR signaling on the interaction between the cell cycle and cell growth. Further, it suggests new diagnostic interpretations for increased red cell volume, as reflecting high Epo and erythropoietic stress.",

    "abstract": "Molecular embryology studies have established that the patterning of the gastrula-stage mouse embryo is dependent on a regulatory network where the WNT, BMP and NODAL signalling pathways cooperate. Still, important aspects of their respective contributions to this process remain unclear. Here, studying their impact on the spatial organization and the developmental trajectories of micro-patterned Epiblast Like Cells (EpiLC) colonies, we show that when BMP is present, it dominates NODAL and WNT and imposes a posterior character to the colonies differentiation. However, the use of two Nodal mutant cell lines allowed us to show that prior to BMP action, NODAL is required to establish the mesendodermal lineage. The fact that mutant phenotypes were more severe in vitro than in vivo suggests that embryonic phenotypes are partially rescued by ligands of extra-embryonic or maternal origin. Our work demonstrates the complementarity of micro-patterned EpiLC colonies to embryological approaches.",

N plays key roles at different steps in the replication cycle and is used as a serological marker of infection. Here we characterize the biochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 N. We define the N domains important for oligomerization and RNA binding that are associated with spherical droplet formation and suggest that N accessibility and assembly may be regulated by phosphorylation. We also map the RNA binding interface using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Finally, we find that the N protein C-terminal domain is the most immunogenic by sensitivity, based upon antibody binding to COVID-19 patient samples from the US and Hong Kong. Together, these findings uncover domain-specific insights into the significance of SARS-CoV-2 N and highlight the diagnostic value of using N domains as highly specific and sensitive markers of COVID-19.",

Despite intensive research including several clinical trials, currently there are no completely safe or effective therapeutics to cure the disease. Here we report a strategy incorporating neutralizing antibodies conjugated on the surface of a photothermal nanoparticle to actively capture and inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The photothermal nanoparticle is comprised of a semiconducting polymer core and a biocompatible polyethylene glycol surface decorated with neutralizing antibodies. Such nanoparticles displayed efficient capture of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, excellent photothermal effect, and complete inhibition of viral entry into ACE2-expressing host cells via simultaneous blocking and inactivating of the virus. This photothermal nanoparticle is a flexible platform that can be readily adapted to other SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and extended to novel therapeutic proteins, thus providing a broad range of protection against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/404624v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@44a5a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d7bcd5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae6e70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d4a4f5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we describe a mEnv vaccine platform that requires no extra proteins or protein engineering. MEnv trimers were fixed, purified and combined with liposomes in mild detergent. On removal of detergent, mEnvs were observed embedded in particles, designated mEnv liposomes (MELs), which were recognized by HIV bnAbs but not non-nAbs. Following sequential immunization in rabbits, MEL antisera neutralized select tier 2 HIV isolates. Variations between the Env immunogens, including a missing N-glycosylation site at position 197 near the CD4 binding site, provide insights into the specificities elicited and possible ways to improve immunogens.

    "abstract": "Microbial populations show striking diversity in cell growth morphology and lifecycle [1]; however, our understanding of how these factors influence the growth rate of cell populations remains limited. We use theory and simulations to predict the impact of asymmetric cell division, cell size regulation and single-cell stochasticity on the population growth rate. Our model predicts that coarse-grained noise in the single-cell growth rate {lambda} decreases the population growth rate, as previously seen for symmetrically dividing cells [2]. However, for a given noise in {lambda} we find that dividing asymmetrically can enhance the population growth rate for cells with strong size control (between a \"sizer\" and an \"adder\"). To reconcile this finding with the abundance of symmetrically dividing organisms in nature, we propose that additional constraints on cell growth and division must be present which are not included in our model, and we explore the effects of selected extensions thereof. Further, we find that within our model, epigenetically inherited generation times may arise due to size control in asymmetrically dividing cells, providing a possible explanation for recent experimental observations in budding yeast [3]. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the complex effects generated by non-canonical growth morphologies.",

In this study, 1566 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences across ten Asian countries are collected, clustered, and characterized based on the clade they belong to. The isolates are compared to the Wuhan reference sequence (Accession no:MN996528.1) to identify the mutations that occurred at different protein regions. Structural changes in amino acids due to mutations lead to functional instability of the proteins. Detailed clade-wise functional assessments are carried out to quantify the stability and vulnerability of the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 genomes which can shade light on personalized prevention and treatment of the disease and encourage towards the invention of clade-specific vaccines.",

Nine male rugby players with a mean age of 27.62 years (SD = 4.21) and 18 male handball players with a mean age of 17.03 years (SD = 0.57) participated. Urinary oxytocin level was measured by ELISA immunoassay as a ratio to the concentration of creatinine [mg/ml] measured through colorimetric detection. Differences in oxytocin level were assessed by ANOVA with repeated measurements.\n\nResultsThe OT/CRE levels significantly differed between the type of player (rugby or handball) but not between times of measurements. Tukeys post-hoc tests revealed that significant differences were only between OT/CRE level in a day of match in rugby players and in 5 days before match in handball players (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionThere was no change in oxytocin levels during the time periods between five days before and on the day of a match, in either of the two kinds of players. The change in oxytocin might be traceable during the match but not before a match and thus perhaps depends on a more subtle context of competition, but not on the assumption of competition.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe key to evolution is reproduction. Pathogens can either kill the human host or can invade the host without causing death, thus ensuring their own survival, reproduction and spread. Tuberculosis, treponematoses and leprosy are widespread chronic infectious diseases whereby the host is not immediately killed. These diseases are examples of the co-evolution of host and pathogen. They can be well studied as the paleopathological record is extensive, spanning over 200 human generations.\n\nMethodsThe paleopathology of each disease has been well documented in the form of published synthetic analyses recording each known case and case frequencies in the samples they were derived from. Here the data from these synthetic analyses were re-analysed to show changes in the prevalence of each disease over time. A total of 69,379 skeletons are included in this study.\n\nResultsThere was ultimately a decline in the prevalence of each disease over time, this decline was statistically significant (Chi-squared, p<0.001). A trend may start with the increase in the diseases prevalence before the prevalence declines, in tuberculosis the decline is monotonic.\n\nConclusionsIncrease in skeletal changes resulting from the respective diseases appears in the initial period of host-disease contact, followed by a decline resulting from co-adaptation that is mutually beneficial for the disease (spread and maintenance of pathogen) and host (less pathological reactions to the infection). Eventually either the host may become immune or tolerant, or the pathogen tends to be commensalic rather than parasitic.",

    "abstract": "Accurate phenotype prediction based on genotypical information has numerous societal applications, such as design of useful crops of cellular factories. However, the prevalence of epistasis, a phenomenon that prevents many biological systems to perform in accordance with the sum of its parts, necessitates modelling the complex path between genotype and phenotype. Defining intermediate levels in this path reduces the complexity of prediction, and may also elucidate the phenotype coupling to other levels by evolution. Inconveniently, the latter requires definitions that maintain biophysical justification from the bottom-up, which conflicts with tractability. By means of a cell growth model, we exemplify a resolution for this conflict by polarization of Cdc42p in budding yeast, a process requiring clustering of active Cdc42p to one zone on the membrane and known to generate ample epistasis. Concretely, our model parsimoniously encompasses constant membrane area growth, stochastic Cdc42p turnover and a simple, justifiable polarity rule we define as the  mesotype. Through intuitively interpretable simulations, we describe previously documented, yet puzzling epistasis inside the polarity module. Moreover, we generate evolutionary relevant predictions e.g., on environmental perturbations, which are general enough to apply to other systems. We quantify how poor growth medium can equalize fitness differentials and enables, otherwise very distinct, evolutionary paths. For example, the fitness of the crippled {Delta}bem1 relative to WT can easily be raised from 0.2 to above 0.95. Finally, we can extend our predictions on epistasis to other modules. We determine that modelled epistasis predictions only add predictive value when functional information of the involved modules is included. This inspires a road-map towards modelling the bidirectional genotype-phenotype map for other model systems with abundant interactions, where the intermediate levels reveal targets that evolution can optimize and facilitate a biophysical justifiable incorporation of epistasis.\n\nAuthor summaryEfforts to understand how traits follow from genes facilitate a broad range of applications. For example, crops can be engineered faster to better resist drought, salt and heat stress, and medicines can be better tailored to individuals. Unfortunately, the path from genes to traits can generally involve a complex interplay of hundreds of genes and gene products whose individual contributions can be heavily context-dependent. In this work, we provide the proof-of-concept in a relatively simple system for a road-map towards elucidating this path. We have constructed a cell growth model for budding yeast, only involving simple rules on membrane growth, protein production and centrally, polarity, the process where yeast chooses the future division site. Despite the simplicity, the polarity rule is fully justifiable from underlying biophysics. Model simulations show good accordance with formerly puzzling traits, and also predict the ease with which the environment can change evolutionary paths. While lab conditions may prohibit the emergence of certain polarity mutations, this becomes much more feasible  in the wild. The tractable model nature allows us to extrapolate the context dependence of mutational effects beyond polarity, showing that this method for understanding trait generation also helps to elucidate protein evolution.",

This study investigates the correlation between DNA methylation of HIF3A and parameters of obesity, including thickness of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissues, in the general Japanese population. Participants (220 men and 253 women) who underwent medical examination were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.

Multiple regression analysis showed that DNA methylation level at cg27146050 was associated with thickness of VAT in women. DNA methylation level at cg27146050 also correlated with body mass index and percentage of body fat in women after excluding smokers and non-smokers who quit smoking with the last 5 years.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe aim of this study is to compare the three previously applied, conventional porcine corneal decellularization methods and to demonstrate the importance of preserving the corneal limbus through decellularization.\n\nMethodsFresh, wild-type (with or without) limbus porcine corneas were decellularized using three different methods, including (i) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), (ii) hypertonic saline (HS), and (iii) N2 gas (NG). Post-treatment evaluation was carried out using histological, residual nuclear material, and ultrastructural analyses. Glycerol was used to help reduce the adverse effects of decellularization. The corneas were preserved for two weeks in cornea storage medium.\n\nResultsAll three decellularization methods reduced the number of keratocytes at different rates in the stromal tissue. However, all methods, except SDS, resulted in the retention of large numbers of cells and cell fragments. The SDS method (0.1% SDS, 48h) resulted in almost 100% decellularization in corneas without limbus. Low decellularization capacity of the NG method (<50%) could make it unfavorable. Although HS method had a more balanced damage-decellularization ratio, its decellularization capacity was lower than SDS method. Preservation of the corneoscleral limbus could partially prevent structural damage and edema, but it would reduce the decellularization capacity.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that SDS is a very powerful decellularization method, but it damages the cornea irreversibly. Preserving the corneoscleral limbus reduces the efficiency of decellularization, but also reduces the damage.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how disease transmission occurs between subpopulations is critically important for guiding disease control efforts irrespective of whether the subpopulations represent geographically separated people, age or risk groups. The structured coalescent (SC) and the multitype birth-death (MBD) model can both be used to infer migration rates between subpopulations from phylogenies reconstructed from pathogen genetic sequences. However, the two classes of phylodynamic methods rely on different assumptions.\n\nHere, we report on a simulation study which compares inferences made using these models for a variety of migration rates in both endemic diseases and epidemic outbreaks. For the epidemic outbreak, we found that the MBD recovers the true migration rates better than the SC regardless of migration rate. We hypothesize that the inaccurate SC estimates stem from the its assumption of a constant population size. For the endemic scenario, our analysis shows that both models obtain a similar coverage of the migration rates, while the SC provides slightly narrower posterior intervals. Irrespective of the scenario, both models estimate the root location with similar coverage.\n\nOur study provides concrete modelling advice for infectious disease analysts. For endemic disease either model can be used, while for epidemic outbreaks the MBD should be the model of choice. Additionally, our study reveals the need to develop the SC further such that varying population sizes can easily be taken into account.\n\nAuthor summaryControlling an infectious disease requires us to quantify and understand how it spreads through pools of susceptible individuals, defined by their belonging to different geographical regions, age or risk groups. Rates of pathogen movement between these pools can be inferred from pathogen phylogenies which are themselves reconstructed from pathogen genetic sequences collected from infected individuals. Two popular foundations for such models are the multitype birth-death model and the structured coalescent.\n\nAlthough these models fulfill the same purpose, they differ in their assumptions and can, hence, produce contrasting results. To assess the appropriateness of the models in different situations, we performed a simulation study. We find that, for endemic diseases, both models are able to estimate the migration parameters reliably. For epidemic outbreaks, however, the multitype birth-death model obtains better estimates of the migration rates. We hypothesize that the structured coalescents inaccurate estimates for the epidemic scenario arise because it assumes a constant number of infected individuals through time.",

Furthermore, the hybridization compatibility between members of Capsicum species complexes remains unresolved. Improving our understanding of the relationship between Capsicum species relatedness and their ability to form hybrids is a highly pertinent issue. Through the development of novel interspecific hybrids in this study, we demonstrate interspecies compatibility is not necessarily reflected in relatedness according to established Capsicum genepool complexes. Based on a phylogeny constructed by genotyping using single sequence repeat (SSR) markers and with a portion of the waxy locus, and through principal component analysis (PCA) of phenotypic data, we clarify the relationships among wild and domesticated Capsicum species. Together, the phylogeny and hybridization studies provide evidence for the misidentification of a number of species from the World Vegetable Center genebank included in this study. The World Vegetable Center holds the largest collection of Capsicum genetic material globally, therefore this may reflect a wider issue in the misidentification of Capsicum wild relatives. The findings presented here provide insight into an apparent disconnect between compatibility and relatedness in the Capsicum genus, which will be valuable in identifying candidates for future breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "The PI3K/mTOR signalling network critically regulates a broad array of important biological processes, including cell growth, metabolism and autophagy. Dysregulation of PI3K/mTOR signalling is associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that functions as a core catalytic subunit in two physically and functionally distinct complexes termed mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, which also share other common components such as mLTS8 (also known as G{beta}L) and DEPTOR. Despite being the subject of intensive research, a full picture of how mTORC1/2 assembly and activity are coordinated, and how they are functionally connected remain to be fully characterised. This is due primarily to the complex network wiring, featuring a growing number of intricate feedback loops and post-translational modifications, which require quantitative systems-level approaches to decipher. Here, we integrate predictive computational modelling, in vitro experiments and -omics data analysis to elucidate the dynamic and emergent features of the PI3K/mTOR network behavior. We construct new mechanistic models of the network that encapsulate novel critical mechanistic details, including mTORC1/2 coordination by mLTS8 (de)ubiquitination, and Akt-to-mTORC2 positive feedback loop. Model simulations subsequently confirmed by experimental validation revealed a previously unknown biphasic, threshold-gated dependence of mTORC1 activity on the key mTORC2 subunit Sin1, which is robust against cell-to-cell variation in protein expression. Furthermore, our results support the essential role of mLST8 in both mTORC1 and 2 activity, and suggest mLST8 could serve as a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer. Overall, our integrated analyses provide fresh systems-level insights into the dynamic behavior of PI3K/mTOR signalling and shed new light on the complexity of this important network.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSignalling networks are the key information-processing machineries that underpin the ability of living cells to respond proportionately to extra- (and intra-) cellular cues. The PI3K/mTOR signalling network is one of the most important signalling networks in human cells that regulates cellular response to hormones such as insulin, yet our understanding of the network behaviour remains far from complete. Here, we employed a highly integrative approach that combines predictive mathematical modelling, biological experimentation, and data analysis to gain novel systems-level insights into PI3K/mTOR signalling. We constructed new mathematical models of this complex network incorporating important regulatory mechanisms. In contrary to commonly held views that mTORC2 lies upstream and is a positive regulator of mTORC1, we found that their relationship is highly nonlinear and dose dependent. This finding has major implications for mTORC2-directed anti-cancer strategies as depending on the cellular contexts, blocking mTORC2 may reduce or even enhance mTORC1 activation, the latter could inadvertently blunt the effect of mTORC2 blockade. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that mLST8 is required for the assembly and activity of both mTOR complexes, and suggest mLST8 is a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer, notably breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock exerts significance influence on the immune system and disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to inflammatory pathologies. shift workers often experience circadian misalignment as their irregular work schedules disrupt the natural sleep-wake cycle, which in turn can cause serious health problems associated with alterations in genetic expressions of clock genes. In particular, shift work is associated with impairment in immune function, and those alterations are sex-specific. The goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms that explain the weakened immune system in shift workers. To achieve that goal, we have constructed a mathematical model of the mammalian pulmonary circadian clock coupled to an acute inflammation model. shift work was simulated by an 8h-phase advance of the circadian system with sex-specific modulation of clock genes. The model reproduces the clock gene expression in the lung and the immune response to various doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Under normal conditions, our model predicts that a host is more sensitive to LPS at CT12 versus CT0 due to a change in the dynamics of IL-10. We identify REV-ERB as a key modulator of IL-10 activity throughout the circadian day. The model also predicts a reversal of the times of lowest and highest sensitivity to LPS, with males and females exhibiting an exaggerated response to LPS at circadian time (CT) 0, which is countered by a blunted immune response at CT12. Overall, females produce fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines than males, but the extent of sequelae experienced by males and females varies across the circadian day. This model can serve as an essential component in an integrative model that will yield mechanistic understanding of how shift work-mediated circadian disruptions affect the inflammatory and other physiological responses.\n\nAuthor summaryShift work has a negative impact on health and can lead to chronic diseases and illnesses. Under regular work schedules, rest is a night time activity and work a daytime activity. Shift work relies on irregular work schedules which disrupt the natural sleep-wake cycle. This can in turn disrupt our biological clock, called the circadian clock, a network of molecular interactions generating biochemical oscillations with a near 24-hour period. Clock genes regulate cytokines before and during infection and immune agents can also impact the clock function. We provide a mathematical model of the circadian clock in the lung coupled to an acute inflammation model to study how the disruptive effect of shift work manifests itself in males and females during inflammation. Our results show that the extent of sequelae experienced by male and female mice depends on the time of infection. The goal of this study is to provide a mechanistic insight of the dynamics involved in the interplay between these two systems.",

    "abstract": "The relatively high frequency of marine mammal stranding events in the Philippines provide many research opportunities. A select set of stranders (n=21) from 2017 to 2018 were sampled for bacteriology and histopathology. Pertinent tissues and bacteria were collected from eight species (i.e. Feresa attenuata, Kogia breviceps, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Grampus griseus, Lagenodelphis hosei, Peponocephala electra, Stenella attenuata and Stenella longirostris) and were subjected to histopathological examination and antibiotic resistance screening, respectively. Lesions that were observed in tissues of 19 cetaceans include congestion, hemorrhage, edema, hemosiderosis, glomerulopathy, Zenkers necrosis, atrophy, atelectasis, and parasitic cysts. These lesions may be associated with factors possibly contributing to the death, debility, and stress of the animals during their strandings. On the other hand, the resistance profiles of 24 bacteria (belonging to genera Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Shigella) that were isolated from four cetaceans were determined using 18 antibiotics. All 24 isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic class, and 79.17% were classified as multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR). The MAR index values of isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.39 with all the isolates resistant to erythromycin (100%; n=24) and susceptible to imipenem, doripenem, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin (100%; n=24). The resistance profiles of these bacteria can be used as basis for selecting antibiotics needed in the medical management of stranded cetaceans that need to be rehabilitated. Overall, the histopathological and bacteriological findings of the study demonstrate the challenges faced by cetacean species in the wild, such as but not limited to, biological pollution through land-sea movement of effluents, fisheries interactions, and anthropogenic activities.",

    "abstract": "1Many ischaemic stroke patients who have a mechanical removal of their clot (thrombectomy) do not get reperfusion of tissue despite the thrombus being removed. One hypothesis for this  no-reperfusion phenomenon is micro-emboli fragmenting off the large clot during thrombectomy and occluding smaller blood vessels downstream of the clot location. This is impossible to observe in-vivo and so we here develop an in-silico model based on in-vitro experiments to model the effect of micro-emboli on brain tissue. Through in-vitro experiments we obtain, under a variety of clot consistencies and thrombectomy techniques, micro-emboli distributions post-thrombectomy. Blood flow through the microcirculation is modelled for statistically accurate voxels of brain microvasculature including penetrating arterioles and capillary beds. A novel micro-emboli algorithm, informed by the experimental data, is used to simulate the impact of micro-emboli successively entering the penetrating arterioles and the capillary bed. Scaled-up blood flow parameters - permeability and coupling coefficients - are calculated under various conditions. We find that capillary beds are more susceptible to occlusions than the penetrating arterioles with a 4x greater drop in permeability per volume of vessel occluded. Individual microvascular geometries determine robustness to micro-emboli. Hard clot fragmentation leads to larger micro-emboli and larger drops in blood flow for a given number of micro-emboli. Thrombectomy technique has a large impact on clot fragmentation and hence occlusions in the microvasculature. As such, in-silico modelling of mechanical thrombectomy predicts that clot specific factors, interventional technique, and microvascular geometry strongly influence reperfusion of the brain. Micro-emboli are likely contributory to the phenomenon of no-reperfusion following successful removal of a major clot.\n\n2 Author summaryAfter an ischaemic stroke - one where a clot blocks a major artery in the brain - patients can undergo a procedure where the clot is removed mechanically with a stent - a thrombectomy. This reopens the blocked vessel, yet some patients dont achieve blood flow returning to their tissue downstream. One hypothesis for this phenomenon is that the clot fragments into smaller clots (called micro-emboli) which block smaller vessels downstream. However, this cant be measured in patients due to the inability of clinical imaging resolving the micro-scale. We therefore develop a computational model here, based on experimental thrombectomy data, to quantify the impact of micro-emboli on blood flow in the brain after the removal of a clot. With this model, we found that micro-emboli are a likely contributor to the no-reflow phenomenon after a thrombectomy. Individual blood vessel geometries, clot composition, and thrombectomy technique all impacted the effect of micro-emboli on blood flow and should be taken into consideration to minimise the impact of micro-emboli in the brain. Furthermore, the computational model developed here allows us to now build large-scale models of blood flow in the brain, and hence simulate stroke and the impact of micro-emboli on the entire brain.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTo correlate structural integrity of visual pathway white matter tracts with prolactin levels in a patient who demonstrates downward herniation of the optic chiasm secondary to medical treatment of a prolactinoma.\n\nMETHODSA 36-year-old woman with a prolactinoma presented with progressive bilateral visual field defects nine years after initial diagnosis and medical treatment. She was diagnosed with empty-sella syndrome and instructed to stop cabergoline. Hormone testing was conducted in tandem with routine clinical evaluations over one year and the patient was followed with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and automated perimetry at three time points. Five healthy controls underwent a complementary battery of clinical and neuroimaging tests at a single time point.\n\nRESULTSShortly after discontinuing cabergoline, diffusion metrics in the optic tracts were within the range of values observed in healthy controls. However, following a brief period where the patient resumed cabergoline (of her own volition), there was a decrease in serum prolactin with a corresponding decrease in visual ability and increase in radial diffusivity (p<0.001). Those measures again returned to their baseline ranges after discontinuing cabergoline a second time.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThese results demonstrate the sensitivity of dMRI to detect rapid and functionally significant microstructural changes in white matter tracts secondary to alterations in serum prolactin levels. The inverse relations between prolactin and measures of diffusion and visual function provide support for a neuroprotective role of prolactin in the injured nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that altered responses to affective touch - a pleasant interoceptive stimulus associated with activation of the C-Tactile (CT) system, may contribute to the aetiology and maintenance of mental conditions characterised by body image disturbances (e.g., Anorexia Nervosa). Here, we investigated whether tactile pleasantness and intensity differ across body sites, and if individual differences in dysmorphic appearance concerns and body awareness might be associated to touch perceptions across body sites. To this end, we measured perceived pleasantness and intensity of gentle, dynamic stroking touches applied to the palm, forearm, face, abdomen and back of 30 female participants (mean age: 25.87{+/-}1.17yrs) using CT-optimal (3 cm/s) and non-CT optimal (0.3 and 30 cm/s) stroking touch. As expected, participants rated CT-targeted touch as more pleasant compared to the two non-CT optimal stroking touch at all body sites. Nevertheless, CT-targeted touch applied to the abdomen elicited the lowest pleasantness ratings compared to all other body sites and to the two non-CT optimal stroking touch. Individual differences in body awareness and dysmorphic concerns significantly predicted preference for CT-optimal over non-CT optimal stroking touch applied to the forearm and the back. These findings begin to elucidate the link between CT sensitivity, dysmorphic appearance concerns and body awareness, which may have implications for future research looking to inform early interventions. Addressing impaired processing of affective interoceptive stimuli, such as CT-targeted touch, may be the key to current treatment approaches available for those populations at risk of disorders characterised by body image disturbance.",

    "abstract": "Patients who suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) often complain of learning and memory problems. Their symptoms are principally mediated by the hippocampus and the ability to adapt to stimulus, also known as neural plasticity. Therefore, one plausible injury mechanism is plasticity impairment, which currently lacks comprehensive investigation across TBI research. For these studies, we used a computational network model of the hippocampus that includes the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1 with neuron-scale resolution. We simulated mild injury through weakened spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which modulates synaptic weights according to causal spike timing. In preliminary work, we found functional deficits consisting of decreased firing rate and broadband power in areas CA3 and CA1 after STDP impairment. To address structural changes with these studies, we applied modularity analysis to evaluate how STDP impairment modifies community structure in the hippocampal network. We also studied the emergent function of network-based learning and found that impaired networks could acquire conditioned responses after training, but the magnitude of the response was significantly lower. Furthermore, we examined pattern separation, a prerequisite of learning, by entraining two overlapping patterns. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, impaired networks did not exhibit deficits in pattern separation with either population- or rate-based coding. Collectively, these results demonstrate how a mechanism of injury that operates at the synapse regulates circuit function.\n\nAuthor summaryTraumatic brain injury causes diverse symptoms, and memory problems are common among patients. These deficits are associated with the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory. Neural plasticity supports learning and memory by enabling the circuit to adapt to external stimulus. After brain injury, plasticity can be impaired, perhaps contributing to memory deficits. Yet, this mechanism of injury remains poorly understood. We implemented plasticity impairment and learning in a network model of the hippocampus that is unique because it has a high degree of biological detail in its structure and dynamics compared to other similar computational models. First, we examined the relationship between neurons in the network and characterized how the structure changed with injury. Then we trained the network with two input patterns to test the function of pattern separation, which is the ability to distinguish similar contexts and underpins general learning. We found that the strength of the encoded response decreased after impairment, but the circuit could still distinguish the two input patterns. This work provides insight into which specific aspects of memory become dysfunctional after injury.",

    "abstract": "Negative correlations in the sequential evolution of interspike intervals (ISIs) are a signature of memory in neuronal spike-trains. They provide coding benefits including firing-rate stabilization, improved detectability of weak sensory signals, and enhanced transmission of information by improving signal-to-noise ratio. Primary electrosensory afferent spike-trains in weakly electric fish fall into two categories based on the pattern of SCCs: non-bursting units have negative SCCs which remain negative but decay to zero with increasing lags (Type I SCCs), and bursting units have oscillatory (alternating sign) SCCs which damp to zero with increasing lags (Type II SCCs). Here, we predict and match observed ISI serial correlations in these afferents using a stochastic dynamic threshold model. We determine SCCs as a function of an arbitrary discrete noise correlation function Rk, where k is a multiple of the mean ISI. The function permits forward and inverse calculations of SCCs. Both types of SCCs can be generated by adding colored noise to the spike threshold with Type I SCCs generated with slow noise and Type II SCCs generated with fast noise. We show that a first-order autoregressive (AR) process with a single parameter is sufficient to predict and accurately match both types of afferent SCCs, the type being determined by the sign of the AR parameter. The predicted and experimentally observed SCCs are in geometric progression. The theory predicts that the limiting sum of SCCs is -0.5 yielding a perfect DC-block in the power spectrum of the spike train. Observed SCCs from afferents have a limiting sum that is slightly larger at -0.475 {+/-} 0.04 (mean {+/-} s.d.). We conclude that the underlying process for generating ISIs may be a simple combination of low-order autoregressive (AR) processes, and discuss the results from the perspective of optimal coding.",

    "abstract": "During normal neuronal activity, ionic concentration gradients across a neurons membrane are often assumed to be stable. Prolonged spiking activity, however, can reduce transmembrane gradients and affect voltage dynamics. Based on mathematical modeling, we investigated the impact of neuronal activity on ionic concentrations and, consequently, the dynamics of action potential generation. We find that intense spiking activity on the order of a second suffices to induce changes in ionic reversal potentials and to consistently induce a switch from a regular to an intermittent firing mode. This transition is caused by a qualitative alteration in the systems voltage dynamics, mathematically corresponding to a co-dimension-two bifurcation from a saddle-node on invariant cycle (SNIC) to a homoclinic orbit bifurcation (HOM). Our electrophysiological recordings in mouse cortical pyramidal neurons confirm the changes in action potential dynamics predicted by the models: (i) activity-dependent increases in intracellular sodium concentration directly reduce action potential amplitudes, an effect typically attributed solely to sodium channel inactivation; (ii) extracellular potassium accumulation switches action potential generation from tonic firing to intermittently interrupted output. Thus, individual neurons may respond very differently to the same input stimuli, depending on their recent patterns of activity and/or the current brain-state.\n\nAuthor summaryIonic concentrations in the brain are not constant. We show that during intense neuronal activity, they can change on the order of seconds and even switch neuronal spiking patterns under identical stimulation from a regular firing mode to an intermittently interrupted one. Triggered by an accumulation of extracellular potassium, such a transition is caused by a specific, qualitative change in of the neuronal voltage dynamics - a so-called bifurcation - which affects crucial features of action-potential generation and bears consequences for how information is encoded and how neurons behave together in the network. Also, changes in intracellular sodium can induce measurable effects, like a shrinkage of spike amplitude that occurs independently of the fast amplitude-effects attributed to sodium channel inactivation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a neuron can respond very differently to the same stimulus, depending on its previous activity or the current brain state. This finding may be particularly relevant when other regulatory mechanisms of ionic homeostasis are challenged, for example, during pathological states of glial impairment or oxygen deprivation. Finally, Categorization of cortical neurons as intrinsically bursting or regular spiking may be biased by the ionic concentrations at the time of the observation, highlighting the non-static nature of neuronal dynamics.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionChild maltreatment (CM) is associated with mental and physical health disorders in adulthood. Some studies have identified elevated markers of systemic inflammation in adult survivors of CM, and inflammation may mediate the association between CM with later health problems. However, there are methodological inconsistencies in studies of the association between CM and systemic inflammation and findings are conflicting. We performed a systemic review to examine the association of CM with systemic inflammation in adults.\n\nMethodsA systematic review was performed following PRISMA . Medline, Embase, Scopus and PsychInfo were searched for studies of the association of CM with blood markers of inflammation in adults. Quality was assessed using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. We had intended to perform a meta-analysis but this was not possible due to variation in study design and reporting.\n\nResultsForty-six articles met criteria for inclusion in the review. The most widely reported biomarkers were C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (n=29), interleukin-6 (n=25) and Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a). Four studies were prospective (all relating to CRP) and the remainder were retrospective. 85% of studies were based in Western settings. In the prospective studies, CM was associated with elevated CRP in adulthood. Results of retrospective studies were conflicting. Methodological issues relating to the construct of CM, methods of analysis, and accounting for confounding or mediating variables (particularly Body Mass Index) may contribute to the uncertainty in the field.\n\nConclusionsThere is some robust evidence from prospective studies that CM is associated with elevated CRP in adulthood. We have identified significant methodological issues in the literature and have proposed measures that future researchers could employ to improve consistency across studies. Further prospective, longitudinal, research using robust and comparable measures of CM with careful consideration of confounding and mediating variables are required to bring clarity to this field.",

    "abstract": "The microbial communities that live in symbiosis with the mucosal surfaces of animals provide the host with defense strategies against pathogens. These microbial communities are largely shaped by the environment and the host genetics. Triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are being considered for aquaculture as they are reproductively sterile and thus cannot contaminate the natural gene pool. It has not been previously investigated how the microbiome of triploid salmon compares to that of their diploid counterparts. In this study, we compare the steady-state skin and gill microbiome of both diploid and triploid salmon, and determine the effects of salmonid alphavirus 3 experimental infection on their microbial composition. Our results show limited differences in the skin-associated microbiome between triploid and diploid salmon, irrespective of infection. In the gills, we observed a high incidence of the bacterial pathogen Candidatus Branchiomonas, with higher abundance in diploid compared to triploid control fish. Diploid salmon infected with SAV3 showed greater histopathological signs of epitheliocystis compared to controls, a phenomenon not observed in triploid fish. Our results indicate that ploidy can affect the alpha diversity of the gills but not the skin-associated microbial community. Importantly, during a natural outbreak of Branchiomonas sp. the gill microbiome of diploid Atlantic salmon became significantly more dominated by this pathogen than in triploid animals. Thus, our results suggest that ploidy may play a role on Atlantic salmon gill health and provide insights into co-infection with SAV3 and C. Branchiomonas in Atlantic salmon.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus chromogenes is a common skin commensal in cattle and has been identified as a frequent cause of bovine mastitis and intramammary infections. To better understand the extent of strain diversity within this species and to facilitate study of strain variation as a factor in pathogenicity, we have developed a seven locus Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme. The scheme was tested on 120 isolates collected from three geographic locations, Vermont and Washington State in the United States and Belgium. A total of 46 sequence types (STs) were identified with most of the STs being location specific. The utility of the typing scheme is indicated by a discrimination power of 95.6% for all isolates and greater than 90% for isolates from each of the three locations. Phylogenetic analysis placed 39 of the 46 STs into single core group consistent with a common genetic lineage; the STs in this group differ by less than 0.5% at the nucleotide sequence level. Most of the diversification in this lineage group can be attributed to mutation; recombination plays a limited role. This lineage group includes two clusters of single nucleotide variants in starburst configurations indicative of recent clonal expansion; nearly 50% of the isolates sampled in this study are in these two clusters. The remaining seven STs were set apart from the core group by having alleles with highly variable sequences at one or more loci. Recombination had a higher impact than mutation in the diversification of these outlier STs. Alleles with hypervariable sequences were detected at five of the seven loci used in the MLST scheme; the average sequence distances between the hypervariable alleles and the common core alleles ranged from 12 to 34 nucleotides. The extent of these sequence differences suggests the hypervariable alleles may be remnants of an ancestral genotype.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic radiation, composed of high charged and energy (HZE) particles, causes cell death and mutations that can subsequently lead to cancers. Radiation-mediated mutations are induced by inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements (translocations, deletions, inversions) that are triggered by misrepaired DNA breaks, especially double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this work, we introduce a new model to predict radiation-mediated induction of cell death and mutation in two different cell lines across a large range of linear energy transfer (LET) values, based on the assumption that DSBs cluster into repair domains, as previously suggested by our group. Specifically, we propose that the probabilities of cell survival and cell mutation can be determined from the number of DSBs and the number of pairwise DSB interactions forming radiation-induced foci. We computed the distribution and locations of DSBs with the new simulation code RITCARD (relativistic ion tracks, chromosome aberrations, repair, and damage) and combined them with experimental data from HF19 human fibroblasts and V79 Chinese hamster cells to derive the parameters of our model and expand its predictions to the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for cell survival and mutation in both cell lines in response to 9 different irradiation particles and energies ranging from 10 to 1,600 MeV/n. Our model generates the correct bell shape of LET dependence for RBE, as well as similar RBE values as experimental data, notably including data that were not used to set the model parameters. Interestingly, our results also suggest that cell orientation (parallel or perpendicular) with respect to the HZE beam can modulate the RBE for both cell death and mutation frequency. Cell orientation effects, if confirmed experimentally, would be another strong piece of evidence for the existence of DNA repair domains and their critical role in interpreting cellular sensitivity to cosmic radiation and hadron therapy.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYOne of the main hazards of human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit is space radiation exposure. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), in particular their high-charge and high-energy particle component, induce a unique spatial distribution of DNA double strand breaks in the nucleus along their traversal in the cell [1], which result in significantly higher cancer risk than X-rays [2]. To mitigate this hazard, there is a significant need to better understand and predict the effects of cosmic radiation exposure at the cellular level. We have computationally predicted two biological endpoints - cell survival and probability of mutations, critical for cancer induction mechanisms - for the full spectrum of cosmic radiation types and energies, by modeling the distribution of DNA damage locations within the cell nucleus. From experimental results of cell survival and mutation probability in two standard cell lines, we were able to derive the parameters of the model for multiple radiation qualities, both biological endpoints, and two irradiation orientations. The model was validated against biological data and showed high predictive capability on data not used for tuning the model. Overall, this work opens new perspectives to predict multiple responses to cosmic radiation, even with limited experimental data available.",

    "abstract": "Multi-drug resistant (MDR) non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a major public health concern globally. This study reports antibiotic susceptibility testing and genotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of NTS isolates from bovine lymph nodes (n=48) and ground beef (n=29). Furthermore, we compared genotypic AMR data of our isolates with those of publicly available NTS genomes from Mexico (n=1637). The probability of finding MDR isolates was higher in ground beef as compared to lymph nodes: {chi}2=12.0, P=0.0005. The most common resistant phenotypes involved tetracycline (40.3%), carbenicillin (26.0%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (20.8%), chloramphenicol (19.5%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (16.9%), while over 55% of the isolates showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and 26% were MDR. Occurrence of MDR isolates was strongly associated with NTS serovar ({chi}2=24.5, P<0.0001), with Typhimurium accounting for 40% of MDR strains. Most of these (9/10), carried Salmonella genomic island 1, which harbors multiple AMR genes (aadA2, blaCARB-2, floR, sul1, tetG) that confer a penta-resistant phenotype. Moreover, 100% of MDR isolates had mutations in the ramR gene. Among public NTS isolates from foods and clinical cases in Mexico to date, those from cattle had the highest proportion of MDR genotypes. Our results suggest attaining significant improvements in AMR meat safety may require the identification and removal (or treatment) of product harboring MDR NTS, instead of screening for Salmonella spp. or for isolates showing resistance to individual antibiotics. In that sense, massive integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies in AMR surveillance provides the shortest path to accomplish these goals.",

    "abstract": "Identification of genomic mutations by molecular testing plays an important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of myeloid neoplasms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an efficient method for simultaneous detection of clinically significant genomic mutations with high sensitivity. However, due to lack of standard NGS protocols, the application of NGS for hematologic malignancies into clinical settings remains limited. We report development and validation of a 48-gene NGS panel for molecular profiling of myeloid neoplasms including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Target regions were captured by hybridization with complementary biotinylated DNA baits, and NGS was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 instrument. A bioinformatics pipeline that was developed in-house was used to detect single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD). An analytical validation study was performed on 184 unique specimens for variants with allele frequencies [&ge;]5%. Variants identified by the 48-gene panel were compared to those identified by a 35-gene hematologic neoplasms panel using an additional 137 unique specimens. The developed assay was applied to a large cohort (n=2,053) of patients with suspected myeloid neoplasms. Analytical validation yielded 99.6% sensitivity (95% CI: 98.9-99.9%) and 100% specificity (95% CI: 100%). Concordance of variants detected by the 2 tested panels was 100%. Among patients with suspected myeloid neoplasms (n=2,053), 54.5% patients harbored at least one clinically significant mutation: 77% in AML patients, 48% in MDS, and 45% in MPN. Together, these findings demonstrate that the assay can identify mutations associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options of myeloid neoplasms.",

    "abstract": "During development, biological neural networks produce more synapses and neurons than needed. Many of these synapses and neurons are later removed in a process known as neural pruning. Why networks should initially be over-populated, and processes that determine which synapses and neurons are ultimately pruned, remains unclear. We study the mechanisms and significance of neural pruning in model neural network. In a deep Boltzmann machine model of sensory encoding, we find that (1) synaptic pruning is necessary to learn efficient network architectures that retain computationally-relevant connections, (2) pruning by synaptic weight alone does not optimize network size and (3) pruning based on a locally-available proxy for \"sloppiness\" based on Fisher Information allows the network to identify structurally important vs. unimportant connections and neurons. This locally-available measure of importance has a biological interpretation in terms of the correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, and implies an efficient activity-driven pruning rule. Overall, we show how local activity-dependent synaptic pruning can solve the global problem of optimizing a network architecture. We relate these findings to biology as follows: (I) Synaptic over-production is necessary for activity-dependent connectivity optimization. (II) In networks that have more neurons than needed, cells compete for activity, and only the most important and selective neurons are retained. (III) Cells may also be pruned due to a loss of synapses on their axons. This occurs when the information they convey is not relevant to the target population.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring social insects activity is critical for biologists researching their group mechanism. Manually labelling individual insects in a video is labour-intensive. Automated tracking social insects is particularly challenging: (1) individuals are small and similar in appearance; (2) frequent interactions with each other cause severe and long-term occlusion. We propose a detection and tracking framework for ants by: (1) adopting a two-stage object detection framework using ResNet-50 as backbone and coding the position of regions of interest to locate ants accurately; (2) using the ResNet model to develop the appearance descriptors of ants; (3) constructing long-term appearance sequences and combining them with motion information to achieve online tracking. To validate our method, we build a video database of ant colony captured in both indoor and outdoor scenes. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 95.7% mMOTA and 81.1% mMOTP in indoor videos, 81.8% mMOTA and 81.9% mMOTP in outdoor videos. Our method runs 6-10 times faster than existing methods for insect tracking. The datasets and code are made publicly available, we aim to contribute to an automated tracking tool for biologists in relevant domains.\n\nAuthor summaryThe research on the group behavior of social insects is in great favor with biologists. But before analysis, each insect needs to be tracked separately in a video. Obviously, that is a time-consuming and labor-intensive work. In this manuscript, we introduce a detection and tracking framework that can automatically track the movement of ants in a video scene. The software first uses a residual network to detect the positions of ants, then learns the appearance descriptor of each ant as appearance information via another residual network. Furthermore, we obtain motion information of each ant by using the Kalman filter. Combining with appearance and motion information, we can accurately track every ant in the ant colony. We validate the performance of our framework using 4 indoor and 5 outdoor videos, including multiple ants. We invite interested readers to apply these methods using our freely available software.",
