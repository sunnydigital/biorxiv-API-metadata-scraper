    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with a poor long-term prognosis. The current median survival is approximately fifteen to twenty months with the standard of care therapy which includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. An important factor contributing to recurrence of GBM is high resistance of GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs) to several anticancer drugs, for which a systemically delivered single drug approach will be unlikely to produce a viable cure. Therefore, multidrug therapies have the potential to improve the survival time. Currently, only temozolomide (TMZ), which is a DNA alkylator, affects overall survival in GBM patients. CSCs regenerate rapidly and over-express a methyl transferase which overrides the DNA-alkylating mechanism of TMZ, leading to drug resistance. Idasanutlin (RG7388, R05503781) is a potent, selective MDM2 antagonist that additively kills GBM CSCs when combined with TMZ. Nanotechnology is an emerging field that shows great promise in drug delivery and diagnostics. The ability to combine both therapy and imaging allows real time assessment of drug delivery in vivo for the field of theranostics.\n\nTo develop a multi-drug therapy using multi-functional nanoparticles (NPs) that preferentially target the GBM CSC subpopulation and provide in vivo preclinical imaging capability. Polymer-micellar NPs composed of poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) were developed investigating both single and double emulsion fabrication techniques as well as combinations of TMZ and RG7388. The NPs were covalently bound to a 15-base-pair CD133 aptamer in order to target the CD133 antigen expressed on the surface of GBM CSC subpopulation. For theranostic functionality, the NPs were also labelled with a radiotracer, Zirconium-89 (89Zr). The NPs maintained a small size of less than 100 nm, a low negative charge and exhibited the ability to effectively target and kill the CSC subpopulation. In addition, the conjugation of the CD133 aptamer was able to promote killing in CSCs leading to the justification of a targeted nanosystem to potentially improve localized therapy in future in vivo models. This work has provided a potentially therapeutic option for GBM specific for CSC targeting and theranostic imaging.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionOver 300 million people in the world live with asthma, resulting in 500,000 annual global deaths with future increases expected. It is estimated that around 50-80% of asthma exacerbations are due to viral infections. Currently, a combination of long-acting beta agonists (LABA) for bronchodilation and glucocorticoids (GCS) to control lung inflammation represent the dominant strategy for the management of asthma, however it is still sub-optimal in 35-50% of moderate-severe asthmatics resulting in persistent lung inflammation, impairment of lung function, and risk of mortality. Mechanistically, LABA/GCS combination therapy results in synergistic efficacy mediated by intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nHypothesisIncreasing intracellular cAMP during LABA/GCS combination therapy via inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) and/or blocking export of cAMP by ATP Binding Cassette Transporter C4 (ABCC4), will potentiate anti-inflammatory responses of mainstay LABA/GCS therapy.\n\nMethodsExpression and localization experiments were performed using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in human lung tissue from healthy subjects, while confirmatory transcript and protein expression analyses were performed in primary human airway epithelial cells and cell lines. Intervention experiments were performed on the human airway epithelial cell line, HBEC-6KT, by pre-treatment with combinations of LABA/GCS with PDE4 and/or ABCC4 inhibitors followed by Poly I:C or imiquimod challenge as a model for viral stimuli. Cytokine readouts for IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, and CCL5/RANTES were quantified by ELISA.\n\nResultsUsing archived human lung and human airway epithelial cells, ABCC4 gene and protein expression were confirmed in vitro and in situ. LABA/GCS attenuation of Poly I:C or imiquimod-induced IL-6 and IL-8 was potentiated with ABCC4 and PDE4 inhibition, which was greater when ABCC4 and PDE4 inhibition was combined. Modulation of cAMP levels had no impact on LABA/GCS modulation of Poly I:C-induced CXCL10/IP-10 or CCL5/RANTES.\n\nConclusionModulation of intracellular cAMP levels by PDE4 or ABCC4 inhibition is able to potentiate LABA/GCS efficacy in human airway epithelial cells challenged with viral stimuli. The data suggests further exploration of the value of adding cAMP modulators to mainstay LABA/GCS therapy in asthma for potentiated anti-inflammatory efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a hyperinflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, shares many clinical features with toxic shock syndrome, which is triggered by bacterial superantigens. The superantigen specificity for binding different V{beta}-chains results in V{beta}-skewing, whereby T cells with specific V{beta}-chains and diverse antigen specificity are overrepresented in the TCR repertoire. Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR Beta Variable gene (TRBV)11-2. Furthermore, TRBV11-2 skewing was remarkably correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Further analysis of TRBJ gene usage and CDR3 length distribution of MIS-C expanding TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity, indicating a superantigen-mediated selection process for TRBV expansion. In silico modelling indicates that polyacidic residues in TCR V{beta}11-2 engage in strong interactions with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Overall, our data indicate that the immune response in MIS-C is consistent with superantigenic activation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMultisystem Inflammatory Disease in Children (MIS-C) patients exhibit T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire skewing, with expansion of T cell Receptor Beta Variable gene (TRBV)11-2\nC_LIO_LITRBV11-2 skewing correlates with MIS-C severity and cytokine storm\nC_LIO_LIJ gene/CDR3 diversity in MIS-C patients is compatible with a superantigen selection process\nC_LIO_LIIn silico modelling indicates TCR V{beta}11-2 engages in CDR3-independent interactions with the polybasic insert P681RRAR in the SAg-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe red macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis is a potent natural supplement for reducing methane production from cattle. A. taxiformis contains several anti-methanogenic compounds including bromoform that inhibits directly methanogenesis. The positive and adverse effects of A. taxiformis on the rumen microbiota are dose-dependent and operate in a dynamic fashion. It is therefore key to characterize the dynamic response of the rumen microbial fermentation for identifying optimal conditions on the use of A. taxiformis as a dietary supplement for methane mitigation. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to model the effect of A. taxiformis supplementation on the rumen microbial fermentation under in vitro conditions. We adapted a published mathematical model of rumen microbial fermentation to account for A. taxiformis supplementation. We modelled the impact of A. taxiformis on the fermentation and methane production by two mechanisms, namely (i) direct inhibition of the growth rate of methanogens by bromoform and (ii) hydrogen control on sugars utilization and on the flux allocation towards volatile fatty acids production. We calibrated our model using a multi-experiment estimation approach that integrated experimental data with six macroalgae supplementation levels from a published in vitro study assessing the dose-response impact of A. taxiformis on rumen fermentation.\n\nResultsour model captured satisfactorily the effect of A. taxiformis on the dynamic profile of rumen microbial fermentation for the six supplementation levels of A. taxiformis with an average determination coefficient of 0.88 and an average coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error of 15.2% for acetate, butyrate, propionate, ammonia and methane.\n\nConclusionsour results indicated the potential of our model as prediction tool for assessing the impact of additives such as seaweeds on the rumen microbial fermentation and methane production in vitro. Additional dynamic data on hydrogen and bromoform are required to validate our model structure and look for model structure improvements. We expect this model development can be useful to help the design of sustainable nutritional strategies promoting healthy rumen function and low environmental footprint.",

    "abstract": "DNA vaccine evaluation in small animals is hampered by low immunogenicity when the vaccines are delivered using a needle and syringe. To overcome this technical hurdle we tested the possibility that a device developed for human intradermal medicine delivery might be adapted to successfully deliver a DNA vaccine to small animals. The PharmaJet(R) Tropis device is a FDA 510(k)-cleared disposable syringe, needle-free jet injection device designed to administer medicines to the human dermis in a 0.1 mL volume. Here, we found that hantavirus DNA vaccines administered to Syrian hamsters using Tropis were substantially more immunogenic than the same vaccines delivered by needle/syringe or particle mediated epidermal delivery (gene gun) vaccination. By adjusting how the device was used we could deliver vaccine to either subcutaneous tissues, or through the skin into the muscle. RNA and/or antigen expression was detected in epidermal, subepidermal and fibroblast cells. We directly compared six optimized and non-optimized hantavirus DNA vaccines in hamsters. Optimization, including codon-usage and mRNA stability, did not necessarily result in increased immunogenicity for all vaccines tested; however, optimization of the Andes virus (ANDV) DNA vaccine protected vaccinated hamsters from lethal disease. This is the first time active vaccination with an ANDV DNA vaccine has shown protective efficacy in the hamster model. The adaptation of a human intradermal jet injection device for use as a method of subcutaneous and intramuscular jet injection of DNA vaccines will advance the development of nucleic acid based medical countermeasures for diseases modeled in hamsters.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to monitor time-resolved motions of biomacromolecules, although it often remains unknown how closely the conformational dynamics correspond to those occurring in real life. Here, we used a large set of open-access MD trajectories of phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers to benchmark the conformational dynamics in several contemporary MD models (force fields) against nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data available in the literature: effective correlation times and spin-lattice relaxation rates.\n\nWe found none of the tested MD models to fully reproduce the conformational dynamics. That said, the dynamics in CHARMM36 and Slipids are more realistic than in the Amber Lipid14, OPLS-based MacRog, and GROMOS-based Berger force fields, whose sampling of the glycerol backbone conformations is too slow. The performance of CHARMM36 persists when cholesterol is added to the bilayer, and when the hydration level is reduced. However, for conformational dynamics of the PC headgroup, both with and without cholesterol, Slipids provides the most realistic description, because CHARMM36 overestimates the relative weight of ~1-ns processes in the headgroup dynamics.\n\nWe stress that not a single new simulation was run for the present work. This demonstrates the worth of open-access MD trajectory databanks for the indispensable step of any serious MD study: Benchmarking the available force fields. We believe this proof of principle will inspire other novel applications of MD trajectory databanks, and thus aid in developing biomolecular MD simulations into a true computational microscope--not only for lipid membranes, but for all biomacromolecular systems.",

    "abstract": "Cell polarisation is a fundamental biological process. Fission yeast is a key model system to study the molecular basis of microtubule-controlled cell polarisation. In this process, cells define prospective growth sites by generating distinct plasma membrane domains enriched in de novo synthesised sterols. Microtubules restrict the number and location of these domains by depositing factors at the cell poles. The mechanisms underlying such sterol-rich membrane domain formation and polarisation are largely unknown. We found that the oxysterol-binding proteins kes1p, osh2p and kes3p define three independent sterol delivery pathways to the plasma membrane. These mediate different phases of cell polarisation in a phosphoinositide-dependent fashion and differ in their requirement for vesicular trafficking steps. The redundant, kes1p- and osh2p-dependent pathways are vital and prime cell polarisation by mediating the formation of randomly distributed sterol-rich plasma membrane domains. Subsequent microtubule-controlled polarisation of these domains preferentially employs kes1p that directly delivers sterols to the plasma membrane independent of cdc42p. In cells lacking kes1p, polarisation becomes cdc42p-dependent, utilising mainly the kes3p-dependent pathway. Our study uncovers an essential biological function for non-vesicular lipid transport and establishes a molecular basis for different sterol-delivery pathways acting in cdc42p-independent and cdc42p-dependent cell polarisation.",

Importin 7-deficient mice exhibit an impaired Sertoli cell function, including loss of Sertoli cells and a compromised nuclear transport of the androgen receptor. Furthermore, our data demonstrate devastating defects in spermiogenesis that are accompanied by disturbed histone-protamine-exchange, absence of the transcriptional regulator Brwd1 and altered expression of Rfx2 target genes, resulting in incomplete sperm maturation and massive loss of sperms.

However, organ development is subject to random variations, called developmental noise, best revealed by the fluctuating asymmetry observed between bilateral organs. The developmental mechanisms ensuring bilateral symmetry in organ size are mostly unknown. In Drosophila, null mutations for the relaxin-like hormone Dilp8 increase wing fluctuating asymmetry, suggesting that Dilp8 plays a role in buffering developmental noise. Here we show that size adjustment of the wing primordia involves a peak of Dilp8 expression that takes place sharply at the end of juvenile growth. Wing size adjustment relies on a crossorgan communication involving the epidermis as the source of Dilp8. We identify ecdysone signaling as both the trigger for epidermal dilp8 expression and its downstream target in the wing primordia, thereby establishing reciprocal feedback between the two hormones as a systemic mechanism controlling organ size precision. Our results reveal a hormone-based time window ensuring fine-tuning of organ size and bilateral symmetry.",

Interspecies differential expression (DE) analyses revealed that twice as many genes exhibit DE in astrocytes (12.2% of all genes expressed) than neurons (5.8%). Pathway enrichment analyses determined that astrocytes, rather than neurons, diverged in expression of glucose and lactate transmembrane transport, as well as pyruvate processing and oxidative phosphorylation. These findings suggest that astrocytes may have contributed significantly to the evolution of greater brain glucose metabolism with proximity to humans.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids and temperate phages are mobile genetic elements driving bacterial evolution. They are usually regarded as very distinct. However, some elements, termed phage-plasmids, are known to be both plasmids and phages, e.g. P1, N15 or SSU5. The number, distribution, relatedness and characteristics of these phage-plasmids are poorly known. Here, we screened for these elements among ca. 14000 phages and plasmids and identified 780 phage-plasmids across very diverse bacterial phyla. We grouped 92% of them by similarity of gene repertoires to define 8 families and 18 other broader communities of elements. The existence of these large groups suggests that phage-plasmids are ancient. Their gene repertoires are large, the average element is larger than an average phage or plasmid, and they include slightly more homologs to phages than to plasmids. We analyzed the pangenomes and the genetic organization of each group of phage-plasmids and found the key phage genes to be conserved and co-localized within families, whereas genes with homologs in plasmids are much more variable and include most accessory genes. Phage-plasmids are a sizeable fraction of all phages and plasmids and could have key roles in bridging the genetic divide between phages and other mobile genetic elements.",

    "abstract": "The R2TP (RUVBL1-RUVBL2-RPAP3-PIH1D1) complex, in collaboration with HSP90, functions as a chaperone for the assembly and stability of protein complexes, including RNA polymerases, snRNPs and PI3 kinase-like kinases (PIKK) such as TOR and SMG1. PIKK stabilisation depends on an additional complex of TELO2, TTI1 and TTI2 (TTT), whose structure and function are poorly understood. We have now determined the cryo-EM structure of the human R2TP-TTT complex that together with biochemical experiments reveals the mechanism of TOR recruitment to the R2TP-TTT chaperone. The HEAT-repeat TTT complex binds the kinase domain of TOR, without blocking its activity, and delivers TOR to the R2TP chaperone. In addition, TTT regulates the R2TP chaperone by inhibiting RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity and by modulating the conformation and interactions of the PIH1D1 and RPAP3 components of R2TP. Together, our results show how TTT couples the recruitment of TOR to R2TP with the regulation of this chaperone system.",

This threshold is unphysical in most systems with N = 2 diffusing species, forcing experimental realizations of the instability to rely on fluctuations or additional nondiffusing species. Here we ask whether this diffusive threshold lowers for N > 2 to allow \"true\" Turing instabilities. Inspired by Mays analysis of the stability of random ecological communities, we analyze the probability distribution of the diffusive threshold in reaction-diffusion systems defined by random matrices describing linearized dynamics near a homogeneous fixed point. In the numerically tractable cases N [&le;] 6, we find that the diffusive threshold becomes more likely to be smaller and physical as N increases and that most of these many-species instabilities cannot be described by reduced models with fewer species.",

    "abstract": "The nanostructural adaptation of bone is crucial for its compatibility with orthopedic implants. The bones nanostructure determines its mechanical properties, however little is known about its temporal and spatial adaptation in degrading implants. This study presents insights into this adaptation by applying electron microscopy, elemental analysis, and small-angle X-ray scattering tensor-tomography (SASTT). We extend the SASTT reconstruction to multiple radii of the reciprocal space vector q, providing a 3D reciprocal-space map per voxel. Each scattering curve is spatially linked to one voxel in the volume, and properties such as the thickness of the mineral particles are quantified. This reconstruction provides information on nanostructural adaptation during healing around a degrading ZX10 magnesium implant over the course of 18 months, using a sham as control. The nanostructural adaptation process is observed to start with an initially fast interfacial organization towards the implant direction, followed by a substantial reorganization of the volume around the implant, and an adaptation in the later degradation stages. The study sheds light on the complex bone-implant interaction in 3D, allowing a more guided approach towards the design of future implant materials, which are expected to be of great interest for further clinical studies on the bone-implant interaction.\n\nTOC text and figureDegrading Magnesium implants are mechanically and chemically well adapted orthopedic implant materials and ensure a gradual load transfer during bone healing due to their degradation.

    "abstract": "High-resolution live-cell imaging is necessary to study complex biological phenomena. Modern fluorescence microscopy methods are increasingly combined with complementary, label-free techniques to put the fluorescence information into the cellular context. The most common high-resolution imaging approaches used in combination with fluorescence imaging are electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), originally developed for solid-state material characterization. AFM routinely resolves atomic steps, however on soft biological samples, the forces between the tip and the sample deform the fragile membrane, thereby distorting the otherwise high axial resolution of the technique. Here we present scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM) as an alternative approach for topographical imaging of soft biological samples, preserving high axial resolution on cells. SICM is complemented with live-cell compatible super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). To demonstrate the capabilities of our method we show correlative 3D cellular maps with SOFI implementation in both 2D and 3D with self-blinking dyes for two-color high-order SOFI imaging. Finally, we employ correlative SICM/SOFI microscopy for visualizing actin dynamics in live COS-7 cells with subdiffractional resolution.",

    "abstract": "Flower development is a major determinant of yield in crops. In wheat, natural variation for the size of spikelet and floral organs is particularly evident in Triticum polonicum, a tetraploid subspecies of wheat with long glumes, lemmas, and grains. Using map-based cloning, we identified VRT2, a MADS-box transcription factor belonging to the SVP family, as the gene underlying the T. polonicum long-glume (P1) locus. The causal P1 mutation is a sequence re-arrangement in intron-1 that results in both increased and ectopic expression of the T. polonicum VRT-A2 allele. Based on allelic variation studies, we propose that the intron-1 mutation in VRT-A2 is the unique T. polonicum species defining polymorphism, which was later introduced into hexaploid wheat via natural hybridizations. Near-isogenic lines differing for the P1 locus revealed a gradient effect of P1 across florets. Transgenic lines of hexaploid wheat carrying the T. polonicum VRT-A2 allele show that expression levels of VRT-A2 are highly correlated with spike, glume, grain, and floral organ length. These results highlight how changes in expression profiles, through variation in cis-regulation, can impact on agronomic traits in a dosage-dependent manner in polyploid crops.\n\nOne-sentence summaryAn intron-1 rearrangement in the MADS-box transcription factor VRT-A2 leads to its misexpression and defines the long-glume phenotype of Polish wheat (T. polonicum).",

    "abstract": "Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) gain-of-function (GOF) is an autosomal dominant immune disorder marked by wide infectious predisposition, autoimmunity, vascular disease and malignancy. Its molecular hallmark, elevated phospho-STAT1 (pSTAT1) following interferon (IFN) stimulation, is seen consistently in all patients and may not fully account for the broad phenotypic spectrum associated with this disorder. While over 100 mutations have been implicated in STAT1 GOF, genotype-phenotype correlation remains limited, and current overexpression models may be of limited use in gene expression studies. We generated heterozygous mutants in diploid HAP1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 base-editing, targeting the endogenous STAT1 gene. Our models recapitulated the molecular phenotype of elevated pSTAT1, and were used to characterize the expression of five IFN-stimulated genes under a number of conditions. At baseline, transcriptional polarization was evident among mutants compared with wild type, and this was maintained following prolonged serum starvation. This suggests a possible role for unphosphorylated STAT1 in the pathogenesis of STAT1 GOF. Following stimulation with IFN or IFN{gamma}, differential patterns of gene expression emerged among mutants, including both gain and loss of transcriptional function. This work highlights the importance of modelling heterozygous conditions, and in particular transcription factor-related disorders, in a manner which accurately reflects patient genotype and molecular signature. Furthermore, we propose a complex and multifactorial transcriptional profile associated with various STAT1 mutations, adding to global efforts in establishing STAT1 GOF genotype-phenotype correlation and enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis.",

The aim of this study is to assess the capacity of NETs to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung epithelial cells and to analyze the involvement of NETs in COVID-19.\n\nNeutrophils activated with PMA (PMA-Neu), a stimulus known to induce NETs formation, induce both EMT and cell death in the lung epithelial cell line, A549. Notably, NETs isolated from PMA-Neu induce EMT without cell damage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients showed high concentration of NETs. Thus, we tested in an in vitro alveolar model the hypothesis that virus-induced NET may drive EMT. Co-culturing A549 at air-liquid interface with alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and SARS-CoV2, we demonstrated a significant induction of the EMT in A549 together with high concentration of NETs, IL8 and IL1{beta}, best-known inducers of NETosis. Lung tissues of COVID-19 deceased patients showed that epithelial cells are characterized by increased mesenchymal markers.

A safe and effective vaccine remains urgently needed.\n\nMethodWe constructed three variants of the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (residues 331-549) in yeast as follows: (1) a \"wild type\" RBD (RBD219-WT), (2) a deglycosylated form (RBD219-N1) by deleting the first N-glycosylation site, and (3) a combined deglycosylated and cysteine-mutagenized form (C538A-mutated variant (RBD219-N1C1)). We compared the expression yields, biophysical characteristics, and functionality of the proteins produced from these constructs.\n\nResults and conclusionsThese three recombinant RBDs showed similar secondary and tertiary structure thermal stability and had the same affinity to their receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), suggesting that the selected deletion or mutations did not cause any significant structural changes or alteration of function. However, RBD219-N1C1 had a higher fermentation yield, was easier to purify, was not hyperglycosylated, and had a lower tendency to form oligomers, and thus was selected for further vaccine development and evaluation.\n\nGeneral significanceBy genetic modification, we were able to design a better-controlled and more stable vaccine candidate, which is an essential and important criterion for any process and manufacturing of biologics or drugs for human use.",

    "abstract": "Legume and rhizobium can establish a nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis. Previous studies have shown that several transcription factors that play a role in (lateral) root development are also involved in nodule development. Chromatin remodelling factors, like transcription factors, are key players in regulating gene expression. However, it has not been studied whether chromatin remodelling genes that are essential for root development get involved in nodule development. Here we studied the role of Medicago histone deacetylases (MtHDTs) in nodule development. Their Arabidopsis orthologs have been shown to play a role in root development. The expression of MtHDTs is induced in nodule primordia and is maintained in nodule meristem and infection zone. Conditional knock-down of their expression in a nodule-specific way by RNAi blocks nodule primordium development. A few nodules still can be formed but their nodule meristems are smaller and rhizobial colonization of the cells derived from the meristem is markedly reduced. Although the HDTs are expressed during nodule and root development, transcriptome analyses indicate that HDTs control the development of these organs in a different manner. During nodule development the MtHDTs positively regulate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase 1 (MtHMGR1). The decreased expression of MtHMGR1 is sufficient to explain the block of primordium formation.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYPlant-specific histone deacetylases regulate the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductases to control root nodule development.",

    "abstract": "Globally visceral leishmaniasis (VL) causes thousands of human deaths every year. In South America, the etiologic agent, Leishmania infantum, is transmitted from an infected canine reservoir to human hosts by the blood-feeding activity of the sand fly vector, predominantly, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Previous evidence from model rodent systems have suggested that the odour of infected hosts is altered by the parasite making them more attractive to the vector leading to an increased biting rate and improved transmission prospects for the pathogen. However, the effect of Le. infantum infection on the attractiveness of naturally infected dogs which are integral to human infection, has not been assessed.\n\nHair collected from infected and uninfected dogs residing in a VL endemic city in Brazil. was entrained to collect the volatile chemical odours present in the headspace. Female and male Lu. longipalpis sand flies were offered a choice of infected or uninfected odour in a series of behavioural experiments. Control experiments established that female and male Lu. longipalpis were equally attracted to uninfected dog odour, female Lu. longipalpis were significantly more attracted to infected dog odour than uninfected dog odour in all 15 experimental replicates (average 45.7{+/-}0.87 females attracted to infected odour; 23.9{+/-}0.82 to uninfected odour; paired T-test, P=0.000). Male Lu. longipalpis did not significantly prefer either infected or uninfected odour (average 36.1{+/-}0.4 males to infected odour; 35.7{+/-}0.6 to uninfected odour; paired T-test, P=0.722). A significantly greater proportion of females chose the infected dog odour compared to the males (paired T-test, P=0.000).\n\nThe results show that dogs infected with Le. infantum are significantly more attractive to blood-feeding female than male sand flies. This is strong evidence for parasite manipulation of the host odour in a natural transmission system and indicates that infected dogs may have a disproportionate significance in maintaining infection in canine and human infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease caused by the Protist parasite Leishmania infantum. In Brazil and other South and Central American countries, the parasite is transmitted by the blood-feeding activity of infected female Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies. The disease leads to thousands of human cases and deaths every year. Domestic dogs are the reservoir of infection for humans therefore understanding the effect of infection on dogs is important in developing an understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. Although previous studies on rodent models of Le. infantum infection have shown that infected Golden Hamsters are more attractive to Lu. longipalpis the attractiveness of naturally infected dogs to the insect vector has not been previously been investigated. In this study we showed that the odour of infected dogs is significantly more attractive to female sand flies which can transmit the pathogen than to male sand flies which do not. This clear-cut difference in attraction of female and males suggests that the females are preferentially attracted by parasite infected hosts and may lead to enhanced infection and transmission opportunities for the parasite.",

    "abstract": "Large scale digitization projects such as #ScanAllFishes and oVert are generating high-resolution microCT scans of vertebrates by the thousands. Data from these projects are shared with the community using aggregate 3D specimen repositories like MorphoSource through various open licenses. MorphoSource currently hosts tens of thousands of 3D scans of eukaryotes. Along with the data from similarly scoped projects such as 10kPhenomes, DigiMorph and many others, soon hundreds of thousands of specimens that represent biodiversity of extinct and extant organisms will be conveniently available to researchers. We anticipate an explosion of quantitative research in organismal biology with the convergence of available data and the methodologies to analyze them.\n\nThough the data are available, the road from a series of images to analysis is fraught with challenges for most biologists. It involves tedious tasks of data format conversions, preserving spatial scale of the data accurately, 3D visualization and segmentations, acquiring measurements and annotations. When scientists use commercial software with proprietary formats, a roadblock for data exchange, collaboration, and reproducibility is erected that hurts the efforts of the scientific community to broaden participation in research. Another relevant concern is that ultimate derivative data from individual research projects (e.g., 3D models of segmentation) are shared in formats that do not preserve the correct spatial scale of the data.\n\nIn this paper, we present our effort to tackle challenges biologists face when conducting 3D specimen-based research. We developed SlicerMorph as an extension of 3D Slicer, a biomedical visualization and analysis ecosystem with extensive visualization and segmentation capabilities built on proven python-scriptable open-source libraries such as Visualization Toolkit and Insight Toolkit. In addition to the core functionalities of Slicer, SlicerMorph provides users with modules to conveniently retrieve open-access 3D models or import users own 3D volumes, to annotate 3D curve and patch-based landmarks, generate canonical templates, conduct geometric morphometric analyses of 3D organismal form using both landmark-driven and landmark-free approaches, and create 3D animations from their results. We highlight how these individual modules can be tied together to establish complete workflow(s) from image sequence to morphospace. Our software development efforts were supplemented with short courses and workshops that cover the fundamentals of 3D imaging and morphometric analyses as it applies to study of organismal form and shape in evolutionary biology, and extensive links to the existing tutorials are provided as supplemental material.\n\nOur goal is to establish a community of organismal biologists centered around Slicer and SlicerMorph to facilitate easy exchange of data and results and collaborations using 3D specimens. Our proposition to our colleagues is that using a common open platform supported by a large user and developer community ensures the longevity and sustainability of the tools beyond the initial development effort.",

    "abstract": "Inbred populations often suffer from heightened mutational load and decreased fitness due to lower efficiency of purifying selection at small effective population size. Genetic rescue (GR) is a tool that is studied and deployed with the aim of increasing fitness of such inbred populations. The success of GR is known to depend on certain factors that may vary between different populations, such as their demographic history and distribution of dominance effects of mutations. While we understand the effects of these factors on the evolution of overall ancestry in the inbred population after GR, it is less clear what the effect is on local adaptations and their genetic architecture. To this end, we conduct a population genetic simulation study evaluating the effect of several different factors on the efficacy of GR including trait complexity (Mendelian vs. polygenic), dominance effects, and demographic history. We find that the effect on local adaptations depends highly on the mutational load at the time of GR, which is shaped dynamically by interactions between demographic history and dominance effects of deleterious variation. While local adaptations are generally restored post-GR in the long run, in the short term they are often compromised in the process of purging deleterious variation. We also show that while local adaptations are almost always fully restored, the degree to which ancestral genetic variation comprising the trait is replaced by donor variation can vary drastically, and is especially high for complex traits. Our results provide considerations for practical GR and its effects on trait evolution.",

    "abstract": "Intraneuronal accumulation of aggregated -synuclein is a pathological hallmark of Parkinsons disease. Therefore, mechanisms capable of promoting -synuclein deposition bear important pathogenetic implications. Mutations of the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA) gene represent a prevalent Parkinsons disease risk factor. They are associated with loss of activity of a key enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, glucocerebrosidase, supporting a mechanistic relationship between abnormal -synuclein-lipid interactions and the development of Parkinson pathology. In this study, the lipid membrane composition of fibroblasts isolated from control subjects, patients with idiopathic Parkinsons disease (iPD) and Parkinson patients carrying the L444P GBA mutation (PD-GBA) was assayed using shotgun lipidomics. The lipid profile of PD-GBA fibroblasts differed significantly from that of control and iPD cells. It was characterized by an overall increase in sphingolipid levels. It also featured a significant change in the proportion of ceramide, sphingomyelin and hexosylceramide molecules with shorter and longer hydrocarbon chain length; levels of shorter-chain molecules were increased while the percent of longer-chain sphingolipids was decreased in PD-GBA lipid extracts. The extent of this shift was correlated to the degree of reduction of fibroblast glucocerebrosidase activity. In a second set of experiments, lipid extracts from control and PD-GBA fibroblasts were added to incubations of recombinant -synuclein. The kinetics of -synuclein aggregation, as assessed by the binding of thioflavin T to amyloid structures, was significantly accelerated after addition of PD-GBA extracts as compared to control samples. Amyloid fibrils collected at the end of these incubations contained lipids, indicating -synuclein-lipid co-assembly. Lipids extracted from -synuclein fibrils were also analysed by shotgun lipidomics. Data revealed that the lipid content of these fibrils was significantly enriched of shorter-chain sphingolipids. Taken together, findings of this study indicate that the L444P GBA mutation and consequent enzymatic loss are associated with a distinctly altered membrane lipid profile that provides a biological fingerprint of this mutation in Parkinson fibroblasts. This altered lipid profile, which includes an increased content of shorter-chain sphingolipids, could also be an indicator of increased risk for -synuclein aggregate pathology. Shorter-chain molecules may act as preferred reactants during lipid-induced -synuclein fibrillation.",

The different roles of -synuclein are characterized by distinct structural states (membrane-bound, dimer, tetramer, oligomer, and fibril), which are originated from its various monomeric conformations. The pathological states, determined by the ensemble of -synuclein monomer conformations and dynamic pathways of interconversion between dominant states, remain elusive due to their transient nature. Here, we use inter-dye distance distributions from bulk time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer as restraints in discrete molecular dynamics simulations to map the conformational space of the -synuclein monomer. We further confirm the generated conformational ensemble in orthogonal experiments utilizing far-UV circular dichroism and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Single-molecule protein-induced fluorescence enhancement measurements show that within this conformational ensemble, some of the conformations of -synuclein are surprisingly stable, exhibiting conformational transitions slower than milliseconds. Our comprehensive analysis of the conformational ensemble reveals essential structural properties and potential conformations that promote its various functions in membrane interaction or oligomer and fibril formation.",

We used 448,553 somatic mutations from whole-genome sequencing of 843 clonal haematopoietic colonies to reconstruct the phylogeny of haematopoiesis, from embryogenesis to clinical disease, in 10 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms which are blood cancers more common in older age. JAK2V617F, the pathognomonic mutation in these cancers, was acquired in utero or childhood, with upper estimates of age of acquisition ranging between 4.1 months and 11.4 years across 5 patients. DNMT3A mutations, which are associated with age-related clonal haematopoiesis, were also acquired in utero or childhood, by 7.9 weeks of gestation to 7.8 years across 4 patients. Subsequent driver mutation acquisition was separated by decades. The mean latency between JAK2V617F acquisition and clinical presentation was 31 years (range 12-54 years). Rates of clonal expansion varied substantially (<10% to >200% expansion/year), were affected by additional driver mutations, and predicted latency to clinical presentation. Driver mutations and rates of expansion would have been detectable in blood one to four decades before clinical presentation. This study reveals how driver mutation acquisition very early in life with life-long growth and evolution drive adult blood cancer, providing opportunities for early detection and intervention, and a new paradigm for cancer development.",

Negative genetic correlations were identified between chronotype and brain-wide mean, axial and radial diffusivities. When exploring individual tracts, ten negative genetic correlations were observed with mean diffusivities, 10 with axial diffusivities, 4 with radial diffusivities and 2 with mode of anisotropy. We found evidence for a possible causal association of chronotype with white matter microstructure in individual tracts including the posterior limb and retrolenticular part of the internal capsule; the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and the posterior, superior and anterior regions of the corona radiata.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that eveningness is associated with variation in tract-specific white matter microstructure and, for an evening person, increases in axial and / or radial diffusivities may influence a higher mean diffusivity. These findings add to our understanding of circadian preference and its relationship with the brain, providing new perspectives on the genetic neurological underpinnings of chronotypes role in health and disease.\n\nStatement of SignificanceSleep is essential for a healthy brain function, particularly for neural organization and brain structure development. Individual chronotype differences have been associated with depression, schizophrenia, diabetes and obesity, among other conditions. Investigating the shared genetic aetiology between chronotype and white matter microstructure is essential to understand the neurological basis of individual variation in chronotype.

    "abstract": "Stress is a ubiquitous part of life that disrupts cellular function and, if unresolved, can irreparably damage essential biomolecules and organelles. All organisms can experience stress in the form of unfavorable environmental conditions including exposure to extreme temperatures, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, alcohol, or shifts in osmolarity. To survive, organisms must sense these changes then react and adapt. One highly conserved adaptive response to stress is through protein sumoylation, which is a post-translational modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein. In this study, we examine the effects of acute ethanol stress on protein sumoylation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although ethanol induces protein sumoylation, the targets and roles of sumoylation are largely unknown. Here, we found that cells exhibit a transient sumoylation response after exposure of cells to [&le;] 7.5% volume/volume ethanol. The response peaks at 15 minutes and resolves by 60 minutes, indicating that cells have an adaptive response to low concentrations of ethanol. By contrast, the sumoylation response becomes chronic at 10% ethanol stress with no resolution by 60 minutes. To identify key targets of ethanol-induced sumoylation, we performed mass spectrometry analyses and identified 18 proteins with increased sumoylation after acute ethanol exposure, with 15 identified as known chromatin-associated proteins. Two of these proteins are the chromatin structural proteins Smc5 and Smc6, which are sumoylated by the activity of the SUMO ligase Mms21. Ethanol-induced Smc5/6 sumoylation occurs during G1 and G2M phases of the cell cycle but is abrogated during S phase despite the fact that other proteins are sumoylated during this phase. Acute ethanol exposure leads to formation of Rad52 foci indicating DNA damage similar to that observed with the addition of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), which is an alkylating agent that damages DNA. Whereas MMS exposure induces the intra-S phase DNA damage checkpoint as observed by Rad53 phosphorylation, ethanol exposure does not induce the intra-S phase checkpoint and prevents Rad53 phosphorylation when added with MMS. From these results, we propose that ethanol induces a structural change in chromatin, possibly through DNA damage, and this causes sumoylation of conserved chromatin-associated proteins, including Smc5 and Smc6.",

    "abstract": "Markov state models (MSMs) have been widely applied to study the kinetics and pathways of protein conformational dynamics based on statistical analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These MSMs coarse-grain both configuration space and time in ways that limit what kinds of observables they can reproduce with high fidelity over different spatial and temporal resolutions. Despite their popularity, there is still limited understanding of which biophysical observables can be computed from these MSMs in a robust and unbiased manner, and which suffer from the space-time coarse-graining intrinsic in the MSM model. Most theoretical arguments and practical validity tests for MSMs rely on long-time equilibrium kinetics, such as the slowest relaxation timescales and experimentally observable time-correlation functions. Here, we perform an extensive assessment of the ability of well-validated protein folding MSMs to accuractely reproduce path-based observable such as mean first-passage times (MFPTs) and transition path mechanisms compared to a direct trajectory analysis. We also assess a recently proposed class of history-augmented MSMs (haMSMs) that exploit additional information not accounted for in standard MSMs. We conclude with some practical guidance on the use of MSMs to study various problems in conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In brief, MSMs can accurately reproduce correlation functions slower than the lag time, but path-based observables can only be reliably reproduced if the lifetimes of states exceed the lag time, which is a much stricter requirement. Even in the presence of short-lived states, we find that haMSMs reproduce path-based observables more reliably.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by a genome-wide profile of differential DNA methylation that is skewed towards hypermethylation in most tissues, including brain. The molecular mechanisms involve the overexpression of genes related to DNA methylation on chromosome 21. Here, we stably overexpressed the chromosome 21 gene DNA methyltransferase 3L (DNMT3L) in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and assayed DNA methylation at over 26 million CpGs by whole genome bisulfite sequencing at three different developmental phases (undifferentiated, differentiating, and differentiated). DNMT3L overexpression resulted in global CpG and CpG island hypermethylation as well as thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The DNMT3L DMRs were skewed towards hypermethylation and mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, cellular signaling, and gene regulation. Merging the DMRs into a consensus profile where the cell lines clustered by genotype and then phase demonstrated that different regions of common genes are affected. The hypermethylated DMRs from all pairwise comparisons were enriched for regions of bivalent chromatin marked by H3K4me3 as well as differentially methylated CpGs from previous DS studies of diverse tissues. In contrast, the hypomethylated DMRs from all pairwise comparisons displayed a tissue-specific profile enriched for regions of heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 during embryonic development. Taken together, we propose a mechanism whereby regions of bivalent chromatin that lose H3K4me3 during development are targeted by excess DNMT3L and become hypermethylated, while excess DNMT3L also evicts DNMT3A from heterochromatin, resulting in hypomethylation. Overall, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3L overexpression during neurodevelopment recreates a facet of the DS DNA methylation signature.",

    "abstract": "Blackgram is a widely cultivated pulse crop in Asia. Bruchid pests and yellow mosaic disease (YMD) causes huge loss in legume production including blackgram. Blackgram wild accession (Vigna mungo var. silvestris), Trombay wild urd (INGR10133) conferred resistance to bruchids especially Callosobruchus maculatus, through antibiosis. However, the mechanisms still remains uncharacterized. We performed the comparative transcriptome analysis of the developing seeds of wild and cultivated blackgram with contrasting phenotypes for 3 traits, bruchids infestation, YMD and seed size. In this study,715differentially expressed genes(DEGs) were re-annotated with reference to NCBI nr database. RNA-Seq was validated by quantitative real-time PCR for 22 DEGs. In Trombay wild, defense related components such as acid phosphatase, vicilins, trypsin inhibitor, brassinosteroid signalling components were found up-regulated. While in cultivar, transcripts for LEA, cysteine protease, autophagy related proteins(ATG3, ATG5, ATG8C and ATG1t), DnaJ, tobamovirus multiplication protein, downy mildew resistance protein, LRR/F-box proteins were found up-regulated. In TW, three transcripts were found common for both bruchids pest and geminivirus resistance (LRR receptor kinase, transmembrane protein 87b and thaumatin like protein).Our study is the first report on transcriptomic differences between wild and cultivated blackgram with new insights into the molecular networks underlying seed development, resistance to pests and pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1 or delta-9 desaturase, D9D) is a key metabolic protein that modulates cellular inflammation and stress, but overactivity of SCD1 is associated with diseases including cancer and metabolic syndrome. This transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum protein converts saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily stearoyl-CoA into oleoyl-CoA, which are critical products for energy metabolism and membrane composition. The present computational molecular dynamics study characterizes the molecular dynamics of SCD1 with substrate, product, and as apoprotein. The modeling of SCD1:fatty acid interactions suggests that 1) SCD1:CoA moiety interactions open the substrate binding tunnel, 2) SCD1 stabilizes a substrate conformation favorable for desaturation, and 3) SCD1:product interactions result in an opening of the tunnel, possibly allowing product exit into the surrounding membrane. Together, these results describe a highly dynamic series of SCD1 conformations resulting from the enzyme:cofactor:substrate interplay that inform drug-discovery efforts.",

The modelling experiment compared the results of a reference run in the presence of sea ice with those of a run in the absence of sea ice, which confirmed that ecological conditions differed significantly for both the scenarios. It has been found that diatoms dominate the phytoplankton biomass in the absence of sea ice, whereas dinoflagellates dominate the biomass in the presence of thin sea ice. The study concludes that under moderate ice conditions (representing the last few decades), dinoflagellates dominate the spring bloom phytoplankton biomass in the Baltic Sea, whereas diatoms will be dominant in the future as a result of climate change i.e. in the absence of sea ice..",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a current research area in cellular treatments due to multipotential characteristics. The aim of this study is to assess the interaction of MSC with CDDP in an athymic nude mouse NB model. Athymic male nude mice (n=28) were injected subcutaneously with C1300 NB cell line. After tumor growth to 1 cm diameter in 7-10 days, mice were randomly assigned to one of 4 experimental groups of control, CDDP treatment, MSC treatment and CDDP+MSC treatment with 7 mice in each group. Animals had basal auditory tests performed and had physiological serum or CDDP (20 mg/kg) injected into the peritoneum and were intravenously injected with 1x105 MSC once. Seven days later, hearing tests were performed again and the animals were sacrificed. Tumor tissue was assessed in terms of necrosis, apoptosis and viability. Apoptosis was evaluated with annexin V+PI flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL. Additionally, the MSC rate within the tumor was assessed with flow cytometry for triple CD34+ CD44+ and CD117-expression. Additionally, liver, kidney, brain and cochlear tissue were analyzed with light microscopy in terms of systemic side effect profile. Expression of the cochlear cell proteins of calretinin, math-1 and myosin2A were immunohistochemically assessed in ear sections. Statistical analysis used the nonparametric Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests with p<0.05 significance. Tumor tissues were found to have statistically significantly higher levels of necrosis in the CDDP group and CDDP+MSC group compared to the control and MSC groups (p=0.001, p=0.006). The CDDP+MSC group had lower tumor necrosis rates than the CDDP group but this was not observed to have statistical significance (p=0.05). MSC did not change the tumor dimensions in the CDDP group (p=0.557). The groups administered MSC had higher triple CD34+ CD44+ and CD117- expression within tumor tissue compared to the control and CDDP groups. In the inner ear, the expression of cochlear cell proteins calretinin, math-1 and myosin2A were identified to be highest in the groups administered MSC. Auditory tests observed that the 15-decibel loss at 12, 16, 20 and 32 kHz frequencies in both ears with CDDP was resolved with MSC administration. With this study, IV administration of MSC treatment was observed to prevent the hearing loss caused by CDDP without disrupting the antitumor effect of CDDP. Systemic MSC may be assessed for clinical use to reduce the side effects of CDDP.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa has been cultivated since antiquity as a source of fibre, food and medicine. The recent resurgence of Cannabis as a cash crop is mainly driven by the medicinal and therapeutic properties of its resin, which contains compounds that interact with the human endocannabinoid system. Compared to other medicinal crops of similar value, however, little is known about the biology of C. sativa. Glandular trichomes are small hair-like projections made up of stalk and head tissue and are responsible for the production of the resin in C. sativa. Trichome productivity, as determined by Cannabis sativa resin yield and composition, is only beginning to be understood at the molecular level. In this study the proteomes of glandular trichome stalks and heads, were investigated and compared to the proteome of the whole flower tissue, to help elucidate Cannabis sativa glandular trichome biochemistry. The data suggested that the floral tissue acts as a major source of carbon and energy to the glandular trichome head sink tissue, supplying sugars which drive secondary metabolite biosynthesis in the glandular trichome head; the location of the secretory cells. The trichome stalk seems to play only a limited role in secondary metabolism and acts as both source and sink.",

The four treatments were control (CK), 15N-urea, 15N-urea plus straw, and 15N-straw plus urea. Soil N pools, maize N and their 15N abundance were determined during maize growth. At maturity 26.0% of straw N was assimilated by maize in the urea plus straw treatment. From the eighth leaf stage to maturity, urea plus straw had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher concentration and percentage of exogenous substrate N present as soil total N (TN), particulate organic N (PON), and mineral associated total N (MTN) in bulk and rhizosphere soils than the urea-only treatment. From silking to maturity in the urea plus straw treatment, rhizosphere soil significantly (P < 0.05) increased the percentage of exogenous substrate N present as inorganic N (Inorg-N) and MTN, and significantly (P < 0.05) decreased that present as PON and microbial biomass N (MBN) compared with the bulk soil. From the eighth leaf stage to maturity, rhizosphere soil significantly (P < 0.05) increased the percentage of straw N present as Inorg-N and MTN except for MTN at the silking stage, and significantly decreased (P < 0.05) that present as PON compared with the bulk soil. Overall, straw was an available N source to the crop, and the increase in straw N availability needs to be considered from the interaction of fertilization practices and the crop rhizosphere.",

For larvae, high mortality was observed for all treatments: In vitro-cultured S. yirgalemense (98%) performed better than S. jeffreyense (73%), while within in vivo cultures, there was no difference between nematode species (both 83%). No significant difference was detected between in vivo- and in vitro cultures of the same nematode species. The LD50 of the in vitro-cultured S. yirgalemense, the best performing species, was 7.33 nematodes per larva. Mortality by infection was established by dissecting cadavers and confirming the presence of nematodes, which was > 90% for all treatments. Within in vitro cultures, both S. yirgalemense and S. jeffreyense were able to produce a new cohort of infective juveniles from L. vanillana larvae. Pupae, however, were found to be considerably less susceptible to EPN infection.

    "abstract": "Lower function of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) has a strong relationship with the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. One characteristic of ASD is the repetitive and restrictive behavior, which may form the basis for better memory and savant skills in some people with ASD. This characteristic in ASD may reflect a tendency towards an exploitation strategy rather than an exploration strategy during learning. Using a rat model, we developed a touchscreen-based task for testing 5-HTT knockout effects on stimulus category learning. By analyzing the data with a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model, we find that 5-HTT knockout rats show a lower learning rate and apply more of an exploitation versus exploration strategy compared to WT rats during category learning. The decision bound of decision-making during stimulus generalization indicates that more 5-HTT knockout rats than WT rats exploit irrelevant information to categorize stimuli. The touchscreen-based task we developed greatly increases the translational value from animals to humans and helps to understand the behavioral mechanisms underlying repetitive behavior in ASD.",

Here, we show that rhythmicity can be observed in behavioral responses from memory tasks, where participants indicate, using button presses, the timing of encoding or retrieval of cue-object associative memories. We found no evidence for rhythmicity in button presses for visual tasks using the same stimuli, or for questions about already retrieved objects. The oscillations for correctly remembered trials center in the slow theta frequency range (1-5 Hz), while responses from later forgotten trials do not lock to the behavioral oscillation. Using intracranial EEG recordings, we show that the memory task induces temporally extended phase consistency in hippocampal local field potentials at slow theta frequencies, but only for correctly remembered trials, providing a mechanistic underpinning for the theta oscillations found in behavioral responses.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes form myelin for central nervous system axons and release factors which signal to neurons during myelination. Here, we ask how oligodendroglial factors influence hippocampal GABAergic neuron physiology. In mixed hippocampal cultures GABAergic neurons fired action potentials of short duration and received high frequencies of excitatory synaptic events. In purified neuronal cultures without glial cells, GABAergic neuron excitability increased and the frequency of synaptic events decreased. These effects were largely reversed by adding oligodendrocyte conditioned medium. We compared the transcriptomic signature with the electrophysiological phenotype of single neurons in these three culture conditions. Genes expressed by single pyramidal or GABAergic neurons largely conformed to expected cell-type specific patterns. Multiple genes of GABAergic neurons were significantly downregulated by the transition from mixed cultures containing glial cells to purified neuronal cultures. Levels of these genes were restored by the addition of oligodendrocyte conditioned medium to purified cultures. Clustering genes with similar changes in expression between different culture conditions revealed processes affected by oligodendroglial factors. Enriched genes are linked to roles in synapse assembly, action potential generation and transmembrane ion transport, including of zinc. These results provide new insight into the molecular targets by which oligodendrocytes influence neuron excitability and synaptic function.",

    "abstract": "Visually guided behavior relies on the integration of sensory input with information held in working memory. Yet it remains unclear how this is accomplished at the level of neural circuits. We studied the direct visual cortical inputs to neurons within a visuomotor area of prefrontal cortex in behaving monkeys. We show that the synaptic efficacy of visual cortical input to prefrontal cortex is gated by information held in working memory. Surprisingly, visual input to prefrontal neurons was found to target those with both visual and motor properties, rather than preferentially targeting other visual neurons. Furthermore, activity evoked from visual cortex was larger in magnitude, more synchronous, and more rapid, when monkeys remembered locations that matched the location of visual input. These results indicate that working memory directly influences the circuitry that transforms visual input into visually guided behavior.",

    "abstract": "Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels have been associated with disease and survival status in septic humans and dogs. To date, studies investigating cfDNA levels in association with critical illness in foals are lacking. We hypothesized that cfDNA would be detectable in the plasma of foals, that septic and sick-nonseptic foals would have significantly higher cfDNA levels compared to healthy foals, and that increased cfDNA levels would be associated with non-survival. Animals used include 80 foals of 10 days of age or less admitted to a tertiary referral center between January and July, 2020 were stratified into three categories: healthy (n=34), sick non-septic (n=11) and septic (n=35) based on specific criteria. This was a prospective clinical study. Blood was collected from critically ill foals at admission or born in hospital for cfDNA quantification and blood culture. Previously published sepsis score (SS) and neonatal SIRS score (NSIRS) were also calculated. SS, NSIRS, blood culture status and cfDNA concentrations were evaluated to predict survival. Continuous variables between groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunns post hoc test. Comparisons between two groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-test or Spearman rank for correlations. The performance of cfDNA, sepsis score and NSIRS score to predict survival was assessed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis including area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity using cutoffs. Plasma cfDNA was detectable in all foals. No significant differences in cfDNA concentration were detected between healthy foals and septic foals (P=0.65) or healthy foals and sick non-septic foals (P=0.88). There was no significant association between cfDNA and culture status, SS, NSIRS or foal survival. SS (AUC 0.85) and NSIRS (AUC 0.83) were superior to cfDNA (AUC 0.64) in predicting survival. cfDNA was detectable in foal plasma however offers negligible utility to diagnose sepsis or predict survival in critical illness in neonates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGiven the challenges and costs associated with implementing HIV-1 incidence assay testing, there is great interest in evaluating the use of commercial HIV diagnostic tests for determining recent HIV infection. A diagnostic test with the capability of providing reliable data for the determination of recent HIV infection without substantial modifications to the test protocol would have a significant impact on HIV surveillance. The Abbott ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo Assay is an antigen/antibody immunoassay, which meets the criteria as the first screening test in the recommended HIV laboratory diagnostic algorithm for the United States.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we evaluated the performance characteristics of the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/Co) for determining recent infection, including estimation of the mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) and false recent rate (FRR), and selection of recency cutoffs.\n\nResultsThe MDRI estimates for the S/Co recency cutoff of 400 is within the 4 to 12 months range recommended for HIV incidence assays, and the FRR rate for this cutoff was 1.5%. Additionally, ARCHITECT Combo S/Co values were compared relative to diagnostic test results from two prior prospective HIV-1 diagnostic studies in order to validate the use of the S/Co for both diagnostic and recency determination.\n\nConclusionDual-use of the ARCHITECT Combo assay data for diagnostic and incidence purposes would reduce the need for separate HIV incidence testing and allow for monitoring of recent infection for incidence estimation and other public health applications.",

Injected mice were subjected to moderate treadmill running (MTR) and intensive treadmill running (ITR). In MTR mice, both GFP-TSC and GFP-TNC injected tendons maintained normal cell morphology with elevated expression of tendon related markers collagen I and tenomodulin. In ITR mice injected with GFP-TNCs, cells also maintained an elongated shape similar to the shape found in normal/untreated control mice, as well as elevated expression of tendon related markers. However, ITR mice injected with GFP-TSCs showed typical tendinopathic changes, such as cell morphology transitioning to a round shape, elevated chondrogenic differentiation, and increased gene expression of non-tenocyte related genes LPL, Runx-2, and SOX-9. Increased gene expression data was supported by immunostaining showing elevated expression of SOX-9, Runx-2, and PPAR{gamma}. This study provides evidence that while MTR maintains tendon homeostasis by promoting the differentiation of TSCs into tenocytes, ITR may cause the development of tendinopathy by inducing non-tenocyte differentiation of TSCs, thus leading to the presence of non-tendinous tissues in tendon.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) addition has increased soil nutrient availability, thereby affecting ecosystem processes and functions in N-limited ecosystems. Long-term N addition decreases plant biodiversity, but the effects of short-term N addition on soil microbial community is poorly understood. The present study examined the impacts of short-term N addition (NH4NO3) on these factors in a sandy grassland and semi-fixed sandy land in the Horqin Sandy Land. We measured the responses of soil microbial biomass C and N; on soil {beta}-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and {beta}-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity; and soil microflora characteristics to N additions gradient with 0 (control), 5 (N5), 10 (N10), and 15 (N15) g N m-2 yr-1. The soil microbial biomass indices, NAG activity, and soil microflora characteristics did not differ significantly among the N levels, and there was no difference at the two sites. The competition for N between plants and soil microbes was not eliminated by short-term N addition due to the low soil nutrient and moisture contents, and the relationships among the original soil microbes did not change. However, N addition increased BG activity in the N5 and N10 additions in the sandy grassland, and in the N5, N10, and N15 additions in the semi-fixed sandy land. This may be due to increased accumulation and fixation of plant litter into soils in response to N addition, leading to increased microbial demand for a C source and increased soil BG activity. Future research should explore the relationships between soil microbial community and N addition at the two sites.",

    "abstract": "Present investigation was carried out to assess the heterotic potential and combining ability of immortal restorer lines [consisting of two recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and two doubled haploid lines (DHLs)] developed from an elite rice hybrid, KRH-2 by crossing them with three popular WA-CMS lines, IR58025A, CRMS32A and APMS6A through line x tester analysis. The doubled haploid line 1 (DHL-1) was observed to be a good general combiner for total grain yield per plant (YLD) and other yield component traits and among the CMS lines, IR58025A was observed to be the best combiner as it showed positive significant values for the traits viz., total grain yield per plant, panicle length and spikelet fertility. Higher preponderance of the variance associated with specific combining ability (SCA) as compared to general combining ability (GCA) variance was observed for most of the traits indicated the predominant role of non-additive gene action in the expression of the traits. Out of twelve novel crosses between the immortal restorer lines derived from KRH-2 and the WA-CMS lines, 66.66% (eight crosses) showed significant and desirable SCA effects for the traits viz., total grain yield per plant, days to fifty percent flowering, plant height, flag leaf length, flag leaf width, number of filled grains per panicle and spikelet fertility. Two crosses IR58025A/RIL-24 and CRMS32A/RIL-24 were observed to be the most promising cross combinations showing standard heterosis of >50% for YLD trait (as compared with KRH-2) with higher prevalence of GCA and SCA, respectively. Heterotic yield advantage of IR58025A/RIL-24 and CRMS32A/RIL-24 was 77.05% and 54.74%, respectively over KRH-2 and these can be utilized for developing commercial hybrids. The present study also indicates the potentiality of RILs in providing useful parental lines for developing heterotic hybrids which are hard to get from outside sources in the new intellectual property regime.",

    "abstract": "Non-additive genetic variance for complex traits is traditionally estimated from data on relatives. It is notoriously difficult to estimate without bias in non-laboratory species, including humans, because of possible confounding with environmental covariance among relatives. In principle, non-additive variance attributable to common DNA variants can be estimated from a random sample of unrelated individuals with genome-wide SNP data. Here, we jointly estimate the proportion of variance explained by additive [Formula], dominance [Formula] and additive-by-additive [Formula] genetic variance in a single analysis model. We first show by simulations that our model leads to unbiased estimates and provide new theory to predict standard errors estimated using either least squares or maximum likelihood. We then apply the model to 70 complex traits using 254,679 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank and 1.1M genotyped and imputed SNPs. We found strong evidence for additive variance (average across traits [Formula]. In contrast, the average estimate of [Formula] across traits was 0.001, implying negligible dominance variance at causal variants tagged by common SNPs. The average epistatic variance [Formula] across the traits was 0.058, not significantly different from zero because of the large sampling variance. Our results provide new evidence that genetic variance for complex traits is predominantly additive, and that sample sizes of many millions of unrelated individuals are needed to estimate epistatic variance with sufficient precision.",

    "abstract": "Tropical sward characteristics can alter lamb ingestive behavior. Our study evaluated the ingestive behavior of young lambs in different tropical pastures to identify which variables interfere in their grazing activity. Two years of study were carried out with 54 weaned lambs distributed in three different swards: 1) monoculture of a upright grass, guinea grass (Panicum maximum; GG); 2) monoculture of a shrubby legume pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan; PP) and 3) contiguous areas with half the paddock with GG and half with PP (GP). The experiment was set out in a randomized complete block design. Lamb ingestive behavior was observed from sunrise to sunset with records every 5 minutes. To identify the main variables that affected with the lamb grazing activity, a multivariate analysis of the Decision Tree was performed. Our results showed that there was no difference in the ingestive behavior parameters of young lambs in different swards (P > 0.05). There was interaction among the swards and the experimental periods for the variables idleness time and biting rate (P [&le;] 0.05). Grazing time of the animals increased 40% with experimental period progression. The Decision Tree identified leaf:stem ratio as the variable that most influenced lamb grazing time in GG and GP swards while in the PP sward grazing time was directly related to the pasture height. The behavior of young lambs on tropical pasture is variable as there is a change in the behavioral response over time. In addition, the grazing time of these animals can be estimated by means of variables related to pasture structural characteristics (leaf:stem ratio and height) together with chemical variables.",

In the SCI group, a laminectomy was performed at the T10 vertebrae, followed by weight-drop contusion of the spinal cord. In the sham group, a laminectomy was carried out without SCI contusion.\n\nKey findingsOur results showed that Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale scores were significantly decreased after SCI, and were obviously improved in SCI rats with Ex-4 administration. Additionally, the water content of spinal cord in SCI group was dramatically increased than that in sham group, and after Ex-4 treatment, degree of edema of spinal cord was remarkably reduced. And also, concentration levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-1{beta}, IL-6 and TNF-) in the spinal cord were significantly elevated after SCI, and were remarkably reduced in SCI rats with Ex-4 administration. Subsequently, cell apoptosis rate in the injured spinal cord was significantly increased, and after Ex-4 treatment, cell apoptosis rate was remarkably decreased. We also revealed that levels of PCBP2 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated after SCI, and were dramatically dropped in SCI rats with Ex-4 administration.\n\nSignificanceTake altogether, our findings disclosed that Ex-4 plays a role in promoting neurological function recovery and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis through effecting PCBP2 expression in SCI rat models.",

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets are lipid storage organelles found in nearly all cell types from adipocytes to cancer cells. Although increasingly implicated in disease, current methods to study lipid droplets require fixation or static imaging which limits investigation of their rapid in vivo dynamics. To address this, we created a lipid droplet transgenic reporter in whole animals and cell culture by fusing tdTOMATO to Perilipin-2 (PLIN2), a lipid droplet structural protein. Expression of this transgene in transparent casper zebrafish enabled in vivo imaging of adipose depots responsive to nutrient deprivation and high-fat diet. Using this system, we tested novel regulators of lipolysis, revealing an unexpected role for nitric oxide in modulating adipocyte lipid droplets. Similarly, we expressed the PLIN2-tdTOMATO transgene in melanoma cells and found that the nitric oxide pathway also regulated lipid droplets in cancer. This model offers a tractable imaging platform to study lipid droplets across cell types and disease contexts.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are inherently dynamic cytoskeletal polymers whose length and activity can be altered to perform essential functions in eukaryotic cells, such as providing tracks for intracellular trafficking and forming the mitotic spindle. Microtubules can be bundled to create more stable structures that collectively propagate force, such as in the flagellar axoneme, which provides motility. The subpellicular microtubule array of the protist parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, is a remarkable example of a highly specialized microtubule bundle, comprising a single microtubule layer that is crosslinked to each other and the plasma membrane. The array microtubules appear to be highly stable and remain intact throughout the cell cycle, but very little is known about the pathways that tune microtubule properties in trypanosomatids. Here, we show that the subpellicular microtubule array is organized into subdomains that consist of differentially localized array-associated proteins. We characterize the localization and function of the array-associated protein PAVE1, which is a component of the inter-microtubule crosslinking fibrils present within the posterior subdomain. PAVE1 functions to stabilize these microtubules to produce the tapered cell posterior. PAVE1 and the newly identified PAVE2 form a complex that binds directly to the microtubule lattice. TbAIR9, which localizes to the entirety of the subpellicular array, is necessary for retaining PAVE1 within the posterior subdomain, and also maintains array-associated proteins in the middle and anterior subdomains of the array. The arrangement of proteins within the array is likely to tune the local properties of the array microtubules and create the asymmetric shape of the cell, which is essential for parasite viability.\n\nAuthor summaryMany parasitic protists use arrays of microtubules that contact the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, typically known as subpellicular microtubules, to shape their cells into forms that allow them to efficiently infect their hosts. While subpellicular arrays are found in a wide range of parasites, very little is known about how they are assembled and maintained. Trypanosoma brucei, which is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, has an elaborate subpellicular array that produces the helical shape of the parasite, which is essential for its ability to move within crowded and viscous solutions. We have identified a series of proteins that have a range of localization patterns within the array, which suggests that the array is regulated by subdomains of array-associated proteins that may tune the local properties of the microtubules to suit the stresses found at different parts of the cell body. Among these proteins are the first known components of the inter-microtubule crosslinks that are thought to stabilize array microtubules, as well as a potential regulator of the array subdomains. These results establish a foundation to understand how subpellicular arrays are built, shaped, and maintained, which has not previously been appreciated.",

In this study, the dynamics of activation of the canonical Wnt pathway were investigated during BEC-to-hepatocyte conversion using as a model methionine/choline deficient (MCD)-injured livers where hepatocyte proliferation was compromised by the overexpression of p21. In this model, activation of {beta}-catenin was found an event associated with BEC reprogramming. Using ductal organoids to model BECs transitioning into hepatocytes, we found that activation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway in these cells promoted partial escape from a biliary fate and triggered the acquisition of progenitor cell features. Our data furthermore support that BECs are source of Wnt ligands and that Rspo proteins potentially act as the limiting factor controlling the activation of {beta}-catenin activation and BEC reprogramming during severe liver damage.",

    "abstract": "The in vitro generation from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) of different blood cell types, in particular those that are not replenished by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) like fetal-derived tissue-resident macrophages and innate-like lymphocytes, is of a particular interest. In order to succeed in this endeavor, a thorough understanding of the pathway interplay promoting lineage specification for the different blood cell types is needed. Notch signaling is essential for the HSC generation and their derivatives, but its requirement for tissue-resident immune cells is unknown. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to recapitulate murine embryonic development, we have studied the requirement for Notch signaling during the earliest B-lymphopoiesis and found that Rbpj-deficient mESCs are able to generate B-1 cells. Their Notch-independence was confirmed in ex vivo experiments using Rbpj-deficient embryos. In addition, we found that upregulation of Notch signaling was needed for the emergence of B-2 lymphoid cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that control of Notch signaling dosage is critical for the different B-cell lineage specification and provides pivotal information for their in vitro generation from PSCs for therapeutic applications.",
