    "abstract": "Human Body Communication (HBC) is an alternative to radio wave-based Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) because of its low-loss, wide bandwidth leading to enhanced energy efficiency. HBC also shows better performance in terms of physical security as most of the signal is confined within the body. To obtain optimum performance and usability, modeling of the body channel plays a vital role. Out of two HBC modalities, Galvanic HBC has the promise to provide lower loss compare to Capacitive HBC for shorter channel length. In this paper, we present the first lumped element based detailed model of Galvanic HBC channel which is used to explain the dependency of channel loss on the material property of skin, fat and muscle tissue layer along with electrode size, electrode separation, geometrical position of the electrodes and return path capacitance. The model considers the impedance of skin and muscle tissue layers and the effect of various coupling capacitances between the body and Tx/Rx electrodes to the Earth-ground. A 2D planner structure is simulated in HFSS to prove the validity of the proposed model. The effect of symmetry and asymmetry at the transmitter and receiver end are also explained using the model. The experimental results show that, due to the mismatch at the transmitter and receiver side, the loss increases gradually with channel length and saturates to a finite value as channel length becomes significantly longer compare to the transmitting or receiving electrode pair separation.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been undergoing various mutations. The analysis of the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. These findings would offer guidance on the development of neutralizing antibodies and the prevention of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans is an important pathogen in the human oral biofilm. It expresses virulent behaviors that are linked to its genetic competence regulon, which is controlled by comX. Expression of comX is modulated by two diffusible signaling peptides, denoted CSP and XIP, and by other environmental cues such as pH and oxidative stress. The sensitivity of S. mutans competence to environmental inputs that may vary on microscopic length scales raises the question of whether the biofilm environment causes spatial clustering of S. mutans virulence behaviors, by creating microniches where competence and related phenotypes are concentrated. We have used two-photon microscopy to characterize the spatial distribution of comX expression among individual S. mutans cells in biofilms. By analyzing correlations in comX activity, we test for spatial clustering that may suggest localized, competence microenvironments. Our data indicate that both competence-signaling peptides diffuse efficiently through the biofilm. CSP triggers a Poisson-like, spatially random, comX response from a subpopulation of cells that is homogeneously dispersed. XIP elicits a population-wide response. Our data indicate that competence microenvironments if they exist are small enough that the phenotypes of individual cells are not clustered or correlated to any greater extent than occurs in planktonic cultures.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is correlated with increased incidence of breast cancer metastasis, however the mechanisms underlying how obesity promotes metastasis are unclear. In a diet-induced obesity mouse model, obesity enhanced lung metastases in both the presence and absence of primary mammary tumors and increased recruitment of myeloid lineage cells into the lungs. In the absence of tumors, obese mice demonstrated increased numbers of myeloid lineage cells and elevated collagen fibers within the lung stroma, reminiscent of pre-metastatic niches formed by primary tumors. Lung stromal cells isolated from obese non-tumor-bearing mice showed increased proliferation, contractility, and expression of extracellular matrix, inflammatory markers, and TGF{beta}1. Conditioned media from lung stromal cells from obese mice promoted myeloid lineage cell migration in vitro in response to CSF2 expression and enhanced invasion of tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that prior to tumor formation, obesity alters the lung microenvironment, creating niches conducive for metastatic growth.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe analyzed the scientific output after COVID-19 and contrasted it with studies published in the aftermath of seven epidemics/pandemics: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Influenza A virus H5N1 and Influenza A virus H1N1 human infections, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, and Dengue.\n\nDesign/Methodology/ApproachWe examined bibliometric measures for COVID-19 and the rest of studied epidemics/pandemics. Data were extracted from Web of Science, using its journal classification scheme as a proxy to quantify the multidisciplinary coverage of scientific output. We proposed a novel Thematic Dispersion Index (TDI) for the analysis of pandemic early stages.\n\nResults/DiscussionThe literature on the seven epidemics/pandemics before COVID-19 has shown explosive growth of the scientific production and continuous impact during the first three years following each emergence or re-emergence of the specific infectious disease. A subsequent decline was observed with the progressive control of each health emergency. We observed an unprecedented growth in COVID-19 scientific production. TDI measured for COVID-19 (29,4) in just six months, was higher than TDI of the rest (7,5 to 21) during the first three years after epidemic initiation.\n\nConclusionsCOVID-19 literature showed the broadest subject coverage, which is clearly a consecuence of its social, economic, and political impact. The proposed indicator (TDI), allowed the study of multidisciplinarity, differentiating the thematic complexity of COVID-19 from the previous seven epidemics/pandemics.\n\nOriginality/ValueThe multidisciplinary nature and thematic complexity of COVID-19 research were successfully analyzed through a scientometric perspective.",

    "abstract": "Viruses thrive by exploiting the cells they infect but must also produce viral proteins to replicate and infect other cells. As a consequence, they are also susceptible to exploitation by defective versions of themselves that do not produce such proteins. A defective viral genome with deletions in protein-coding genes could still replicate in cells coinfected with full-length viruses, and even replicate faster due to its shorter size, interfering with the replication of the virus. We have created a synthetic defective interfering version of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the recent Covid-19 pandemic, assembling parts of the viral genome that do not code for any functional protein but enable it to be replicated and packaged. This synthetic defective genome replicates three times faster than SARS-CoV-2 in coinfected cells, and interferes with it, reducing the viral load of a cell by half in 24 hours. The synthetic genome is transmitted as efficiently as the full-length genome, confirming the location of the putative packaging signal of SARS-CoV-2. A version of such a synthetic construct could be used as a self-promoting antiviral therapy: by enabling replication of the synthetic genome, the virus promotes its own demise.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/393587v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@60aa77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57a965org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@132574dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e2e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphic summary C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) contain the ability to constitute the cell types of the adult vertebrate through a series of developmental state transitions. In culture, ESCs reversibly transition between states in a manner previously described as stochastic. However, whether ESCs retain memory of their previous states or transition in a memoryless (Markovian) process remains relatively unknown. Here we show lineages of ESCs do not exhibit the Markovian property: their previous states and kin relations influence future choices. In a subset of lineages, related ESCs remain likely to occupy the same state weeks after labeling. Unexpectedly, the distribution of lineages across states away from the equilibrium point predicted by a Markov model remains consistent over time, suggesting a conservation of informational entropy in this system. Additionally, some lineages appear highly dynamic in their ability to switch states but do not dominate the culture, suggesting that state switching is a separable property from growth. Together, these data suggest ESC state transitions are a proscribed process governed by additional variables.",

    "abstract": "Humans spend a lifetime learning, storing and refining a repertoire of motor memories. However, it is unknown what principle underlies the way our continuous stream of sensorimotor experience is segmented into separate memories and how we adapt and use this growing repertoire. Here we develop a principled theory of motor learning based on the key insight that memory creation, updating, and expression are all controlled by a single computation - contextual inference. Unlike dominant theories of single-context learning, our repertoire-learning model accounts for key features of motor learning that had no unified explanation and predicts novel phenomena, which we confirm experimentally. These results suggest that contextual inference is the key principle underlying how a diverse set of experiences is reflected in motor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are common in Parkinsons disease (PD), with some PD patients meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). An unaddressed question is whether linguistic prediction is preserved in PD. This ability is nowadays deemed crucial in achieving fast and efficient comprehension, and it may be negatively impacted by cognitive deterioration. To fill this gap of knowledge, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to evaluate mechanisms of linguistic prediction in a sample of PD patients (on dopamine compensation) with and without MCI. To this end, participants read sentence contexts that were predictive or not about a sentence-final word. The final word appeared after 1 second, matching or mismatching the prediction. The introduction of the interval allowed to capture neural responses both before and after sentence-final words, reflecting semantic anticipation and processing. PD patients with normal cognition (N = 58) showed ERP responses comparable to those of matched controls. Specifically, in predictive contexts, a slow negative potential developed prior to sentence-final words, reflecting semantic anticipation. Later, expected words elicited reduced N400 responses (compared to unexpected words), indicating facilitated semantic processing. Besides, PD patients with MCI (N = 20) showed a prolongation of the N400 congruency effect (compared to matched PD patients without MCI), indicating that further cognitive decline impacts semantic processing. Finally, lower verbal fluency scores correlated with prolonged N400 congruency effects and with reduced pre-word differences in all PD patients (N = 78). This relevantly points to a role of deficits in temporal-dependent mechanisms in PD, besides prototypical frontal dysfunction, in altered semantic anticipation and semantic processing during sentence comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Mutations that increase the protein kinase activity of LRRK2 are one of the most common causes of familial Parkinsons disease. LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases within their Switch-II motif, impacting interaction with effectors. We describe and validate a new, multiplexed targeted mass spectrometry assay to quantify endogenous levels of LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab substrates (Rab1, Rab3, Rab8, Rab10, Rab35 and Rab43) as well as total levels of Rabs, LRRK2 and LRRK2-phosphorylated at the Ser910 and Ser935 biomarker sites. Exploiting this assay, we quantify for the first time the relative levels of each of the pRab proteins in different cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, human neutrophils) and mouse tissues (brain, kidney, lung and spleen). We define how these components are impacted by Parkinsons pathogenic mutations (LRRK2[R1441C] and VPS35[D620N]) and LRRK2 inhibitors. We find that the VPS35[D620N], but not LRRK2[R1441C] mutation, enhances Rab1 phosphorylation in a manner blocked by administration of an LRRK2 inhibitor, providing the first evidence that endogenous Rab1 is a physiological substrate for LRRK2. We exploit this assay to demonstrate that in Parkinsons patients with VPS35[D620N] mutations, phosphorylation of multiple Rab proteins (Rab1, Rab3, Rab8, Rab10 and Rab43) is elevated. We highlight the benefits of this assay over immunoblotting approaches currently deployed to assess LRRK2 Rab signalling pathway.",

In this longitudinal analysis, conducted on a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients followed up to 242 days, we found that individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay in neutralizing activity that persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis. Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained higher among hospitalized individuals. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of antibody titers change, reinforcing the hypothesis that the quality of immune response evolves over the post-convalescent stage4,5.",

    "abstract": "The phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis is the primary insect vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. For ectothermic organisms such as sand flies, the ambient temperature is a critical factor influencing all aspects of their life. However, the impact of temperature has been ignored in previous investigations of stress-induced responses by the vector, such as taking a blood meal or during Leishmania infection. Therefore, this study explored the interaction of Lu. longipalpis with temperature by evaluating sand fly behaviour across a thermal gradient after sugar or blood-feeding, and infection with Leishmania mexicana. Thermographic recordings of sand fly females fed on mice were analysed, and the gene expression of heat shock proteins HSP70 and HSP90(83) was evaluated when insects were exposed to extreme temperatures or infected. The results showed that 72h after blood ingestion females of Lu. longipalpis became less active and preferred relatively low temperatures. However, at later stages of blood digestion females increased their activity and remained at higher temperatures prior to taking a second blood meal; this behaviour seems to be correlated with the evolution of their oocysts and voracity for a second blood meal. No changes in the temperature preferences of female sand flies were recorded in the presence of a gut infection by Le. mexicana, indicating that this parasite has not triggered behavioural immunity in Lu. longipalpis. Real-time imaging showed that the body temperature of female flies feeding on mice increased to the same temperature as the host within a few seconds after landing. The body temperature of females remained around 35 {+/-} 0.5 {degrees}C until the end of blood-feeding, revealing a lack of thermoregulatory behaviour. Analysis of expression of heat shock proteins revealed insects increased expression of HSP90(83) when exposed to higher temperatures, such as during blood feeding. Our findings suggest that Lu. longipalpis interacts with the environmental temperature by using its behaviour to avoid temperature-related physiological damage during the gonotrophic cycle. However, the expression of certain heat shock proteins might be triggered to mitigate against thermal stress in situations where a behavioural response is not the best option.",

    "abstract": "Two proteases produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Mpro and PLpro, are essential for viral replication and have become the focus of drug development programs for treatment of COVID-19. We screened a highly focused library of compounds containing covalent warheads designed to target cysteine proteases to identify new lead scaffolds for both Mpro and PLpro proteases. These efforts identified a small number of hits for the Mpro protease and no viable hits for the PLpro protease. Of the Mpro hits identified as inhibitors of the purified recombinant protease, only two compounds inhibited viral infectivity in cellular infection assays. However, we observed a substantial drop in antiviral potency upon expression of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease that acts in an alternative viral entry pathway to the lysosomal cathepsins. This loss of potency is explained by the fact that our lead Mpro inhibitors are also potent inhibitors of host cell cysteine cathepsins. To determine if this is a general property of Mpro inhibitors, we evaluated several recently reported compounds and found that they are also effective inhibitors of purified human cathepsin L and B and showed similar loss in activity in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Our results highlight the challenges of targeting Mpro and PLpro proteases and demonstrate the need to carefully assess selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors to prevent clinical advancement of compounds that function through inhibition of a redundant viral entry pathway.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is the main catecholamine in the brain and the kidney, where it controls a number of physiological functions such as locomotion, cognition, emotion, endocrine regulation and renal function. As a membrane impermeant hormone and neurotransmitter, dopamine is thought to signal by binding and activating dopamine receptors, members of the G protein couple receptor (GPCR) family, only on the plasma membrane. Here, using novel nanobody-based biosensors, we demonstrate for the first time that the dopamine D1 receptor (D1DR), the primary mediator of dopaminergic signaling in the brain and kidney, not only functions on the plasma membrane but becomes activated at the Golgi apparatus in the presence of its ligand. We present evidence that activation of the Golgi pool of D1DR is dependent on Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2), a dopamine transporter, providing an explanation for how the membrane impermeant dopamine accesses subcellular pools of D1DR. We further demonstrate that dopamine activates Golgi-D1DR in the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) and this activity depends on OCT2 function. We also introduce a new approach to selectively interrogate compartmentalized D1DR signaling by inhibiting Gs coupling, using a nanobody-based chemical recruitment system. Using this strategy, we show that Golgi-localized D1DRs regulate cAMP production and mediate local protein kinase A activation. Together, our data suggest that spatially compartmentalized signaling hubs are previously unappreciated regulatory aspects of D1DR signaling. Our data also provide further evidence for the role of transporters in regulating subcellular GPCR activity.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous population of multipotent progenitors that contribute to tissue regeneration and homeostasis. MSCs assess extracellular elasticity by probing resistance to applied forces via adhesion, cytoskeletal, and nuclear mechanotransducers, that direct differentiation toward soft or stiff tissue lineages. Even under controlled conditions, MSC differentiation exhibits substantial cell-to-cell variation that remains poorly characterized. By single-cell transcriptional profiling of naive, matrix-conditioned, and early differentiation state cells, we identified distinct MSC subpopulations with distinct mechanosensitivities, differentiation capacities, and cell cycling. We showed that soft matrices support adipogenesis of multipotent cells and endochondral ossification of non-adipogenic cells, whereas intramembranous ossification and pre-osteoblast proliferation are enhanced by stiff matrices. Using diffusion pseudotime mapping, we delineated hierarchical matrix-directed differentiation and identified mechanoresponsive genes. We found that tropomyosin-1 (TPM1) is highly sensitive to stiffness cues both at RNA and protein levels and that changes in expression of TPM1 determine adipogenic or osteogenic fates. Thus, cell-to-cell variation in tropomyosin-mediated matrix-sensing contributes to impaired differentiation with implications to the biomedical potential of MSCs.",

    "abstract": "The utility of a universal DNA  barcode fragment of 658 base pairs of the Cytochrome C Oxidase I (COI) gene for the recognition of all animal species has been a widely debated topic on theoretical and practical levels. Regardless of its challenges, large amounts of COI sequence data have been produced in the last two decades. To optimally use the data towards reliable species identification will require further steps to validate the method and reference libraries. The fruit fly tribe Dacini holds about a thousand species, of which eighty are pests of economic concern, including some of the worlds foremost fruit and vegetable pests, and there are many morphologically cryptic species complexes in the tribe. Where previous studies showed limited success in using COI to identify Dacini, our results with a highly curated morphological dataset indicate high congruence between morphology and COI: 90% of the species in our 5,576 sequences, 262-species global dataset can be identified with COI alone based on a monophyly criterion. However, in some key pest species belonging to complexes that were previously thought diagnosable with COI, we found that expanded sampling and independent validation of identifications using genomic data revealed introgression of mitochondrial DNA. We find that the informative SNPs are uniformly distributed across the COI gene, and we provide recommendations for standardization. We conclude that reliable molecular identifications with COI require extensive species coverage, population sampling, and genomics-supported reference identifications before they can be validated as a \"diagnostic\" marker for specific groups.",

Specifically, we applied HPRep to H3K4me3 PLAC-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse brain tissues, as well as H3K27ac HiChIP data from human lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 and leukemia cell line K562, showing that HPRep can more clearly separate among pseudo-replicates, real replicates, and non-replicates. Furthermore, in an H3K4me3 PLAC-seq dataset consisting of 11 samples from four human brain cell types, HPRep demonstrates expected clustering of data which could not be achieved by existing methods developed for Hi-C data, highlighting the need of a reproducibility metric tailored to HiChIP and PLAC-seq data.",

As per the GISAID database, the genomics of SARS-CoV2 is extensively studied with more than 500 genome submissions per day. Out of several hotspot mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, researchers have focused a lot on missense variants but the least work is done on the UTRs. One of the most frequent 5 UTR variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the C241T with a global frequency of more than 0.9. In the present study, the effect of the C241T mutation has been studied with respect to change in RNA structure and its interaction with the host replication factors MADP1 Zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (hnRNP1). The results obtained from molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation indicated weaker interaction of C241T mutant stem loops with host transcription factor MADP1 indicating reduced replication efficiency. The results are also correlated with increased recovery rates and decreased death rates of global SARS-CoV-2 cases.",

Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoding missense substitutions within tryptic peptides exhibiting high allele frequencies in European, African, and East Asian populations, termed peptide ancestry informative markers (pAIMs), were prioritized from 1000 genomes. In silico analysis shows that as few as 20 pAIMs can determine ancestry proportions similarly to >260K SNPs (R2=0.9905). Multiplexed proteomic analysis of >100 human endometrial cancer cell lines and uterine leiomyoma tissues resulted in the quantitation of 62 pAIMs that correlate with self-described race and genotype-confirmed patient ancestry. Candidates include a D451E substitution in GC vitamin D-binding protein previously associated with altered vitamin D levels in African and European populations.

Here, we combined functional MRI with machine learning to identify and evaluate a sensitive and generalizable neural signature predictive of the momentary self-reported subjective fear experience across discovery (n=67), validation (n=20) and generalization (n=31) cohorts. We systematically demonstrate that accurate fear prediction crucially requires distributed brain systems, with important contributions from cortical (e.g., prefrontal, midcingulate and insular cortices) and subcortical (e.g., thalamus, periaqueductal gray, basal forebrain and amygdala) regions. We further demonstrate that the neural representation of subjective fear is distinguishable from the representation of conditioned threat and general negative affect. Overall, our findings suggest that subjective fear, which exhibits distinct neural representation with some other aversive states, is encoded in distributed systems rather than isolated  fear centers. This signature provides a neuromarker for monitoring fear-related neuropathology and evaluating novel treatments targeting pathological fear.",

Although liquid cultures are often the preferred cultivation method in microbiology, bacterial cells in biofilm adopt a profoundly different phenotype reflecting the close cell-to-cell contact compare to their planktonic counterparts. To investigate F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis interactions relevant in biofilm formation, we applied liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine the expressed proteome of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis cells that were grown either as biofilm or in planktonic culture, and individually or together.\n\nThe proteomic analyses detected 1,322 F. nucleatum and 966 P. gingivalis proteins. We statistically compared the proteins label-free quantitative (LFQ) intensities between biofilm and planktonic culture and identified significant changes (p-value [&le;]0.05) in 0,4% F. nucleatum proteins, 7% P. gingivalis proteins, and more than 14% of all proteins in the dual-species model. For both species, proteins involved in vitamin B2 (riboflavin) metabolic process had significantly increased levels in the biofilm condition. In both mono- and dual-species biofilm models, P. gingivalis increased the production of proteins functional in translation, oxidation-reduction, and amino acid metabolism, when compared to planktonic cultures. However, when we compared LFQ intensities between mono- and dual-species models, over 90% of the significantly changed P. gingivalis proteins had their levels reduced in biofilm and planktonic settings of the dual-species model.\n\nOur findings suggest that the two bacteria interact with each other at the protein level and indicate that P. gingivalis reduces the production of multiple proteins because of more favourable growth conditions provided by F. nucleatum presence.

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the severity of diabetic retinopathy and various factors including bilirubin levels and factors influencing bilirubin metabolism.\n\nMethodsThe study participants consisted of 94 consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus admitted to Kyushu University Hospital from April 2011 to July 2012. The patients were classified into three groups: no retinopathy (NDR), simple retinopathy (SDR), and pre-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy (PDR). The relationship between the severity of retinopathy and various factors was evaluated using univariate and logistic regression analyses. In addition, multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the significant determinants for bilirubin levels.\n\nResultsIn univariate analysis, a significant difference was found among NDR, SDR and PDR in bilirubin levels, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and macroalbuminuria. Logistic regression analysis showed that PDR was significantly associated with bilirubin levels, duration of diabetes, and systolic blood pressure (OR 0.737, 95% CI 0.570-0.952, P=0.012; OR 1.085, 95% CI 1.024-1.149, P=0.006; OR 1.036, 95% CI 1.011-1.062, P=0.005, respectively). In turn, multivariate regression analysis showed that bilirubin levels were negatively associated with high-sensitivity Creactive protein levels and PDR, but positively correlated with urinary biopyrrin levels, oxidized metabolites of bilirubin.\n\nConclusionsPDR was negatively associated with bilirubin levels. This negative association may be due to a decreased production of bilirubin rather than its increased consumption considering the positive association between bilirubin and biopyrrin levels.",

    "abstract": "Constipation, a common health problem, causes discomfort and affects quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of probiotics on loperamide (LP)-induced constipation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, a well-established animal model of spastic constipation. In total, 100 male SD rats (age, 8 weeks; Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan) were used in the experiments following a 12-day acclimatisation period. They were randomly divided into two treatment groups (groups 1 and 2) of 50 rats each. Spastic constipation was induced via oral administration of LP (3 mg/kg) for 6 days 1 hour before the administration of each test compound. Similarly, a probiotics solution (4 ml/kg body weight) was orally administered to the rats once a day for 6 days in group 2. In group 1, phosphate buffer solution was orally administered once a day for 6 days 1 hour after each LP administration. The changes in body weight, faecal parameters, short-chain fatty acid concentration in faeces, and faecal immunoglobulin (Ig)-A concentration were recorded. In the present study, the oral administration of probiotics improved faecal parameters, short-chain fatty acid concentration in faeces, and faecal IgA concentration. Our results indicate that probiotics increase the levels of intestinal short-chain fatty acids, especially butyric acid, thereby improving constipation and intestinal immunity.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton release massive amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the water column during recurring blooms in coastal waters and inland seas. The released DOM encompasses a complex mixture of both known and unknown compounds, and is a rich nutrient source for heterotrophic bacteria. The metabolic activity of bacteria during and after phytoplankton blooms can hence be expected to reflect the characteristics of the released DOM. We therefore investigated if bacterioplankton could be used as \"living sensors\" of phytoplankton DOM quantity and/or quality, by applying gene expression analyses to identify bacterial metabolisms induced by DOM. We used transcriptional analysis of two Baltic Sea bacterial isolates (Polaribacter sp. BAL334 [Flavobacteriia] and Brevundimonas sp. BAL450 [Alphaproteobacteria]) growing with DOM from axenic cultures of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum. We observed pronounced differences between the two bacteria both in bacterial growth and the expressed metabolic pathways in cultures exposed to dinoflagellate DOM compared with controls. Differences in metabolic responses between the two isolates were caused both by differences in gene repertoire between them (e.g. in the SEED categories for membrane transport, motility and photoheterotrophy) and the regulation of expression (e.g. fatty acid metabolism), emphasizing the importance of separating the responses of different taxa in analyses of community sequence data. Similarities between the bacteria included substantially increased expression of genes for Ton and Tol transport systems in both isolates, which are commonly associated with uptake of complex organic molecules. Polaribacter sp. BAL334 showed stronger metabolic responses to DOM harvested from exponential than stationary phase dinoflagellates (128 compared to 26 differentially expressed genes), whereas Brevundimonas sp. BAL450 responded more to the DOM from stationary than exponential phase dinoflagellates (33 compared to 6 differentially expressed genes). These findings suggest that shifts in bacterial metabolisms during different phases of phytoplankton blooms can be detected in individual bacterial species and can provide insights into their involvement in DOM transformations.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia is a pollutant frequently found in aquatic ecosystems. In fish, ammonia can cause physical damage, alter its behaviour and even cause death. Exposure to ammonia also increases fish physiological stress, which can be measured through biomarkers. In this study, we analysed the effect of sublethal ammonia concentrations on the behaviour and the oxidative stress of Barbus meridionalis that had been pre-exposed to this compound in the wild. Wild-caught fish from a polluted site (pre-exposed fish) and from an unpolluted site (non-pre-exposed fish) were exposed, under experimental conditions, to total ammonia concentrations (TAN) of 0, 1, 5 and 8 mg/L. Swimming activity, feeding behaviour and oxidative stress response based on biomarkers were analysed. Pre-exposed fish showed both an altered behaviour and an altered oxidative stress response in the control treatment (0 mg/L). Differences in swimming activity were also found as pre-exposed fish swam less. Lower feeding activity (voracity and satiety) and altered response to oxidative stress were also observed at [&ge;] 1 mg/L TAN. Biomarker results confirmed pre-exposed fish suffer from a reduction in their antioxidant defences and, hence, showed increased oxidative tissue damage. In summary, pre-exposed fish showed more sensitivity to ammonia exposure than fish from a pristine site.",
