    "abstract": "Parallel adaptation provides valuable insight into the predictability of evolutionary change through replicated natural experiments. A steadily increasing number of studies have demonstrated genomic parallelism, yet the magnitude of this parallelism varies depending on whether populations, species or genera are compared. This led us to hypothesize that the magnitude of genomic parallelism scales with genetic divergence between lineages, but whether this is the case and the underlying evolutionary processes remain unknown. Here, we resequenced seven parallel lineages of two Arabidopsis species which repeatedly adapted to challenging alpine environments. By combining genome-wide divergence scans with model-based approaches we detected a suite of 151 genes that show parallel signatures of positive selection associated with alpine colonization, involved in response to cold, high radiation, short season, herbivores and pathogens. We complemented these parallel candidates with published gene lists from five additional alpine Brassicaceae and tested our hypothesis on a broad scale spanning ~ 0.02 to 18 million years of divergence. Indeed, we found quantitatively variable genomic parallelism whose extent significantly decreased with increasing divergence between the compared lineages. We further modeled parallel evolution over the Arabidopsis candidate genes and showed that a decreasing probability of repeated selection of the same standing or introgressed alleles drives the observed pattern of divergence-dependent parallelism. We therefore conclude that genetic divergence between populations, species and genera, affecting the pool of shared variants, is an important factor in the predictability of genome evolution.\n\nSignificance statementRepeated evolution tends to be more predictable. The impressive spectrum of recent reports on genomic parallelism, however, revealed that the fraction of the genome that evolves in parallel largely varies, possibly reflecting different evolutionary scales investigated. Here, we demonstrate divergence-dependent parallelism using a comprehensive genome-wide dataset comprising 12 cases of parallel alpine adaptation and identify decreasing probability of adaptive re-use of genetic variation as the major underlying cause. This finding empirically demonstrates that evolutionary predictability is scale dependent and suggests that availability of pre-existing variation drives parallelism within and among populations and species. Altogether, our results inform the ongoing discussion about the (un)predictability of evolution, relevant for applications in pest control, nature conservation, or the evolution of pathogen resistance.",

    "abstract": "The recurrent and recent global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has turned into a global concern which has infected more than 19-million people all over the globe, and this number is increasing in hours. Unfortunate no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which make it more deadly. A vaccine-informatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which showed non-toxic nature, non-allergenic, highly antigenic and non-mutated in other SARS-CoV-2 virus strains. The population coverage analysis has found that CD4+ T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over to CD8+ peptides in the 16 different geographical regions of the world. We identified twelve peptides (LTDEMIAQY, WTAGAAAYY, WMESEFRVY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQI, YGFQPTNGVGYQ, LPDPSKPSKR, QTQTNSPRRARS and VITPGTNTSN) that are 80% - 90% identical with experimentally determined epitopes of SARS-CoV, and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design. Moreover, docking analysis suggested that identified peptides are tightly bound in the groove of HLA molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall this study allows us to determine potent peptide antigen targets in surface glycoprotein on intuitive grounds which open up a new horizon in COVID-19 research. However, this study needs experimental validation by in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLoss in intraspecific diversity can alter ecosystem functions, but the underlying mechanisms are still elusive, and intraspecific biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships (iBEF) have been restrained to primary producers. Here, we manipulated genetic and functional richness of a fish consumer (Phoxinus phoxinus), to test whether iBEF relationships exist in consumer species, and whether they are more likely sustained by genetic or functional richness. We found that both genotypic and functional richness affected ecosystem functioning, either independently or in interaction. Loss in genotypic richness reduced benthic invertebrate diversity consistently across functional richness treatments, whereas it reduced zooplankton diversity only when functional richness was high. Finally, both losses in genotypic and functional richness altered essential functions (e.g. decomposition) through trophic cascades. We concluded that iBEF relationships lead to substantial top-down effects on entire food chains. The loss of genotypic richness impacted ecological properties as much as the loss of functional richness, probably because it sustains \"cryptic\" functional diversity.",

    "abstract": "With more than 51 million cases and 1.3 million deaths, and with the resulting social upheaval, the COVID-19 pandemic presents one of the greatest challenges ever to human society. It is thus vital to fully understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, we now demonstrate that following engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system, and importantly clathrin-heavy chain knockdown, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. This discovery reveals important new information about the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of synaptic changes resulting from long-term potentiation (LTP) is essential for brain function such as memory and learning. Different LTP phases have been associated with diverse molecular processes and pathways, and the molecular underpinnings of LTP on the short, as well as long time scales, are well established. However, the principles on the intermediate time scale of 1-6 hours that mediate the early phase of LTP (E-LTP) remain elusive. We hypothesize that the interplay between specific features of postsynaptic receptor trafficking is responsible for sustaining synaptic changes during this LTP phase. We test this hypothesis by formalizing a biophysical model that integrates several experimentally-motivated mechanisms. The model captures a wide range of experimental findings and predicts that synaptic changes are preserved for hours when the receptor dynamics are shaped by the interplay of structural changes of the spine in conjunction with increased trafficking from recycling endosomes and the cooperative binding of receptors. Furthermore, our model provides several predictions to verify our findings experimentally.\n\nAuthor summaryThe cognitive ability of learning is associated with plasticity-induced changes in synaptic transmission efficacy mediated by AMPA receptors. Synaptic changes depend on a multitude of molecular and physiological mechanisms, building complex interaction networks. By formalizing and employing a biophysical model of AMPAR trafficking, we unravel and evaluate the interplay between key mechanisms such as receptor binding, exocytosis, morphological changes, and cooperative receptor binding. Our findings indicate that cooperative receptor binding in conjunction with morphological changes of the spine and increased trafficking from recycling endosomes leads to the maintenance of synaptic changes on behaviorally relevant time spans. Characterizing the principles underlying synaptic changes will provide insight into the role of synaptic dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Mass spectroscopy (MS) and structural bioinformatics (SB) approaches have become feasible to identify subcomplexes involved in assembly and disassembly, while they cannot provide atomic information sufficient for free energy calculation to characterize transition mechanism between two different sets of subcomplexes. To combine observations derived from MS and SB approaches with conventional free energy calculation protocols, we here designed a new reaction pathway sampling method with employing hybrid configuration bias Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (hcbMC/MD) scheme and applied it to simulate disassembly process of serum amyloid P component (SAP) pentamer. The results we obtained are consistent with those of the earlier MS and SB studies with respect to SAP subcomplex species and the initial stage of SAP disassembly processes. Furthermore, we observed a novel dissociation event, ring-opening reaction of SAP pentamer. Employing free energy calculation combined with the hcbMC/MD reaction pathway trajectories, we moreover obtained experimentally testable observations on (1) reaction time of the ring-opening reaction and (2) importance of Asp42 and Lys117 for stable formation of SAP oligomer.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is paramount to control the COVID- 19 pandemic. We analyzed more than 300,000 high quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) associated region of the nucleocapsid protein are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals four distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region- specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March-July, during a period of stasis in terms of inter- regional diversity. Finally, beginning July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.\n\nSignificanceUnderstanding the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to control and ultimately end the pandemic. We analyzed more than 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of January 2021 and demonstrate adaptive evolution of the virus that affects, primarily, multiple sites in the spike and nucleocapsid protein. Selection appears to act on combinations of mutations in these and other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Evolution of the virus is accompanied by ongoing adaptive diversification within and between geographic regions. This diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required.",

    "abstract": "Environmental conditions affect virus inactivation rate and transmission potential. Understanding those effects is critical for anticipating and mitigating epidemic spread. Ambient temperature and humidity strongly affect the inactivation rate of enveloped viruses, but a mechanistic, quantitative theory of those effects has been elusive. We measure the stability of the enveloped respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life is over 24 hours at 10 {degrees}C and 40 % RH, but approximately 1.5 hours at 27 {degrees}C and 65 % RH. Our mechanistic model uses simple chemistry to explain the increase in virus inactivation rate with increased temperature and the U-shaped dependence of inactivation rate on relative humidity. The model accurately predicts quantitative measurements from existing studies of five different human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that shared mechanisms may determine environmental stability for many enveloped viruses. Our results indicate scenarios of particular transmission risk, point to pandemic mitigation strategies, and open new frontiers in the mechanistic study of virus transmission.",

Unlike common temporary transcriptional regulation methods such as the use of inducible promoters, integrases permanently edit DNA sequences.

Here we propose to improve the regulation of site-specific integrase-based genetic system by dynamically hiding one of the attB/P sites that are essential for recombination with transcriptional factors. After effectively suppressing excessive recombination, we also validated the necessity of each of the essential components in our transcriptional factor-controlled recombination (TFCR) system. The system applied transcriptional-level regulators directly on controlling the activity of existing non-transcriptional-level trans-factor proteins by inhibiting its binding to the cis-regulatory elements. We anticipate my results to provide greater robustness for integrase components to enable safer use in systems as well as be a starting point for future cross-expression level gene regulations.",

However, minority populations and ethnic groups, including Vietnamese, are still under-represented in existing genetic studies. Here we reported the first comprehensive study of recessive diseases in the Vietnamese population.\n\nMethodsClinical exome sequencing (CES) data of 4,503 disease-associated genes obtained from a cohort of 985 Vietnamese individuals was analyzed to identify pathogenic variants, associated diseases and their carrier frequencies in the population.\n\nResultsEighty-five recessive diseases were identified in the Vietnamese population, among which seventeen diseases had carrier frequencies of at least 1% (1 in 100 individuals). Three diseases were especially prevalent in the Vietnamese population with carrier frequencies of 2-12 times higher than in other East Asia or the world populations, including Beta-thalassemia (1 in 25), citrin deficiency (1 in 33) and phenylketonuria (1 in 40). Seven novel pathogenic and three likely pathogenic variants associated with nine recessive diseases were also discovered.\n\nConclusionsThe comprehensive profile of recessive diseases identified in this study shall enable the design of cost-effective carrier screening programs specific to the Vietnamese population. The newly discovered pathogenic variants may also exist in other populations at extremely low frequencies, thus representing a valuable resource for future research. Our study has demonstrated the advantage of population-specific genetic studies to advance the knowledge and practice of medical genetics.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is a critical shortage of proven treatment options and an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of multi-organ failure and lung damage. Cytokine storm is associated with severe inflammation and organ damage during COVID-19. However, a detailed molecular pathway defining this cytokine storm is lacking, and gaining mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 elicits a hyperactive inflammatory response is critical to develop effective therapeutics. Of the multiple inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that the combined production of TNF- and IFN-{gamma} specifically induced inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, characterized by gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis, caspase-8-mediated apoptosis, and MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Deletion of pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis mediators individually was not sufficient to protect against cell death. However, cells deficient in both RIPK3 and caspase-8 or RIPK3 and FADD were resistant to this cell death. Mechanistically, the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis activated by TNF- and IFN-{gamma} co-treatment induced iNOS for the production of nitric oxide. Pharmacological and genetic deletion of this pathway inhibited pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of PANoptosis protected mice from TNF- and IFN-{gamma}-induced lethal cytokine shock that mirrors the pathological symptoms of COVID-19. In vivo neutralization of both TNF- and IFN-{gamma} in multiple disease models associated with cytokine storm showed that this treatment provided substantial protection against not only SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock models, demonstrating the broad physiological relevance of this mechanism. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other cytokine storm-driven syndromes by limiting inflammation and tissue damage. The findings also provide a molecular and mechanistic description for the term cytokine storm. Additionally, these results open new avenues for the treatment of other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases and cancers where TNF- and IFN-{gamma} synergism play key pathological roles.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine induced trained immunity protects against non-specific infections. Multiple clinical trials are currently underway to assess effectiveness of the vaccine in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the durability and mechanism of BCG trained immunity remain unclear. Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections, and transcriptomic alterations reported in COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very long-lasting transcriptomic changes that, unsurprisingly, mimic viral infections by upregulated antiviral defense response, and, counterintuitively. oppose viral infections by downregulated myeloid cell activation. These durability and mechanistic insights have immediate implications in fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus suis is a common pathogen colonising the respiratory tract of pigs. It can cause meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia leading to economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its metabolites play an important regulatory role in different biological processes like modulation of inflammation and immune activation. In this report we analysed the induction of COX-2 and the production of its metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a porcine precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) model. Using Western blot analysis, we found a time-dependent induction of COX-2 in the infected tissue resulting in increased PGE2 levels. Immunohistological analysis revealed a strong COX-2 expression in the proximity of the bronchioles between the ciliated epithelial cells and the adjacent alveolar tissue. The morphology, location and vimentin staining suggested that these cells are subepithelial bronchial fibroblasts. Furthermore, we showed that COX-2 expression as well as PGE2 production was detected following infection with two prevalent S. suis serotypes and that the pore-forming toxin suilysin played an important role in this process. Therefore, this study provides new insights in the response of porcine lung cells to S. suis infections and serves as a basis for further studies to define the role of COX-2 and its metabolites in the inflammatory response in porcine lung tissue during infection with S. suis.",

Hippocampal segmentation with newer and advanced 7 Tesla (7T) MRI protocols has revealed atrophy in specific subregions in other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, however, there is limited evidence of hippocampal involvement in SCD. Thus, we explored whether SCD may be also associated with abnormalities in hippocampal subregions. We conducted 7T MRI imaging in individuals with SCD, including the HbSS, HbSC and HbS/beta thalassemia genotypes (n=37), and healthy race and age-matched controls (n=40), using a customized head coil. Both T1 and T2 weighted images were used for automatic segmentation of the hippocampus subfields. Individuals with SCD had significantly smaller volume of the Dentate Gyrus and Cornu Ammonis (CA) 2 and 3 as compared to the control group. Other hippocampal subregions also showed a trend towards smaller volumes in the SCD group. These findings support previous reports of reduced volume in the temporal lobe in SCD patients. Further studies are necessary to investigate the mechanisms that lead to structural changes in the hippocampus subfields and their relationship with cognitive performance in SCD patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacterial genomes follow a U-shaped frequency distribution whereby most genomic loci are either rare (accessory) or common (core); the union of these is the pan-genome. The alignable fraction of two genomes from a single species can be low (e.g. 50-70%), such that no single reference genome can access all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The pragmatic solution is to choose a close reference, and analyse SNPs only in the core genome. Given much bacterial adaptability hinges on the accessory genome, this is an unsatisfactory limitation.\n\nResultsWe present a novel pan-genome graph structure and algorithms implemented in the software pandora, which approximates a sequenced genome as a recombinant of reference genomes, detects novel variation and then pan-genotypes multiple samples. The method takes fastq as input and outputs a multi-sample VCF with respect to an inferred data-dependent reference genome, and is available at https://github.com/rmcolq/pandora.\n\nConstructing a reference graph from 578 E. coli genomes, we analyse a diverse set of 20 E. coli isolates. We show pandora recovers at least 13k more rare SNPs than single-reference based tools, achieves equal or better error rates with Nanopore as with Illumina data, 6-24x lower Nanopore error rates than other tools, and provides a stable framework for analysing diverse samples without reference bias. We also show that our inferred recombinant VCF reference genome is significantly better than simply picking the closest RefSeq reference.\n\nConclusionsThis is a step towards comprehensive cohort analysis of bacterial pan-genomic variation, with potential impacts on genotype/phenotype and epidemiological studies.",

    "abstract": "Arf-family small GTPases are essential protein components for membrane trafficking in all eukaryotic endomembrane systems, particularly during the formation of membrane-bound, coat protein complex-coated transport carriers. In addition to their roles in the transport carrier formation, a number of Arf-family GTPases have been reported to physically associate with coiled-coil tethering proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes, which are responsible for membrane tethering, a process of the initial contact between transport carriers and their target subcellular compartments. Nevertheless, whether and how indeed Arf GTPases are involved in the tethering process remain unclear. Here, using a chemically-defined reconstitution approach with purified proteins of two representative Arf isoforms in humans (Arf1, Arf6) and synthetic liposomes for model membranes, we discovered that Arf6 can function as a bona fide membrane tether, directly and physically linking two distinct lipid bilayers even in the absence of any other tethering factors, whereas Arf1 retained little potency to trigger membrane tethering under the current experimental conditions. Arf6-mediated membrane tethering reactions require trans-assembly of membrane-anchored Arf6 proteins and can be reversibly controlled by the membrane attachment and detachment cycle of Arf6. The intrinsic membrane tethering activity of Arf6 was further found to be significantly inhibited by the presence of membrane-anchored Arf1, suggesting that the tethering-competent Arf6-Arf6 assembly in trans can be prevented by the heterotypic Arf1-Arf6 association in a cis configuration. Taken together, these findings lead us to postulate that self-assemblies of Arf-family small GTPases on lipid bilayers contribute to driving and regulating the tethering events of intracellular membrane trafficking.",

    "abstract": "N-acetyl-DL-leucine is an analogue of the alpha amino acid leucine with a chiral stereocenter. The active L-enantiomer of the racemate is currently under development for rare neurological disorders. Here we present evidence that a selective recognition of N-acetyl-L-leucine versus L-leucine by different uptake transporters significantly contributes to the therapeutic effects of N-acetyl-L-leucine. A previous study of the pharmacokinetics of racemic N-acetyl-DL-leucine and N-acetyl-L-leucine revealed D-L enantiomer competition and saturation kinetics, best explained by carrier-mediated uptake. The strategy we used was to first analyze the physicochemical properties associated with good oral bioavailable drugs and how these are alerted by N-acetylation by comparing N-acetyl-L-leucine with L-leucine. Using in silico computational chemistry we found that N-acetylation has a profound impact on certain physicochemical properties that can rationalize why N-acetyl-L-leucine is drug-like compared to L-leucine. Our calculations show that at physiological pH, L-leucine is a zwitterion, whereas N-acetyl-L-leucine is present as mainly an anion. Specifically, N-acetylation removes a charge from the nitrogen at physiological pH and N-acetyl-L-leucine is an anion that is then a substrate for the organic anion transporters. We examined N-acetyl-L-leucine uptake in human embryonic kidney cells overexpression candidate organic anion transporters (OAT) and pharmacological inhibitors. We found that N-acetyl-L-leucine is a translocated substrate for OAT1 and OAT3 with low affinity (Km ~10 mM). In contrast, L-leucine is known to be transported by the L-type Amino Acid Transporter (LAT) with high affinity (Km ~0.2 mM) and low capacity. The clinical consequence is that L-leucine uptake becomes saturated at 50-fold lower concentration than N-acetyl-L-leucine. These results demonstrate a mechanism of action that explains why N-acetyl-L-leucine is effective as a drug and L-leucine itself is not.",

    "abstract": "Myriad biological functions require protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and engineered PPIs are crucial for applications ranging from drug design to synthetic cell circuits. Understanding and engineering specificity in PPIs is particularly challenging as subtle sequence changes can drastically alter specificity. Coiled-coils are small protein domains that have long served as a simple model for studying the sequence-determinants of specificity and have been used as modular building blocks to build large protein nanostructures and synthetic circuits. Despite their simple rules and long-time use, building large sets of well-behaved orthogonal pairs that can be used together is still challenging because predictions are often inaccurate, and, as the library size increases, it becomes difficult to test predictions at scale. To address these problems, we first developed a method called the Next-Generation Bacterial Two-Hybrid (NGB2H), which combines gene synthesis, a bacterial two-hybrid assay, and a high-throughput next-generation sequencing readout, allowing rapid exploration of interactions of programmed protein libraries in a quantitative and scalable way. After validating the NGB2H system on previously characterized libraries, we designed, built, and tested large sets of orthogonal synthetic coiled-coils. In an iterative set of experiments, we assayed more than 8,000 PPIs, used the dataset to train a novel linear model-based coiled-coil scoring algorithm, and then characterized nearly 18,000 interactions to identify the largest set of orthogonal PPIs to date with twenty-two on-target interactions.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of spermatozoa morphology is fundamental to understand male fertility and the aetiology of infertility. Traditionally scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used to define surface topology. Recently, however, it has become a critical tool for three-dimensionally analyse of internal cellular ultrastructure. Modern SEM provides nanometer-scale resolution, but the meaningfulness of such information is proportional to the quality of the sample preservation. In this study, we demonstrate that sperm quickly and robustly adhere to gold-coated surfaces. Leveraging this property, we developed three step-by-step protocols fulfilling different needs for sperm imaging: chemically fixed monolayers for SEM examination of the external morphology, and two high-pressure freezing-based protocols for fast SEM examination of full cell internal morphology and focused ion-beam SEM (FIB-SEM) tomography. These analyses allow previously unappreciated insights into mouse sperm ultrastructure, including the identification of novel structures within the fibrous sheath and domain-specific interactions between the plasma membrane and exosome-like structures.",

    "abstract": "SummaryLineage transformation between lung cancer subtypes is a poorly understood phenomenon associated with resistance to treatment and poor patient outcomes. Here, we aimed to model this transition to define underlying biological mechanisms and identify potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is neuroendocrine in origin and, in contrast to non-SCLC (NSCLC), rarely contains mutations that drive the MAPK pathway. Likewise, NSCLCs that transform to SCLC concomitantly with development of therapy resistance downregulate MAPK signaling, suggesting an inverse relationship between pathway activation and lineage state. To test this, we activated MAPK in SCLC through conditional expression of mutant KRAS or EGFR, which revealed suppression of the neuroendocrine differentiation program via ERK. We found that ERK induces the expression of ETS factors that mediate transformation into a NSCLC-like state. ATAC-seq demonstrated ERK-driven changes in chromatin accessibility at putative regulatory regions and global chromatin rewiring at neuroendocrine and ETS transcriptional targets. Further, ERK-mediated induction of ETS factors as well as suppression of neuroendocrine differentiation were dependent on histone acetyltransferase activities of CBP/p300. Overall, we describe how the ERK-CBP/p300-ETS axis promotes a lineage shift between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine lung cancer phenotypes and provide rationale for the disruption of this program during transformation-driven resistance to targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Numerous synthetic and naturally-occurring biomaterials have been developed to provide such architectures to support the proliferation of mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. Our group, and others, have shown that scaffolds derived from plants can be utilized for tissue engineering applications in biomedicine and in the burgeoning cultured meat industry. Such scaffolds are ideally straightforward and inexpensive to prepare, allowing researchers to take advantage of their intrinsic 3D microarchitectures. These efforts inspired us to continue to pursue the development of novel and unconventional biomaterials that are easily produced and high performing in vitro. With this in mind, few plant-derived materials are more ubiquitous than bread. Having observed the porosity of the crumb (i.e. the internal bulk) we sought to investigate whether it might support the proliferation of mammalian cells in vitro. Here, we develop and validate a yeast-free \"soda bread\" that maintains its mechanical stability over several weeks in culture conditions. Importantly, we also demonstrate that control over the mechanical stability of the scaffold can also be achieved with both chemical and enzymatic means. The scaffolding is a heterogeneous and complex structure of isolated and interconnected pores which allow for the proliferation of multiple cell types. We demonstrate here that mouse fibroblasts, myoblasts and pre-osteoblasts are able to proliferate up to four weeks in culture. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that the fibroblasts are able to deposit their own fibronectin extracellular matrix and that mouse myoblasts are able to differentiate and fuse into myotubes. Although the pre-osteoblasts proliferated over the course of four weeks their ability to differentiate was inconclusive. Metabolic analyses of proliferation, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress reveal that cells remain highly viable and functional on these novel bread scaffolds. While the results presented in this proof-of-concept study create many new questions and opportunities, the results open up novel possibilities in the development of edible scaffolds that may be utilized in future food applications. Bread derived scaffolds represent a surprising alternative to synthetic or animal-derived scaffolds for addressing a diverse variety of tissue engineering challenges in food science. Future studies will delve deeper into investigating these how possibilities might take advantage of the immense breadth of knowledge about bread making and examine their applicability in the development of lab grown foods and broader applications in cellular agriculture.",

Antivirals against coronaviruses do not exist, hence global drug re-purposing efforts have been carried out to identify agents that may provide clinical benefit to patients with COVID-19. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been reported to have potential activity against animal coronaviruses.\n\nMethodsUsing cell-based phenotypic assays, the in vitro antiviral activity of itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole was assessed against clinical isolates from a German and Belgian patient infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsItraconazole demonstrated antiviral activity in human Caco-2 cells (EC50 = 2.3 M; MTT assay). Similarly, its primary metabolite, 17-OH itraconazole, showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 = 3.6 M). Remdesivir inhibited viral replication with an EC50 = 0.4 M. Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole resulted in a viral yield reduction in vitro of approximately 2-log10 and approximately 1-log10, as measured in both Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells, respectively.

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein mediates attachment and entry into host cells and is a major target of vaccine and drug design. Potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies derived from closely related antibody heavy chain genes (IGHV3-53 or 3-66) have been isolated from multiple COVID-19 convalescent individuals. These usually contain minimal somatic mutations and bind the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) to interfere with attachment to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used antigen-specific single B cell sorting to isolate S-reactive monoclonal antibodies from the blood of a COVID-19 convalescent individual. The seven most potent neutralizing antibodies were somatic variants of the same IGHV3-53-derived antibody and bind the RBD with varying affinity. We report X-ray crystal structures of four Fab variants bound to the RBD and use the structures to explain the basis for changes in RBD affinity. We show that a germline revertant antibody binds tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizes virus, and that gains in affinity for the RBD do not necessarily correlate with increased neutralization potency, suggesting that somatic mutation is not required to exert robust antiviral effect. Our studies clarify the molecular basis for a heavily germline-biased human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a serious threat to global public health. Development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity of a remdesivir parent nucleotide analog, GS441524, which targets the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, and a feline coronavirus prodrug, GC376, which targets its main protease, using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse model. Our results showed that GS441524 effectively blocked the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse upper and lower respiratory tracts via combined intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) treatment. However, the ability of high-dose GC376 (i.m. or i.n. and i.m.) was weaker than GS441524. Notably, low-dose combined application of GS441524 with GC376 could effectively protect mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via i.n. or i.n. and i.m. treatment. Moreover, we found that the pharmacokinetic properties of GS441524 is better than GC376, and combined application of GC376 and GS441524 had a synergistic effect. Our findings support the further evaluation of the combined application of GC376 and GS441524 in future clinical studies.\n\nImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has seriously threatened global public health and economic development.

Our results showed that low-dose combined application of GC376 and GS441524 could effectively protect mice from HRB26M infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.

    "abstract": "Chromatin spatial organization (interactome) plays a critical role in genome function. Deep understanding of chromatin interactome can shed insights into transcriptional regulation mechanisms and human disease pathology. One essential task in the analysis of chromatin interactomic data is to identify long-range chromatin interactions. Existing approaches, such as HiCCUPS, FitHiC/FitHiC2 and FastHiC, are all designed for analyzing individual cell types or samples. None of them accounts for unbalanced sequencing depths and heterogeneity among multiple cell types or samples in a unified statistical framework. To fill in the gap, we have developed a novel statistical framework MUNIn (Multiple sample UNifying long-range chromatin Interaction detector) for identifying long-range chromatin interactions from multiple samples. MUNIn adopts a hierarchical hidden Markov random field (H-HMRF) model, in which the status (peak or background) of each interacting chromatin loci pair depends not only on the status of loci pairs in its neighborhood region, but also on the status of the same loci pair in other samples. To benchmark the performance of MUNIn, we performed comprehensive simulation studies and real data analysis, and showed that MUNIn can achieve much lower false positive rates for detecting sample-specific interactions (33.1 - 36.2%), and much enhanced statistical power for detecting shared peaks (up to 74.3%), compared to uni-sample analysis. Our data demonstrated that MUNIn is a useful tool for the integrative analysis of interactomic data from multiple samples.",

In this study, we provided a comprehensive lifespan characterization of urine metabolomics in a cohort of 348 healthy children and 315 adults aged 1 to 70 years using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. Our results suggested that gender-dependent urine metabolites are much greater in adults than in children. The pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis and alanine metabolism pathways were enriched in early life. Androgen and estrogen metabolism showed high activity during adolescence and youth stages. Pyrimidine metabolism was enriched in the old stage. Based on the above analysis, metabolomic characteristics of each age stage were provided.

    "abstract": "In a recent paper in Nature Communications, Narayan et al 1 described the development of an in silico method to predict synergy of drug combinations, validated in vivo using 5 different models for 5 different drug pairs. The published analysis of the in vivo experimental data used the Chou and Talalay Combination Index, which ignores important aspects of the study design, including, but not limited to the variability between individual mice and the longitudinal nature of the data. Furthermore, the original publication reported the Combination Index as static numbers without properly accounting for experimental variability. When 95% confidence intervals are recalculated using bootstrapping methods, 4 out of 5 drug pairs do not show a statistically significant synergistic effect. Three models (originally figures 5A, B and E) are subject to severe inaccuracies in the data handling and reporting. In one model, (originally figure 5D), the data better supports an additive effect between drugs rather than synergy. As the Chou and Talalay Combination Index is poorly suited to this data, we applied mixed-effects models fitted to the longitudinal tumor growth data as an alternative means of estimating synergy. The results support the findings from the bootstrapping analysis, namely that the majority of the drug pairs do not achieve a synergistic effect. We conclude that the in vivo validation of the in silico method to predict synergy of drug combinations as proposed by Narayan et al has a negative outcome when analyzed with appropriate statistical methods.",

    "abstract": "Varroa destructor is an ectoparasitic mite causing devastating damages to honey bee colonies around the world. Its impact is considered a major factor contributing to the significant seasonal losses of colonies recorded every year. Beekeepers are usually relying on a reduced set of acaricides to manage the parasite, usually the pyrethroids tau-fluvalinate or flumethrin, the organophosphate coumaphos and the formamidine amitraz. However, the evolution of resistance in the populations is leading to an unsustainable scenario with almost no alternatives to reach an adequate control of the mite.\n\nHere we present the results from the first, large-scale and extensive monitoring of the susceptibility to acaricides in the Comunitat Valenciana, one of the most prominent apicultural regions in Spain. Our ultimate goal was to provide beekeepers with timely information to help them decide what would be the best alternative for a long-term control of the mites in their apiaries. Our data show that there is a significant variation in the expected efficacy of coumaphos and pyrethroids across the region, indicating the presence of a different ratio of resistant individuals to these acaricides in each population. On the other hand, the expected efficacy of amitraz was more consistent, although slightly below the expected efficacy according to the label.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIVarroa destructor is causing severe damages to honey bee colonies worldwide.\nC_LIO_LIThere are very few acaricides available to manage the parasite.\nC_LIO_LIThe evolution of resistance is limiting our capacity to control the mite.\nC_LIO_LIWe estimated the expected efficacy of the main acaricides in many Spanish apiaries.\nC_LIO_LIThe information was shared with beekeepers for them to decide the best treatment to control the mite.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDiarrhea is distinguished by prevalence of bowel movement accompanied by a loose consistency of stools, resulting from hyper peristalsis of the small intestine or colon, Diarrhea is a major challenge among infants and growing children. The study was carried out to assess the result of combined treatment of vitamin C and loperamide on intestinal Na+, K+ - ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipid peroxidation in castor oil induced diarrheal wistar rats.\n\nMethodA total of 18 wistar rats weighing 180-200g were randomly divided into 6 groups, (Group 1 Normal control no castor oil, no treatment administered, Group 2 Experimental control were given castor oil 3.0 ml/kg body weight with no treatment, Group 3 Standard control were given castor oil 3.0 ml/kg body weight + loperamide, Group 4 Treatment 1 were administered 3.0 ml/kg body weight + 25 mg/kg combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide, Group 5 Treatment 2 were administered 3.0 ml/kg body weight + 50 mg/kg combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide, and Group 6 were administered 3.0 ml/kg body weight + 100 mg/kg combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide) with 3 rats per group; the experiment lasted for 24 hours. The action of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, Na+, K+ - ATPase and malondialdehyde were determined.\n\nResultDescriptive statistical analysis was adopted using SPSS version 20. Combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide significantly (p<0.05) lowered the elevated levels of malondialdehyde caused by castor oil induced diarrhea; the Na+, K+ - ATPase intestinal activity treatment with both vitamin C and loperamide significantly elevated the activity of Na+, K+ ATPase when compared with the normal control, but both treatments (loperamide alone and vitamin C plus loperamide were not significantly different (p<0.05) to themselves. However, at 50 mg/kg body weight of combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide it showed significant difference in the action of intestinal alkaline phosphatase.\n\nConclusionFindings of this study therefore, indicate that a combined effect of loperamide and vitamin C will be an effective therapeutic agent in the management of diarrhea by scavenging of free radicals generated in the cause of diarrheal to reduce lipid peroxidation. Therefore, combined effect of vitamin C and loperamide should be encouraged in the management of diarrhea. Further research should be directed towards assessing the therapeutic action of vitamin C only in the management of diarrhea.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular sedimentation of highly dense, starch-filled amyloplasts toward the gravity vector is likely a key initial step for gravity sensing in plants. However, recent live-cell imaging technology revealed that most amyloplasts continuously exhibit dynamic, saltatory movements in the endodermal cells of Arabidopsis stems. These complicated movements led to questions about what type of amyloplast movement triggers gravity sensing. Here we show that a confocal microscope equipped with optical tweezers can be a powerful tool to trap and manipulate amyloplasts noninvasively, while simultaneously observing cellular responses such as vacuolar dynamics in living cells. A near-infrared ({lambda} = 1064 nm) laser that was focused into the endodermal cells at 1 mW of laser power attracted and captured amyloplasts at the laser focus. The optical force exerted on the amyloplasts was theoretically estimated to be up to 1 pN. Interestingly, endosomes and trans-Golgi networks were trapped at 30 mW but not at 1 mW, which is probably due to lower refractive indices of these organelles than that of the amyloplasts. Because amyloplasts are in close proximity to vacuolar membranes in endodermal cells, their physical interaction could be visualized in real time. The vacuolar membranes drastically stretched and deformed in response to the manipulated movements of amyloplasts by optical tweezers. Our new method provides deep insights into the biophysical properties of plant organelles in vivo and opens a new avenue for studying gravity-sensing mechanisms in plants.",

    "abstract": "Early life stress (ELS) is an important risk factor for the development of depression. Impairments in reward learning and feedback sensitivity are suggested to be an intermediate phenotype in depression aetiology therefore we hypothesised that similar impairments are present in healthy adults with a history of ELS. We recruited 64 adults with high levels of ELS and no diagnosis of a current mental health disorder and 65 controls. Participants completed the probabilistic reversal learning task and probabilistic reward task followed by depression, anhedonia, social status, and stress scales. Participants with high levels of ELS showed decreased positive feedback sensitivity in the probabilistic reversal learning task compared to controls. High ELS participants also trended towards possessing a decreased model-free learning rate. This was coupled with a decreased learning ability in the acquisition phase of block 1 following the practice session. Neither group showed a reward induced response bias in the probabilistic reward task however high ELS participants exhibited decreased stimuli discrimination. Due to the PRT not meeting its primary endpoint a separate cohort of control participants were tested in a modified PRT where they showed a response bias. This indicates the PRT can be successfully carried out online. Overall, these data suggest that healthy participants without a mental health diagnosis and high levels of ELS show deficits in positive feedback sensitivity and reward learning in the probabilistic reversal learning task that are distinct from depressed patients. These deficits may be relevant to increased depression vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Energy allocation in juvenile fish can have important implications for future life-history progression. Inherited and environmental factors determine when and where individuals allocate energy, and timely and sufficient energy reserves are crucial for reaching key life stages involved in the timing of maturation and sea migration. In Atlantic salmon, lipid reserves are predominantly found in the viscera and myosepta in the muscle and have been shown to play a key role in determining the timing of maturity. This life-history trait is tightly linked to fitness in many species and can be different between males and females, however, the details of relative energy allocation in juveniles of different sexes is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sex, genetics and environment during juvenile development of salmon on the amount and composition of their lipid reserves. To do so, juvenile salmon were fed one of two different lipid food contents during their first summer and autumn under common-garden conditions. Muscle lipid composition and concentrations were determined by thin layer chromatography. The muscle lipid class concentrations covaried negatively with body length and males showed higher concentrations than females for phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and triacylglycerol. This sex-specific difference in major lipid classes presents a new scope for understanding the regulation of lipids during juvenile development and gives direction for understanding how lipids may interact and influence major life-history traits in Atlantic salmon.",

    "abstract": "Steroidogenesis is strictly regulated at multiple levels, as produced steroid hormones are crucial to maintain physiological functions. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are key players in adrenal steroid hormone biosynthesis and function within short redox-chains in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. However, mechanisms regulating supply of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial CYP-dependent system are not fully understood. In the present work, we aimed to estimate how the specific steroids, substrates, intermediates and products of multistep reactions modulate protein-protein interactions between adrenodoxin (Adx) and mitochondrial CYP11s. Using the SPR technology we determined that steroid substrates affect affinity and stability of CYP11s - Adx complexes in an isoform-specific mode. In particular, cholesterol induces a 4-fold increase in the rate of CYP11A1 - Adx complex formation without significant effect on dissociation (koff decreased ~1.5-fold), overall increasing complex affinity. At the same time steroid substrates decrease the affinity of both CYP11B1 - Adx and CYP11B2 - Adx complexes, predominantly reducing their stability (4-7 fold). This finding reveals differentiation of protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial pool of CYPs, which have the same electron donor. The regulation of electron supply by the substrates might affect the overall steroid hormones production. Our experimental data provide further insight into protein-protein interactions within CYP-dependent redox chains involved in steroidogenesis.",

Participants underwent the training for up to 9 months or were assigned to a retest control cohort. Chronic stress indices were assayed at four timepoints, i.e., pre-training and following each module. The main outcome measures were cortisol and cortisone concentration in hair and self-reported chronic stress\n\nResultsN=362 initial individuals were randomized, of whom n=30 dropped out before study initiation, n=4 before first sampling and n=2 were excluded. N=99 participants did not provide hair samples. Data from three separate training cohorts revealed consistent decreases in hair cortisol and cortisone levels over the training period. This effect increased with practice frequency, was independent of training content and not associated with change in self-reported chronic stress.\n\nConclusionsOur results point to the reduction of long-term cortisol exposure as a mechanism via which contemplative mental training may exert positive effects on practitioners health.\n\nTrial registrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01833104",

    "abstract": "Here we employed scRNA-seq coupled with computational approaches to examine molecular changes in cells during specification and differentiation. We examined the first 24 hours of development of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus (Lv) with 18 time points during which the embryo develops to the larval stage. Using Waddington-OT, the time points were computationally \"stitched\" together to calculate developmental trajectories. Skeletogenic cells displayed the expected immediate early divergence while other lineages diverged asynchronously, with many cells retaining an intermediate specification status until late in gastrulation. The Lv-scRNA-seq dataset was compared to the developmental Gene Regulatory Network (dGRN) model of specification in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp). 79 of 80 genes (98%) in that dGRN are present in the Lv-scRNA-seq dataset, and expressed in the correct lineages in which the dGRN circuits operate. Surprisingly, however, many heterochronies in timing of first expression of dGRN genes have evolved between the two species. Replotting the two dGRNs with precise attention to time of expression revealed a number of feedback inputs that likely buffer the dGRNs, allowing them to maintain function in the face of accumulating heterochronies.\n\nSummary statementThe early development of the sea urchin embryo was followed using scRNA-seq plus computational methods to trace lineage diversifications.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMethylation of cytosines in DNA (5mC methylation) is a major epigenetic modification that modulates gene expression and is important for embryonic development and cell reprogramming in vertebrates. In mammals, 5mC methylation in promoter regions is linked to transcriptional repression. Transcription regulation by 5mC methylation notably involves the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase complex (NuRD complex) which bridges DNA methylation and histone modifications. Less is known about roles and mechanisms of 5mC methylation in non-vertebrate animals. In this paper, we study 5mC methylation in the marine annelid worm Platynereis dumerilii, an emerging evolutionary and developmental biology model capable of regenerating the posterior part of its body upon amputation. The regenerated region includes both differentiated structures and a growth zone consisting of stem cells required for the continuous growth of the worm.\n\nResultsUsing in silico and experimental approaches, we show that P. dumerilii displays a high level of DNA methylation comparable to that of mammalian somatic cells. 5mC methylation in P. dumerilii is dynamic along the life cycle of the animal and markedly decreases at the transition between larval to post-larval stages. We identify a full repertoire of mainly singlecopy genes encoding the machinery associated to 5mC methylation or members of the NuRD complex in P. dumerilii and show, through phylogenetic analyses, that this repertoire is close to the one inferred for the last common ancestor of bilaterians. These genes are dynamically expressed during P. dumerilii development, growth and regeneration. Treatment with the DNA hypomethylating agent Decitabine, impairs P. dumerilii larval development and regeneration, and has long-term effects on post-regenerative growth by affecting the functionality of stem cells of the growth zone.\n\nConclusionsOur data indicate high-level of 5mC methylation in the annelid P. dumerilii, highlighting that this feature is not specific to vertebrates in the bilaterian clade. Analysis of DNA methylation levels and machinery gene expression during development and regeneration, as well as the use of a chemical inhibitor of DNA methylation, suggest an involvement of 5mC methylation in P. dumerilii development, regeneration and stem cell-based post-regenerative growth. We also present data indicating that P. dumerilii constitutes a promising model to study biological roles and mechanisms of DNA methylation in non-vertebrate bilaterians and to provide new knowledge about evolution of the functions of this key epigenetic modification in bilaterian animals.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the emergence and spread of infectious diseases is critical for effective conservation of biodiversity. White-nose syndrome (WNS), an emerging infectious disease of bats, has resulted in high mortality in eastern North America. Because the fungal causative agent Pseudogymnoascus destructans is constrained by temperature and humidity, spread dynamics may vary greatly by geography. Environmental conditions in the southern part of the continent, where disease dynamics are typically studied, making it difficult to predict how the disease will manifest. Herein, we modeled the spread of WNS in Texas based on available cave densities and average dispersal distances of species occupying these sites, and projected these results out to 10 years. We parameterized a predictive model of WNS epidemiology and its effects on hibernatory bat populations with observed environmental data from bat hibernation sites in Texas. Our model suggests that bat populations in northern Texas will be more affected by WNS mortality than southern Texas. As such, we recommend prioritizing the preservation of large overwintering colonies of bats in north Texas through management actions. Our model further illustrates that infectious disease spread and infectious disease severity can become uncoupled over a gradient of environmental variation. Finally, our results highlight the importance of understanding host, pathogen and environmental conditions in various settings to elucidate what may happen across a breadth of environments.",

There is no evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), and the only Nash equilibrium (NE) is unstable: strategies similar to the NE can always invade. But in spite of this instability, the NE is predictive. If harvesting attempts are costly or there are many competitors, the process tends to remain near the unstable NE. In this case, the resource often goes unharvested. Harvesting attempts--when they happen at all--usually occur when the resource is barely ripe enough to offset costs. The more foragers there are, the lower the chance that the resource will be harvested and the greater its mean value when harvested. This counterintuitive behavior is exhibited not only by theoretical models and computer simulations, but also by human subjects in an experimental game.",

    "abstract": "The piRNA pathway is a genomic defense system that controls the movement of transposable elements (TEs) through transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing. While TE defense is critical to ensuring germline genome integrity, it is equally critical that the piRNA pathway avoids autoimmunity in the form of silencing host genes. Ongoing cycles of selection for expanded control of invading TEs, followed by selection for increased specificity to reduce impacts on host genes, are proposed to explain the frequent signatures of adaptive evolution among piRNA pathway proteins. However, empirical tests of this model remain limited, particularly with regards to selection against genomic autoimmunity.\n\nI examined three adaptively evolving piRNA proteins, Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff, for evidence of interspecific divergence in autoimmunity between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. I tested a key prediction of the autoimmunity hypothesis: that foreign heterospecific piRNA proteins will exhibit enhanced autoimmunity, due to the absence of historical selection against off-target effects. Consistent with this prediction, full-length D. simulans Cutoff, as well as the D. simulans hinge domain of Rhino, exhibit expanded regulation of D. melanogaster genes. I further demonstrate that this autoimmunity is dependent on known incompatibilities between D. simulans proteins or domains and their interacting partners in D. melanogaster. My observations reveal that the same protein-protein interaction domains that are interfaces of adaptive evolution in Rhino and Cutoff also determine their potential for autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Cercospora leaf spot is the most important disease of sugar beet worldwide. The disease is caused by the fungus Cercospora beticola and is managed principally by timely application of fungicides including those of the sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) class. However, reliance on DMIs has caused an increase in resistance to this class of fungicides in multiple C. beticola populations. To better understand the genetic and evolutionary basis for resistance in C. beticola, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and selective sweep analysis were conducted for the first time in this fungal plant pathogen. We performed whole genome resequencing of 190 C. beticola isolates predominantly from North Dakota and Minnesota that were phenotyped for sensitivity to tetraconazole, the most widely used DMI fungicide in this region. GWAS identified mutations in genes associated with DMI fungicide resistance including a Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) protein, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) pleiotropic drug resistance transporter, a dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK), and a gene annotated as a hypothetical protein. A SNP upstream of CbCYP51, the gene encoding the target of DMI fungicides, was also identified via GWAS. Haplotype analysis of CbCYP51 identified a synonymous mutation (E170) in high linkage disequilibrium with the upstream SNP, and multiple non-synonymous mutations (L144F, I387M and Y464S) associated with DMI resistance. Additionally, a putative codon bias effect for the L144F substitution was identified that generated different resistance potentials. We also identified a CbCYP51 paralog in C. beticola, CbCYP51-like, with high protein homology to CYP51C found uniquely in Fusarium species but CbCYP51-like does not appear to influence DMI sensitivity. Genome-wide scans of selection showed that several of the GWAS mutations for fungicide resistance resided in regions that have recently undergone a selective sweep. Using radial plate growth on selected media as a fitness proxy, we did not find a trade-off associated with DMI fungicide resistance suggesting that resistance mutations can persist in C. beticola populations. Taken together, we show that population genomic data from a crop pathogen can allow the identification of mutations conferring fungicide resistance and inform about their origins in the pathogen population.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are on course to translate the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into clinical practice. To date, most GWAS have been based on individuals of European-ancestry, meaning that the utility of PRS for non-European populations is limited because SNP effects and LD patterns may not be conserved across populations. We hypothesized that cross population prediction at the level of genes rather than SNPs would be more effective, since the effect of genes on traits is likely to be more highly conserved. Therefore, we developed a framework to convert effect sizes at SNPs into effect sizes for genetically predicted transcript abundance, which we used for prediction in non-European populations. We compared this approach, which we call polygenic transcriptome risk scores (PTRS), to PRS, using data from 17 quantitative traits that were measured in multiple ancestries (European, African, East Asian, and South Asian) by UK Biobank. On average, PTRS using whole blood predicted transcriptome had lower absolute prediction accuracy than PRS, as we expected since not all regulatory processes were captured by a single tissue. However, as hypothesized, we found that in the African target set, the portability (prediction accuracy relative to the European reference set) was significantly higher for PTRS than PRS (p=0.03) with additional gain when transcriptomic prediction models ancestry matched the target population (p=0.021). Taken together, our results suggest that using PTRS can improve prediction in underrepresented populations and that increasing the diversity of transcriptomic data may be an effective way to improve portability of GWAS results between populations and help reduce health disparities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe emergence of insecticide resistance is a major threat to malaria control programmes in Africa, with many different factors contributing to insecticide resistance in its vectors, Anopheles mosquitoes. CYP6M2 has previously been recognized as an important candidate in cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification in Anopheles mosquitoes. As it has been implicated in resistance against pyrethroids, organochlorines and carbamates, its broad metabolic activity makes it a potential agent in insecticide cross-resistance. Currently, allelic variation within the Cyp6m2 gene remains unknown.\n\nResultsHere, we use Illumina whole-genome sequence data from Phase 2 of the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G) to examine genetic variation in the Cyp6m2 gene across 16 populations in 13 countries comprising Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. We find 15 missense biallelic substitutions at high frequency (defined as >5% frequency in one or more populations), that fall into five distinct haplotype groups that carry the main high frequency variants: A13T, D65A, E328Q, Y347F, I359V and A468S. We examine whether these alleles show evidence of selection either through potentially modified enzymatic function or by being linked to variants that change the transcriptional profile of the gene. Despite consistent reports of Cyp6m2 upregulation and metabolic activity in insecticide resistant Anophelines, we find no evidence of directional selection occurring on these variants or on the haplotype clusters in which they are found.\n\nConclusionOur results imply that emerging resistance associated with Cyp6m2 is potentially driven by distant regulatory loci such as transcriptional factors rather than by its missense variants, or that other genes are playing a more significant role in conferring metabolic resistance.",

    "abstract": "The activity of transposable elements (TEs) can be an important driver of genetic diversity with TE-mediated mutations having a wide range of fitness consequences. To avoid deleterious effects of TE activity, some fungi evolved highly sophisticated genomic defences to reduce TE proliferation across the genome. Repeat-induced point (RIP) mutations is a fungal-specific TE defence mechanism efficiently targeting duplicated sequences. The rapid accumulation of RIP mutations is expected to deactivate TEs over the course of a few generations. The evolutionary dynamics of TEs at the population level in a species with highly repressive genome defences is poorly understood. Here, we analyze 366 whole-genome sequences of Parastagonospora nodorum, a fungal pathogen of wheat with efficient RIP. A global population genomics analysis revealed high levels of genetic diversity and signs of frequent sexual recombination. Contrary to expectations for a species with RIP, we identified recent TE activity in multiple populations. The TE composition and copy numbers showed little divergence among global populations regardless of the demographic history. Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIMs) were largely underlying recent intra-species TE expansions. We inferred RIP footprints in individual TE families and found that recently active, high-copy TEs have possibly evaded genomic defences. We find no evidence that recent positive selection acted on TE-mediated mutations rather that purifying selection maintained new TE insertions at low insertion frequencies in populations. Our findings highlight the complex evolutionary equilibria established by the joint action of TE activity, selection and genomic repression.\n\nData SummaryAll Illumina sequence data is available from the NCBI SRA BioProject numbers PRJNA606320, PRJNA398070 and PRJNA476481 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject).

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe GRCh37 human genome assembly is still widely used in genomics despite the fact an updated human genome assembly (GRCh38) has been available for many years. A particular issue with relevant ramifications for clinical genetics currently is the case of the GRCh37 Ensembl gene annotations which has been archived, and thus not updated, since 2013. These Ensembl GRCh37 gene annotations are just as ubiquitous as the former assembly and are the default gene models used and preferred by the majority of genomic projects internationally. In this study, we highlight the issue of genes with discrepant annotations, that have been recognized as protein coding in the new but not the old assembly. These genes are ignored by all genomic resources that still rely on the archived and outdated gene annotations. Moreover, the majority if not all of these discrepant genes (DGs) are automatically discarded and ignored by all variant prioritization tools that rely on the GRCh37 Ensembl gene annotations.\n\nMethodsWe performed bioinformatics analysis identifying Ensembl genes with discrepant annotations between the two most recent human genome assemblies, hg37, hg38, respectively. Clinical and phenotype gene curations have been obtained and compared for this gene set. Furthermore, matching RefSeq transcripts have also been collated and analyzed.\n\nResultsWe found hundreds of genes (N=267) that were reclassified as \"protein-coding\" in the new hg38 assembly. Notably, 169 of these genes also had a discrepant HGNC gene symbol between the two assemblies. Most genes had RefSeq matches (N=199/267) including all the genes with defined phenotypes in Ensembl genes GRCh38 assembly (N=10). However, many protein-coding genes remain missing from the current known RefSeq gene models (N=68)\n\nConclusionWe found many clinically relevant genes in this group of neglected genes and we anticipate that many more will be found relevant in the future. For these genes, the inaccurate label of \"non-protein-coding\" hinders the possibility of identifying any causal sequence variants that overlap them. In addition, Important additional annotations such as evolutionary constraint metrics are also not calculated for these genes for the same reason, further relegating them into oblivion.",

The system uses an Arduino microcontroller with compatible components, it is affordable and easy to rebuild for every laboratory. The MoPSS was validated using female C57BL/6J mice and manual video comparison. It proved to be accurate even for fast moving mice (up to 100 % accuracy after logical reconstruction), and is already implemented in several studies in our laboratory. Here, we provide the complete construction description as well as the validation data and the results of an example experiment. This tracking system will allow group-based preference testing with individually identified mice to be carried out in a convenient manner, creating the foundation for better housing conditions from the animals perspective.",

While the formation of traplines by individual pollinators has been studied in details, how populations of foragers exploit resources in a common area is an open question, difficult to address experimentally. We explored conditions for the emergence of resource partitioning among traplining bees using agent-based models built from experimental data of bumblebees foraging on artificial flowers. In the models, bees learn to develop routes as a consequence of feedback loops that change their probabilities of moving between flowers. While a positive reinforcement of movements leading to rewarding flowers is sufficient for the emergence of resource partitioning when flowers are evenly distributed, addition of negative reinforcement of movements leading to unrewarding flowers is necessary when flowers are patchily distributed. In environments with more complex spatial structure, the negative experiences of individual bees on flowers favour spatial segregation and efficient collective foraging.",

Here, we exploited the neural function of surviving spinal circuits to restore voluntary arm and hand control in three monkeys with spinal cord injury using spinal cord stimulation. Our neural interface leverages the functional organization of the dorsal roots to convey artificial excitation via electrical stimulation to relevant spinal segments at appropriate movement phases. Stimulation bursts targeting specific spinal segments produced sustained arm movements enabling monkeys with arm paralysis to perform an unconstrained reach-and-grasp task. Stimulation specifically improved strength, task performances and movement quality. Electrophysiology suggested that residual descending inputs were necessary to produce coordinated movements.

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs) allow us to extract motor, sensory and autonomic information from the nervous system and use it as control signals in neuroprosthetic and neuromodulation applications. Recent efforts have aimed to improve the recording selectivity of PNIs, including by using spatiotemporal patterns from multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Before such a methodology can be translated to humans, its performance in chronic implantation scenarios must be evaluated. In this simulation study, approaches were evaluated for maintaining selective recording performance in the presence of two chronic implantation challenges: the growth of encapsulation tissue and rotation of the nerve cuff electrode. Performance over time was examined in three conditions: training the CNN at baseline only, supervised re-training with explicitly labeled data at periodic intervals, and a semi-supervised self-learning approach. This study demonstrated that a selective recording algorithm trained at baseline will likely fail over time due to changes in signal characteristics resulting from the chronic challenges. Results further showed that periodically recalibrating the selective recording algorithm can maintain its performance over time, and that a self-learning approach has the potential to reduce the frequency of recalibration.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating and tracking wound size is a fundamental metric for the wound assessment process. Good location and size estimates can enable proper diagnosis and effective treatment. Traditionally, laboratory wound healing studies include a collection of images at uniform time intervals exhibiting the wounded area and the healing process in the test animal, often a mouse. These images are then manually observed to determine key metrics --such as wound size progress- relevant to the study. However, this task is a time-consuming and laborious process. In addition, defining the wound edge could be subjective and can vary from one individual to another even among experts. Furthermore, as our understanding of the healing process grows, so does our need to efficiently and accurately track these key factors for high throughput (e.g., over large-scale and long-term experiments). Thus, in this study, we develop a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that aims to intake non-uniform wound images and extract relevant information such as the location of interest, wound only image crops, and wound periphery size over-time metrics. In particular, our work focuses on images of wounded laboratory mice that are used widely for translationally relevant wound studies and leverages a commonly used ring-shaped splint present in most images to predict wound size. We apply the method to a dataset that was never meant to be quantified and, thus, presents many visual challenges. Additionally, the data set was not meant for training deep learning models and so is relatively small in size with only 256 images. We compare results to that of expert measurements and demonstrate preservation of information relevant to predicting wound closure despite variability from machine-to-expert and even expert-to-expert. The proposed system resulted in high fidelity results on unseen data with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, the pipeline estimates acceptable wound sizes when less than 50% of the images are missing reference objects.\n\nAuthor summaryKnowledge of the wound size changes over-time allows us to observe important insights such as rate of closure, time to closure, and expansion events, which are key indicators for predicting healing status. To better perform wound measurements it is essential to utilize a technique that returns accurate and consistent results every time. Over the last years, collecting wound images is becoming easier and more popular as digital cameras and smartphones are more accessible. Commonly, scientists/clinicians trace the wound in these images manually to observe changes in the wound, which is normally a slow and labor-intensive process and also requires a trained eye. The clinical goal is to more efficiently and effectively treat wounds by employing easy to use and precise wound measurement techniques. Therefore, the objective should be devising automatic and precise wound measurement tools to be used for wound assessment. To this end, we leveraged a combination of various state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning-based methods for developing a versatile and automatic wound assessment tool. We applied this tool to analyze the images of wound inflicted lab mice and showed that our developed tool automated the overall wound measurement process, therefore, resulting in high fidelity results without significant human intervention. Furthermore, we compared results to two expert measurements. We found variability in measurement even across experts further validating the need for a consistent approach. However, qualitative behavior, which is most important for predicting wound closure, is preserved.",

    "abstract": "The key method for determining the structure of a protein to date is X-ray crystallography, which is a very expensive technique that suffers from high attrition rate. On the contrary, a sequence-based predictor that is capable of accurately determining protein crystallization property, would not only overcome such limitations, but also would reduce the trial-and-error settings required to perform crystallization. In this work, to predict protein crystallizability, we have developed a novel sequence-based hybrid method that employs two separate, yet fully automated, concepts for extracting features from protein sequences. Specifically, we use a deep convolutional neural network on a publicly available dataset to extract descriptive features directly from the sequences, then fuse such feature with structural-and-physio-chemical driven features (such as amino-acid composition or AAIndex-based physicochemical properties). Dimentionality reduction is then performed on the resulting features and the output vectors are applied to train optimized gradient boosting machine (XGBoostt). We evaluate our method through three publicly available test sets, and show that our proposed DHS-Crystallize algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and achieves higher performance compared to using DCNN-deriven features, or structural-and-physio-chemical driven features alone.",

Fluorescence imaging is an easy-to-access method to detect individual DNA barcodes, which can be scaled up to a massively high-throughput format. Large overlaps between emission spectra of fluorescence dyes, however, severely limit the numbers of DNA barcodes-and thus its signal space-that can be detected in a simultaneous manner. We here demonstrate the use of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to encode virtual signals in DNA barcodes using conventional two-color fluorescence microscopy. By optimizing imaging and biochemistry conditions for weak hybridization events for DNA barcodes, we markedly enhanced accuracy in our determination of the efficiency by which single-molecule FRET occurred. This allowed us to unambiguously differentiate six DNA barcodes exhibiting different FRET values without involving probe sequence exchanges. Our method can be directly incorporated with previous DNA barcode techniques, and may thus be widely adopted to expand the signal space of the DNA barcode techniques.",

    "abstract": "The improvement of efficiency traits, such as protein efficiency (PE), digestible energy efficiency (EnE) and lipid gain (LipG), are relevant given their associations with environmental pollution, cost of productions, and the quality of meat. However, these traits are difficult traits to measure and usually require slaughtering of pigs. Efficiency traits are complex, and several factors, such as genetic predisposition, feed composition, but also individual feeding behaviour may contribute to efficiency. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the potential of using feeding behaviour traits to predict efficiency traits under dietary protein restriction. A total of 587 Swiss Large White pigs, consisting of 312 females and 275 castrated males, had ad libitum access to feed and water, and were fed a protein-reduced diet (80% of recommended digestible protein and essential amino acids) from 22.5 {+/-} 1.6 to 106.6 {+/-} 4.6 kg BW. Individual feed intake was monitored and carcass composition (lean and fat mass) at slaughter was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The PE and EnE were calculated as the ratio of protein or energy in the carcass (estimated by DXA) to the total protein or energy consumed. Feeding behaviour traits monitored were daily feed intake (DFI; g/day), feed intake per meal (FIM; g/meal), number of daily meals (NDM; meals/day), duration of meal (DUM; min/meal), feeding rate (FR; g/min), and feeder occupation (FO; min/day). A partial least square (PLS) regression was used to predict PE, EnE and LipG from feeding behaviour traits, while including farrowing series (for PE only), age at slaughter and body weight at slaughter. Accuracy of PLS regression was assessed based on RMSE and R2 for calibration and validation sets, and on concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), which were estimated over 100 replicates of calibration and validation sets. Models with a number of latent variables of 5, 2 and 3 were identified as optimal for PE, EnE, and LipG, which explained 34.64%, 55.42% and 82.68% of the total variation in PE, EnE, and LipG, respectively. Significant CCC were found between predicted and observed values for PE (0.50), EnE (0.70), and LipG (0.90). In conclusion, individual feeding behaviour traits can better predict EnE and LipG than for PE under dietary protein restriction when fed ad libitum.\n\nImplicationsThis study suggests that five feeding behaviour traits, which are automatically recorded via feeder stations in large numbers with little effort, together with body weight and age, may be used to predict protein efficiency, energy efficiency and lipid gain in Swiss Large White pigs receiving a protein reduced diet with considerable accuracy. This will allow for easy collection of large amounts of data on these traits for precision feeding and genetic selection strategies, especially when additional traits are added in the future to further improve accuracy.",

In hepatocellular cancer patients, the liver was identified as the predominant source of plasma DNA carrying tumor-specific mutations. In a pregnant woman with lymphoma, plasma DNA molecules carrying cancer mutations and fetal-specific alleles were accurately shown to be derived from the lymphocytes and placenta, respectively. Analysis of tissue origin for plasma DNA carrying genetic variants is potentially useful for noninvasive prenatal testing, transplantation monitoring and cancer screening.",

    "abstract": "Huanglongbing (HLB, ex-greening) is the most devastating citrus disease around the world. We modelled HLB spread in scenarios with different populational levels of the main alternative host (Murraya paniculata) and Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, vector of HLB associated bacteria; and removal of HLB-symptomatic plants. A compartmental deterministic mathematical model was built for representing the HLB dynamics in the Reconcavo Baiano, Bahia State, Brazil. The model encompasses delays on latency and incubation disease periods and on the D. citri nymphal stages. The simulations indicated that the presence of alternative hosts at low proportion would not play a crucial role in HLB dynamics in situations of poor D. citri management, regardless of HLB-symptomatic plants eradication. Symptomatic citrus plants contribute more to increase the HLB-incidence than the alternative host in scenarios without a suitable D. citri management.",

    "abstract": "In addition to participating in {gamma}-secretase activity, presenilin 1 (PS1) regulates trafficking and subcellular localization of {beta}-amyloid precursor protein (APP). We previously showed that gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP) selectively modulates {gamma}-secretase activity by inducing conformational change in PS1. However, little is known whether and how GSAP might influence APP trafficking and consequent generation of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides. Here, to explore whether GSAP has any role in regulating APP trafficking, and to systematically investigate the intracellular trafficking routes of APP, we paired total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, high-speed line scanning microscopy, and 4D microscopy with comprehensive imaging analysis methodologies to depict the elusive modes of APP trafficking at a single-vesicle level. Mobility and diffusivity changes reveal the existence of two kinetically distinct pathways, classified into mobile and immobile pools, for vesicular APP trafficking, suggesting high association between immobile vesicle pool and amyloidogenic processing. GSAP knockdown significantly lowers immobile pool without overturning APP vesicle diffusivity, suggesting that GSAP affects vesicular APP trafficking by retaining APP in membrane microdomains known to favor amyloidogenic processing. Our study reveals a novel role of GSAP in the regulation of A{beta}-peptide formation that modulates switching of APP vesicles between immobile and mobile pools, which may help identifying new therapeutic strategies to treat Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe increasing prevalence of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) necessitates a reliable detection of VRE especially for low level resistance mediated by vanB in Enterococcus faecium. In this prospective study we analyzed if vanB mediated vancomycin resistance can be reliably detected by Vitek2.\n\nMethods1344 enterococcal isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested by Vitek2 (bioMerieux, Nurtingen, Germany). Additionally, a bacterial suspension (0.5 McFarland) was inoculated on a chromID VRE screening agar (bioMerieux) and incubated for 48 hours. If vancomycin was tested susceptible by Vitek2 but growth was detected on the screening agar a PCR for vanA/vanB was performed (GeneXpert vanA/B test kit, Cepheid, Frankfurt, Germany). MICs of vancomycin susceptible by Vitek but vanA/B positive isolates were determined before and after cultivation in a broth with increasing concentration of vancomycin.\n\nResults156/492 of E. faecium were VRE, predominantly vanB (87.0%) of which 14 were not identified as VRE by Vitek2 (sensitivity 91.0%). The majority (9/14) demonstrated high-level MICs by broth dilution. Even after exposure to increasing vancomycin concentrations MICs remained nearly identical. Three of the undetected isolates demonstrated initial growth on chromID VRE, after the vancomycin exposure additional 7 isolates demonstrated growth on chromID VRE.\n\nConclusionsVitek2 fails to detect vanB mediated vancomycin resistance consistently, especially but not limited to low-level resistance. As this may lead to treatment failure and further dissemination of vanB VRE, additional methods (e.g. culture on VRE screening agar or PCR) are necessary to reliably identify vanB-positive enterococci in clinical routine.",

    "abstract": "A proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a new technology that marks proteins for degradation in a highly specific manner. During screening, PROTAC compounds are tested in concentration-response (CR) assays to determine their potency, and parameters such as the half-maximal degradation concentration (DC50) are estimated from the fitted CR curves. These parameters are used to rank compounds, with lower DC50 values indicating greater potency. However, PROTAC data often exhibit bi-phasic and poly-phasic relationships, making standard sigmoidal CR models inappropriate. A common solution includes manual omitting of points (the so called \"masking\" step) allowing standard models to be used on the reduced datasets. Due to its manual and subjective nature, masking becomes a costly and non-reproducible procedure. We, therefore, used a Bayesian changepoint Gaussian Processes model that can flexibly fit both non-sigmoidal and sigmoidal CR curves without user input. Parameters, such as the DC50, the maximum effect Dmax, and the point of departure (PoD) are estimated from the fitted curves. We then rank compounds based on one or more parameters, and propagate the parameter uncertainty into the rankings, enabling us to confidently state if one compound is better than another. Hence, we used a flexible and automated procedure for PROTAC screening experiments. By minimizing subjective decisions, our approach reduces time, cost, and ensures reproducibility of the compound ranking procedure.

We show that the relationship has shifted down and became shallower, corresponding to a decline in population density of 32-72%, for the largest and smallest mammals, respectively. However, the SDRs become steeper in some groups (e.g. carnivores) and shallower in others (e.g. herbivores). The Anthropocene reorganization of biotic systems is apparent in macroecological relationships that were previously believed to be immutable, reinforcing the notion that biodiversity pattens are contingent upon conditions at the time of investigation.

    "abstract": "Cattle are natural hosts of the intracellular pathogen, Brucella abortus, which inflicts a significant burden on the health and reproduction of these important livestock. The primary routes of infection in field settings have been described, but it is not known how the bovine host shapes the structure of B. abortus populations during infection. We utilized a library of approximately 106 uniquely barcoded B. abortus strains to temporally and spatially quantify population structure at the strain level during colonization of cattle through a natural route of infection. Introducing 108 bacteria from this barcoded library to the conjunctival mucosa resulted in expected levels of local lymph node colonization at a one-week timepoint. We leveraged variance in strain abundance in the library to demonstrate that only 1 in 10,000 brucellae introduced at the site of infection reached the parotid lymph nodes. Thus, cattle restrict the overwhelming majority of B. abortus introduced via the ocular conjunctiva at this dose. Individual strains were spatially restricted within the host tissue, and the total B. abortus census was dominated by a small number of distinct strains in each lymph node. These results define a bottleneck that B. abortus must traverse to colonize local lymph nodes from the conjunctival mucosa. The data further support a model in which a small number of spatially isolated granulomas founded by unique strains are present one-week post infection. These experiments demonstrate the power of barcoded transposon tools to quantify infection bottlenecks and to define pathogen population structure in host tissues.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding microbial population dynamics during infection has important implications for disease management, transmission and pathogen evolution. A quantitative analysis of microbial population structure requires the ability to track individual strains. We used a pool of individually barcoded strains to measure changes in Brucella abortus population structure during infection of bovine hosts via the ocular conjunctiva, a natural route of entry. Cattle exert a severe bottleneck on the bacterial population entering through the conjunctival mucosa such that individual cells have a 0.0001 probability of colonizing a local draining lymph node. The populations in lymph nodes, even on different sides of the same animal, are distinct and dominated by a small number of highly abundant, spatially distinct clones.",

    "abstract": "In genomics-scale datasets, loci are closely packed within chromosomes and hence provide correlated information. Averaging across loci as if they were independent creates pseudoreplication, which reduces the effective degrees of freedom (df) compared to the nominal degrees of freedom, df. This issue has been known for some time, but consequences have not been systematically quantified across the entire genome. Here we measured pseudoreplication (quantified by the ratio df/df) for a common metric of genetic differentiation (FST) and a common measure of linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci (r2). Based on data simulated using models (SLiM and msprime) that allow efficient forward-in-time and coalescent simulations while precisely controlling population pedigrees, we estimated df and df/df by measuring the rate of decline in the variance of mean FST and mean r2 as more loci were used. For both indices, df increases with Ne and genome size, as expected. However, even for large Ne and large genomes, df for mean r2 plateaus after a few thousand loci, and a variance components analysis indicates that the limiting factor is uncertainty associated with sampling individuals rather than genes. Pseudoreplication is less extreme for FST, but df/df [&le;]0.01 can occur in datasets using tens of thousands of loci. Commonly-used block-jackknife methods consistently overestimated var(FST), producing very conservative confidence intervals. Predicting df based on our modeling results as a function of Ne, L, S, and genome size provides a robust way to quantify precision associated with genomics-scale datasets.",

    "abstract": "Very little information exists on the NUclear MiTochondrial sequences (NUMTs) in oral squamous cell carcinoma-gingivobuccal (OSCC-GB). We analysed whole genome sequences obtained from paired tumour and blood DNA from 25 patients of OSCC-GB for detecting NUMTs. Nine potential somatic NUMTs and 78 germline NUMTs were identified in these patients. None of the somatic NUMTs could be confirmed by PCR assay. None of the germline NUMTs were found to be specific for OSCC-GB. Although there have been recent reports on detection of somatic NUMTs in other cancer types, our results suggest NUMTs, both somatic and germline, are not involved in OSCC-GB.",

Evolutionary analysis revealed codon 9628 under episodic selective pressure for all four countries, suggesting it as a key site for the virus evolution. Belonging to the P0DTD3 (Y14_SARS2) uncharacterized protein 14, further investigation has been conducted showing the codon mutation as responsible for the helical modification in the secondary structure. According to the predictions done, the codon is placed into the more ordered region of the gene (41-59) and close the area acting as transmembrane (54-67), suggesting its involvement into the attachment phase of the virus. The predicted structures of P0DTD3 mutated and not confirmed the importance of the codon to define the protein structure and the ontological analysis of the protein emphasized that the mutation enhances the binding probability.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the ventricle represent different populations to those below it. Concerns included limited number of genes profiled, biased selection of genes, and potential independent origins of cell types in different parts of the brain. Here we test two competing hypotheses, using RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the ventricle boundary, and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations below and above the ventricle were remarkably similar. What had been previously named hyperpallium densocellulare above the ventricle had nearly the same molecular profile as the mesopallium below it; the hyperpallium apicale above was highly similar to the nidopallium below; the primary sensory intercalated hyperpallium apicale above was most similar to the sensory population below, although more divergent than the other populations were to each other. These shared population expression profiles define unique functional specializations in anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings support the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivisions above and below the ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations instead of seven and has some profound implications for our understanding of vertebrate brain evolution.",

    "abstract": "The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized neuronal compartment in which synaptic input is converted into action potential output. This process is supported by a diverse complement of sodium, potassium, and calcium channels (CaV). Different classes of sodium and potassium channels are scaffolded at specific sites within the AIS, conferring unique functions, but how calcium channels are functionally distributed within the AIS is unclear. Here, we utilize conventional 2-photon laser scanning and diffraction-limited, high-speed spot 2-photon imaging to resolve action potential-evoked calcium dynamics in the AIS with high spatiotemporal resolution. In mouse layer 5 prefrontal pyramidal neurons, calcium influx was mediated by a mix of CaV2 and CaV3 channels that differentially localized to discrete regions. CaV3 functionally localized to produce nanodomain hotspots of calcium influx that coupled to ryanodine-dependent stores, whereas CaV2 localized to non-hotspot regions. Thus, different pools of CaVs appear to play distinct roles in AIS function.",

    "abstract": "Multiple cilia-associated genes have been shown to affect hair cells in zebrafish (Danio rerio), including the human deafness gene dcdc2, the radial spoke gene rsph9, and multiple intraflagellar transport (IFT) and transition zone genes. Recently a zebrafish alms1 mutant was generated. The ALMS1 gene is the gene mutated in the ciliopathy Alstrom Syndrome a disease that causes hearing loss among other symptoms. The hearing loss seen in Alstrom Syndrome may be due in part to hair cell defects as Alms1 mutant mice show stereocilia polarity defects and a loss of hair cells. Hair cell loss is also seen in postmortem analysis of Alstrom patients. The zebrafish alms1 mutant has metabolic defects similar to those seen in Alstrom syndrome and Alms1 mutant mice. We wished to investigate if it also had hair cell defects. We, however, failed to find any hair cell related phenotypes in alms1 mutant zebrafish. They had normal lateral line hair cell numbers as both larvae and adults and normal kinocilia formation. They also showed grossly normal swimming behavior, response to vibrational stimuli, and FM1-43 loading. Mutants also showed a normal degree of sensitivity to both short-term neomycin and long-term gentamicin treatment. These results indicate that cilia-associated genes differentially affect different hair cell types.",

    "abstract": "Under natural conditions, the visual system often sees a given input repeatedly. This provides an opportunity to optimize processing of the repeated stimuli. Stimulus repetition has been shown to strongly modulate neuronal-gamma band synchronization, yet crucial questions remained open. Here we used magnetoencephalography in 30 human subjects and find that gamma decreases across ~10 repetitions and then increases across further repetitions, revealing plastic changes of the activated neuronal circuits. Crucially, changes induced by one stimulus did not affect responses to other stimuli, demonstrating stimulus specificity. Changes partially persisted when the inducing stimulus was repeated after 25 minutes of intervening stimuli. They were strongest in early visual cortex and increased interareal feedforward influences. Our results suggest that early visual cortex gamma synchronization enables adaptive neuronal processing of recurring stimuli. These and previously reported changes might be due to an interaction of oscillatory dynamics with established synaptic plasticity mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly clear that the neurons in the cerebral cortex are not randomly interconnected. This wiring specificity can result from synapse formation mechanisms that interconnect neurons depending on their activity or genetically defined identity. Here we report that in addition to these synapse formation mechanisms, the structural composition of the neuropil provides a third prominent source by which wiring specificity emerges in cortical networks. This structurally determined wiring specificity reflects the packing density, morphological diversity and similarity of the dendritic and axonal processes. The higher these three factors are, the more recurrent the topology of the networks. Conversely, low density, diversity and similarity yield feedforward networks. These principles predict connectivity patterns from subcellular to network scales that are remarkably consistent with empirical observations from a rich body of literature. Thus, cortical network architectures reflect the specific morphological properties of their constituents to much larger degrees than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has generated intense interest in the rapid development and evaluation of vaccine candidates for this disease and other emerging diseases. Several novel methods for preparing vaccine candidates are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in response to the urgent need to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In many cases, these methods rely on new approaches for vaccine production and immune stimulation. We report on the use of a novel method (SolaVAX) for production of an inactivated vaccine candidate and the testing of that candidate in a hamster animal model for its ability to prevent infection upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The studies employed in this work included an evaluation of the levels of neutralizing antibody produced post-vaccination, levels of specific antibody sub-types to RBD and spike protein that were generated, evaluation of viral shedding post-challenge, flow cytometric and single cell sequencing data on cellular fractions and histopathological evaluation of tissues post-challenge. The results from this study provide insight into the immunological responses occurring as a result of vaccination with the proposed vaccine candidate and the impact that adjuvant formulations, specifically developed to promote Th1 type immune responses, have on vaccine efficacy and protection against infection following challenge with live SARS-CoV-2. This data may have utility in the development of effective vaccine candidates broadly. Furthermore, the results suggest that preparation of a whole virion vaccine for COVID-19 using this specific photochemical method may have utility in the preparation of one such vaccine candidate.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe have developed a vaccine for COVID-19 which is prepared by a novel method for inactivation of a whole virion particle and tested it in a hamster animal model for its ability to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

COVID-19 is caused by airborne infection of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, methods of inactivating the virus efficiently and safely are crucial for reducing the risk of airborne infection. In this regard, the effect of plasma discharge on the infectivity of the coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV-2 was tested. Plasma discharge efficiently reduced the infectivity of both coronaviruses. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium with a plasma discharge resulted in 95.17% viral inactivation after plasma irradiation after 1 hour (hr), 99.54% inactivation after 2 hrs and 99.93% inactivation after 3 hrs. Similar results were obtained for MHV. The results indicated that plasma discharge effectively and safely inactivated the airborne coronaviruses and may be useful in minimizing the risk of airborne infection of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) is a HAP3 subunit of CCAAT-binding transcription factor, which controls several aspects of embryo and postembryo development, including embryo morphogenesis, storage reserve accumulation and skotomorphogenesis. Herein, using the method of chromosomal walking, a 2707bp upstream sequence from the ATG initiation codon site of AhLEC1A which is a homolog of Arabidopsis LEC1 was isolated in peanut. Its transcriptional start site confirmed by 5 RACE was located at 82 nt from 5 upstream of ATG. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that there existed many tissue-specific elements and light responsive motifs in its promoter. To identify the functional region of the AhLEC1A promoter, seven plant expression vectors expressing the GUS ({beta}-glucuronidase) gene, driven by 5 terminal series deleted fragments of AhLEC1A promoter, were constructed and transformed into Arabidopsis. Results of GUS histochemical staining showed that the regulatory region containing 82bp of 5 UTR and 2228bp promoter could facilitate GUS to express preferentially in the embryos at different development periods of Arabidopsis. Taken together, it was inferred that the expression of AhLEC1A during seed development of peanut might be controlled positively by several seed-specific regulatory elements, as well as negatively by some other regulatory elements inhibiting its expression in other organs. Moreover, the GUS expression pattern of transgenic seedlings in darkness and in light was relevant to the light-responsive elements scattered in AhLEC1A promoter segment, implying that these light-responsive elements harbored in the AhLEC1A promoter regulate skotomorphogenesis of peanut seeds, and AhLEC1A expression was inhibited after the germinated seedlings were transferred from darkness to light.",

    "abstract": "The human protein-coding gene ILRUN (inflammation and lipid regulator with UBA-like and NBR1-like domain, previously C6orf106) is a recently-characterised inhibitor of the transcription regulators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). Here we have utilised RNA-seq to define cellular pathways regulated by ILRUN in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We find that inhibition of ILRUN expression increases cellular expression of several members of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), including the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, inhibition of ILRUN results in increased SARS-CoV-2 replication. These data identify ILRUN as a novel inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents, to our knowledge, the first report of ILRUN as a regulator of the RAAS.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThere is no doubt that the current rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had significant and far-reaching impacts on our health and economy and will continue to do so. Research in emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is growing rapidly, with new breakthroughs in the understanding of host-virus interactions and the development of innovative and exciting therapeutic strategies and new knowledge and tools to better protect against the impacts of disease. The human protein-coding gene ILRUN is a recently-characterised inhibitor of the transcription regulators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). Here we present the first evidence that ILRUN modulation has implications for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Virus infectivity assays confirmed that gene silencing of ILRUN had a proviral effect and increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, whilst over-expression of ILRUN inhibited SARS-CoV-2 production. Additionally, we observed that ILRUN also regulates the expression of key elements of the RAAS. These data have important implications for the development of antiviral strategies to deal with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",
