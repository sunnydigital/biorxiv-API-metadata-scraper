    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease with high variability of clinical symptoms. In most cases MS appears as a relapsing-remitting disease course that at a later stage transitions into irreversible progressive decline of neurologic function. The mechanisms underlying MS progression remain poorly understood. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of MS. Here we demonstrate that mice that develop mild EAE after immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 are prone to undergo clinical progression around 30 days after EAE induction. EAE progression was associated with reduction in CD11c+ microglia and dispersed coalescent parenchymal infiltration. We found sex-dependent differences mediated by p38 signaling, a key regulator of inflammation. Selective reduction of CD11c+ microglia in female mice with CD11c-promoter driven p38 knockout (KO) correlated with increased rate of EAE progression. In protected animals, we found CD11c+ microglia forming contacts with astrocyte processes at the glia limitans and immune cells retained within perivascular spaces. Together, our study provides evidence on the protective role of CD11c+ microglia in controlling CNS immune cell parenchymal infiltration in autoimmune demyelination.",

    "abstract": "Over 95% of human genes undergo alternative splicing (AS) in a developmental, tissue-specific, or signal transduction-dependent manner. Here, we present a large-scale survey of sex-biased differential alternative splicing (DAS) across 7027 samples of 39 tissues from 532 individuals (351 males and 181 females) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We detected a total of 1278 statistically significant DAS events affecting 888 different genes and 4417 significant differential gene expression (DGE) events in 3221 genes. Only 267 (29.3%) of the differentially spliced genes were also differentially expressed. Genes that displayed sex-biased DGE or DAS across multiple tissues were enriched in functions related to signaling including histone demethylation. The probability of a gene showing significant differential AS varies by chromosome and is highest for the X chromosome, with differentially spliced X chromosomal genes additionally being more likely to escape X chromosomal inactivation. A small but significant association was found between sex-biased AS and transcripts that undergo physiological nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). We show a significant overlap of differential splicing and genes that display estrogen-induced alternative splicing, that are involved in estrogen response pathway. Further, we show overlap of the involved exons with estrogen-receptor bindings sites. Our results provide a comprehensive survey of sex-biased AS and its characteristics across a large collection of human tissues.",

    "abstract": "The provenance of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) poses unusually challenging questions because of their role in the emergence and evolution of genetic coding. We investigate evidence about their ancestry from highly curated structure-based multiple sequence alignments of a small \"scaffold\" that is structurally invariant in all 10 canonical Class I aaRS. Statistically different values of two uncorrelated phylogenetic metrics--residue by residue conservation derived from Clustal and row-by-row cladistic congruence derived from BEAST2--suggest that the Class I scaffold is a mosaic assembled from distinct, successive genetic sources. These data are especially significant in light of: (i) experimental fragmentations of the Class I scaffold into three partitions that retain catalytic activities in proportion to their length; and (ii) multiple sources of evidence that two of these partitions arose from an ancestral Class I aaRS gene encoding a Class II ancestor in frame on the opposite strand. Two additional metrics output by BEAST2 vary in accordance with the presumed functionality endowed by the various modules. The new evidence supplements previous aaRS phylogenies. It identifies a previously characterized 46-residue Class I \"protozyme\" as preceding the adaptive radiation of the superfamily containing variations of the Rossmann dinucleotide binding fold related to amino acid discrimination, and thus as root of that molecular tree. Such a rooting is consistent with near simultaneous emergence of genetic coding and the origin of the proteome, resolving a conundrum posed by previous inferences that Class I aaRS evolved long after the genetic code had been implemented in an RNA world. Further, it establishes a timeline for the growth of coding from a binary amino acid alphabet by pinpointing discontinuous enhancements of aaRS fidelity.\n\nAuthor SummaryPhylogenetic analysis uncovers evolutionary connections between different protein superfamily members. We describe complementary, uncorrelated, phylogenetic metrics that support multiple evolutionary histories for different segments within members of the Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase superfamily. Using a carefully curated 3D crystal structure superposition as the primary source of the multiple sequence alignment substantially reduced dependence of these metrics on empirical amino acid substitution matrices. Two metrics are derived from the amino acid distribution observed in each successive position. A third depends on how individual sequences distribute into phylogenetic tree branches for each of the ten amino acids activated by the superfamily. All metrics confirm that a segment previously identified as an inserted element is, indeed, a more recent acquisition, despite its structural conservation. The residue-by-residue conservation metrics reveal significant co-variation of mutational frequencies between a core segment that forms the amino acid binding site and a neighboring segment derived from the more recent insertion element. We attribute that covariation to the differentiation of superfamily members as evolutionary divergence enhanced amino acid specificity. Finally, evidence that the insertion element is a recent acquisition implies a new branching order for much of the proteome.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells display massive dysregulation of key regulatory pathways due to now well-catalogued mutations and other DNA-related aberrations. Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy.\n\nWe introduce a representation of multi-omics profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of \"paired DNA-RNA aberrations\" that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene \"Source-Target Pair\" (STP) consists of a \"source\" regulatory gene and a \"target\" gene whose expression is plausibly \"controlled\" by the source gene. The STP is then \"aberrant\" in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (e.g., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is \"RNA-aberrant\", meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With M STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2M possible configurations.\n\nWe concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations.\n\nWe apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.\n\nAuthor SummaryA large variety of genomic and transcriptomic aberrations are observed in cancer cells, and their identity, location, and frequency can be highly indicative of the particular subtype or molecular phenotype, and thereby inform treatment options. However, elucidating this association between sets of aberrations and subtypes of cancer is severely impeded by considerable diversity in the set of aberrations across samples from the same population. Most attempts at analyzing tumor heterogeneity have dealt with either the genome or transcriptome in isolation. Here we present a novel, multi-omics approach for quantifying heterogeneity by determining a small set of paired DNA-RNA aberrations that incorporates potential downstream effects on gene expression. We apply integer programming to identify a small set of paired aberrations such that at least one among them is present in every sample of a given cancer population. The resulting \"coverings\" are analyzed for six cancer cohorts from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and facilitate introducing an information-theoretic measure of heterogeneity. Our results identify many known facets of tumorigenesis as well as suggest potential novel genes and interactions of interest.\n\nData Availability StatementRNA-Seq data, somatic mutation data and copy number data for The Cancer Genome Atlas were obtained through the Xena Cancer Genome Browser database (https://xenabrowser.net) from individual cancer type cohorts.

    "abstract": "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is associated with vascular dementia (VaD). Cerebral hypoperfusion may initiate complex molecular and cellular inflammatory pathways that contribute to long-term cognitive impairment and memory loss. Here we used a bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model of VaD to investigate its effect on the innate immune response - particularly the inflammasome signaling pathway. Comprehensive analyses revealed that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induces a complex temporal expression and activation of inflammasome components and their downstream products (IL-1{beta} and IL-18) in different brain regions, and promotes activation of apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death pathways. Polarized glial cell activation, white matter lesion formation and hippocampal neuronal loss also occurred in a spatiotemporal manner. Moreover, in AIM2 knockout mice we observed attenuated inflammasome-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis and pyroptosis, as well as resistance to chronic microglial activation, myelin breakdown, hippocampal neuronal loss, and behavioural and cognitive deficits following BCAS. Hence, we have demonstrated that activation of the AIM2 inflammasome substantially contributes to the pathophysiology of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced brain injury and may therefore represent a promising therapeutic target for attenuating cognitive impairment in VaD.",

While well established socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic risk factors have been identified, our understanding of the drivers and mechanisms underlying these complex diseases remains incomplete. A better understanding is required to develop more effective therapeutic interventions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to assess organ health in a number of studies, but large-scale population-based studies are still in their infancy. Using 38,683 abdominal MRI scans in the UK Biobank, we used deep learning to systematically quantify parameters from individual organs (liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, lungs and adipose depots), and demonstrate that image derived phenotypes (volume, fat and iron content) reflect organ health and disease. We show that these traits have a substantial heritable component (8%-44%), and identify 93 independent genome-wide significant associations, including 3 associations with liver fat and one with liver iron that have not previously been reported, and 73 in traits that have not previously been studied. Overall our work demonstrates the utility of deep learning to systematically quantify health parameters from high-throughput MRI across a range of organs and tissues of the abdomen, and to generate new insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriocins are proteinaceous antimicrobials produced by bacteria which are active against other strains of the same species. R-type pyocins are phage tail-like bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to their anti-pseudomonal activity, R-pyocins have potential as therapeutics in infection. P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and is particularly problematic for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). P. aeruginosa from CF lung infections develop increasing resistance to antibiotics, making new treatment approaches essential. P. aeruginosa populations become phenotypically and genotypically diverse during infection, however, little is known of the efficacy of R-pyocins against heterogeneous populations. R-pyocins vary by subtype (R1-R5), distinguished by binding to different residues on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Each type varies in killing spectrum, and each strain produces only one R-type. To evaluate the prevalence of different R-types, we screened P. aeruginosa strains from the International Pseudomonas Consortium Database (IPCD) and from our biobank of CF strains. We found that (i) R1-types were the most prevalent R-type among strains from respiratory sources; (ii) there is a large number of strains lacking R-pyocin genes, and (iii) isolates collected from the same patient have the same R-type. We then assessed the impact of intra-strain diversity on R-pyocin susceptibility and found a heterogenous response to R-pyocins within populations, likely due to differences in the LPS core. Our work reveals that heterogeneous populations of microbes exhibit variable susceptibility to R-pyocins and highlights that there is likely heterogeneity in response to other types of LPS-binding antimicrobials, including phage.\n\nImportanceR-pyocins have potential as alternative therapeutics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic infection, however little is known about the efficacy of R-pyocins in heterogeneous bacterial populations. P. aeruginosa is known to become resistant to multiple antibiotics, as well as evolve phenotypic and genotypic diversity over time; thus it is particularly difficult to eradicate in chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa populations from CF lungs maintain the same R-pyocin genotype but exhibit heterogeneity in susceptibility to R-pyocins from other strains. Our findings suggest there is likely heterogeneity in response to other types of LPS-binding antimicrobials, such as phage, highlighting the necessity of further studying the potential of LPS-binding antimicrobial particles as alternative therapies in chronic infections.",

Invading tumor cells evade treatment, limiting the efficacy of the current standard of care regimen. Understanding the underlying invasive behaviors that support tumor growth may allow for generation of novel GBM therapies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are attractive for genetics and live imaging, and have in recent years, emerged as a model system suitable for cancer biology research. While other groups have studied CNS tumors using zebrafish, few have concentrated on the invasive behaviors supporting the development of these diseases. Previous studies demonstrated that one of the main mechanisms of GBM invasion is perivascular invasion, i.e. single tumor cell migration along blood vessels. Here, we characterize phenotypes, methodology, and potential therapeutic avenues for utilizing zebrafish to model perivascular GBM invasion. Using patient derived xenolines or an adherent cell line, we demonstrate tumor expansion within the zebrafish brain. Within 24 hours post-intracranial injection, D54-MG-tdTomato glioma cells produce finger-like projections along the zebrafish brain vasculature. As few as 25 GBM cells were sufficient to promote single cell vessel co-option. Of note, these tumor-vessel interactions are CNS specific, and do not occur on pre-existing blood vessels when injected into the animals peripheral tissue. Tumor-vessel interactions increase over time and can be pharmacologically disrupted through inhibition of Wnt signaling. Therefore, zebrafish serve as a favorable model system to study perivascular glioma invasion, one of the deadly characteristics that make GBM so difficult to treat.",

Cyclic mechanical loading is well established to influence bone (re)modelling activity, in which bone formation and resorption are correlated to micro-scale strain. Based on this, the application of mechanical stimulation across a bone defect could improve healing. However, if ignoring the mechanical integrity of defected bone, loading regimes have a high potential to either cause damage or be ineffective. This study explores real-time finite element (rtFE) methods that use three-dimensional structural analyses from micro-computed tomography images to estimate effective peak cyclic loads in a subject-specific and time-dependent manner. It demonstrates the concept in a cyclically loaded mouse caudal vertebral bone defect model. Using rtFE analysis combined with adaptive mechanical loading, mouse bone healing was significantly improved over non-loaded controls, with no incidence of vertebral fractures. Such rtFE-driven adaptive loading regimes demonstrated here could be relevant to clinical bone defect healing scenarios, where mechanical loading can become patient-specific and more efficacious. This is achieved by accounting for initial bone defect conditions and spatio-temporal healing, both being factors that are always unique to the patient.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how human brain microstructure influences functional connectivity is an important endeavor. In this work, magnetic resonance imaging data from ninety healthy participants were used to calculate structural connectivity matrices using the streamline count, fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and a myelin measure (derived from multicomponent relaxometry) to assign connection strength. Unweighted binarized structural connectivity matrices were also constructed. Magnetoencephalography resting-state data from those participants were used to calculate functional connectivity matrices, via correlations of the Hilbert envelopes of beamformer timeseries at the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. Non-negative matrix factorization was performed to identify the components of the functional connectivity. Shortest-path-length and search-information analyses of the structural connectomes were used to predict functional connectivity patterns for each participant.\n\nThe microstructure-informed algorithms predicted the components of the functional connectivity more accurately than they predicted the total functional connectivity. This provides a methodology for better understanding of functional mechanisms. The shortest-path-length algorithm exhibited the highest prediction accuracy. Of the weights of the structural connectivity matrices, the streamline count and the myelin measure gave the most accurate predictions, while the fractional anisotropy performed poorly. Overall, different structural metrics paint very different pictures of the structural connectome and its relationship to functional connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease without a cure. If untreated, increased pulmonary vascular resistance kills patients within several years due to right heart failure. Even with the currently available therapies, survival durations remain short. By the time patients are diagnosed with this disease, the damage to the right ventricle (RV) has already developed. Therefore, agents that repair the damaged RV have therapeutic potential. We previously reported that cardiac fibrosis that occurs in the RV of adult Sprague-Dawley rats with PAH could naturally be reversed. We herein investigated the mechanism of this remarkable cardiac repair process. Counting of cardiomyocytes showed that the elimination of cardiac fibrosis is associated with the increased RV myocyte number, suggesting that new cardiomyocytes were generated. Immunohistochemistry showed the expression of -smooth muscle actin and Sox-2 in RV myocytes of rats with PAH. Transmission electron microscopy detected the structure that resembles maturing cardiomyocytes in both the RV of PAH rats and cultured cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. We propose that the damaged RV in PAH can be repaired by activating the cell reprogramming mechanism that converts resident cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes.",

We tested whether this competition is restricted to acoustic-phonetic interference or if it extends to competition for linguistic processing as well. Neural activity was recorded using Magnetoencephalography as human participants were instructed to attended to natural speech presented to one ear, and task-irrelevant stimuli were presented to the other. Task-irrelevant stimuli consisted either of random sequences of syllables, or syllables structured to form coherent sentences, using hierarchical frequency-tagging.\n\nWe find that the phrasal structure of structured task-irrelevant stimuli was represented in the neural response in left inferior frontal and posterior parietal regions, indicating that selective attention does not fully eliminate linguistic processing of task-irrelevant speech. Additionally, neural tracking of to-be-attended speech in left inferior frontal regions was enhanced when competing with structured task-irrelevant stimuli, suggesting inherent competition between them for linguistic processing.\n\nImpact StatementSyntactic structure-building processes can be applied to speech that is task-irrelevant and should be ignored, demonstrating that Selective Attention does not fully eliminate linguistic processing of competing speech.",

However, organ development is subject to random variations, called developmental noise, best revealed by the fluctuating asymmetry observed between bilateral organs. The developmental mechanisms ensuring bilateral symmetry in organ size are mostly unknown. In Drosophila, null mutations for the relaxin-like hormone Dilp8 increase wing fluctuating asymmetry, suggesting that Dilp8 plays a role in buffering developmental noise. Here we show that size adjustment of the wing primordia involves a peak of Dilp8 expression that takes place sharply at the end of juvenile growth. Wing size adjustment relies on a crossorgan communication involving the epidermis as the source of Dilp8. We identify ecdysone signaling as both the trigger for epidermal dilp8 expression and its downstream target in the wing primordia, thereby establishing reciprocal feedback between the two hormones as a systemic mechanism controlling organ size precision. Our results reveal a hormone-based time window ensuring fine-tuning of organ size and bilateral symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Species ranges are shifting in response to climate change. In New England saltmarshes, the mud fiddler crab, Minuca pugnax, is expanding north of Cape Cod, MA into the Gulf of Maine (GoM) due to warming waters. The burrowing lifestyle of M. pugnax means sediment compaction in saltmarshes may influence the ability for crabs to dig, with more compact soils being resilient to burrowing. Previous studies indicate that saltmarshes along the GoM have higher soil strength (i.e., compaction) relative to marshes south of Cape Cod. Together, physical characteristics and temperature of this habitat may be influencing the burrowing performance of M. pugnax, and therefore the continuation of their northward range expansion into the GoM. To determine if compaction affects burrowing activity of M. pugnax in historical and range expanded populations, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment. We manipulated soil compaction in standardized lab assays and measured crab burrowing performance with individuals collected from Nantucket (i.e., historical range) and the Plum Island Estuary (PIE, i.e., expanded range). We determined compaction negatively affected burrowing ability in crabs from both sites; however, crabs from PIE burrowed in higher soil compactions than Nantucket crabs. In addition, PIE crabs were more likely to burrow overall. We conclude that site level differences in compaction are likely altering burrowing behavior in the crabs expanded range territory by way of phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolution. Our study demonstrates that non-temperature physical habitat traits can be as important as temperature in influencing climate driven range expansions.",

Current theories emphasise the importance of a left-lateralised semantic control network (SCN) in supporting flexible semantic behaviour, while a bilateral multiple-demand network (MDN) is implicated in executive functions across domains. No study, however, has examined whether semantic and non-semantic demands are reflected in a common neural code within regions specifically implicated in semantic control. Using functional MRI and univariate parametric modulation analysis as well as multivariate pattern analysis, we found that semantic and non-semantic demands gave rise to both similar and distinct neural responses across control-related networks. Though activity patterns in SCN and MDN could decode the difficulty of both semantic and verbal working memory decisions, there was no shared common neural coding of cognitive demands in SCN regions. In contrast, regions in MDN showed common patterns across manipulations of semantic and working memory control demands, with successful cross-classification of difficulty across tasks. Therefore, SCN and MDN can be dissociated according to the information they maintain about cognitive demands.",

Here, we report the first genomic characterization of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) from sub-Saharan Africa. While suspected, only a single PCR finding without sequence confirmation or characterization has been reported. Here, we used a microbial metagenomic approach to confirm and characterize pathogens causing the suspected outbreak of RHD in Ibadan, Nigeria. On the 25th September 2020, the liver, spleen, and lung samples of five rabbits from an outbreak in 2 farms in Ibadan, Nigeria, were analyzed for the vp60 gene of RHDV by RT-PCR. Subsequently, Next Generation Sequencing on 1st of October revealed one full and two partial RHDV2 genomes on both farms. Phylogenetic analysis showed close clustering with RHDV2 lineages from Europe, in particular, 98.6% similarity with RHDV2 in the Netherlands, and 99.1 to 100% identity with RHDV2 in Germany, suggesting potential importation from Europe. The detection of twelve unique mutations in RHDV2 sequences from the Ibadan outbreak compared to other RHDV2 sequences in the same clade suggests significant genetic diversity of the GI.2 strains in Nigeria. This highlights the need to further understand the genetic diversity of Lagoviruses to, inform vaccine development, and for accurate tracking, monitoring, and control of outbreaks in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine signaling is thought to mediate reward-based learning. We tested for a role of dopamine in motor adaptation by administering the dopamine precursor levodopa to healthy participants in two experiments involving reaching movements. Levodopa has been shown to impair reward-based learning in cognitive tasks. Thus, we hypothesized that levodopa would selectively impair aspects of motor adaptation that depend on reinforcement of rewarding actions.\n\nIn the first experiment, participants performed two separate tasks in which adaptation was driven either by visual error-based feedback of the hand position or binary reward feedback. We used EEG to measure event-related potentials evoked by task feedback. We hypothesized that levodopa would specifically diminish adaptation and the neural responses to feedback in the reward learning task. However, levodopa did not affect motor adaptation in either task nor did it diminish event-related potentials elicited by reward outcomes.\n\nIn the second experiment, participants learned to compensate for mechanical force field perturbations applied to the hand during reaching. Previous exposure to a particular force field can result in savings during subsequent adaptation to the same force field or interference during adaptation to an opposite force field. We hypothesized that levodopa would diminish savings and anterograde interference, as previous work suggests that these phenomena result from a reinforcement learning process. However, we found no reliable effects of levodopa.\n\nThese results suggest that reward-based motor adaptation, savings, and interference may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms that have been shown to be disrupted by levodopa during various cognitive tasks.\n\nNew and NoteworthyMotor adaptation relies on multiple processes including reinforcement of successful actions. Cognitive reinforcement learning is impaired by levodopa-induced disruption of dopamine function. We administered levodopa to healthy adults who participated in multiple motor adaptation tasks. We found no effects of levodopa on any component of motor adaptation. This suggests that motor adaptation may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms as cognitive forms or reinforcement learning that have been shown to be impaired by levodopa.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) is a major leap towards personalized approaches to disease modelling and cell-replacement therapies. However, we still lack the ability to fully control the epigenetic status of iPSCs, which is a major hurdle for their downstream applications. A sensible indicator for epigenetic fidelity is genomic imprinting, a phenomenon dependent on DNA methylation, which is frequently perturbed in iPSCs by yet unidentified reasons. By using a secondary reprogramming system with murine hybrid donor cells, we conducted a thorough imprinting analysis using IMPLICON in multiple female and male iPSCs generated under different culture conditions. Our results show that imprinting defects are remarkably common in mouse iPSCs causing dysregulation of the typical monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. Interestingly, the nature of imprinting defects depends on the sex of the donor cell and their respective response to culture conditions. Under serum-free conditions, male iPSCs show global hypomethylation at imprinted regions, whereas in serum conditions show focal hypermethylation at specific loci. In contrast, female iPSCs always exhibit hypomethylation defects regardless of culture conditions. These imprinting defects are more severe than the global changes in DNA methylation, highlighting the sensitivity of imprinting loci to current iPSC generation protocols. Our results reveal clear predictors underlying different types of imprinting defects in mouse iPSCs. This knowledge is essential to devise novel reprogramming strategies aiming at generating epigenetically faithful iPSCs.",

Pleometrosis in ants - the cooperation of queens to found a colony - benefits colony growth, but also incurs costs for some of the cooperators because only one queen usually survives the association. While several traits are associated with queen survival, they tend to be confounded and it is unclear which factor specifically determines the outcome of pleometrosis. In this study, we used the ant Lasius niger to monitor offspring production in colonies founded by one or two queens. Then, we experimentally paired queens that differed in fecundity but not in size, and vice versa, to disentangle the effect of these factors on queen survival. Finally, we investigated how fecundity and size differed between queens depending on whether they were chosen as pleometrotic partners. Our results indicate that pleometrosis increased and accelerated worker production via a nutritional boost to the larvae. The most fecund queens more frequently survived the associations, even when controlling for size and worker parentage, and queens selected as pleometrotic partners were less fecund. Our results are consistent with fecundity being central to the onset and outcome of pleometrosis, a typical case of cooperation among unrelated animals.",

    "abstract": "In the burgeoning field of single-cell transcriptomics, a pressing challenge is to benchmark various experimental protocols and numerous computational methods in an unbiased manner. Although dozens of simulators have been developed for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, they lack the capacity to simultaneously achieve all the three goals: preserving genes, capturing gene correlations, and generating any number of cells with varying sequencing depths. To fill in this gap, here we propose scDesign2, a transparent simulator that achieves all the three goals and generates high-fidelity synthetic data for multiple scRNA-seq protocols and other single-cell gene expression count-based technologies. Compared with existing simulators, scDesign2 is advantageous in its transparent use of probabilistic models and is unique in its ability to capture gene correlations via copula. We verify that scDesign2 generates more realistic synthetic data for four scRNA-seq protocols (10x Genomics, CEL-Seq2, Fluidigm C1, and Smart-Seq2) and two single-cell spatial transcriptomics protocols (MERFISH and pciSeq) than existing simulators do. Under two typical computational tasks, cell clustering and rare cell type detection, we demonstrate that scDesign2 provides informative guidance on deciding the optimal sequencing depth and cell number in single-cell RNA-seq experimental design, and that scDesign2 can effectively benchmark computational methods under varying sequencing depths and cell numbers. With these advantages, scDesign2 is a powerful tool for single-cell researchers to design experiments, develop computational methods, and choose appropriate methods for specific data analysis needs.",

    "abstract": "The endogenous opioid system of the cerebral cortex is an important feature of antinociception and reward valuation through its modulation of inhibitory neocortical interneurons. Dysregulation of this system, through disease or drugs, disrupts the reward system and contributes to eating and mood disorders, impulsive actions, and addiction. Impulsive behaviors can be induced experimentally through infusion of the  opioid receptor specific agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin (DAMGO) into the frontal cortex in animal models. The mechanism involves increased potassium channel function, which suppresses neocortical interneuron activity. However, much of the data on the effect of this receptor on ion channels have been derived from noncortical ORs, and the identity and effects of the ion channels that the OR targets in neocortical neurons have not been thoroughly investigated. Based on previous experiments by other labs, we hypothesized that the OR could activate -dendrotoxin (DTX) sensitive channels (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 subunits) to exert its inhibitory effects in cortical interneurons. This, in turn, is expected to confer a variety of effects on passive and active electrical properties of the cell. We performed patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine the electrophysiological effects of ORs in cultured neocortical interneurons. We found that a range of features among the 54 membrane and action potential properties we analyzed were modulated by ORs, including action potential kinetics and frequency. The Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 inhibitor DTX reversed some effects on action potential frequency, but not effects on their kinetics. Therefore, ORs in neocortical interneurons influence DTX-sensitive channels, as well as other channels, to modulate action potential kinetics and firing properties.",

    "abstract": "Tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is particularly challenging in low-resource settings such as Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital (FPRRH) in Western Uganda. Specific knowledge of local AMR epidemiology is required to inform evidence-based improvement of antibiotic stewardship measures in the hospital. To address this, we combined existing antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) from FPRRH, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 41 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (2017-2019). AST revealed 73% (30/41) of isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics and 29% (12/41) were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Resistance phenotypes were largely explained by the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in WGS data. Five isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and MDR. Although all isolates were susceptible to clindamycin, a 24% carriage of erm genes suggests potential for rapid development of resistance. We inferred a population structure for the S. aureus isolates by comparing their core genomes. Twenty isolates formed a tight cluster corresponding to multilocus sequence typing clonal complex (CC) 152, a CC found to be particularly prevalent in northern Africa. The frequency of genes associated with methicillin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin resistance were significantly lower among CC152 strains than non-CC152 strains; thus, in keeping with previous work, we find that CC152 is almost exclusively methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Also, in agreement with other studies, we observed that the occurrence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin toxin-encoding genes was significantly higher among CC152 strains than non-CC152 strains. However, we also observed that the coagulase gene was over-represented in this CC, further defining the virulence strategy of this important pathogen. By generating detailed information about the epidemiology of circulating S. aureus and their antibiotic susceptibility, our study has provided, for the first time, data on which evidence-based infection and AMR interventions at FPRRH can be based.",

    "abstract": "The signaling events controlling proliferation, survival, and apoptosis during mammary epithelial acinar morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. By imaging single-cell ERK activity dynamics in MCF10A acini, we find that these fates depend on the average frequency of non-periodic ERK pulses. High pulse frequency is observed during initial acinus growth, correlating with rapid cell motility. Subsequent decrease in motility correlates with lower ERK pulse frequency and quiescence. Later, during lumen formation, coordinated ERK waves emerge across multiple cells of an acinus, correlating with high and low ERK pulse frequency in outer surviving and inner dying cells respectively. Optogenetic entrainment of ERK pulses causally connects high ERK pulse frequency with inner cell survival. Acini harboring the PIK3CA H1047R mutation, commonly observed in breast cancer, display increased ERK pulse frequency, inner cell survival and loss of lumen formation. Thus, fate decisions during acinar morphogenesis are fine-tuned by different spatio-temporal coordination modalities of ERK pulse frequency.",

The latter is typically ignored, since it is assumed that the population of spores which have reached the troposphere is small, and the fraction of the remaining spores that survived the subsequent journey is negligible due to ultraviolet light and frigid temperatures. However, we claim that it is in fact a crucial mechanism for continental-scale spread. We argue that free tropospheric currents can not be ignored, even as the probability for spores to reach them and to survive within them approaches zero. In other words, models that neglect tropospheric advection are fragile - their predictions change qualitatively if this alternative transport channel becomes accessible - even when the rate at which spores actually make use of this transport channel approaches zero.",

    "abstract": "The junctophilin family of proteins tether together plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and couple PM- and ER-localized calcium channels. Understanding in vivo functions of junctophilins is of great interest for dissecting the physiological roles of ER-PM contact sites. Here, we show that the sole C. elegans junctophilin JPH-1 localizes to discrete membrane contact sites in neurons and muscles and has important tissue-specific functions. jph-1 null mutants display slow growth and development due to weaker contraction of pharyngeal muscles, leading to reduced feeding. In the body wall muscle, JPH-1 co-localizes with the PM-localized EGL-19 voltage-gated calcium channel and ER-localized UNC-68/RyR calcium channel, and is required for animal movement. We also find an unexpected cell non-autonomous effect of jph-1 in axon regrowth after injury. In neurons, JPH-1 co-localizes with the membrane contact site protein Extended-SYnaptoTagmin 2 (ESYT-2) and modulates neurotransmission. Interestingly, jph-1 and esyt-2 null mutants display mutual suppression in their response to aldicarb, suggesting that JPH-1 and ESYT-1 have antagonistic roles in neuromuscular synaptic transmission. Our genetic double mutant analysis also reveals that jph-1 functions in overlapping pathways with two PM-localized voltage-gated calcium channels, egl-19 and unc-2, and unc-68/RyR for animal health and development. Finally, we show that unc-68/RyR is required for JPH-1 localization to ER-PM puncta. Our data demonstrate important roles for junctophilin in cellular physiology, and also provide insights into how junctophilin functions together with other calcium channels in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism is of central importance to diverse aspects of cell and developmental biology. Defects in mitochondria are associated with many diseases, including cancer, neuropathology, and infertility. Our understanding of mitochondrial metabolism in situ and dysfunction in diseases are limited by the lack of techniques to measure mitochondrial metabolic fluxes with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we developed a new method to infer mitochondrial metabolic fluxes in living cells with subcellular resolution from fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH. This result is based on the use of a generic coarse-grained NADH redox model. We tested the model in mouse oocytes and human tissue culture cells subject to a wide variety of perturbations by comparing predicted fluxes through the electron transport chain (ETC) to direct measurements of oxygen consumption rate. Interpreting the FLIM measurements of NADH using this model, we discovered a homeostasis of ETC flux in mouse oocytes: perturbations of nutrient supply and energy demand do not change ETC flux despite significantly impacting NADH metabolic state. Furthermore, we observed a subcellular spatial gradient of ETC flux in mouse oocytes and found that this gradient is primarily a result of heterogeneous mitochondrial proton leak. We concluded from these observations that ETC flux in mouse oocytes is not controlled by energy demand or supply, but by the intrinsic rates of mitochondrial respiration.",

    "abstract": "Understanding carbon flux-controlling mechanisms in a tangled metabolic network is an essential question of cell metabolism. Secondary metabolism, such as terpene biosynthesis, has evolved with low carbon flux due to inherent pathway constraints. Thraustochytrids are a group of heterotrophic marine unicellular protists, and can accumulate terpenoids under the high salt condition in their natural environment. However, the mechanism behind the terpene accumulation is not well understood. Here we show that terpene biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp. ATCC 26185 is constrained by local thermodynamics in the mevalonate pathway. Thermodynamic analysis reveals the metabolite limitation in the nondecarboxylative Claisen condensation of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA step catalyzed by the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT). Through a sodium elicited mechanism, higher respiration leads to increased ATP investment into the mevalonate pathway, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force for enhanced terpene biosynthesis. The proteomic analysis further indicates that the increased ATP demands are fulfilled by shifting energy generation from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism. This study demonstrates a unique strategy in nature using ATP to drive a low-flux metabolic pathway, providing an alternative solution for efficient terpene metabolic engineering.\n\nIMPORTANCETerpenoids are a large class of lipid molecules with important biological functions, and diverse industrial and medicinal applications. Metabolic engineering for terpene production has been hindered by the low flux distribution to its biosynthesis pathway. In practice, a high substrate load is generally required to reach high product titers. Here we show that the mevalonate-derived terpene biosynthesis is constrained by local pathway thermodynamics, which can only be partially relieved by increasing substrate levels. Through comparative proteomic and biochemical analyses, we discovered a unique mechanism for high terpene accumulation in marine protists thraustochytrids. Through a sodium induced mechanism, thraustochytrids shift their energy metabolism from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism for enhanced ATP production, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force for efficient terpene biosynthesis. This study reveals an important mechanism in eukaryotes to overcome the thermodynamic constraint in low-flux pathways by increased ATP consumption. Engineering energy metabolism thus provides an important alternative to relieve flux constraints in low-flux and energy-consuming pathways.",

Here, we optimized a high-selectivity DIA-MS named BoxCarmax that supports the analysis of complex samples, such as those generated from Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and pulse SILAC (pSILAC) experiments. BoxCarmax enables multiplexed acquisition at both MS1- and MS2-levels, through the integration of BoxCar and MSX features, as well as a gas-phase separation strategy. We found BoxCarmax modestly increased the identification rate for label-free and labeled samples but significantly improved the quantitative accuracy in SILAC and pSILAC samples. We further applied BoxCarmax in studying the protein degradation regulation during serum starvation stress in cultured cells, revealing valuable biological insights.

Our aim was to observe, through 3D Gait Analysis, the effect of different types of RAS (at a fixed frequency or based on the average cadence of each subject) on both gait spatio-temporal parameters and stability. The latter was estimated through an innovative measure, the trunk displacement index (TDI) that we have recently implemented. We observed that the low frequencies RAS led to a general slowdown of gait, which did not provide any clear benefit and produced harmful effects on stability when the frequency became too low compared to the individual natural frequency. On the contrary, the high frequencies of RAS showed a slight acceleration of gait, accompanied by better stability (as documented by a lower TDI value), regardless of the type of RAS. Finally, the RAS equal to the individual natural cadence also produced an increase in stability.",

    "abstract": "The findings from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) studies often show inconsistent and sometimes contradictory results due to small sample sizes as well as differences in acquisition parameters and pre-/post-processing methods. To address these challenges, collaborative multi-site initiatives have provided an opportunity to collect larger and more diverse groups of subjects, including those with neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to increased power and findings that may be more representative at the group and individual level. With the availability of these datasets openly, the ability of joint analysis of multi-site dMRI data has become more important than ever. However, intrinsic- or acquisition-related variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols, and reconstruction settings hinder pooling multi-site dMRI directly. One powerful and fast statistical harmonization method called ComBat (https://github.com/Jfortin1/ComBatHarmonization) was developed to mitigate the \"batch effect\" in gene expression microarray data and was adapted for multi-site dMRI harmonization to reduce scanner/site effect. Our goal is to evaluate this commonly used harmonization approach using a large diffusion MRI dataset involving 542 individuals from 5 sites. We investigated two important aspects of using ComBat for harmonization of fractional anisotropy (FA) across sites: First, we assessed how well ComBat preserves the inter-subject biological variability (measured by the effect sizes of between-group FA differences) after harmonization. Second, we evaluated the effect of minor differences in pre-processing on ComBats performance. While the majority of effect sizes are mostly preserved in some sites after harmonization, they are not well-preserved at other sites where non-linear scanner contributions exist. Further, even minor differences in pre-processing can yield unwanted effects during ComBat harmonization. Thus, our findings suggest paying careful attention to the data being harmonized as well as using the same processing pipeline while using ComBat for data harmonization.",

In mice, oxidative stress increases posttranslational modifications at parkin cysteines and reduces its solubility. Oxidation of recombinant parkin also promotes insolubility and aggregate formation, but in parallel, lowers hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This thiol-based redox activity is diminished by parkin point mutants, e.g., p.C431F and p.G328E. Intriguingly, in parkin-deficient human brain H2O2 concentrations are elevated. In prkn-null mice, H2O2 levels are dysregulated under oxidative stress conditions, such as acutely by MPTP-toxin exposure or chronically due to a second genetic hit. In dopamine toxicity studies, wild-type parkin, but not disease-linked mutants, protects human dopaminergic M17 cells, in part through lowering H2O2. Parkin also neutralizes reactive, electrophilic dopamine metabolites via adduct formation, which occurs foremost at primate-specific Cys95. Further, wild-type but not p.C95A-mutant parkin augments melanin formation. In sections of normal, adult human midbrain, parkin specifically co-localizes with neuromelanin pigment, frequently within LAMP-3/CD63+ lysosomes. We conclude that oxidative modifications of parkin cysteines are associated with protective outcomes, which include the reduction of H2O2, conjugation of reactive dopamine metabolites, sequestration of radicals within insoluble aggregates, and increased melanin formation. The loss of these redox effects may augment oxidative stress in dopamine producing neurons of mutant PRKN allele carriers, thereby contributing to neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two major constituents of cannabis with contrasting mechanisms of action. THC is the major psychoactive, addiction-promoting, and psychotomimetic compound, while CBD may have somewhat opposite effects. The brain effects of these drugs alone and in combination are poorly understood. In particular the striatum is implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, but it is unclear how THC and CBD influence striato-cortical connectivity. Across two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, we examine the effects of THC, CBD, and THC+CBD on the functional connectivity of striatal sub-divisions (associative, limbic, and sensorimotor) using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and seed-based functional connectivity analyses. Study 1 (N=17; inhaled 8mg THC, 8mg THC+10mg CBD, placebo) showed strong disruptive effects of both THC and THC+CBD conditions on connectivity in the associative and sensorimotor networks, but a specific effect of THC in the limbic striatum, which was alleviated in the THC+CBD condition such that it did not differ from placebo. In Study 2 (N=23, oral 600mg CBD, placebo) CBD increased connectivity in the associative network, but relatively minor decreases/disruptions were found in the limbic and sensorimotor. In conclusion, THC strongly disrupts striato-cortical networks, and this effect is selectively mitigated in the limbic striatum when co-administered with CBD. When administered alone, 600mg oral CBD has a more complex effect profile of relative increases and decreases in connectivity. The insula emerges as a key region affected by cannabinoid-induced changes in functional connectivity, with potential implications for understanding cannabis related disorders, and the development of cannabinoid therapeutics.",

When co-cultured with HGSC cell lines the NK-92 cell line acquired CD9 from tumor cells by trogocytosis with a resultant reduction in both anti-tumor cytokine production and cytotoxicity. Critically, a CD9 blocking antibody restored the killing activity of CD9+-NK-92 cells. These findings identify previously unrecognized mechanisms of immune suppression in HGSC.

    "abstract": "The diverse composition of mammalian tissues poses challenges for understanding the cell-cell interactions required for organ homeostasis and how spatial relationships are perturbed during disease. Existing methods such as single-cell genomics, lacking a spatial context, and traditional immunofluorescence, capturing only 2-6 molecular features, cannot resolve these issues. Imaging technologies have been developed to address these problems, but each possesses limitations that constrain widespread use. Here we report a new method that overcomes major impediments to highly multi-plex tissue imaging. Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX) uses an iterative staining and chemical bleaching method to enable high resolution imaging of >65 parameters in the same tissue section without physical degradation. IBEX can be employed with various types of conventional microscopes and permits use of both commercially available and user-generated antibodies in an  open system to allow easy adjustment of staining panels based on ongoing marker discovery efforts. We show how IBEX can also be used with amplified staining methods for imaging strongly fixed tissues with limited epitope retention and with oligonucleotide-based staining, allowing potential cross-referencing between flow cytometry, Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq), and IBEX analysis of the same tissue. To facilitate data processing, we provide an open source platform for automated registration of iterative images. IBEX thus represents a technology that can be rapidly integrated into most current laboratory workflows to achieve high content imaging to reveal the complex cellular landscape of diverse organs and tissues.\n\nSignificance StatementSingle cell flow cytometry and genomic methods are rapidly increasing our knowledge of the diversity of cell types in metazoan tissues. However, suitably robust methods for placing these cells in a spatial context that reveal how their localization and putative interactions contribute to tissue physiology and pathology are still lacking. Here we provide a readily accessible pipeline (IBEX) for highly multi-plex immunofluorescent imaging that enables a fine-grained analysis of cells in their tissue context. Additionally, we describe extensions of the IBEX workflow to handle hard to image tissue preparations and a method to facilitate direct integration of the imaging data with flow cytometry and sequencing technologies.",

In this work we propose an approach for extracting peptide sequence features that affect pMHC binding from such datasets. In the process we develop the theoretical framework for fitting and interpreting these features. We demonstrate that these features accurately capture the kinetics underlying pMHC binding, and can be used to predict pMHC binding well enough to rival the current state of the art. We then analyze the extracted factors and show that they correlate with our current structural understanding of MHC molecules.

    "abstract": "Type I interferons (IFNs) play an essential role in antiviral immunity, correlate with severity of systemic autoimmune disease, and are likely to represent a key component of mRNA vaccine-adjuvanticity. Relevant to all, type I IFNs can enhance germinal center (GC) B cell responses but underlying signaling pathways are incompletely understood due to pleiotropic effects in multiple cell types. Here, we demonstrate that a succinct type I IFN response promotes GC formation and associated IgG subclass distribution primarily through signaling in cDCs and B cells. Type I IFN signaling in cDCs, distinct from cDC1, stimulates development of separable Tfh and Th1 cell subsets. However, Th cell-derived IFN-{gamma} induces T-bet expression and IgG2c isotype switching prior to this bifurcation and has no evident effects once GCs and bona fide Tfh cells developed. This pathway acts in synergy with early B cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling, which reinforces T-bet expression in B cells and leads to a selective amplification of the IgG2c+ GC B cell response. Despite the strong Th1 polarizing effect of type I IFNs, the Tfh cell subset develops into IL-4 producing cells that control the overall magnitude of the GCs and promote generation of IgG1 + GC B cells. Thus, type I IFNs act on B cells and cDCs to drive GC formation and to coordinate IgG subclass distribution through parallel Th1 and Tfh cell-dependent pathways.",

    "abstract": "Humans have co-evolved with a dense community of microbial symbionts that inhabit the lower intestine. In the colon, secreted mucus creates a physical barrier that separates these microbes from the intestinal epithelium. Some gut bacteria are able to utilize mucin glycoproteins, the main mucus component, as a nutrient source. However, it remains unclear which bacterial enzymes initiate the degradation of the highly complex O-glycans found in mucins. In the colon, these glycans are heavily sulfated, but the specific sulfatases that are active on colonic mucins have not been identified. Here, we show that sulfatases are essential to the utilization of colonic mucin O-glycans by the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. We have characterized the activity of 12 different sulfatases encoded by this species, showing that these enzymes collectively are active on all of the known sulfate linkages in colonic O-glycans. Crystal structures of 3 enzymes provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of substrate-specificity. Unexpectedly, we found that a single sulfatase is essential for utilization of sulfated O-glycans in vitro and also plays a major role in vivo. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms of mucin degradation by gut bacteria, an important process for both normal microbial gut colonization and diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Sulfatase activity is likely to be a keystone step in bacterial mucin degradation and inhibition of these enzymes may therefore represent a viable therapeutic path for treatment of IBD and other diseases.",

Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1,262 metagenomes) and IBD (1,635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4,077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes.

By integrating spatial context and highly multiplexed transcriptional measurements with two single-cell transcriptome atlases we accurately characterize cell types across the embryo and demonstrate how spatially-resolved expression of genes not profiled by seqFISH can be imputed. We use this high-resolution spatial map to characterize fundamental steps in the patterning of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and the developing gut tube. Our spatial atlas uncovers axes of resolution that are not apparent from single-cell RNA sequencing data - for example, in the gut tube we observe early dorsal-ventral separation of esophageal and tracheal progenitor populations. In sum, by computationally integrating high-resolution spatially-resolved gene expression maps with single-cell genomics data, we provide a powerful new approach for studying how and when cell fate decisions are made during early mammalian development.",

We generated de novo reference genomes for five independently evolved parthenogenetic species in the stick insect genus Timema and their closest sexual relatives. Using these references in combination with population genomic data, we show that parthenogenesis results in an extreme reduction of heterozygosity, and often leads to genetically uniform populations. We also find evidence for less effective positive selection in parthenogenetic species, supporting the view that sex is ubiquitous in natural populations because it facilitates fast rates of adaptation. Contrary to studies of non-recombining genome portions in sexual species, genomes of parthenogenetic species do not accumulate transposable elements (TEs), likely because successful parthenogens derive from sexual ancestors with inactive TEs. Because we are able to conduct replicated comparisons across five species pairs, our study reveals, for the first time, how animal genomes evolve in the absence of sex in natural populations, providing empirical support for the negative consequences of parthenogenetic reproduction as predicted by theory.",

Some of the osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes, forming a cell network within the lacunocanalicular network (LCN) of bone. To get more insight into the potential role of osteocytes in the mineralization process of osteoid, sites of bone formation were three-dimensionally imaged in nine forming human osteons using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). In agreement with previous observations, the mineral concentration was found to gradually increase from the central Haversian canal towards preexisting mineralized bone. Most interestingly, a similar feature was discovered on a length scale more than 100-times smaller, whereby mineral concentration increased from the LCN, leaving around the canaliculi a zone virtually free of mineral, the size of which decreases with progressing mineralization. This suggests that the LCN controls mineral formation but not just by diffusion of mineralization precursors, which would lead to a continuous decrease of mineral concentration from the LCN. Our observation is, however, compatible with the codiffusion and reaction of precursors and inhibitors from the LCN into the bone matrix.",

Particular interest has been devoted to the commonly used polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and a number of PET hydrolases have been described. However, a kinetic framework for comparisons of PET hydrolases (or other plastic degrading enzymes) acting on the insoluble substrate, has not been established. Here, we propose such a framework and test it against kinetic measurements on four PET hydrolases. The analysis provided values of kcat and KM, as well as an apparent specificity constant in the conventional units of M-1s-1. These parameters, together with experimental values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface, enabled comparative analyses. We found that the PET hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis was the most efficient enzyme at ambient conditions, and that this relied on a high kcat rather than a low KM. Moreover, both soluble and insoluble PET fragments were consistently hydrolyzed much faster than intact PET. This suggests that interactions between polymer strands slow down PET degradation, while the chemical steps of catalysis and the low accessibility associated with solid substrate were less important for the overall rate. Finally, the investigated enzymes showed a remarkable substrate affinity, and reached half the saturation rate on PET, when the concentration of attack sites in the suspension was only about 50 nM. We propose that this is linked to nonspecific adsorption, which promotes the nearness of enzyme and attack sites.",

    "abstract": "ATP and its ionotropic P2X receptors are components of one of the most ancient signaling systems. However, little is known about the distribution and function of purinergic transmission in invertebrates. Here, we cloned, expressed, and pharmacologically characterized P2X receptors in the sea slug Aplysia californica - the prominent model in cellular and system neuroscience. These functional P2X receptors were successfully expressed in Xenopus oocytes and displayed activation by ATP (EC50=306 M) with two-phased kinetics as well as Na+-dependence. The ATP analog, Bz-ATP, was a less effective agonist (~20%) than ATP, and PPADS was a more potent inhibitor of the P2X receptors than the suramin. We showed that P2X receptors are uniquely expressed within Aplysias cerebral bioenergetic center (also known as F-cluster). Using RNA-seq, we found that the F-cluster contains more than a dozen unique secretory peptides, including three insulins, interleukins, and potential toxins, as well as ecdysone-type receptors and a district subset of ion channels. This structure is one of the most prominent integrative centers in the entire CNS and remarkably different from the morphologically similar neurosecretory center (bag cluster) involved in egg-laying behavior. Using RNA-seq, we also characterized the expression of P2X receptors across more than a dozen Aplysia peripheral tissues and developmental stages. We showed that P2X receptors are predominantly expressed in chemosensory structures and during early cleavage stages. The localization and pharmacology of P2X receptors in Aplysia highlight the evolutionary conservation of bioenergetic sensors and chemosensory purinergic transmission across animals. This study also provides a foundation to decipher homeostatic mechanisms in development and neuroendocrine systems.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/392001v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea3ab5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b45aadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad1851org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17abbc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG We show that ATP and its ligand-gated P2X receptors are essential signaling components within both the chemosensory systems and the unique integrative neurosecretory center, present in the CNS of the sea slug Aplysia - a prominent model in neuroscience.

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a contiguous and complicated membrane network in eukaryotic cells, and membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the ER and other organelles perform vital cellular functions, including lipid homeostasis, metabolite exchange, calcium level regulation, and organelle division. Here, we establish a whole pipeline to reconstruct all ER, mitochondria, lipid droplets, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and nuclei by automated tape-collecting ultramicrotome scanning electron microscopy (ATUM-SEM) and deep-learning techniques, which generates an unprecedented 3D model for mapping liver samples. Furthermore, the morphology of various organelles is systematically analyzed. We found that the ER presents with predominantly flat cisternae and is knitted tightly all throughout the intracellular space and around other organelles. In addition, the ER has a smaller volume-to-membrane surface area ratio than other organelles, which suggests that the ER could be more suited for functions that require a large membrane surface area. Moreover, the MCSs between the ER and other organelles are explored. Our data indicate that ER-mitochondrial contacts are particularly abundant, especially for branched mitochondria. In addition, ER contacts with lipid droplets, lysosomes, and peroxisomes are also plentiful. In summary, we design an efficient method for obtaining a 3D reconstruction of biological structures at a nanometer resolution. Our study also provides the first 3D reconstruction of various organelles in liver samples together with important information fundamental for biochemical and functional studies in the liver.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate action potentials in prokaryotes and in many eukaryotic cells, including vertebrate nerve and muscle. Their activation is steeply voltage-dependent, but it is unclear how the voltage sensitivity is set or whether it can be broadly shifted to positive voltages. Here we show that the voltage dependence of activation (VA) of the ancestral bacterial sodium channel NaVAb can be progressively shifted from -118 mV to +35 mV in chimeras with increasing numbers of amino acid residues from the extracellular half of the voltage sensor of human NaV1.7 channels. In a minimal chimera in which only 32 residues were transferred, we analyzed the effects of six additional mutations of conserved amino acid residues singly, in pairs, and as triple mutations. The resulting chimeric mutants exhibited a broad range of voltage sensitivity from VA=-118 mV to VA=+120 mV. Three mutations (N48K, L112A, and M119V) shifted VA to +61 mV when substituted in NaVAb itself, and substitution of two additional Cys residues in the Cys-free background of NaVAb further shifted VA to +105 mV. In these mutants, measurement of gating currents revealed that the voltage dependence of gating charge movement (VQ) shifted to positive membrane potentials as much or more than VA, confirming that the gating charges are trapped in their resting positions by these VA-shifting mutations. Our results demonstrate broadband shifting of VA and VQ of a sodium channel across a range of 240 mV and provide a toolbox of methods and constructs to analyze sodium channel structure and function in the resting state at 0 mV and in activated states at positive membrane potentials.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACTThe complete range of broadband tuning of voltage-dependent activation of a sodium channel.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=59 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/392571v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147c265org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2b8b15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b84b48org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1569072_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Many intracellular pathogens avoid detection by their host cells. However, it remains unknown how they avoid being tagged by ubiquitin, an initial step leading to anti-microbial autophagy. Here, we show that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Rickettsia parkeri uses two protein-lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) to modify outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and prevent their ubiquitylation. Mutants deficient in the PKMTs were avirulent in mice and failed to grow in macrophages due to ubiquitylation and autophagy. Analysis of the lysine-methylome revealed that PKMTs modify a subset of OMPs by methylation at the same sites that are recognized by host ubiquitin. These findings show that lysine methylation is an essential determinant of rickettsial pathogenesis that shields bacterial proteins from ubiquitylation to evade autophagic targeting.",
