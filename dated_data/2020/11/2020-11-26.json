    "abstract": "HIV persists, despite antiviral immune responses and effective antiretroviral therapy, in viral reservoirs that seed rebound viremia if therapy is interrupted. Previously, we showed that the BCL-2 protein contributes to HIV persistence by conferring a survival advantage to reservoir-harboring cells. Here, we demonstrate that many of the BCL-2 family members are overexpressed in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells, indicating increased tension between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival family members - as well as raising the possibility that the inhibition of pro-survival members may disproportionately affect the survival of HIV-infected cells. Based on these results, we chose to further study BCL2L1 (encoding the protein BCL-XL), due to its consistent overexpression and the availability of selective antagonists. Infection of primary CD4+ T-cells with either a clinical isolate, a CCR5-tropic strain, or a CXCR4-tropic strain of HIV resulted in increased BCL-XL protein expression; and treatment with two selective BCL-XL antagonists, A-1155463 and A-1551852, led to disproportionate cell death compared to uninfected CD4+ T-cells. In a primary cell model of latency, both BCL-XL antagonists drove significant reductions in total HIV DNA and in infectious cell frequencies both alone and in combination with the latency reversing agent bryostatin-1, with little off-target cytotoxicity. However, these antagonists, with or without bryostatin-1, or in combination with the highly potent latency reversing agent combination PMA + ionomycin, failed to reduce total HIV DNA and infectious reservoirs in ex vivo CD4+ T-cells from ART-suppressed donors. Our results add to growing evidence that bonafide reservoir-harboring cells are resistant to multiple \"kick and kill\" modalities - relative to latency models - and uncover BCL-XL antagonists as a facile approach to probing mechanistic underpinnings. We also interpret our results as encouraging of further exploration of BCL-XL antagonists for cure, where combination approaches may unlock the ability to eliminate ex vivo reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "It is important to understand the biogenesis of exosomes, extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin controlling cell-to-cell communication. We previously reported that Phospholipase D2 (PLD2) supports late endosome (LE) budding and the biogenesis of syntenin-dependent exosomes. Here, we reveal that PLD2 has a broader generic effect on exosome production. Combining gain- and loss-of-function experiments, proteomics, microscopy and lipid-binding studies with reconstituted liposomes mimicking LE, we show that: (i) PLD2 activity controls the recruitment of MVB12B to LE and the exosomal secretion of ESCRT-I; (ii) loss-of-MVB12B phenocopies loss-of-PLD2, similarly affecting LE budding, the number of exosomes released and exosome loading with cargo; (iii) MVB12B MABP domain directly interacts with phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD2. We therefore propose that PLD2 and phosphatidic acid support ESCRT-I recruitment to LE for the formation of exosomes. This work highlights a major unsuspected piece of the molecular framework supporting LE and exosome biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The adipocyte hormone leptin regulates glucose homeostasis both centrally and peripherally. A key peripheral target is the pancreatic {beta}-cell, which secretes insulin upon glucose stimulation. Leptin suppresses glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by promoting trafficking of KATP channels to the {beta}-cell surface, which increases K+ conductance and causes {beta}-cell hyperpolarization. Here we investigate the signaling mechanism underlying leptin-induced KATP channel translocation with a focus on protein kinase A (PKA). Using FRET-based PKA activity reporters, we show that leptin increases PKA activity at the cell membrane via a signaling pathway involving NMDA receptors, CaMKK{beta} and AMPK. Genetic knockdown and rescue experiments reveal that leptin activation of PKA requires tethering of PKA to the membrane-targeted PKA-anchoring protein AKAP79/150. Interestingly, disrupting protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) anchoring to AKAP79/150, known to elevate basal PKA signaling, increases surface KATP channels. Our findings uncover a novel role of AKAP79/150 in coordinating leptin and PKA signaling to regulate {beta}-cell function.",

    "abstract": "Conventional standing-wave (SW) fluorescence microscopy uses a single wavelength to excite fluorescence from the specimen, which is normally placed in contact with a first surface reflector. The resulting excitation SW creates a pattern of illumination with anti-nodal maxima at multiple evenly-spaced planes perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope. These maxima are approximately 90 nm thick and spaced 180 nm apart. Where the planes intersect fluorescent structures, emission occurs, but between the planes are non-illuminated regions which are not sampled for fluorescence. We evaluate a multi-excitation-wavelength SW fluorescence microscopy (which we call TartanSW) as a method for increasing the density of sampling by using SWs with different axial periodicities, to resolve more of the overall cell structure. The TartanSW method increased the sampling density from 50% to 98% over seven anti-nodal planes, with no notable change in axial or lateral resolution compared to single-excitation-wavelength SW microscopy. We demonstrate the method with images of the membrane and cytoskeleton of living and fixed cells.",

Sampling algorithms and energy functions for RNA structure prediction are improving, due to the increasing diversity of structural data available for training statistical potentials and testing structural data, along with a steady supply of blind challenges through the RNA Puzzles initiative. The recent FARFAR2 algorithm enables near-native structure predictions on fairly complex RNA structures, including automated selection of final candidate models and estimation of model accuracy. Here, we describe the use of a publicly available webserver for RNA modeling for realistic scenarios using FARFAR2, available at https://rosie.rosettacommons.org/farfar2. We walk through two cases in some detail: a simple model pseudoknot from the frameshifting element of beet western yellows virus modeled using the \"basic interface\" to the webserver, and a replication of RNA-Puzzle 20, a metagenomic twister sister ribozyme, using the \"advanced interface.\" We also describe example runs of FARFAR2 modeling including two kinds of experimental data: a c-di-GMP riboswitch modeled with low resolution restraints from MOHCA-seq experiments and a tandem GA motif modeled with 1H NMR chemical shifts.",

Unraveling the covalent modification landscape of histones and their defined stoichiometries within Nucs helps to explain epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. In nCZE-TDMS, online Nuc separation is followed by a three-tier tandem MS approach that measures the intact mass of Nucs, ejects and detects the constituent histones, and fragments to sequence the histone. The new platform was optimized with synthetic Nucs to reduce both sample requirements and cost significantly compared to direct infusion. Limits of detection were in the low attomole range, with linearity over ~three orders of magnitude. The nCZE-TDMS platform was applied to endogenous Nucs from two cell lines distinguished by overexpression or knockout of histone methyltransferase NSD2/MMSET, where analysis of constituent histones revealed changes in histone abundances over the course of the CZE separation. We are confident the nCZE-TDMS platform will help advance nucleosome-level research in the fields of chromatin and epigenetics.",

    "abstract": "Disaggregation and microtubule-severing nanomachines from the AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily assemble into ring-shaped hexamers that enable protein remodeling by coupling large-scale conformational changes with application of mechanical forces within a central pore by loops protruding within the pore. We probed these motions and intra-ring interactions that support them by performing extensive explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of single-ring severing proteins and the double-ring disaggregase ClpB. Simulations reveal that dynamic stability of hexamers of severing proteins and of the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) ring of ClpB, which belong to the same clade, involves a network of salt bridges that connect conserved motifs of central PL1 loops of the hexamer. Clustering analysis of ClpB highlights correlated motions of domains of neighboring protomers supporting strong inter-protomer collaboration. Severing proteins have weaker inter-protomer coupling and stronger intra-protomer stabilization through salt bridges formed between PL2 and PL3 loops. Distinct mechanisms are identified in the NBD2 ring of ClpB involving weaker inter-protomer coupling through salt bridges formed by non-canonical loops and stronger intra-protomer coupling. Pore width fluctuations associated with the PL1 constriction in the spiral states, in the presence of a substrate peptide, highlight stark differences between narrowing of channels of severing proteins and widening of the NBD1 ring of ClpB. This indicates divergent substrate processing mechanisms of remodeling and translocation by ClpB and substrate tail-end gripping and possible wedging on microtubule lattice by severing enzymes. Relaxation dynamics of the distance between the PL1 loops and the centers of mass of protomers reveals observation-time-dependent dynamics, leading to predicted relaxation times of tens of microseconds on millisecond experimental timescales. For ClpB the predicted relaxation time is in excellent agreement with the extracted time from smFRET experiments.",

ARGONAUTE10 (AGO10) is known to be critical for maintenance of the embryonic SAM by regulating the expression of Class III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors, which then modulate downstream responses to the key phytohormone auxin. However, we do not understand how AGO10 modulates auxin responses after embryogenesis in the mature plant.\n\nResultsHere we show that AGO10 regulates auxin responses in the post-embryonic SAM via the bHLH transcription factor INDEHISCENT (IND). IND directly regulates auxin responses in the SAM regulating the auxin transporter PIN1 via direct transcriptional regulation of PINOID kinase. We show that a loss of function ind mutation significantly restores ago10zwl-3 mutant SAM and fruit phenotypes. ago10zwl-3 mutants overexpress IND and overexpression of IND phenocopies the ago10zwl-3 SAM phenotypes, and regulates auxin transport and responses in the SAM. AGO10 also regulates post-embryonic development in the fruit via a similar genetic pathway.\n\nConclusionsWe characterise a molecular mechanism that is conserved during post embryonic development linking AGO10 directly to auxin responses.",

    "abstract": "In budding yeast and mammals, double strand breaks trigger global chromatin mobility together with the rapid phosphorylation of the histone H2A over an extensive region of the chromatin. To assess the role of H2A phosphorylation in this response to DNA damage, we have constructed strains where H2A has been mutated to the phospho-mimetic H2A-S129E. We show that H2A-S129E mutant increases global motion of chromosomes even in the absence of DNA damage. The intrinsic chromatin mobility of H2A-S129E is not due to checkpoint activation, histone degradation or kinetochore anchoring. Rather, the increased intra-chromosomal distances observed in H2A-S129E mutant are consistent with chromatin structural changes. In this context, the Rad953BP1-dependent-checkpoint becomes dispensable. The increase in chromatin dynamics is favorable to NHEJ of a single double-strand break but is accompanied by a sharp decrease in inter-chromosomal translocation rates. We propose that changes in chromosomal conformation due to H2A phosphorylation are sufficient to modulate the DDR and maintain genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesAberrant expression of apoptotic genes has been associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the past, however, their prognostic role and utility as biomarkers remains poorly understood.\n\nMaterials and methodsIn this study, we analysed 505 PTC patients by employing Cox-PH regression techniques, prognostic index models and machine learning methods to elucidate the relationship between overall survival (OS) of PTC patients and 165 apoptosis related genes.\n\nResultsIt was observed that nine genes (ANXA1, TGFBR3, CLU, PSEN1, TNFRSF12A, GPX4, TIMP3, LEF1, BNIP3L) showed significant association with OS of PTC patients. Five out of nine genes were found to be positively correlated with OS of the patients, while the remaining four genes were negatively correlated. These genes were used for developing risk prediction models. Our voting-based model achieved highest performance (HR=41.59, p=3.36x10-4, C=0.84, logrank-p=3.8x10-8). The performance of voting-based model improved significantly when we used the age of patients with prognostic biomarker genes and achieved HR=57.04 with p=10-4 (C=0.88, logrank-p=1.44x10-9). We also developed classification models that can classify high risk patients (survival [&le;] 6 years) and low risk patients (survival > 6 years). Our best model achieved AUROC of 0.92. Since these genes can also be used as potential therapeutic targets in PTC, we identified potential drug molecules which could modulate their expression profile.\n\nConclusionThis study briefly revealed the key prognostic biomarker genes in the apoptotic pathway whose altered expression is associated with PTC progression and aggressiveness. In addition to this, risk assessment models proposed here can help in efficient management of PTC patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIschaemic postconditioning (IPoC) has been shown to ameliorate ischaemia reperfusion injury in different species and tissues.\n\nObjectivesTo assess the feasibility of IPoC in equine small intestinal ischaemia and to assess its effect on histomorphology, electrophysiology and paracellular permeability.\n\nStudy designrandomized controlled terminal in vivo experiment\n\nMethodsExperimental jejunal ischaemia was induced for 90 min in horses under general anaesthesia. In the control group (C; n=7), the jejunum was reperfused without further intervention. In the postconditioning group (P; n=7), IPoC was implemented by clamping the mesenterial vessels after ischaemia. This was followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion in both groups. Intestinal microperfusion and oxygenation was measured during IPoC using spectrophotometry and Doppler fluxmetry. Histomorphology and histomorphometry of the intestinal mucosa were assessed. Furthermore, electrophysiological variables and unidirectional fluxrates of 3H-mannitol were determined in Ussing chambers. Western Blot analysis was performed to determine the tight junction protein levels of Claudin-1, Claudin-2 and Occludin in the intestinal mucosa. Comparisons between the groups and time points were performed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA or non-parametric statistical tests for the ordinal and not normally distributed data (significance p<0.05).\n\nResultsPostconditioning significantly reduced intestinal microperfusion during all clamping cycles, yet affected tissue oxygenation only during the first cycle. After reperfusion, group IPoC showed significantly less mucosal villus denudation (mean difference 21.5 %, p=0.02) and decreased mucosal-to-serosal fluxrates (mean difference 15.2 nM/cm2/h, p=0.007) compared to group C. There were no significant differences between the groups for the other tested variables.\n\nMain limitationssmall sample size, long term effects were not investigated.\n\nConclusionsFollowing ischaemic postconditioning, the intestinal mucosa demonstrated significantly less villus denudation and paracellular permeability compared to the untreated control group, possibly indicating a protective effect of IPoC on ischaemia reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "Here we propose that much of the magnetic interference observed when using optically pumped magnetometers can be modeled spatially as a mean (magnetic) field. We show that this approximation reduces sensor level variability and substantially improves statistical power. This model does not require knowledge of the underlying neuroanatomy nor the sensor positions. It only needs information about the sensor orientation. Due to the models low rank there is little risk of removing substantial neural signal. However, we provide a framework to assess this risk for any sensor number, design or subject neuroanatomy. We find that the risk of unintentionally removing neural signal is reduced when multi-axis recordings are performed. We validated the method using a binaural auditory evoked response paradigm and demonstrated that the mean field correction increases reconstructed SNR in relevant brain regions in both the spatial and temporal domain. Considering the models simplicity and efficacy, we suggest that this mean field correction can be a powerful preprocessing step for arrays of optically pumped magnetometers.",

    "abstract": "Premature birth is associated with high prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairments in surviving infants. The hippocampus is known to be critical for learning and memory, the putative role of hippocampus dysfunction remains poorly understood in preterm neonates. Particularly, hemispherical asymmetry of the hippocampus has been well-noted, either structurally or functionally. How the preterm birth impairs the hippocampal development, and to what extent the hippocampus was impaired by preterm birth asymmetrical has not been well studied. In this study, we compared regional and local hippocampal development in term born neonates (n=361) and prematurely born infants at term-born equivalent age on MRI studies (n = 53) using T2 MRI images collected from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP); We compared 1) volumetric growth; 2) shape development in the hippocampal hemispheres using Laplace-Beltrami eigen-projection and boundary deformation between the two groups; and 3) structural covariance between hippocampal vertices and the cortical thickness in cerebral cortex regions. We demonstrated that premature infants have smaller volume for the right hippocampi, while no difference was observed for the left hippocampi. Lower thickness was observed in the hippocampal head in both hemispheres for preterm neonates compared to full-term peers, while an accelerated hippocampal thickness growth rate was found in left hippocampus only. Structural covariance analysis demonstrated that in premature infants, the structural covariance between hippocampi and limbic lobe were severely impaired compared to healthy term neonates only in left hemisphere. These data suggest that the development of the hippocampus during the third trimester may be altered following early extrauterine exposure, with high degree of asymmetry. These findings suggested that the hippocampus shows high degree of vulnerability, particularly asymmetrical vulnerability or plasticity, in preterm neonates at the term-born equivalent age compared to full-term healthy controls.",

    "abstract": "We implemented a deep learning (DL) algorithm for the 3-dimensional segmentation of perivascular spaces (PVSs) in deep white matter (DWM) and basal ganglia (BG). This algorithm is based on an autoencoder and a U-shaped network (U-net), and was trained and tested using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large database of 1,832 healthy young adults. An important feature of this approach is the ability to learn from relatively sparse data, which gives the present algorithm a major advantage over other DL algorithms. Here, we trained the algorithm with 40 T1-weighted MRI datasets in which all \"visible\" PVSs were manually annotated by an experienced operator. After learning, performance was assessed using another set of 10 MRI scans from the same database in which PVSs were also traced by the same operator and were checked by consensus with another experienced operator. The Sorensen-Dice coefficients for PVS voxel detection in DWM (resp. BG) were 0.51 (resp. 0.66), and 0.64 (resp. 0.71) for PVS cluster detection (volume threshold of 0.5 within a range of 0 to 1). Dice values above 0.90 could be reached for detecting PVSs larger than 10 mm3 and 0.95 for PVSs larger than 15 mm3. We then applied the trained algorithm to the rest of the database (1,782 individuals). The individual PVS load provided by the algorithm showed a high agreement with a semi-quantitative visual rating done by an independent expert rater, both for DWM and for BG. Finally, we applied the trained algorithm to an age-matched sample from another MRI database acquired using a different scanner. We obtained a very similar distribution of PVS load, demonstrating the interoperability of this algorithm.",

    "abstract": "A diverse set of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) enable synaptic plasticity adaptations at inhibitory postsynaptic sites in collaboration with the scaffolding protein gephyrin. Early studies helped to identify distinctions between GABAAR subtypes allocated within specific functional circuits, but their contribution to the changing dynamics of a microcircuit remains unclear. Here, using the whisker-barrel system in mouse, we assessed the contribution of specific synaptic GABAAR subtypes and gephyrin scaffolding changes to sensory processing in vivo. We monitored spontaneous and evoked Ca2+ transients in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells with the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor RCaMP1.07. Using Gabra1 or Gabra2 global and conditional knockout mice, we uncovered that 1- and 2-GABAARs determine the sparseness of L2/3 pyramidal neuron encoding. In a cell-type dependent manner, 1-GABAARs and 2-GABAARs affected neuronal excitability and the reliability of neuronal responses after whisker stimulation. We also discerned that gephyrin with its diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs) shows preference for specific GABAAR subtype to facilitate microcircuit activity. Our results underscore the relevance of the diversity of GABAARs within a cortical microcircuit.\n\nKey pointsO_LIWhile GABAergic inhibition from interneuron subtypes regulates cortical microcircuit activity the molecular determinants have remain unclear.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that specific-GABAA receptor subtypes contribute differentially to layer 2/3 neuronal activities in mouse barrel cortex.\nC_LIO_LIImportantly, we link the GABAAR contributions to the scaffolding properties of its important postsynaptic density protein gephyrin.

    "abstract": "PurposeThe aim of the second quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) reconstruction challenge (Oct 2019, Seoul, Korea) was to test the accuracy of QSM dipole inversion algorithms in simulated brain data.\n\nMethodsA two-stage design was chosen for this challenge. The participants were provided with datasets of multi-echo gradient echo images synthesized from two realistic in silico head phantoms using an MR simulator. At the first stage, participants optimized QSM reconstructions without ground-truths available to mimic the clinical setting. At the second stage, ground-truths were provided for parameter optimization.Submissions were evaluated using eight numerical metrics and visual ratings.\n\nResultsA total of 98 reconstructions were submitted for stage 1 and 47 submissions for stage 2. Iterative methods had the best quantitative metric scores, followed by deep-learning and direct inversion methods. Priors derived from magnitude data improved the metric scores. Algorithms based on iterative approaches and Total Variation (and its derivatives) produced the best overall results. The reported results and analysis pipelines have been made public to allow researchers to compare new methods to the current state of the art.\n\nConclusionThe synthetic data provides a consistent framework to test the accuracy and robustness of QSM algorithms in the presence of noise, calcifications and minor voxel dephasing effects. Total Variation-based algorithmsproduced the best results along all metrics. Future QSM challenges should asses if this good performance with synthetic datasets translates to more realistic scenarios, where background fields and dipole-incompatible phase contributions are included.",

Advances in computing technology offer alternative cost-effective techniques which are less invasive and can discriminate between individuals based on visual and/or acoustic cues. Here, we employ human assessment and an automatic analytical approach to predict the identity of common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) females based on the appearance of their eggs. The cuckoos secretive brood parasitic strategy makes studying its life history very challenging. Eggs were analysed using calibrated digital photography for quantifying spotting pattern, size and shape, and spectrometry for measuring colour. Cuckoo females were identified from genetic sampling of their nestlings, allowing us to determine the accuracy of human and automatic female assignment. Finally, we used a novel  same-different approach that uses both genetic and phenotypic information to assign eggs that were not genetically analysed.\nC_LIO_LIOur results supported the  constant egg-type hypothesis, showing that individual cuckoo females lay eggs with a relatively constant appearance and that eggs laid by different females differ more than eggs laid by the same female. The accuracy of unsupervised hierarchical clustering was comparable to assessments of experienced human observers. Supervised random forest analysis showed better results, with higher cluster accuracy. Same-different analysis was able to assign 22 of 87 unidentified cuckoo eggs to seven already known females.\nC_LIO_LIOur study showed that egg appearance on its own is not sufficient for identification of individual cuckoo females. We therefore advocate genetic analysis to be used for this purpose. However, supervised analytical methods reliably assigned a relatively high number of eggs without genetic data to their mothers which can be used in conjunction with genetic testing as a cost-effective method for increasing sample sizes for eggs where genetic samples could not be obtained.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AimTimely and accurate information on population trends is a prerequisite for effective biodiversity conservation. Structured biodiversity monitoring programs have been shown to track population trends reliably, but require large financial and time investment. The data assembled in a large and growing number of online databases are less structured and suffer from bias, but the number of observations is much higher compared to structured monitoring programs. Model-based integration of data from these disparate sources could capitalize on their respective strengths.\n\nLocationGermany.\n\nMethodsAbundance data for 26 farmland bird species were gathered from the standardized Common Breeding Bird Survey (CBBS) and three online databases that varied with regard to their degree of survey standardization. Population trends were estimated with a benchmark model that included only CBBS data, and five Bayesian hierarchical models integrating all data sources in different combinations. Across models, we compared consistency and precision of the predicted population trends, and the accuracy of the models. Bird species body mass, prevalence in the dataset and abundance were tested as potential predictors of the explored quantities.\n\nResultsConsistency in predicted annual abundance indices was generally high especially when comparing the benchmark models to the integrated models without unstructured data. The accuracy of the estimated population changes was higher in the hierarchical models compared to the benchmark model but this was not related to data-integration. Precision of the predicted population trends increased as more data sources were integrated.\n\nMain conclusionsModel-based integration of data from different sources can lead to improved precision of bird population trend estimates. This opens up new opportunities for conservation managers to identify declining populations earlier. Integrating data from online databases could substantially increase sample size and thus allowing to derive trends for currently not well-monitored species, especially at sub-national scales.",

Here, using multiple samples from the same individuals we compared the mutational landscape in 29 anatomical structures from soma and the germline. Two ubiquitous mutational signatures, SBS1 and SBS5/40, accounted for the majority of acquired mutations in most cell types but their absolute and relative contributions varied substantially. SBS18, potentially reflecting oxidative damage, and several additional signatures attributed to exogenous and endogenous exposures contributed mutations to subsets of cell types. The mutation rate was lowest in spermatogonia, the stem cell from which sperm are generated and from which most genetic variation in the human population is thought to originate. This was due to low rates of ubiquitous mutation processes and may be partially attributable to a low cell division rate of basal spermatogonia. The results provide important insights into how mutational processes affect the soma and germline.",

Firstly, a risk stratification model has been developed using biomarker genes selected using a network-based approach and achieved HR=1.37 with p=0.294. Secondly, we developed a risk stratification model using biomarker of seven genes obtained from clustering and achieved HR=9.14 and p= 1.49x10-12. Finally, we developed various combinatorial models using biomarker of 15 PRR genes that were significantly associated with UCEC survival. We found that a multiple genes-based risk stratification model using nine genes (CLEC1B, CLEC3A, IRF7, CTSB, FCN1, RIPK2, NLRP10, NLRP9 and SARM1) gave the best result (HR=10.70, p=1.1x10-12, C=0.76, log-rank-p=8.15x10-14). The performance of this model improved significantly when we used the clinical stage of patients in combination with the expression of nine genes and achieved HR=15.23 (p=2.21x10-7, C=0.78, log-rank-p=2.76x10-17). We also developed classification models that can classify high-risk patients (survive [&le;] 4.3 years) and low-risk patients (survive > 4.3 years) and achieved AUROC of 0.86. It was observed that specific genes are positively correlated with overall survival of UCEC patients. Based on these observations, we identified potential immunotherapeutic agents for treating UCEC patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong reads have gained popularity in the analysis of metagenomics data. Therefore, we comprehensively assessed metagenomics classification tools on the species taxonomic level. We analysed kmer-based tools, mapping-based tools and two general-purpose long reads mappers. We evaluated more than 20 pipelines which use either nucleotide or protein databases and selected 13 for an extensive benchmark. We prepared seven synthetic datasets to test various scenarios, including the presence of a host, unknown species and related species. Moreover, we used available sequencing data from three well-defined mock communities, including a dataset with abundance varying from 0.0001% to 20% and six real gut microbiomes.\n\nResultsGeneral-purpose mappers Minimap2 and Ram achieved similar or better accuracy on most testing metrics than best-performing classification tools. They were up to ten times slower than the fastest kmer-based tools requiring up to four times less RAM. All tested tools were prone to report organisms not present in datasets, except CLARK-S, and they underperformed in the case of the high presence of the hosts genetic material. Tools which use a protein database performed worse than those based on a nucleotide database. Longer read lengths made classification easier, but due to the difference in read length distributions among species, the usage of only the longest reads reduced the accuracy.\n\nThe comparison of real gut microbiome datasets shows a similar abundance profiles for the same type of tools but discordance in the number of reported organisms and abundances between types. Most assessments showed the influence of database completeness on the reports.\n\nConclusionThe findings indicate that kmer-based tools are well-suited for rapid analysis of long reads data. However, when heightened accuracy is essential, off-the-shelf mappers demonstrate slightly superior performance, albeit at a considerably slower pace. Nevertheless, a combination of diverse categories of tools and databases will likely be necessary to analyse complex samples. Discrepancies observed among tools when applied to real gut datasets, as well as a reduced performance in cases where unknown species or a significant proportion of the host genome is present in the sample, highlight the need for continuous improvement of existing tools. Additionally, regular updates and curation of databases are important to ensure their effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression through multiple epigenetic components is a highly combinatorial process. Alterations in any of these layers, as is commonly found in cancer diseases, can lead to a cascade of downstream effects on tumor suppressor or oncogenes. Hence, deciphering the effects of epigenetic alterations on regulatory elements requires innovative computational approaches that can benefit from the huge amounts of epigenomic datasets that are available from multiple consortia, such as Roadmap or BluePrint. We developed a software tool named Irene (Integrative Ranking of Epigenetic Network of Enhancers), which performs quantitative analyses on differential epigenetic modifications through an integrated, network-based approach. The method takes into account the additive effect of alterations on multiple regulatory elements of a gene. Applying this tool to well-characterized test cases, it successfully found many known cancer genes from publicly available cancer epigenome datasets.",

    "abstract": "Sandy pitfall traps are an elaborate construction to capture prey and antlions are well-known representatives of this predation technique. From a soil mechanical perspective, antlions exploit the interactions between the particles of their habitat and engineer a stable trap. This construction is close to the unstable state, where a prey item will immediately slide towards the center - towards the ambushing antlion - when accidently entering the trap. This method is efficient, but requires permanent pit maintaining. According to the present knowledge, antlions throw sand at their prey, to distract it, and/or cause sand slides towards the center of the pit. Using sand throwing and escape experiments, as well as finite element analysis, we supported this hypothesis. Furthermore, we added new hypothesis about maintaining the pitfall trap. We showed that sand that accumulates in the center of the pit will be continuously removed, which lead to the slope maintenance close to an unstable condition. This avoids self-burial of the antlion, as well as decreasing the chance of prey item escapes by keeping the slope angle steep. This demonstrates the interaction of an insect larva with its abiotic environment from a novel perspective and adds further insights into longstanding entomological hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "During goal-directed movements, the magnitude of error correction by a person on a subsequent movement provides important insight into a persons motor learning dynamics. Observed differences in trial-by-trial adaptation rates might indicate different relative weighting placed on the various sources of information that inform a movement, e.g. sensory feedback, control predictions, or internal model expectations. Measuring this trial-by-trial adaptation rate is not straightforward, however, since externally observed data are masked by noise from several sources and influenced by inaccessible internal processes. Adaptation to perturbation has been used to measure error adaptation as the introduced external disturbance is sufficiently large to overshadow other noise sources. However, perturbation analysis is difficult to implement in real-world scenarios, requires a large number of movement trials to accommodate infrequent perturbations, and the paradigm itself might affect the movement dynamics being observed. Here we focus on error adaptation during unperturbed and naturalistic movements. With increasing motor noise, the conventional estimation of trial-by-trial adaptation increases, a counterintuitive finding that is the consequence of systematic bias in the estimate due to noise masking the learners intention. We present an analytic solution relying on stochastic signal processing to reduce this effect of noise, producing an estimate of motor adaptation with reduced bias. The result is an improved estimate of trial-by-trial adaptation in a human learner compared to conventional methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method in analyzing simulated and empirical movement data under different noise conditions. The analytic approach is applicable across different types of movements in varied contexts and should replace the regression analysis method in future motor analysis studies.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhen a person makes a movement, a motor error is typically observed that then drives motor planning corrections on subsequent movements. This error correction provides insight into how the nervous system is operating, particularly in regard to how much confidence a person places in different sources of information such as sensory feedback or motor command reproducibility. Traditional analysis of movement has required carefully controlled laboratory conditions, limiting the usefulness of motor analysis in clinical and everyday environments. Here we present a new computational method that can be accurately applied to typical movements. Counterintuitive findings of the established approach are corrected by the proposed method. This method will provide a common framework for researchers to analyze movements while extending dynamic motor adaptation analysis capabilities to clinical and non-laboratory settings.",

    "abstract": "Subjective visual experience builds on sensory encoding of light reflected by different objects in our environment. Most retinal ganglion cells encode changes in light intensity, quantified as contrast, rather than the absolute intensity. Mathematically, contrast is often defined as a relative change in light intensity. Activity in the visual system and perceptual responses are usually explained with such definitions of contrast. Here, for the first time, we explicitly explored how contrast is actually represented in the visual system. Using mouse retina electrophysiology, we show that response strength of OFF retinal ganglion cells does not represent relative, but absolute changes in light intensity. ON RGC response strength is governed by a combination of absolute and relative change in light intensity. This is true for a wide range of ambient light levels, at least from scotopic to high mesopic regimes. Consequently, light decrements and increments are represented asymmetrically in the retina, which may explain the asymmetries in responses to negative and positive contrast observed throughout the visual system. These findings may help to more thoroughly design and interpret vision science studies where responses are driven by contrast of the visual stimuli.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how the brain orchestrates information from multiple input streams into a unified conscious experience. Here, we address two fundamental questions: how is the human information-processing architecture functionally organised, and how does its organisation support consciousness? We combine network science and a rigorous information-theoretic notion of synergy to delineate a \"synergistic global workspace\", comprising gateway regions that gather synergistic information from specialised modules across the brain. This information is then integrated within the workspace and widely distributed via broadcaster regions. Through functional MRI analysis, we show that gateway regions of the synergistic workspace correspond to the brains default mode network, whereas broadcasters coincide with the executive control network. Demonstrating the empirical relevance of our proposed architecture for neural information processing, we show that loss of consciousness due to general anaesthesia or disorders of consciousness corresponds to a diminished ability of the synergistic workspace to integrate information, which is restored upon recovery. Thus, loss of consciousness coincides with a breakdown of information integration within the synergistic workspace of the human brain. This work contributes to conceptual and empirical reconciliation between two prominent scientific theories of consciousness, the Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory. Taken together, this work provides a new perspective on the role of prominent resting-state networks within the human information-processing architecture, while also advancing our understanding of how the human brain supports consciousness through the synergistic integration of information.",

Nuclear sequence data is increasingly being used to complement mitochondrial datasets for phylogenetic and evolutionary investigations; these studies would benefit from information regarding the rate and pattern of DNA substitutions derived from the nuclear genome. To estimate this genomewide neutral mutation rate (), genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) datasets were generated for three transisthmian species pairs in Alpheus snapping shrimp. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach (G-PhoCS) applied to 44,960 GBS loci, we estimated  to be 2.64E-9 substitutions/site/year, when calibrated with the closure of the CAS at 3 Ma. This estimate is remarkably similar to experimentally derived mutation rates in model arthropod systems, strengthening the argument for a recent closure of the CAS.

    "abstract": "An epigenetic basis for transgenerational plasticity is widely theorized, but convincing empirical support is limited by taxa-specific differences in the presence and role of epigenetic mechanisms. In teleost fishes, DNA methylation generally does not undergo extensive reprogramming and has been linked with environmentally-induced intergenerational effects, but solely in the context of early life environmental differences. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, we demonstrate that differential methylation of sperm occurs in response to captivity during the maturation of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar), a species of major economic and conservation significance. We show that adult captive exposure further induces differential methylation in an F1 generation that is associated with fitness-related phenotypic differences. Genes targeted with differential methylation were consistent with genes differential methylated in other salmonid fishes experiencing early-life hatchery rearing, as well as genes under selection in domesticated species. Our results support a mechanism of transgenerational plasticity mediated by intergenerational inheritance of DNA methylation acquired late in life for salmon. To our knowledge, this is the first-time environmental variation experienced later in life has been directly demonstrated to influence gamete DNA methylation in fish.",

We characterized 72 individuals sampled across eight forests through nuclear and mitochondrial restriction associated sequencing data (RADseq) and chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSR).

    "abstract": "The development of targeted treatment options for precision medicine is hampered by a slow and costly process of drug screening. While small molecule docking simulations are often applied in conjunction with cheminformatic methods to reduce the number of candidate molecules to be tested experimentally, the current approaches suffer from high false positive rates and are computationally expensive. Here, we present a novel in silico approach for drug discovery and repurposing, dubbed connectivity enhanced Structure Activity Relationship (ceSAR) that improves on current methods by combining docking and virtual screening approaches with pharmacogenomics and transcriptional signature connectivity analysis. ceSAR builds on the landmark LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of over 20,000 drug-like molecules and ~5,000 gene knock-downs (KDs) to connect small molecules and their potential targets. For a set of candidate molecules and specific target gene, candidate molecules are first ranked by chemical similarity to their  concordant LINCS analogs that share signature similarity with a knock-down of the target gene. An efficient method for chemical similarity search, optimized for sparse binary fingerprints of chemical moieties, is used to enable fast searches for large libraries of small molecules. A small subset of candidate compounds identified in the first step is then re-scored by combining signature connectivity with docking simulations. On a set of 20 DUD-E benchmark targets with LINCS KDs, the consensus approach reduces significantly false positive rates, improving the median precision 3-fold over docking methods at the extreme library reduction. We conclude that signature connectivity and docking provide complementary signals, offering an avenue to improve the accuracy of virtual screening while reducing run times by multiple orders of magnitude.",

Here, we propose the construction of searchable graph representations of metabolic networks. Each reaction is decomposed into pairs of reactants and products, and each pair is assigned a weight, which is calculated from the number of conserved atoms between the reactant and the product molecule. We test our method on a biochemical network that spans 6,546 known enzymatic reactions to show how our approach elegantly extracts biologically relevant metabolic pathways from biochemical networks, and how the proposed network structure enables the application of efficient graph search algorithms that improve navigation and pathway identification in big metabolic networks. The weighted reactant-product pairs of an example network and the corresponding graph search algorithm are available online. The proposed method extracts metabolic pathways fast and reliably from big biochemical networks, which is inherently important for all applications involving the engineering of metabolic networks.",

    "abstract": "The advancements in genome editing techniques over the past years have rekindled interest in rational metabolic engineering strategies. While Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) is a well-established method for quantifying the effects of metabolic engineering interventions on flows in metabolic networks and metabolic concentrations, it fails to account for the physiological limitations of the cellular environment and metabolic engineering design constraints. We report here a constraint-based framework based on MCA, Network Response Analysis (NRA), for the rational genetic strain design that incorporates biologically relevant constraints, as well as genome editing restrictions. The NRA core constraints being similar to the ones of Flux Balance Analysis, allow it to be used for a wide range of optimization criteria and with various physiological constraints. We show how the parametrization and introduction of biological constraints enhance the NRA formulation compared to the classical MCA approach, and we demonstrate its features and its ability to generate multiple alternative optimal strategies given several user-defined boundaries and objectives. In summary, NRA is a sophisticated alternative to classical MCA for rational metabolic engineering that accommodates the incorporation of physiological data at metabolic flux, metabolite concentration, and enzyme expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Despite a growing understanding of how environmental composition affects microbial community properties, it remains difficult to apply this knowledge to the rational design of synthetic multispecies consortia. This is because natural microbial communities can harbor thousands of different organisms and environmental substrates, making up a vast combinatorial space that precludes exhaustive experimental testing and computational prediction. Here, we present a method based on the combination of machine learning and dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) that selects optimal environmental compositions to produce target community phenotypes. In this framework, dFBA is used to model the growth of a community in candidate environments. A genetic algorithm is then used to evaluate the behavior of the community relative to a target phenotype, and subsequently adjust the environment to allow the organisms to more closely approach this target. We apply this iterative process to in silico communities of varying sizes, showing how it can rapidly identify environments that yield desired phenotypes. Moreover, this novel combination of approaches produces testable predictions for the in vivo assembly of microbial communities with specific properties, and can facilitate rational environmental design processes for complex microbiomes.",

Despite many efforts, very little progress has been made regarding finding low-cost oral medicines that can be made widely available worldwide to address the global pandemic.\n\nMethodsWe sought to examine if a triple combination of nitazoxanide (using its active metabolite tizoxanide), ribavirin, and hydroxychloroquine would lead to a multiplicative effects on viral replication of SARS-COV-2 resulting in a significant reduction of virus yield using VERO E6 cells as a model of viral replication.\n\nResultsVirus yield measured in PFU/ml was ~ 2 logs lower with triple combination versus either drug alone, resulting in the prolongation of time to peak cytopathic effects (CPE). The time to produce 50% CPE increased from 2.8 days for viral controls versus 5.3 days for triple combination therapy. Finally, for each 1-log reduction in virus yield 24 hours post-infection, there was an additional 0.7-day delay in onset of CPE.\n\nConclusionsA triple combination of tizoxanide, ribavirin, and hydroxychloroquine produced a reduction in SARS-COV-2 viral replication in Vero E6 cells, warranting exploration in additional cell lines as well as human clinical trials.",

To improve treatment options, we conducted a high-throughput drug repurposing screen to uncover compounds that block the viral activity of SARS-CoV-2.

Comprehensive profiling was conducted on more than 600 compounds, with each compound arrayed at 10 dose points (ranging from 20 M to 1 nM). Our screening revealed several FDA-approved agents that act as novel antivirals that block both OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, including lapatinib, doramapimod, and 17-AAG. Importantly, lapatinib inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication by over 50,000-fold without any toxicity and at doses readily achievable in human tissues. Further, both lapatinib and doramapimod could be combined with remdesivir to dramatically improve antiviral activity in cells. These findings reveal novel treatment options for people infected with SARS-CoV-2 that can be readily implemented during the pandemic.",

Here, we examine patterns of signed LD in two population genomic datasets, one from Capsella grandiflora and one from Drosophila melanogaster. We consider how processes such as drift, admixture, Hill-Robertson interference, and epistasis may contribute to these patterns. We report that most types of mutations exhibit positive LD, particularly, if they are predicted to be less deleterious. We show with simulations that this pattern arises easily in a model of admixture or distance biased mating, and that genome-wide differences across site types are generally expected due to differences in the strength of purifying selection even in the absence of epistasis. We further explore how signed LD decays on a finer scale, showing that loss of function mutations exhibit particularly positive LD across short distances, a pattern consistent with intragenic antagonistic epistasis. Controlling for genomic distance, signed LD in C. grandiflora decays faster within genes, compared to between genes, likely a by-product of frequent recombination in gene promoters known to occur in plant genomes. Finally, we use information from published biological networks to explore whether there is evidence for negative synergistic epistasis between interacting radical missense mutations. In D. melanogaster networks, we find a modest but significant enrichment of negative LD, consistent with the possibility of intra-network negative synergistic epistasis.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWConjugative transfer is a major threat to global health since it contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors among commensal and pathogenic bacteria. To allow their transfer, mobile genetic elements including Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) use a specialized conjugative apparatus related to Type IV secretion systems (Conj-T4SS). Therefore, Conj-T4SSs are excellent targets for strategies that aim to limit the spread of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we combined structural, biochemical and biophysical approaches to study OrfG, a protein that belongs to Conj-T4SS of ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus. Structural analysis of OrfG by X-ray crystallography revealed that OrfG central domain is similar to VirB8-like proteins but displays a different quaternary structure in the crystal. To understand, at a structural level, the common and the diverse features between VirB8-like proteins from both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, we used an in silico structural alignment method that allowed us to identify different structural classes of VirB8-like proteins. Biochemical and biophysical characterizations of purified OrfG soluble domain and its central and C-terminal subdomains indicated that they are mainly monomeric in solution but able to form an unprecedented 6-mer oligomers. Our study provides new insights into the structural and assembly mode of VirB8-like proteins, a component essential for conjugative transfer and improves our understanding on these under-examined bacterial nanomachines.",

    "abstract": "Lymphocyte homeostasis, activation and differentiation crucially rely on basal autophagy. The fine-tuning of this process depends on autophagy-related (ATG) proteins and their interaction with the trafficking machinery that orchestrates the membrane rearrangements leading to autophagosome biogenesis. The underlying mechanisms are as yet not fully understood. The intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, known for its role in cargo transport along the axonemal microtubules of the primary cilium, has emerged as a regulator of autophagy in ciliated cells. Growing evidence indicates that ciliogenesis proteins participate in cilia-independent processes, including autophagy, in the non-ciliated T cell. Here we investigate the mechanism by which IFT20, an integral component of the IFT system, regulates basal T cell autophagy. We show that IFT20 interacts with the core autophagy protein ATG16L1 through its CC domain, which is also essential for its pro-autophagic activity. We demonstrate that IFT20 is required for the association of ATG16L1 with the Golgi complex and early endosomes, both of which have been identified as membrane sources for phagophore elongation. This involves the ability of IFT20 to interact with proteins that are resident at these subcellular localizations, namely the golgin GMAP210 at the Golgi apparatus and Rab5 at early endosomes. GMAP210 depletion, while leading to a dispersion of ATG16L1 from the Golgi, did not affect basal autophagy. Conversely, IFT20 was found to recruit ATG16L1 to early endosomes tagged for autophagosome formation by the BECLIN 1/VPS34/Rab5 complex, which resulted in the local accumulation of LC3. Hence IFT20 participates in autophagosome biogenesis under basal conditions by regulating the localization of ATG16L1 at early endosomes to promote autophagosome biogenesis. These data identify IFT20 as a new regulator of an early step of basal autophagy in T cells.",

Human milk also contains a plethora of bioactive molecules, including a large set of human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs). Especially fucosylated hMOs have received attention for their anti-adhesive effects on pathogens by preventing attachment to the intestinal wall. Because hMOs are generally challenging to produce in sufficient quantities to study and ultimately apply in (medical) infant formula, hMO mimics are interesting compounds to produce and evaluate for their biological effects.\n\nMethods and resultsWe investigated the digestion, fermentation, and pathogen anti-adhesive capacity of the novel hMO mimic di-fucosyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (DF{beta}CD). We establish that DF{beta}CD is not digested by -amylase and also resists fermentation by the microbiota from a 9 month-old infant. In addition, we reveal that DF{beta}CD blocks adhesion of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) to Caco-2 cells, especially when DF{beta}CD is pre-incubated with ETEC prior to addition to the Caco-2 cells.\n\nConclusionOur results suggests that DF{beta}CD functions through a decoy effect. We expect that our results inspire the generation and biological evaluation of other fucosylated hMOs and mimics, to obtain a comprehensive overview of the anti-adhesive power of fucosylated glycans.",

Here, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing combined with the DiCre/LoxP system to investigate how the PfHP1 chromodomain (CD), hinge domain and chromoshadow domain (CSD) contribute to overall PfHP1 function. We show that the C-terminal 76 residues are responsible for targeting PfHP1 to the nucleus. Furthermore, we reveal that each of the three functional domains of PfHP1 are required for heterochromatin formation, gene silencing and mitotic parasite proliferation. Finally, we discovered that the hinge and CSD domains of HP1 are functionally conserved between P. falciparum and P. berghei, a related malaria parasite infecting rodents. In summary, our study provides new insights into PfHP1 function and offers a tool for further studies on epigenetic regulation and life cycle decision in malaria parasites.",

    "abstract": "Denitrifier community phenotypes often result in transient accumulation of denitrification (NO3-[-&gt;]NO2-[-&gt;]NO[-&gt;]N2O[-&gt;]N2) intermediates. Consequently, anoxic spells drive NO-, N2O- and possibly HONO-emissions to the atmosphere, affecting both climate and tropospheric chemistry. Soil pH is a key controller of intermediate levels, and while there is a clear negative correlation between pH and emission of N2O, NO2- concentrations instead increase with pH. These divergent trends are probably a combination of direct effects of pH on the expression/activity of denitrification enzymes, and an indirect effect via altered community composition. This was studied by analyzing metagenomics/transcriptomics and phenomics of two soil denitrifier communities, one of pH 3.8 (Soil3.8) and the other 6.8 (Soil6.8). Soil3.8 had severely delayed N2O reduction despite early transcription of nosZ, encoding N2O reductase, by diverse denitrifiers, and of several nosZ accessory genes. This lends support to a post-transcriptional, pH-dependent mechanism acting on the NosZ apo-protein or on enzymes involved in its maturation. Metagenome/metatranscriptome reads of nosZ were almost exclusively clade I in Soil3.8 while clade II dominated in Soil6.8. Reads of genes and transcripts for NO2--reductase were dominated by nirK over nirS in both soils, while qPCR-based determinations showed the opposite, demonstrating that standard primer pairs only capture a fraction of the nirK community. The -omics results suggested that low NO2- concentrations in acidic soils, often ascribed to abiotic degradation, are primarily due to enzymatic activity. The NO reductase gene qnor was strongly expressed in Soil3.8, suggesting an important role in controlling NO. Production of HONO, for which some studies claim higher, others lower, emissions from NO2- accumulating soil, was estimated to be ten times higher from Soil3.8 than from Soil6.8. The study extends our understanding of denitrification-driven gas emissions and the diversity of bacteria involved and demonstrates that gene and transcript quantifications cannot always reliably predict community phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "More than 30,000 tons of menthol are produced every year as a flavor and fragrance compound or as medical component. So far, only extraction from plant material or chemical synthesis is possible. A sustainable alternative approach for menthol production could be a biotechnological-chemical two-step conversion, starting from (+)-limonene, which is a side product of the citrus processing industry. The first step requires a limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3H) activity that specifically catalyzes hydroxylation of limonene at carbon atom 3. Several protein engineering strategies already attempted to create limonene-3-hydroxylases from bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs or P450s), which can be efficiently expressed in bacterial hosts. However, their regiospecificity is rather low, if compared to the highly selective L3H enzymes from the biosynthetic pathway towards menthol in Mentha species. The only naturally occurring limonene-3-hydroxylase activity identified in microorganisms so far, was reported for a strain of the black yeast-like fungus Hormonema sp. in South Africa.\n\nWe have discovered further fungi that can catalyze the intended reaction and identified potential CYP-encoding genes within the genome sequence of one of the strains. Using heterologous gene expression and biotransformation experiments in yeasts, we were able to identify limonene-3-hydroxylases from Aureobasidium pullulans and Hormonema carpetanum. Further characterization of the A. pullulans enzyme demonstrated its high stereospecificity and regioselectivity, its potential for limonene-based menthol production and its additional ability to convert -and {beta}-pinene to verbenol and pinocarveol, respectively.\n\nImportance(-)-Menthol is an important flavor and fragrance compound and furthermore has medicinal uses. To realize a two-step synthesis starting from renewable (+)-limonene, a regioselective limonene-3-hydroxylase enzyme is necessary. We identified enzymes from two different fungi, which catalyze this hydroxylation reaction and represent an important module for the development of a biotechnological process for (-)-menthol production from renewable (+)-limonene.",

    "abstract": "In parallel with the expansion of RNA interference techniques evidence has been accumulating that RNAi analyses may be seriously biased due to off-target effects of gene-specific shRNAs. Our work points to another possible source of misinterpretations of shRNA-based data - off-target effects of non-targeting shRNA. We found that one such control for the MISSION(R) library (commercialized TRC library), SHC016, is cytotoxic. Using a lentiviral vector with inducible expression of SHC016 we proved that this shRNA induces apoptosis in murine cells and, depending on p53 status, senescence or mitotic catastrophe in human tumor cell lines. We identified SNRPD3, a core spliceosomal protein, as a major SHC016 target in several cell lines and confirmed in A549 and U251 cell lines that CRISPRi-knockdown of SNRPD3 mimics the effects of SHC016 expression. Our finding disqualifies non-targeting SHC016 shRNA and adds a new premise to the discussion about the sources of uncertainty of RNAi results.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are evolutionary conserved factors that contribute to cell fate determination and maintenance of cellular identities during development of multicellular organisms. The PcG behaves as repressors to maintain heritable patterns of gene silencing and trxG act as anti-silencing factors by maintaining activation of cell type specific genes. Genetic and molecular analysis has revealed extensive details about how different PcG and trxG complexes antagonize each other to maintain cell fates, however the cellular signaling components that contribute to maintenance of gene expression by PcG/trxG remain elusive. Here, we report an ex vivo kinome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila aimed to identify cell signaling genes that facilitate trxG to counteract PcG mediated repression. From the list of trxG candidates, Ballchen (BALL), a histone kinase, known to phosphorylate histone H2A at threonine 119 (H2AT119p), was characterized as a trxG regulator. The ball mutant exhibit strong genetic interaction with Polycomb (Pc) and trithorax (trx) mutants and loss of BALL also affects expressions of trxG target genes in ball mutant embryos. BALL co-localizes with Trithorax on chromatin and depletion of BALL results in increased H2AK118 ubiquitination, a histone mark central to PcG mediated gene silencing. Moreover, analysis of genome-wide binding profile of BALL shows an overlap with 85% known binding sites of TRX across the genome. Both BALL and TRX are highly enriched at actively transcribed genes, which also correlate with presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. We propose that BALL mediated signal positively contributes to the maintenance of gene activation by trxG by counteracting the repressive effect of PcG.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that act as cellular antennae to mediate vertebrate development and growth factor signalling. Defects in primary cilia result in a group of inherited developmental conditions known as ciliopathies. Ciliopathies often present with cystic kidney disease, a major cause of early renal failure that requires renal replacement therapies. Currently, only one drug, Tolvaptan, is licensed to slow the decline of renal function for the ciliopathy polycystic kidney disease. Novel therapeutic interventions for these conditions remain a pressing clinical need.\n\nWe screened clinical development compounds for positive effects on cilia formation and function and identified fasudil hydrochloride as the top hit. Fasudil is a generic, off-patent drug that is a potent but broadly selective Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. In a parallel whole genome siRNA-based reverse genetics phenotypic screen of positive modulators of cilia formation, we identified ROCK2 as the target molecule. We demonstrate that ROCK2 is a key mediator of cilium formation and function through effects on actin cytoskeleton remodelling. Our results indicate that specific ROCK2 inhibitors such as belumosudil (KD-025) could be repurposed for pharmacological intervention in cystic kidney disease. We propose that ROCK2 inhibition represents a novel, disease-modifying therapeutic approach for heterogeneous ciliopathies.",

It is presumed that date palms were first domesticated in the Persian Gulf and subsequently introduced into North Africa, where their evolution in the latter region appears to have been influenced by gene flow from the wild relative P. theophrasti, which is restricted to Crete and Turkey. However, the timing of gene flow from P. theophrasti to P. dactylifera remains unknown due to the limited archaeobotanical evidence of P. theophrasti and their exclusion from population genomic studies.\nC_LIO_LIWe addressed this issue by investigating the relatedness and ancestry of a ~2,100-year-old P. dactylifera leaf from Saqqara (Egypt), combining genome sequencing of this ancient specimen with a broad sample of date palm cultivars and closely related species.\nC_LIO_LIThe ancient Saqqara date palm shares close genetic ancestry with North African date palm populations. We find clear genomic admixture between the Saqqara date palm, P. theophrasti and the closest known relative P. sylvestris.\nC_LIO_LIOur study highlights that gene flow from P. theophrasti and P. sylvestris to North African date palms had already occurred at least ~2,100 years ago, providing a minimum timestamp for hybridisation between species.\nC_LI",

In this study, we used threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) to test whether trait mismatch in hybrids increases with the magnitude of phenotypic divergence between parent populations. We measured morphological traits in parents and hybrids in crosses between a marine population representing the ancestral form and twelve freshwater populations that have diverged from this ancestral state to varying degrees according to their environments. We found that trait mismatch was greater in more divergent crosses for both F1 and F2 hybrids. In the F1, the divergence-mismatch relationship was caused by traits having dominance in different directions whereas it was caused by segregating phenotypic variation in the F2. Selection against mismatched traits is an ecological analogue to selection against intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities, and our results imply that extrinsic hybrid incompatibilities accumulate predictably as phenotypic divergence proceeds.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization is widely acknowledged as an important mechanism of acquiring adaptive variation. In Texas, the sunflower Helianthus annuus subsp. texanus is thought to have acquired herbivore resistance and morphological traits via introgression from a local congener, H. debilis. Here we test this hypothesis using whole genome sequencing data from across the entire range of H. annuus and possible donor species, as well as phenotypic data from a common garden study. We find that although it is morphologically convergent with H. debilis, H. a. texanus has conflicting signals of introgression. Genome wide tests (Pattersons D and TreeMix) only find evidence of introgression from H. argophyllus (sister species to H. annuus and also sympatric), but not H. debilis, with the exception of one individual of 109 analysed. We further scanned the genome for localized signals of introgression using PCAdmix and found minimal but non-zero introgression from H. debilis and significant introgression from H. argophyllus. Putative introgressions mainly occur in high recombination regions as predicted by theory if introgressed ancestry contains maladaptive alleles. To reconcile the disparate findings of our analyses, we discuss potential test-specific confounding features, including introgression from other taxa. Given the paucity of introgression from H. debilis, we argue that the morphological convergence observed in Texas is likely independent of introgression.",

The expression level of TEAD4 and PKM2 was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Luciferase reporter assay were employed to verify the effect of TEAD4 on PKM2 promoter as well as TEAD4/PKM2 axis on reporter activity of HIF-1. Glycolysis was investigated according to glucose consumption, lactate production and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to assess cell viability. The present study indicated that TEAD4 and PKM2 were upregulated in LUAD and closely related to prognosis. Mechanistic investigations identified that TEAD4 played a key role as a transcription factor and promoted PKM2 transcription and expression, which further altered the reporter activity of HIF-1 and upregulated HIF-1-targeted glycolytic genes GLUT1 and HK2. Functional assays revealed that TEAD4 and PKM2 affected glycolytic and 2-DG blocked the positive function of TEAD4 and PKM2 on glycolytic. Besides, TEAD4/PKM2 axis affects LUAD cells survival through glycolysis. Together, these data provided evidence that both TEAD4 and PKM2 were poor prognosticator.

    "abstract": "RationaleThere is an important clinical need to improve the treatment of high risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa), and to reduce the side effects of these treatments. We hypothesized that multi-modality therapy combining radiotherapy and vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) could PCa tumour control compared against monotherapy with each of these treatments alone. This could provide proof-of-concept to take to the clinic. VTP is a focal therapy for localized PCa, which rapidly destroys targeted tumors through vascular disruption. Tumor vasculature is characterized by vessel immaturity, increased permeability, aberrant branching and inefficient flow. Fractionated radiotherapy (FRT) alters the tumor microenvironment and promotes transient vascular normalization.\n\nObjectiveWe investigated whether sequential delivery of FRT followed by VTP 7 days later improves PCa tumor control compared to monotherapy with FRT or VTP alone.\n\nFindingsFRT induced vascular normalization changes in PCa flank tumor allografts, improving vascular function as demonstrated using dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. FRT followed by VTP significantly delayed tumor growth in flank PCa allograft pre-clinical models, compared with monotherapy with FRT or VTP alone, and improved overall survival.\n\nConclusionTaken together, these results suggest that combining FRT and VTP could become a promising multimodal clinical strategy in PCa therapy. This provides proof-of-concept for this multi-modality therapy approach to take forward to early phase clinical trials.",

Mutant IDH-dependent 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) accumulation leads to DNA and histone hypermethylation. Based on this distinct phenotype, we interrogated epigenetic dependencies of IDH-mutant glioma that can be targeted therapeutically.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a chemical screen targeting chromatin modifiers in patient derived IDH1-mutant GBM cells. We investigated mechanisms of action of compound hits and their combinations through cell-based functional assays, live-cell imaging, Western blot, CRISPR knockout, RNA-seq and ChIP experiments. The therapeutic concept was validated in vivo using chemical inhibitors GSK-J4 and Belinostat in an orthotopic GBM model.\n\nResultsWe identified the H3K27me3 demethylase (KDM6) inhibitor GSK-J4 and histone deacetylase inhibitor Belinostat as potent, genotype-selective agents against IDH1-mutant glioma. RNA-sequencing on paired wild-type and IDH1R132H cells revealed inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and activation of cellular stress in IDH1R132H cells, which were reversible with a mutant IDH1 inhibitor. GSK-J4 caused further repression of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes through H3K27me3 deposition and exacerbated the ATF4-mediated integrated stress response. Belinostat inhibited anti-apoptotic pathways through activation of TGF-{beta} signaling and induced cell cycle arrest. Together, the GSK-J4 and Belinostat combination activated DDIT3/CHOP-dependent apoptosis in IDH1-mutant cells and extended survival in an IDH1-mutant orthotopic model in vivo.\n\nConclusionsThese results provide a possible therapeutic approach that exploits epigenetic vulnerabilities of IDH-mutant gliomas.\n\nKey points- Combination of GSK-J4 and Belinostat selectively targets IDH1-mutant cells.\n- GSK-J4 downregulates cholesterol biosynthesis and activates an ATF4-mediated stress response.\n- Belinostat activates the TGF{beta} pathway, induces G2/M arrest and inhibits anti-apoptotic pathways.\n\n\nImportance of the studyIDH1/2 genes are frequently mutated in low grade glioma and secondary glioblastoma. These tumors exhibit a distinct epigenomic signature with increased DNA and histone methylation; therefore, identifying and exploiting their epigenetic vulnerabilities may lead to effective therapies.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo test a simplified evaluation of fellowship proposals by analyzing the agreement of funding decisions with the official evaluation, and to examine the use of a lottery-based decision for proposals of similar quality.\n\nDesignThe study involved 134 junior fellowship proposals (Postdoc.Mobility). The official method used two panel reviewers who independently scored the application, followed by triage and discussion of selected applications in a panel. Very competitive/uncompetitive proposals were directly funded/rejected without discussion. The simplified procedure used the scores of the two panel members, with or without the score of an additional, third expert. Both methods could further use a lottery to decide on applications of similar quality close to the funding threshold. The same funding rate was applied, and the agreement between the two methods analyzed.\n\nSettingSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).\n\nParticipantsPostdoc.Mobility panel reviewers and additional expert reviewers.\n\nPrimary outcome measurePer cent agreement between the simplified and official evaluation method with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\n\nResultsThe simplified procedure based on three reviews agreed in 80.6% (95% CI 73.9-87.3) with the official funding outcome. The agreement was 86.6% (95% CI 80.8-92.4) when using the two reviews of the panel members. The agreement between the two methods was lower for the group of applications discussed in the panel (64.2% and 73.1%, respectively), and higher for directly funded/rejected applications (range 96.7% to 100%). The lottery was used in eight (6.0%) of 134 applications (official method), 19 (14.2%) applications (simplified, three reviewers) and 23 (17.2%) applications (simplified, two reviewers). With the simplified procedure, evaluation costs could have been halved and 31 hours of meeting time saved for the two 2019 calls.\n\nConclusionAgreement between the two methods was high. The simplified procedure could represent a viable evaluation method for the Postdoc.Mobility early career instrument at the SNSF.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects the cornea and caused blinding ocular disease. In the present study, we evaluated whether and how a novel engineered version of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), designated as TTHX1114, would reduce the severity of HSV-1-induced primary and recurrent ocular herpes in the mouse model. The efficacy of TTHX1114 against corneal keratopathy was assessed in B6 mice following corneal infection with HSV-1, strain McKrae. Starting day one post infection (PI), mice received TTHX1114 for 14 days. The severity of primary stromal keratitis and blepharitis were monitored up to 28 days PI. Inflammatory cell infiltrating infected corneas were characterized up to day 21 PI. The severity of recurrent herpetic disease was quantified in latently infected B6 mice up to 30 days post-UVB corneal exposure. The effect of TTHX1114 on M1 and M2 macrophage polarization was determined in vivo in mice and in vitro on primary human monocytes-derived macrophages. Compared to HSV-1 infected non-treated mice, the infected and TTHX1114 treated mice exhibited a significant reduction of primary and recurrent stromal keratitis and blepharitis, without affecting virus corneal replication. The therapeutic effect of TTHX1114 was associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of M1 macrophages infiltrating the cornea, which expressed significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This polarization toward M2 phenotype was confirmed in vitro on human primary macrophages. This pre-clinical finding suggests use of this engineered FGF-1 as a novel immunotherapeutic regimen to reduce primary and recurrent HSV-1-induced corneal disease in the clinic.\n\nIMPORTANCEHerpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a prevalent human pathogen that infects the cornea causing potentially blinding herpetic disease. The present study is the first to demonstrate a reduction of primary and recurrent corneal herpetic disease in mice following engineered FGF-1 (TTHX1114) treatment. This was associated with a decrease of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and an increase of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages infiltrating the corneas of HSV-1 infected mice. The finding in mice were confirmed in humans by showing that in vitro FGF-1 treatment skewed the polarization of primary monocyte-derived macrophages into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Moreover, FGF-1 treatment appeared to reduce production of anti-inflammatory mediators. This pre-clinical finding support this engineered FGF-1 as a novel immunotherapeutic regimen to reduce primary and recurrent corneal herpetic disease in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes 700 million infections and accounts for half a million deaths per year. Biofilm formation has been implicated in both pharyngeal and dermal GAS infections. In vitro, plate-based assays have shown that several GAS M-types form biofilms, and multiple GAS virulence factors have been linked to biofilm formation. Although the contributions of these plate-based studies have been valuable, most have failed to mimic the host environment, with many studies utilising abiotic surfaces. GAS is a human specific pathogen, and colonisation and subsequent biofilm formation is likely facilitated by distinct interactions with host tissue surfaces. As such, a host cell-GAS model has been optimised to support and grow GAS biofilms of a variety of GAS M-types. Improvements and adjustments to the crystal violet biofilm biomass assay have also been tailored to reproducibly detect delicate GAS biofilms. We propose 72 h as an optimal growth period for yielding detectable biofilm biomass. GAS biofilms formed are robust and durable, and can be reproducibly assessed via staining/washing intensive assays such as crystal violet with the aid of methanol fixation prior to staining. Lastly, SEM imaging of GAS biofilms formed by this model are resemblant of those previously found on excised tonsils of patients suffering chronic pharyngo-tonsillitis. Taken together, we outline an efficacious GAS biofilm pharyngeal cell model that can support long-term GAS biofilm formation, with biofilms formed closely resembling those seen in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is caused by Plasmodium spp. protozoan parasites, which are transmitted by female anopheline mosquitoes in the form of sporozoites. Once deposited in the dermis during the blood meal of the mosquito, sporozoites rapidly migrate to the liver for an initial and obligatory round of replication inside hepatocytes, before exponential multiplication of the parasite in the blood and onset of the malaria disease. Sporozoites and liver stages provide attractive targets for the development of a malaria vaccine. Until now, a single antigen from Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest species infecting humans, has been considered for subunit vaccine clinical development, with limited success so far. This emphazises the need to identify novel targets. In this context, defining the parasite proteome is important not only to guide the down-selection of potential candidate antigens, but also to allow a better understanding of the parasite biology. Previous studies have determined the total proteome of sporozoite stages from the two main human malaria parasites, P. falciparum and P. vivax, as well as P. yoelii, a parasite that infects rodents. Another murine malaria parasite, P. berghei, has been widely used to investigate the biology of Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages. However, a deep view of the proteome of P. berghei sporozoites is still missing. To fill this gap, we took advantage of a novel highly sensitive timsTOF PRO mass spectrometer, based on trapped ion mobility spectrometry with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation. Combined with three alternative methods for sporozoite purification, this approach allowed us to identify the deep proteome of P. berghei sporozoites using low numbers of parasites. This study provides a reference proteome for P. berghei sporozoites, identifying a core set of proteins expressed accross species, and illustrates how the unprecedented sensitivity of the timsTOF PRO system enables deep proteomic analysis from limited sample amounts.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are glycolipids that anchor many proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface. The core glycan of GPI precursor has three mannoses, which in mammals, are all modified by ethanolamine-phosphate (EthN-P). It is postulated that EthN-P on the third mannose (EthN-P-Man3) is the bridge between GPI to the protein and the second (EthN-P-Man2) is removed after GPI-protein attachment. However, EthN-P-Man2 may not be always transient, as mutations of PIGG, the enzyme that transfers EthN-P to Man2, result in inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), characterized by neuronal dysfunctions. Here, we show EthN-P on Man2 is the preferential bridge in some GPI-APs, among them, the ect-5-nucleotidase and netrin G2. We found that CD59, a GPI-AP, is attached via EthN-P-Man2 both in PIGB-knockout cells, in which GPI lacks Man3 and with a small fraction, in wild type cells. Our findings modify the current view of GPI anchoring and provide mechanistic bases of IGDs caused by PIGG mutations.",

    "abstract": "The AKT-mTOR pathway is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Upon sustained mTOR activity, AKT activity is attenuated by a feedback loop that restrains upstream signaling. However, how cells control the signals that limit AKT activity is not fully understood. Here we show that MASTL/Greatwall, a cell-cycle kinase that supports mitosis by phosphorylating the PP2A/B55 inhibitors ENSA/ARPP19, inhibits PI3K-AKT activity by sustaining mTORC1- and S6K1-dependent phosphorylation of IRS1 and GRB10. Genetic depletion of MASTL results in an inefficient feedback loop and AKT hyperactivity. These defects are rescued by expression of phospho-mimetic ENSA/ARPP19 or inhibition of PP2A/B55 phosphatases. MASTL is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1, thereby limiting the PP2A/B55-dependent dephosphorylation of IRS1 and GRB10 downstream of mTORC1. Downregulation of MASTL results in increased glucose uptake in vitro and increased glucose tolerance in adult mice, suggesting the relevance of the MASTL-PP2A/B55 kinase-phosphatase module in controlling AKT and maintaining metabolic homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Expression of the gap and pair-rule genes plays an essential role in body segmentation during Drosophila embryogenesis [1-5]. However, it remains unclear how precise expression patterns of these key developmental genes arise from stochastic transcriptional activation at the single cell level. Here, I employed genome editing and live imaging approaches to comprehensively visualize regulation of the gap and pair-rule genes at the endogenous loci. Quantitative image analysis revealed that the total duration of active transcription (transcription period) is a major determinant of spatial patterning of gene expression in early embryos. The length of transcription period is regulated by the continuity of bursting activities in individual nuclei, with core expression domain producing more bursts than boundary region. Each gene exhibits distinct rate of nascent RNA production during transcriptional bursting, which contributes to gene-to-gene variability in the total output. I also provide evidence for \"enhancer competition\", wherein a distal weak enhancer interferes with transcriptional activation by a strong proximal enhancer to downregulate the length of transcription period without changing the transcription rate. Analysis of endogenous hunchback (hb) locus revealed that the removal of distal shadow enhancer induces strong ectopic transcriptional activation, which suppresses refinement of broad expression domain into narrower stripe pattern at the anterior part of embryos. This study provides key insights into the link between transcriptional bursting, enhancer-promoter interaction and spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression during animal development.",

    "abstract": "Selfish centromere DNA sequences bias their transmission to the egg in female meiosis. Evolutionary theory suggests that centromere proteins evolve to suppress costs of this \"centromere drive\". In hybrid mouse models with genetically different maternal and paternal centromeres, selfish centromere DNA exploits a kinetochore pathway to recruit microtubule-destabilizing proteins that act as drive effectors. We show that such functional differences are suppressed by a parallel pathway for effector recruitment by heterochromatin, which is similar between centromeres in this system. Disrupting heterochromatin by CENP-B deletion amplifies functional differences between centromeres, whereas disrupting the kinetochore pathway with a divergent allele of CENP-C reduces the differences. Molecular evolution analyses using newly sequenced Murinae genomes identify adaptive evolution in proteins in both pathways. We propose that centromere proteins have recurrently evolved to minimize the kinetochore pathway, which is exploited by selfish DNA, relative to the heterochromatin pathway that equalizes centromeres, while maintaining essential functions.",

Here, we performed smFRET experiments on functionally active human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) molecules embedded in freely diffusing lipid nanodiscs to study their intramolecular conformational dynamics. We propose a dynamic model of A2AAR activation that involves a slow (>2 ms) exchange between the active-like and inactive-like conformations in both apo and antagonist-bound A2AAR, explaining the receptors constitutive activity. For the agonist-bound A2AAR, we detected faster (390{+/-}80 s) ligand efficacy-dependent dynamics.

While the basic course of transcription is well understood, it is unclear how binding of a TF affects the frequency, duration and size of a transcriptional burst. We systematically varied the residence time and concentration of a synthetic TF and characterized the transcription of a reporter gene by combining single molecule imaging, single molecule RNA-FISH, live transcript visualisation and analysis with a novel algorithm, Burst Inference from mRNA Distributions (BIRD). For this well-defined system, we found that TF binding solely affected burst frequency and variations in TF residence time had a stronger influence than variations in concentration. This enabled us to device a model of gene transcription, in which TF binding triggers multiple successive steps before the gene transits to the active state and actual mRNA synthesis is decoupled from TF presence. We quantified all transition times of the TF and the gene, including the TF search time and the delay between TF binding and the onset of transcription. Our quantitative measurements and analysis revealed detailed kinetic insight, which may serve as basis for a bottom-up understanding of gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Although mice locate resources using turbulent airborne odor plumes, the stochasticity and intermittency of fluctuating plumes create challenges for interpreting odor cues in natural environments. Population activity within the olfactory bulb (OB), is thought to process this complex spatial and temporal information, but how plume dynamics impact odor representation in this early stage of the mouse olfactory system is not known. Limitations in odor detection technology have made it impossible to measure plume fluctuations while simultaneously recording from the mouses brain. Thus, previous studies have measured OB activity following controlled odor pulses of varying profiles or frequencies, but this approach only captures a subset of features found within olfactory plumes. Adequately sampling this feature space is difficult given a lack of knowledge regarding which features the brain extracts during exposure to natural olfactory scenes. Here we measured OB responses to naturally fluctuating odor plumes using a miniature, adapted odor sensor combined with wide-field GCaMP6f signaling from the dendrites of mitral and tufted (MT) cells imaged in olfactory glomeruli of head-fixed mice. We precisely tracked plume dynamics and imaged glomerular responses to this fluctuating input, while varying flow conditions across a range of ethologically-relevant values. We found that a consistent portion of MT activity in glomeruli follows odor concentration dynamics, and the strongest responding glomeruli are the best at following fluctuations within odor plumes. Further, the reliability and average response magnitude of glomerular populations of MT cells are affected by the flow condition in which the animal samples the plume, with the fidelity of plume following by MT cells increasing in conditions of higher flow velocity where odor dynamics result in intermittent whiffs of stronger concentration. Thus, the flow environment in which an animal encounters an odor has a large-scale impact on the temporal representation of an odor plume in the OB. Additionally, across flow conditions odor dynamics are a major driver of activity in many glomerular networks. Taken together, these data demonstrate that plume dynamics structure olfactory representations in the first stage of odor processing in the mouse olfactory system.",

IP3/Ca2+ signals in certain interneurons (vGlutVGN6341) allow Drosophila larvae to pupariate on a protein-deficient diet by partially circumventing this shutdown through upregulation of neuropeptide signaling and the expression of ecdysone synthesis genes. Here we show that IP3/Ca2+ signals in vGlutVGN6341 neurons drive expression of dSET2, a Drosophila Histone 3 Lysine 36 methyltransferase. Further, dSET2 expression is required for larvae to pupariate in the absence of dietary protein. IP3/Ca2+ signal-driven dSET2 expression upregulates key Ca2+ signaling genes through a novel positive feedback loop. Transcriptomic studies coupled with analysis of existing ChIP-seq datasets identified genes from larval and pupal stages, that normally exhibit robust H3K36 trimethyl marks on their gene bodies and concomitantly undergo stronger downregulation by knockdown of either an intracellular Ca2+ release channel the IP3R or dSET2. IP3/Ca2+ signals thus regulate gene expression through dSET2 mediated H3K36 marks on select neuronal genes for the larval to pupal transition.",

    "abstract": "Functional annotations have the potential to increase the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by prioritizing variants according to their biological function. Focusing on variant-specific annotation meta-scores including CADD (Kircher et al., 2014) and Eigen (Ionita-laza et al., 2016), we broadly examined GWAS summary statistics of 1,132 traits from the UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., 2015) using the weighted p-value approach (Genovese et al., 2006) and stratified false discovery control (sFDR) method (Sun et al., 2006). These 1,132 traits were rated by Benjamin Neales lab from the Broad Institute as having medium to high confidence for their heritability estimates.\n\nAveraged across the 1,132 UK Biobank traits, sFDR was more robust to uninformative meta-scores, but the weighted p-value method identified more variants using CADD or Eigen, based on performance measures that included type I error control, recall, precision, and relative efficiency. Our application results were consistent with those from an extensive simulation study using three different designs, including leveraging the real genetic data combined with simulated genomic data and vice versa.\n\nWe also considered the recent FINDOR method (Kichaev et al., 2019), which leverages a set of individual 75 functional annotations into GWAS. An earlier application of FINDOR to 27 traits selected from the z7 category (SNP-heritability p-value < 1.27 x 10-12 by Nealelab) detected 13%-20% additional genome-wide significant loci as compared to the standard annotation-free GWAS, which we confirmed. Moreover, across all 438 traits in the z7 category, 46,631 out 59,764 (80%) significant loci discovered are common across the three data-integration methods.\n\nHowever, across all the 1,132 UK Biobank traits examined, the median [Q1,Q3] of the total numbers of new, genome-wide significant independent loci were 0 [0, 3] by FINDOR, 0 [0, 2] by weighted p-value, and 0 [0, 0] by sFDR. Notably, 162 traits (89%) in the nonsig trait category (SNP-heritability p-value > 0.05, \"likely reflecting limited statistical power rather than a true lack of heritability\" by Nealelab) had no new discoveries after data-integration by any of the three methods. Our findings suggest that more informative scores or new data integration methods are warranted to further improve the power of GWAS by leveraging the variant functional annotations.",

Out of these, we assessed 10 PAs under state level administration that lacked thus far a standardized assessment. For PAs under federal administration, we got assessment data from the government itself. We contrasted the PAs regarding the level of administration and collected a list of aspects that could result in differences in management effectiveness between PAs. We checked the relationship between PA aspects and mean effectiveness with linear models. The same aspects were also related to PA management elements, namely context, planning, inputs, processes, and outputs, using redundancy analysis. Management effectiveness and scores of management elements were found to be lower for PAs either with unresolved land tenure, lacking management plans, being under many pressures and threats, or being under state level administration. Our results call for extended assessments to reach the reality of the Brazilian PA network with different administration levels. Assessments must be carried out regularly since it is the only way to effectively flag a barrier, clear it, then find the next one to be tackled.",

    "abstract": "Cilia are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based structures that perform diverse biological functions. Cilia are assembled on basal bodies and anchored to the plasma membrane via distal appendages. Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are a specialized cell type with hundreds of motile multicilia, lining the brain ventricles, airways, and reproductive tracts to propel fluids/substances across the epithelial surface. In the male reproductive tract, MCCs in efferent ducts (EDs) move in a whip-like motion to stir the luminal contents and prevent sperm agglutination. Previously, we demonstrated that the essential distal appendage protein CEP164 recruits Chibby1 (Cby1), a small coiled-coil-containing protein, to basal bodies to facilitate basal body docking and ciliogenesis. Mice lacking CEP164 in MCCs (FoxJ1-Cre;CEP164fl/fl) show a significant loss of multicilia in the trachea, oviduct, and ependyma. In addition, we observed male sterility, however, the precise role of CEP164 in male fertility remained unknown. Here, we report that the seminiferous tubules and rete testis of FoxJ1-Cre;CEP164fl/fl mice exhibit substantial dilation, indicative of dysfunctional multicilia in the EDs. Consistent with these findings, multicilia were hardly detectable in the EDs of FoxJ1-Cre;CEP164fl/fl mice although FoxJ1-positive immature cells were present. Sperm aggregation and agglutination were commonly noticeable in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules and EDs of FoxJ1-Cre;CEP164fl/fl mice. In FoxJ1-Cre;CEP164fl/fl mice, the apical localization of Cby1 and the transition zone marker NPHP1 was severely diminished, suggesting basal body docking defects. TEM analysis of EDs further confirmed basal body accumulation in the cytoplasm of MCCs. Collectively, we conclude that deletion of CEP164 in the MCCs of EDs causes basal body docking defects and loss of multicilia, leading to sperm agglutination, obstruction of EDs, and male infertility. Our study therefore unravels an essential role of the distal appendage protein CEP164 in male fertility.\n\nAuthor SummaryMulticilia are tinny hair-like microtubule-based structures that beat in a whip-like pattern to generate a fluid flow on the apical cell surface. Multiciliated cells are essential for the proper function of major organs such as brain, airway, and reproductive tracts. In the male reproductive system, multiciliated cells are present in the efferent ducts, which are small tubules that connect the testis to the epididymis. However, the importance of multiciliated cells in male fertility remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the critical ciliary protein CEP164 in male fertility using a mouse model lacking CEP164 in multiciliated cells. Male mice are infertile with reduced sperm counts. We demonstrate that, in the absence of CEP164, multiciliated cells are present in the efferent ducts but fail to extend multicilia due to basal body docking defects. Consistent with this, the recruitment of key ciliary proteins is perturbed. As a result, these mice show sperm agglutination, obstruction of sperm transport, and degeneration of germ cells in the testis, leading to infertility. Our study therefore reveals essential roles of CEP164 in the formation of multicilia in the efferent ducts and male fertility.",

    "abstract": "Experimental grinding has been used to study the relationship between human humeral robusticity and cereal grinding in the early Holocene. However, such replication studies raise two questions regarding the robusticity of the results: whether female nonathletes used in previous research are sufficiently comparable to early agricultural females, and whether previous analysis of muscle activation of only four upper limb muscles is sufficient to capture the stress of cereal grinding on upper limb bones. We test the influence of both of these factors. Electromyographic activity of eight upper limb muscles was recorded during cereal grinding in an athletic sample of 10 female rowers and a nonathletic sample of 25 females and analyzed using both an eight- and four-muscle model. Athletes had lower activation than nonathletes in the majority of measured muscles, but most of these differences were non-significant. Furthermore, both athletes and nonathletes had lower muscle activation during saddle quern grinding than rotary quern grinding suggesting that the nonathletic sample can be used to model early agricultural females during saddle and rotary quern grinding.\n\nSimilarly, in both eight- and four-muscle models, upper limb loading was lower during saddle quern grinding than during rotary quern grinding, suggesting that the upper limb muscles may be reduced to the previously used four-muscle model for evaluation of the upper limb loading during cereal grinding. Another implication of our measurements is to question the assumption that skeletal indicators of high involvement of the biceps brachii muscle can be interpreted as specifically indicative of saddle quern grinding.",

    "abstract": "A recent flood of publications has documented serious problems in scientific reproducibility, power, and reporting of biomedical articles, yet scientists persist in their usual practices. Why? We examined a popular and important preclinical assay, the Forced Swim Test (FST) in mice used to test putative antidepressants. Whether the mice were assayed in a naive state vs. in a model of depression or stress, and whether the mice were given test agents vs. known antidepressants regarded as positive controls, the mean effect sizes seen in the experiments were indeed extremely large (1.5 - 2.5 in Cohens d units); most of the experiments utilized 7-10 animals per group which did have adequate power to reliably detect effects of this magnitude. We propose that this may at least partially explain why investigators using the FST do not perceive intuitively that their experimental designs fall short -- even though proper prospective design would require ~21-26 animals per group to detect, at a minimum, large effects (0.8 in Cohens d units) when the true effect of a test agent is unknown. Our data provide explicit parameters and guidance for investigators seeking to carry out prospective power estimation for the FST. More generally, altering the real-life behavior of scientists in planning their experiments may require developing educational tools that allow them to actively visualize the inter-relationships among effect size, sample size, statistical power, and replicability in a direct and intuitive manner.",

In a word production task, we observed enhanced involvement of the right posterior cerebellum for trials that were correct, but on which participants were more likely to make a word-as compared to a non-word error. Furthermore, comparing errors to correctly produced utterances, we observed increased activation of the same cerebellar region, in addition to temporal and medial frontal regions. Within the framework associating the cerebellum to forward modelling of upcoming actions, this indicates that forward models of verbal actions contain information about word representations used for error monitoring even before articulation (internal monitoring). Additional resources relying on speech perception and conflict monitoring are deployed during articulation to detect overt errors (external monitoring). In summary, speech monitoring seems to recruit a network of brain regions serving domain general purposes, even for abstract levels of processing.",

    "abstract": "The striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN) are considered to be the primary input nuclei of the basal ganglia. Projection neurons of both striatum and STN can extensively interact with other basal ganglia nuclei, and there is growing anatomical evidence of direct axonal connections from the STN to striatum. There remains, however, a pressing need to elucidate the organization and impact of these subthalamostriatal projections in the context of the diverse cell types constituting the striatum. To address this, we carried out monosynaptic retrograde tracing from genetically-defined populations of dorsal striatal neurons in adult male and female mice, quantifying the connectivity from STN neurons to spiny projection neurons, GABAergic interneurons, and cholinergic interneurons. In parallel, we used a combination of ex vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics to characterize the responses of a complementary range of dorsal striatal neuron types to activation of STN axons. Our tracing studies showed that the connectivity from STN neurons to striatal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons is significantly higher (~ four-to eight-fold) than that from STN to any of the four other striatal cell types examined. In agreement, our recording experiments showed that parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, but not the other cell types tested, commonly exhibited robust monosynaptic excitatory responses to subthalamostriatal inputs. Taken together, our data collectively demonstrate that the subthalamostriatal projection is highly selective for target cell type. We conclude that glutamatergic STN neurons are positioned to directly and powerfully influence striatal activity dynamics by virtue of their enriched innervation of GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing interneurons.",

We identify Egr1 as a modulator of gene expression in the hippocampus during motor learning. Using mice in which neural ensembles are permanently labeled in an Egr1 activity-dependent fashion we identify ensembles of Egr1-expressing pyramidal neurons in CA1 activated in short- and long-term trained mice in the rotarod task. When Egr1 is downregulated or these neuronal ensembles are depleted, motor learning is improved whereas their chemogenetic stimulation impairs motor learning performance. Thus, Egr1 organizes specific CA1 neuronal ensembles during the accelerating rotarod task that limit motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 8 (CHD8) is one of the most frequently mutated genes causative of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While its phenotypic spectrum often encompasses macrocephaly and hence implicates cortical abnormalities in this form of ASD, the neurodevelopmental impact of human CHD8 haploinsufficiency remains unexplored. Here we combined human cerebral organoids and single cell transcriptomics to define the effect of ASD-linked CHD8 mutations on human cortical development. We found that CHD8 haploinsufficiency causes a major disruption of neurodevelopmental trajectories with an accelerated generation of inhibitory neurons and a delayed production of excitatory neurons alongside the ensuing protraction of the proliferation phase. This imbalance leads to a significant enlargement of cerebral organoids aligned to the macrocephaly observed in patients with CHD8 mutations. By adopting an isogenic design of patient-specific mutations and mosaic cerebral organoids, we define genotype-phenotype relationships and uncover their cell-autonomous nature. Finally, our results assign different CHD8-dependent molecular defects to particular cell types, pointing to an abnormal and extended program of proliferation and alternative splicing specifically affected in, respectively, the radial glial and immature neuronal compartments. By identifying temporally restricted cell-type specific effects of human CHD8 mutations, our study uncovers developmental alterations as reproducible endophenotypes for neurodevelopmental disease modelling.",

Fifty-four also underwent structural MRI. We investigated relationships between task-evoked EEG responses, cognitive ability and immunocompromise. MRI suggested a subcortical basis for the observed EEG effects.\n\nResultsEEG activity was associated with cognitive ability at later (P300) but not earlier processing stages of both tasks. However, only the P300 evoked by the attention task was associated with past HIV infection severity. Source localization confirmed that the tasks engaged different brain circuits. Thalamus volumes correlated with P300 amplitudes evoked by the attention task, while globus pallidus volumes were related to the P300 in both tasks.\n\nInterpretationThis is the first study to combine structural and functional imaging in an overlapping sample to address the neural circuits related to cognitive dysfunction in HIV. Neural substrates of attention were more affected than those supporting inhibitory control. Preliminary evidence suggests these differences may relate to vulnerability of the thalamus to the effects of HIV. Our results suggest high-yield tasks and circuit targets for future work.",

    "abstract": "Leptospira interrogans is a pathogenic spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, a neglected, zoonotic reemerging disease. Humans are sensitive hosts and may develop severe disease. Some animal species, such as rats and mice can become asymptomatic renal carriers. More than 350 leptospiral serovars have been identified, classified on the basis of the antibody response directed against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similarly to whole inactivated bacteria used as human vaccines, this response is believed to confer only short-term, serogroup-specific protection. The immune response of hosts against leptospires has not been thoroughly studied and correlates of protection would be required to test vaccine candidates. In this work, we studied the immunoglobulin (Ig) profiles in mice infected with L. interrogans over time to determine whether this humoral response confers long-term protection after homologous challenge six months post-infection.\n\nGroups of mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2x107 leptospires of one of three pathogenic serovars (Manilae, Copenhageni or Icterohaemorrhagiae), attenuated mutants or heat-killed bacteria. Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin (IgA, IgM, IgG and 4 subclasses) produced in the first weeks up to 6 months post-infection were measured by ELISA. Strikingly, we found sustained high levels of IgM in mice infected with the pathogenic Manilae and Copenhageni strains, both colonizing the kidney. In contrast, the Icterohaemorrhagiae strain did not lead to kidney colonization, even at high dose, and triggered a classical IgM response that peaked at day 8 post-infection and disappeared. The virulent Manilae and Copenhageni serovars elicited high levels and similar profiles of IgG subclasses in contrast to Icterohaemorrhagiae strains that stimulated weaker antibody responses. Inactivated heat-killed Manilae strains elicited very low responses. However, all mice pre-injected with leptospires challenged with high doses of homologous bacteria did not develop acute leptospirosis, and all antibody responses were boosted after challenge. Furthermore, we showed that 2 months post challenge, mice pre-infected with the M895 Manilae LPS mutant or heat-killed bacterin were completely protected against renal colonization. In conclusion, we observed a sustained IgM response potentially associated with chronic leptospiral renal infection. We also demonstrated in mice different profiles of protective antibody response after L. interrogans infection, depending on the serovar and virulence of strains.\n\nAuthor summaryLeptospira interrogans is a pathogenic spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, a neglected zoonotic reemerging disease. The immune response of hosts against these bacteria has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we studied over 6 months the immunoglobulin (Ig) profiles in mice infected with L. interrogans and determined whether this humoral response confers long-term protection after homologous challenge six months after primary infection. Groups of mice were infected intraperitoneally with 2x107 bacteria of one of three different pathogenic serovars (Manilae, Copenhageni and Icterohaemorrhagiae) and some corresponding attenuated avirulent mutants. We measured by ELISA each type of Leptospira-specific Ig (IgA, IgM, IgG and 4 subclasses) produced in the first weeks up to 6 months post-infection. We showed different profiles of antibody response after L. interrogans challenge in mice, depending on the serovar and virulence of strains. However, all infected mice, including the ones harboring low antibody levels, like mice vaccinated with an inactivated, heat-killed strain, were protected against leptospirosis after challenge. Notably, we also showed an unusual sustained IgM response associated with chronic leptospiral colonization. Altogether, this long-term immune protection is different from what is known in humans and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic gene expression is extensively regulated by cellular stress and pathogen infections. We have previously shown that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and several cellular stresses cause widespread disruption of transcription termination (DoTT) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in host genes and that the viral immediate early factor ICP27 plays an important role in HSV-1-induced DoTT. Here, we show that HSV-1 infection also leads to widespread changes in alternative polyadenylation (APA) of host mRNAs. In the majority of cases, polyadenylation shifts to upstream poly(A) sites (PAS), including many intronic PAS. Mechanistically, ICP27 contributes to HSV-1-mediated APA regulation. HSV-1- and ICP27-induced activation of intronic PAS is sequence-dependent and does not involve general inhibition of U1 snRNP. HSV1-induced intronic polyadenylation is accompanied by early termination of RNAPII. Finally, HSV-1-induced mRNAs polyadenylated at intronic PAS are exported into the cytoplasm while APA isoforms with extended 3 UTRs are sequestered in the nuclei, both preventing the expression of the full-length gene products. Together with other recent studies, our results suggest that viral infection and cellular stresses induce a multi-faceted host shutoff response that includes DoTT and changes in APA profiles.",

    "abstract": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play critical roles in protecting germline genome integrity and promoting normal spermiogenic differentiation. In mammals, there are two populations of piRNAs: pre-pachytene and pachytene piRNAs. Transposon-rich pre-pachytene piRNAs are expressed in fetal and perinatal germ cells and are required for retrotransposon silencing, whereas transposon-poor pachytene piRNAs are expressed in spermatocytes and round spermatids and regulate mRNA transcript levels. MOV10L1, a germ cell-specific RNA helicase, is essential for the production of both populations of piRNAs. Although the requirement of the RNA helicase domain located in the MOV10L1 C-terminal region for piRNA biogenesis is well known, its large N-terminal region remains mysterious. Here we report a novel Mov10l1 mutation in the Mov10l1 N-terminal region named yama. The yama mutation results in a single amino acid substitution V229E. The yama mutation causes meiotic arrest, de-repression of transposable elements, and male sterility because of defects in pre-pachytene piRNA biogenesis. Moreover, restricting the Mov10l1 mutation effects to later stages in germ cell development by combining with a postnatal conditional deletion of a complementing wild-type allele causes absence of pachytene piRNAs, accumulation of piRNA precursors, polar conglomeration of piRNA pathway proteins in spermatocytes, and spermiogenic arrest. Mechanistically, the V229E substitution in MOV10L1 reduces its interaction with PLD6, an endonuclease that generates the 5' ends of piRNA intermediates. Our results uncover an important role for the MOV10L1-PLD6 interaction in piRNA biogenesis throughout male germ cell development.\n\nAuthor SummarySmall non-coding RNAs play critical roles in silencing of exogenous viruses, endogenous retroviruses, and transposable elements, and also play multifaceted roles in controlling gene expression. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are found in gonads in diverse species from flies to humans. An evolutionarily conserved function of piRNAs is to silence transposable elements through an adaptive mechanism and thus to protect the germline genome integrity. In mammals, piRNAs also provide a poorly understood function to regulate postmeiotic differentiation of spermatids. More than two dozen proteins are involved in the piRNA pathway. MOV10L1, a germ-cell-specific RNA helicase, binds to piRNA precursors to initiate piRNA biogenesis. Here we have identified a single amino acid substitution (V229E) in MOV10L1 in the yama mutant. When constitutively expressed as the only source of MOV10L1 throughout germ cell development, the yama mutation abolishes piRNA biogenesis, de-silences transposable elements, and causes meiotic arrest. When the mutant phenotype is instead revealed only later in germ cell development by conditionally inactivating a complementing wild-type copy of the gene, the point mutant abolishes formation of later classes of piRNAs and again disrupts germ cell development. Point mutations in MOV10L1 may thus contribute to male infertility in humans.",

    "abstract": "O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a post-translational modification (i.e., O-GlcNAcylation) on serine/threonine residues of proteins. As a unique intracellular monosaccharide modification, protein O-GlcNAcylation plays important roles in almost all biochemical processes examined. Aberrant O-GlcNAcylation underlies the etiologies of a number of chronic diseases (including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease). With the tremendous improvement of techniques, thousands of proteins along with their O-GlcNAc sites have been reported. However, until now there is no database dedicated to accommodate the rapid accumulation of such information. Thus, O-GlcNAcAtlas is created to integrate all experimentally identified O-GlcNAc sites and proteins from 1984 to Dec, 2019. O-GlcNAcAtlas consists of two datasets (Dataset-I and Dataset-II, for unambiguously identified sites and ambiguously identified sites, respectively), representing a total number of 4571 O-GlcNAc modified proteins. For each protein, comprehensive information (including gene name, organism, modification sites, site mapping methods and literature references) is provided. To solve the heterogeneity among the data collected from different sources, the sequence identity of these reported O-GlcNAc peptides are mapped to the UniProtKB protein entries. To our knowledge, O-GlcNAcAtlas is the comprehensive and curated database encapsulating all O-GlcNAc sites and proteins identified in the past 35 years. We expect that O-GlcNAcAtlas will be a useful resource which will facilitate site-specific O-GlcNAc functional studies and computational analyses of protein O-GlcNAcylation. The public version of the web interface to the O-GlcNAcAtlas can be found at https://oglcnac.org.",
