    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe goal of the present study was to identify the role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the detection and later processing of novelty stimuli.\n\nMethodsTwenty-one epilepsy patients with unilateral MTL resection (10 left-sided; 11 right-sided) performed an adapted visual novelty oddball task. In this task two streams of stimuli were presented on the left and right of fixation while the patients electroencephalogram was measured. Patients responded to infrequent target stimuli, while ignoring frequent standard, and infrequent novel stimuli that could appear either contra- or ipsilateral to the resected side.\n\nResultsNovelty detection, as indexed by the N2 ERP component elicited by novels, was not affected by the MTL resections. Later processing of novels, however, as indexed by the novelty P3 ERP component, was reduced for novels presented contra-versus ipsilateral to the resected side. Target processing, as indexed by the P3b, was unaffected.\n\nConclusionsThe current results suggest that MTL structures play a role in novelty processing, but that the novelty signal may originate from a distinct neural source.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial flagellin protein is a potent microbe-associated molecular pattern. Immune responses are triggered by a 22 amino acid epitope derived from flagellin, known as flg22, upon detection by the pattern recognition receptor FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) in multiple plant species. However, increasing evidence suggests that flg22 epitopes of several bacterial species are not universally immunogenic to plants. We investigated whether flg22 immunogenicity systematically differs between classes of the phylum Proteobacteria, using a dataset of 2,470 flg22 sequences. To predict which species encode highly immunogenic flg22 epitopes, we queried a custom motif (11[ST]xx[DN][DN]xAGxxI21) in the flg22 sequences, followed by sequence conservation analysis and protein structural modelling.

    "abstract": "Odor perception in non-humans is poorly understood. Here, we generated the most comprehensive murine olfactory ethological atlas to date, consisting of behavioral responses to a diverse panel of 73 odorants, including 12 at multiple concentrations. These data revealed that the mouse behavior is incredibly diverse, and changes in response to odor identity and intensity. Using only behavioral responses, ~30% of the 73 odorants could be identified with high accuracy (>96%) by a trained classifier. Mouse behavior occupied a low-dimensional space, consistent with analyses of human olfactory perception. While mouse olfactory behavior is difficult to predict from the corresponding human olfactory percept, three fundamental properties are shared: odor valence is the primary axis of olfactory perception; the physicochemical properties of odorants can predict the olfactory percept; and odorant concentration quantitatively and qualitatively impacts olfactory perception. These results provide a template for future comparative studies of olfactory percepts among species.",

    "abstract": "Visual illusions have long been studied because the illusory effect they induce is believed to tell us something important on how the visual system processes visual information. Here, we modified a classic visual illusion, the Delboeuf illusion, so that it resembled a type of stimulus commonly used in experiments investigating surround modulation. We then performed a small set of psychophysical experiments in order to determine if the classical Delboeuf illusion effect, i.e. a change in the perceived size of an object, could be observed in these altered stimuli. In four conditions, we created stimuli that either had a high or low frequency surround in addition to being presented with a proximal thin surround or a distal thick surround. We found a significant difference in perceived object size for all four conditions compared to control indicating the presence of an illusion, and we discuss these findings in relation to existing literature from electrophysiological animal studies.",

    "abstract": "Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) amplicon sequencing can quantitatively and comprehensively profile natural microbiomes, representing a critically important tool for studying diverse global ecosystems. However, results will only be accurate if PCR primers perfectly match the rRNA of all organisms present. To evaluate how well marine microorganisms across all 3 domains are detected by this method, we compared commonly-used primers with > 300 million rRNA gene sequences retrieved from globally-distributed marine metagenomes. The best-performing primers when comparing to 16S rRNA of Bacteria and Archaea were 515Y/926R and 515Y/806RB, which perfectly matched over 96% of all sequences. Considering Cyanobacteria and Chloroplast 16S rRNA, 515Y/926R had the highest coverage (99%), making this set ideal for quantifying marine primary producers. For eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences, 515Y/926R also performed best (88%), followed by V4R/V4RB (18S rRNA-specific; 82%) - demonstrating that the 515Y/926R combination performs best overall for all 3 domains. Using Atlantic and Pacific Ocean samples, we demonstrate high correspondence between 515Y/926R amplicon abundances (generated for this study) and metagenomic 16S rRNA (median R2=0.98, n=272), indicating amplicons can produce equally accurate community composition data versus shotgun metagenomics. Our analysis also revealed that expected performance of all primer sets could be improved with minor modifications, pointing toward a nearly-completely universal primer set that could accurately quantify biogeochemically-important taxa in ecosystems ranging from the deep-sea to the surface. In addition, our reproducible bioinformatic workflow can guide microbiome researchers studying different ecosystems or human health to similarly improve existing primers and generate more accurate quantitative amplicon data.\n\nSignificance StatementPCR amplification and sequencing of marker genes is a low-cost technique for monitoring prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities across space and time, but will only work optimally if environmental organisms match PCR primer sequences exactly. In this study, we evaluated how well primers match globally-distributed short-read oceanic metagenomes. Our results demonstrate primer sets vary widely in performance, and that at least for marine systems, rRNA amplicon data from some primers lack significant biases compared to metagenomes. We also show that it is possible to create a nearly universal primer set for diverse saline environments by defining a specific mixture of a few dozen oligonucleotides and present a software pipeline that can guide rational design of primers for any environment with available metaomic data.",

    "abstract": "Marine plankton form complex communities of interacting organisms at the base of the food web, which sustain oceanic biogeochemical cycles, and help regulate climate. Though global surveys are starting to reveal ecological drivers underlying planktonic community structure, and predicted climate change responses, it is unclear how community-scale species interactions will be affected by climate change. Here we leveraged Tara Oceans sampling to infer a global ocean cross-domain plankton co-occurrence network - the community interactome - and used niche modeling to assess its vulnerabilities to environmental change. Globally, this revealed a plankton interactome self-organized latitudinally into marine biomes (Trades, Westerlies, Polar), and more connected poleward. Integrated niche modeling revealed biome-specific community interactome responses to environmental change, and forecasted most affected lineages for each community. These results provide baseline approaches to assess community structure and organismal interactions under climate scenarios, while identifying plausible plankton bioindicators for ocean monitoring of climate change.",

    "abstract": "O_LIEcological networks are valuable for ecosystem analysis but their use is often limited by a lack of data because many types of ecological interaction, e.g. predation, are short-lived and difficult to observe or detect. There are different methods for inferring the presence of interactions, which we lack methods to predict interaction strengths and so use weighted network analysis.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we develop a trait-based approach suitable for creating quantitative networks, i.e. with varying interaction strengths. We developed the method for seed-feeding carabid ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) although the principles can be applied to other interactions.\nC_LIO_LIWe used existing literature data from experimental seed-feeding trials to predict a per-individual interaction cost index based on carabid and seed size with frequency-dependent prey selection and assuming bottom up control. This was scaled up to the population level to create predicted inferred weighted networks using the abundance of carabids and seeds in samples from arable fields and energetic intake rates of carabids from the literature. From these weighted networks, we also calculated a novel measure of predation pressure.\nC_LIO_LIWe applied it to existing ecological survey data from 255 arable fields with carabid data from pitfall traps and plant seeds from seed rain traps. Analysis of these inferred networks led to testable hypotheses about how networks and predation pressure varied amongst fields.\nC_LIO_LIInferred networks are valuable because (i) they provide null models for the structuring of food webs to test against empirical species interaction data, e.g. DNA analysis of carabid gut regurgitates, and (ii) they allow weighted inferred networks to be constructed whenever we can estimate interactions between species and have ecological census data available. This would permit network analysis even at times and in places when interactions were not directly assessed.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Robber flies or assassin flies (Diptera: Asilidae) are a diverse family of venomous predators. The most recent classification organizes Asilidae into 14 subfamilies based on a comprehensive morphological phylogeny, but many of these have not been supported in a subsequent molecular study using traditional molecular markers. To address questions of monophyly in Asilidae, we leveraged the recently developed Diptera-wide UCE baitset to compile seven datasets comprising 151 robber flies and 146 - 2,508 loci, varying in the extent of missing data. We also studied the behavior of different nodal support metrics, as the non-parametric bootstrap is known to perform poorly with large genomic datasets. Our ML phylogeny was fully resolved and well-supported, but partially incongruent with the coalescent phylogeny. Further examination of the datasets suggested the possibility that GC bias had influenced gene tree inference and subsequent species tree analysis. The subfamilies Brachyrhopalinae, Dasypogoninae, Dioctriinae, Stenopogoninae, Tillobromatinae, Trigonomiminae, and Willistonininae were not recovered as monophyletic in either analysis, consistent with a previous molecular study. The inter-subfamily relationships are summarized as follows: Laphriinae and Dioctriinae (in part) are successively sister to the remaining subfamilies, which form two clades; the first consists of a grade of Stenopogoninae (in part), Willistonininae (in part), Bathypogoninae+Phellinae, Stichopogoninae, Leptogastrinae, Ommatiinae, and Asilinae; the second clade consists of a thoroughly paraphyletic assemblage of genera from Dioctriinae (in part), Trigonomiminae, Stenopogoninae (in part), Tillobromatinae, Brachyrhopalinae, and Dasypogoninae. We find that nodal support does not significantly vary with missing data. Furthermore, the bootstrap appears to overestimate nodal support, as has been reported from many recent studies. Gene concordance and site concordance factors seem to perform better, but may actually underestimate support. We instead recommend quartet concordance as a more appropriate estimator of nodal support. Our comprehensive phylogeny demonstrates that the higher classification of Asilidae is far from settled, and it will provide a much-needed foundation for a thorough revision of the subfamily classification.",

    "abstract": "1In many biological systems, pH can be used as a parameter to understand and study cell dynamics. However, measuring pH in live cell culture is limited by the sensor ion specificity, proximity to the cell surface, and scalability. Commercially available pH sensors are difficult to integrate into a small-scale cell culture system due to their size and are not cost-effective for disposable use. We made PHAIR - a new pH sensor that uses a micro-wire format to measure pH in vitro human airway cell culture. Tungsten micro-wires were used as the working electrodes, and silver micro-wires with a silver/silver chloride coating were used as a pseudo reference electrode. pH sensitivity, in a wide and narrow range, and stability of these sensors were tested in common standard buffer solutions as well as in culture media of human airway epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface in a 24 well cell culture plate. When measuring the pH of cells grown under basal and challenging conditions using PHAIR, cell viability and cytokine responses were not affected. Our results confirm that micro-wires-based sensors have the capacity for miniaturization, and detection of diverse ions while maintaining sensitivity. This suggests the broad application of PHAIR in various biological experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "Here, a method for label-free, real-time interrogation, monitoring, detection and sorting of biological rare cells in magnetically-suspended heterogeneous samples is developed. To achieve this, heterogeneous populations of cells were levitated and confined in a microcapillary channel. This strategy enables spatiotemporal differential magnetic levitation of rare fragile dead cells equilibrating at different heights based on the balance between magnetic and corrected gravitational forces. In addition, sorting of fragile rare dead cell populations is monitored in real-time. This technique provides a broadly applicable label-free tool for high resolution, real-time research, as well as forensic evidence processing of rape kits. This method is validated with forensic mock samples dating back to 2003, isolating sperm from epithelial fraction with >90% efficiency and >97% purity. Overall, this method reduces the processing time by over 20-fold down to 20 minutes, eliminating centrifugation and labels, and providing an inexpensive and a high-yield alternative to the current centrifuge-based differential extraction techniques. It can potentially facilitate the forensic downstream genomic analyses, accelerating the identification of suspects, and advancing public safety.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous profiling of multi-omic modalities within a single cell is a grand challenge for single-cell biology. While there have been impressive technical innovations demonstrating feasibility - for example generating paired measurements of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq - wide-spread application of joint profiling is challenging due to the experimental complexity, noise, and cost. Here we introduce BABEL, a deep learning method that translates between the transcriptome and chromatin profiles of a single cell. Leveraging a novel interoperable neural network model, BABEL can generate scRNA-seq directly from a cells scATAC-seq, and vice versa. This makes it possible to computationally synthesize paired multi-omic measurements when only one modality is experimentally available. Across several paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets in human and mouse, we validate that BABEL accurately translates between these modalities for individual cells. BABEL also generalizes well to new biological contexts not seen during training. For example, starting from scATAC-seq of patient derived basal cell carcinoma (BCC), BABEL generated scRNA-seq that enabled fine-grained classification of complex cell states, despite having never seen BCC data. These predictions are comparable to analyses of the experimental BCC scRNA-seq data. We further show that BABEL can incorporate additional single-cell data modalities, such as CITE-seq, thus enabling translation across chromatin, RNA, and protein. BABEL offers a powerful approach for data exploration and hypothesis generation.",

    "abstract": "Batch effect correction is an essential step in the integrative analysis of multiple single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. One state-of-the-art strategy for batch effect correction is via unsupervised or supervised detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs). However, both two kinds of methods only detect MNNs across batches on the top of uncorrected data, where the large batch effect may affect the MNN search. To address this issue, we presented iSMNN, a batch effect correction approach via iterative supervised MNN refinement across data after correction. Our benchmarking on both simulation and real datasets showed the advantages of the iterative refinement of MNNs on the performance of correction. Compared to popular alternative methods, our iSMNN is able to better mix the cells of the same cell type across batches. In addition, iSMNN can also facilitate the identification of differentially expression genes (DEGs) relevant to the biological function of certain cell types. These results indicated that iSMNN will be a valuable method for integrating multiple scRNA-seq datasets that can facilitate biological and medical studies at single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Computational approaches for accurate prediction of drug interactions, such as drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and drug-target interactions (DTIs), are highly demanded for biochemical researchers due to the efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Despite the fact that many methods have been proposed and developed to predict DDIs and DTIs respectively, their success is still limited due to a lack of systematic evaluation of the intrinsic properties embedded in the corresponding chemical structure. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework, named DeepDrug, to overcome the above limitation by using residual graph convolutional networks (RGCNs) and convolutional networks (CNNs) to learn the comprehensive structural and sequential representations of drugs and proteins in order to boost the DDIs and DTIs prediction accuracy. We benchmark our methods in a series of systematic experiments, including binary-class DDIs, multi-class/multi-label DDIs, binary-class DTIs classification and DTIs regression tasks using several datasets. We then demonstrate that DeepDrug outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness in predicting DDIs and DTIs with multiple experimental settings. Furthermore, we visualize the structural features learned by DeepDrug RGCN module, which displays compatible and accordant patterns in chemical properties and drug categories, providing additional evidence to support the strong predictive power of DeepDrug. Ultimately, we apply DeepDrug to perform drug repositioning on the whole DrugBank database to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2, where 3 out of 5 top-ranked drugs are reported to be repurposed to potentially treat COVID-19. To sum up, we believe that DeepDrug is an efficient tool in accurate prediction of DDIs and DTIs and provides a promising insight in understanding the underlying mechanism of these biochemical relations.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe success of modern farming and plant breeding relies on accurate and efficient collection of data. For a commercial organization that manages large amounts of crops, collecting accurate and consistent data is a bottleneck. Due to limited time and labor, accurately phenotyping crops to record color, head count, height, weight, etc. is severely limited. However, this information, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, is vital for developing new superior crop species that help feed the worlds growing population. Recent advances in machine learning, in particular deep learning, have shown promise in mitigating this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for counting on-ear corn kernels in-field to aid in the gathering of real-time data and, ultimately, to improve decision making to maximize yield. We name this approach DeepCorn, and show that this framework is robust under various conditions and can accurately and efficiently count corn kernels. We also adopt a semi-supervised learning approach to further improve the performance of our proposed method. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "MotivationShedding light on the relationships between protein se-quences and functions is a challenging task with many implications in protein evolution, diseases understanding, and protein design. Protein sequence / function space is however hard to comprehend due to its com-plexity. Generative models help to decipher complex systems thanks to their abilities to learn and recreate data specificity. Applied to protein sequences, they can point out relationships between protein positions and functions capture the sequence patterns associated with functions or navigate through uncharted area of molecular evolution.\n\nResultsIn this study, an unsupervised generative approach based on adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) is proposed to generate and explore new sequences with respect to their functions thanks to the prior distribution allowing a continuous exploration of the latent space. AAEs are tested on three protein families known for their multiple functions. Clustering re-sults on the encoded sequences from the latent space computed by AAEs display high level of homogeneity regarding the protein sequence func-tions. The study also reports and analyzes for the first time two sampling strategies based on latent space interpolation and latent space arithmetic to generate intermediate protein sequences sharing sequential and functional properties of original sequences issued from different families and functions. Generated sequences by interpolation between latent space data points demonstrate the ability of the AAE to generalize and to pro-duce meaningful biological sequences from an evolutionary uncharted area of the biological sequence space. Finally, 3D structure models generated by comparative modelling between different combinations of structures of different sub-families and of generated sequences from latent space or sub-family sequences point out to the ability of the latent space arithmetic to successfully transfer functional properties between sub-families. All in all this study confirms the ability of deep learning frameworks to model biological complexity and bring new tools to explore amino acid sequence and functional spaces.\n\nAvailabilityCode and data used for this study are freely available at https://github.com/T-B-F/aae4seq.\n\nContacttristan@bitardfeildel.fr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at online.",

    "abstract": "Many complex genomic rearrangements arise through template switch errors, which occur in DNA replication when there is a transient polymerase switch to an alternate template nearby in three-dimensional space. While typically investigated at kilobase-to-megabase scales, the genomic and evolutionary consequences of this mutational process are not well characterised at smaller scales, where they are often interpreted as clusters of independent substitutions, insertions and deletions. Here we present an improved statistical approach using pair hidden Markov models, and use it to detect and describe short-range template switches underlying clusters of mutations in the multi-way alignment of hominid genomes. Using robust statistics derived from evolutionary genomic simulations, we show that template switch events have been widespread in the evolution of the great apes genomes and provide a parsimonious explanation for the presence of many complex mutation clusters in their phylogenetic context. Larger-scale mechanisms of genome rearrangement are typically associated with structural features around breakpoints, and accordingly we show that atypical patterns of secondary structure formation and DNA bending are present at the initial template switch loci. Our methods improve on previous non-probabilistic approaches for computational detection of template switch mutations, allowing the statistical significance of events to be assessed. By specifying realistic evolutionary parameters based on the genomes and taxa involved, our methods can be readily adapted to other intra- or inter-species comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Claims for the widespread preservation of fossilized biomolecules in many fossil animals have recently been reported in six studies, based on Raman microspectroscopy. Here, we show that the putative Raman signatures of organic compounds in these fossils are actually instrumental artefacts resulting from intense background luminescence. Raman spectroscopy relies upon the detection of photons scattered inelastically by matter as a result of its interaction with a laser beam. For many natural materials, this interaction also generates a luminescence signal that is often orders of magnitude more intense than the light produced by Raman scattering. Such luminescence, coupled with the transmission properties of the spectrometer, induced quasi-periodic ripples in the measured spectra that have been incorrectly interpreted as Raman signatures of organic molecules. Although several analytical strategies have been developed to overcome this common issue, Raman microspectroscopy as used in the studies questioned here cannot be used to identify fossil biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, which is the largest class of membrane proteins in the human genome. As part of the endocannabinoid system, they have many regulatory functions in the human body. Their malfunction therefore triggers a diverse set of undesired conditions, such as pain, neuropathy, nephropathy, pruritus, osteoporosis, cachexia and Alzheimers disease. Although drugs targeting the system exist, the molecular and functional mechanisms involved are still poorly understood, preventing the development of better therapeutics with fewer undesired effects. One path toward the development of better and safer medicines targeting cannabinoid receptors relies on the ability of some compounds to activate a subset of pathways engaged by the receptor while sparing or even inhibiting the others, a phenomenon known as biased signaling. To take advantage of this phenomenon for drug development, a better profiling of the pathways engaged by the receptors is required. Using a BRET-based signaling detection platform, we systematically analyzed the primary signaling cascades activated by CB1 and CB2 receptors, including 9 G protein and 2 {beta}-arrestin subtypes. Given that biased signaling is driven by ligand-specific distinct active conformations of the receptor, establishing a link between the signaling profiles elicited by different drugs and their chemotypes may help designing compounds that selectively activate beneficial pathways while avoiding those leading to undesired effects. We screened a selection of 35 structurally diverse ligands, including endocannabinoids, phytocannabinoids and synthetic compounds structurally similar or significantly different from natural cannabinoids. Our data show that biased signaling is a prominent feature of the cannabinoid receptor system and that, as predicted, ligands with different chemotypes have distinct signaling profiles. The study therefore allows for better understanding of cannabinoid receptors signaling and provides the information about tool compounds that can now be used to link signaling pathways to biological outcomes, aiding the design of improved therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Tomato, an important fruit crop worldwide, requires efficient sugar allocation for fruit development. However, molecular mechanisms for sugar import to fruits remain poorly understood. Expression of SWEET (Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters) proteins is closely linked with hexose ratio in tomato fruits and may be involved in sugar allocation. Here, using quantitative PCR, we discovered that SlSWEET15 was highly expressed in developing fruits compared to vegetative organs. Based on in situ hybridization and GUS fusion analyses, SlSWEET15 proteins accumulated in vascular tissues and seed coats, major sites of sucrose unloading in fruits. Localizing SlSWEET15-GFP to the plasma membrane supported its putative role in apoplasmic sucrose unloading. The sucrose transport activity of SlSWEET15 was confirmed by complementary growth assays in a yeast mutant. Elimination of the SlSWEET15 function by CRISPR/cas9 gene editing significantly decreased average sizes and weights of fruits, with severe defects in seed filling and embryo development. Together, we confirmed the role of SlSWEET15 in mediating sucrose efflux from the releasing phloem to the fruit apoplasm and subsequent import into parenchyma cells during fruit development. Furthermore, SlSWEET15-mediated sucrose efflux was also required for sucrose unloading from the seed coat to the developing embryo.\n\nOne-sentence SummarySlSWEET15, a specific sucrose uniporter in tomato, mediates apoplasmic sucrose unloading from releasing phloem cells and seed coat for carbon supply during fruit expansion and seed filling.",

    "abstract": "Automatizing phenotype measurement is needed to increase plant breeding efficiency. Morphological traits are relevant in many fruit breeding programs, as appearance influences consumer preference. Often, these traits are manually or semi-automatically obtained. Yet, fruit morphology evaluation can be boosted by resorting to fully automatized procedures and digital images provide a cost-effective opportunity for this purpose. Here, we present an automatized pipeline for comprehensive phenomic and genetic analysis of morphology traits extracted from internal and external strawberry images. The pipeline segments, classifies and labels the images, extracts conformation features, including linear (area, perimeter, height, width, circularity, shape descriptor, ratio between height and width) and multivariate (Fourier Elliptical components and Generalized Procrustes) statistics. Internal color patterns are obtained using an autoencoder to smooth out the image. In addition, we develop a variational autoencoder to automatically detect the most likely number of underlying shapes. Bayesian modeling is employed to estimate both additive and dominant effects for all traits. As expected, conformational traits are clearly heritable. Interestingly, dominance variance is higher than the additive component for most of the traits. Overall, we show that fruit shape and color can be quickly and automatically evaluated and is moderately heritable. Although we study the strawberry species, the algorithm can be applied to other fruits, as shown in the GitHub repository https://github.com/lauzingaretti/DeepAFS.",

    "abstract": "To make optimal decisions in uncertain circumstances flexible adaption of behaviour is required; exploring alternatives when the best choice is unknown, exploiting what is known when that is best. Using a detailed computational model of the basal ganglia, we propose that switches between exploratory and exploitative decisions can be mediated by the interaction between tonic dopamine and cortical input to the basal ganglia. We show that a biologically detailed action selection circuit model of the basal ganglia, endowed with dopamine dependant striatal plasticity, can optimally solve the explore-exploit problem, estimating the true underlying state of a noisy Gaussian diffusion process. Critical to the models performance was a fluctuating level of tonic dopamine which increased under conditions of uncertainty. With an optimal range of tonic dopamine, explore-exploit decision making was mediated by the effects of tonic dopamine on the precision of the model action selection mechanism. Under conditions of uncertain reward pay-out, the models reduced selectivity allowed disinhibition of multiple alternative actions to be explored at random. Conversely, when uncertainly about reward pay-out was low, enhanced selectivity of the action selection circuit was enhanced, facilitating exploitation of the high value choice. When integrated with phasic dopamine dependant influences on cortico-striatal plasticity, the models performance was at the level of the Kalman filter which provides an optimal solution for the task. Our model provides an integrative account of the relationship between phasic and tonic dopamine and the action selection function of the basal ganglia and supports the idea that this subcortical neural circuit may have evolved to facilitate decision making in non-stationary reward environments, allowing a number of experimental predictions with relevance to abnormal decision making in neuropsychiatric and neurological disease.",

    "abstract": "People with central vision loss (CVL) due to macular degeneration are forced to rely on their residual peripheral vision and often develop a preferred retinal locus (PRL), a region of intact peripheral retina that is used for fixation. At the PRL, visual processing is impaired due to crowding (cluttering of visual objects). The problem of crowding still persists when images are magnified to account for the lower resolution of peripheral vision. We assessed whether anodal transcranial direct stimulation (a-tDCS), a neuro-modulation technique that alters cortical inhibition, would reduce collinear inhibition (an early component of crowding) when applied to the visual cortex in patients with CVL. Our results showed that applying a-tDCS to the visual cortex for 20mins reduced crowding in three patients with CVL and that the effect was sustained for up to 30mins. Sham stimulation delivered in a separate session had no effect. These initial observations mandate further research into the use of a-tDCS to enhance cortical processing of residual retinal input in patients with CVL.",

    "abstract": "Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a population of innate-like T cells that utilise a semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR)  chain and are restricted by the highly conserved antigen presenting molecule MR1. MR1 presents microbial riboflavin biosynthesis derived metabolites produced by bacteria and fungi. Consistent with their ability to sense ligands derived from bacterial sources, MAIT cells have been associated with the immune response to a variety of bacterial infections, such as Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli. To date, MAIT cells have been studied in humans, non-human primates and mice. However, they have only been putatively identified in cattle by PCR based methods; no phenotypic or functional analyses have been performed. Here, we identified a MAIT cell population in cattle utilising MR1 tetramers and high-throughput TCR sequencing. Phenotypic analysis of cattle MAIT cells revealed features highly analogous to those of MAIT cells in humans and mice, including expression of an orthologous TRAV1-TRAJ33 TCR  chain, an effector memory phenotype irrespective of tissue localisation, and expression of the transcription factors PLZF and EOMES. We determined the frequency of MAIT cells in peripheral blood and multiple tissues, finding that cattle MAIT cells are enriched in mucosal tissues as well as in the mesenteric lymph node. Cattle MAIT cells were responsive to stimulation by 5-OP-RU and riboflavin biosynthesis competent bacteria in vitro. Furthermore, MAIT cells in milk increased in frequency in cows with mastitis. Following challenge with virulent Mycobacterium bovis, a causative agent of bovine tuberculosis and a zoonosis, peripheral blood MAIT cells expressed higher levels of perforin. Thus MAIT cells are implicated in the immune response to two major bacterial infections in cattle. These data suggest that MAIT cells are functionally highly conserved and that cattle are an excellent large animal model to study the role of MAIT cells in important zoonotic infections.",

    "abstract": "Lymphocyte biology research commonly involves purification of lymphocyte subpopulations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or immunomagnetic separation (IMS), both of which typically rely on antibody labeling of validated cell markers. Methods enabling label-free segregation of lymphocyte subpopulations would be invaluable with regard to less-perturbation, simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Here, we introduce TRuST, a label-free approach for T cell reconstitution using side-scatter (SSC). TRuST-sorted SSClow cells enrich for CD4+ T and naive T cells, while SSChigh cells enrich for CD8+ T, NK and differentiated T cells. Enrichment purity can be improved by computational gate design. SSClow cells have superior expansion capacity and generate more central memory precursors with naive-resembling cytokine responses. Moreover, we find that both T cell differentiation status and CD4/CD8 T ratio in the starting cellular material are critical attributes predicting T cell product quality and quantity. TRuST presents an effective and reliable technique for label-free lymphocytes selection and reconstitution.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that ensure the reproducible generation of neuronal diversity in the vertebrate nervous system are incompletely understood. Here we provide evidence of a temporal patterning program consisting of cohorts of transcription factors expressed in neurons generated at successive developmental timepoints. This program acts in parallel to spatial patterning, diversifying neurons throughout the nervous system and in neurons differentiated in-vitro from stem cells. We demonstrate the TGF{beta} signalling pathway controls the pace of the temporal program. Furthermore, targeted perturbation of components of the temporal program, Nfia and Nfib, reveals their requirement for the generation of late-born neuronal subtypes. Together, our results provide evidence for the existence of a previously unappreciated global temporal program of neuronal subtype identity and suggest that the integration of spatial and temporal patterning programs diversifies and organises neuronal subtypes in the vertebrate nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Neurotransmitter release occurs either synchronously with action potentials (evoked release) or spontaneously (spontaneous release). Whether the molecular mechanisms underlying evoked and spontaneous release are identical, especially whether voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) can trigger spontaneous events, is still a matter of debate in glutamatergic synapses. To elucidate this issue, we characterized the VGCC dependence of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in various synapses with different coupling distances between VGCCs and synaptic vesicles, known as a critical factor in evoked release. We found that most of the extracellular calcium-dependent mEPSCs were attributable to VGCCs in cultured autaptic hippocampal neurons and the mature calyx of Held where VGCCs and vesicles were tightly coupled. Among loosely coupled synapses, mEPSCs were not VGCC-dependent at immature calyx of Held and CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses, whereas VGCCs contribution was significant at CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. Interestingly, the contribution of VGCCs to spontaneous glutamate release in CA3 pyramidal neurons was abolished by a calmodulin antagonist, calmidazolium. These data suggest that coupling distance between VGCCs and vesicles determines VGCC dependence of spontaneous release at tightly coupled synapses, yet VGCC contribution can be achieved indirectly at loosely coupled synapses.\n\nHighlightsO_LIExtracellular Ca2+ -dependent spontaneous glutamate release is mediated by VGCCs.\nC_LIO_LICa2+ cooperativity of spontaneous and evoked release is comparable.\nC_LIO_LISynapses at different areas and ages show distinct VGCC dependence on mini events.\nC_LIO_LINanodomain coupling between VGCCs and Ca2+ sensors determines VGCC dependence.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAerosolization of respiratory droplets is considered the main route of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, reducing the viral load of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shed via respiratory droplets is potentially an ideal strategy to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The in vitro virucidal activity of intranasal Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) has been demonstrated recently to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titres. This study evaluated the virucidal activity of the aqueous solution of Iodine-V (a clathrate complex formed by elemental iodine and fulvic acid) as in Essential Iodine Drops (EID) with 200 g elemental iodine/ml content against SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain whether it is a better alternative to PVP-I.\n\nMethodsSARS-CoV-2 (USAWA1/2020 strain) virus stock was prepared by infecting Vero 76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587) until cytopathic effect (CPE). The virucidal activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in three dilutions (1:1; 2:1 and 3:1) in triplicates by incubating at room temperature (22 {+/-} 2{degrees}C) for either 60 or 90 seconds. The surviving viruses from each sample were quantified by a standard end-point dilution assay.\n\nResultsEID (200 g iodine/ml) after exposure for 60 and 90 seconds was compared to controls. In both cases, the viral titre was reduced by 99% (LRV 2.0). The 1:1 dilution of EID with virus reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus from 31,623 cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCCID50) to 316 CCID50 within 90 seconds.\n\nConclusionSubstantial reductions in LRV by Iodine-V in EID confirmed the activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, demonstrating that Iodine-V in EID is effective at inactivating the virus in vitro and therefore suggesting its potential application intranasally to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.",

The enzyme is essential for the proliferation and pathogenicity of the parasite as well as its ability to overcome the blood-brain barrier of the host. Lysosomal cathepsins are expressed as zymogens with an inactivating pro-domain that is cleaved under acidic conditions. A structure of the uncleaved maturation intermediate from a trypanosomal cathepsin L-like protease is currently not available. We thus established the heterologous expression of T. brucei rhodesiense pro-rhodesain in E. coli and determined its crystal structure. The trypanosomal pro-domain differs from non-parasitic pro-cathepsins by a unique, extended -helix that blocks the active site and whose interactions resemble that of the antiprotozoal inhibitor K11777. Interdomain dynamics between pro- and core protease domain as observed by photoinduced electron transfer fluorescence correlation spectroscopy increase at low pH, where pro-rhodesain also undergoes autocleavage. Using the crystal structure, molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis, we identify a conserved interdomain salt bridge that prevents premature intramolecular cleavage at higher pH values and may thus present a control switch for the observed pH-sensitivity of pro-enzyme cleavage in (trypanosomal) CathL-like proteases.",

    "abstract": "There are distinguishing features or \"hallmarks\" of cancer that are found across tumors, individuals, and types of cancer, and these hallmarks can be driven by specific genetic mutations. Yet, within a single tumor there is often extensive genetic heterogeneity as evidenced by single-cell and bulk DNA sequencing data. The goal of this work is to jointly infer the underlying genotypes of tumor subpopulations and the distribution of those subpopulations in individual tumors by integrating single-cell and bulk sequencing data. Understanding the genetic composition of the tumor at the time of treatment is important in the personalized design of targeted therapeutic combinations and monitoring for possible recurrence after treatment.\n\nWe propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model that incorporates the correlation structure induced by a structured sampling arrangement and we show that this model improves the quality of inference. We develop a representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior as a Gamma-Poisson hierarchy and we use this representation to derive a fast Gibbs sampling inference algorithm using the augment-and-marginalize method. Experiments with simulation data show that our model outperforms standard numerical and statistical methods for decomposing admixed count data. Analyses of real acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer sequencing dataset shows that our model improves upon state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods. An interpretation of the results of our model on this real dataset reveals co-mutated loci across samples.",

    "abstract": "Sexual stimuli processing is a key element in the repertoire of human affective and motivational states. Previous neuroimaging studies of sexual stimulus processing have revealed a complicated mosaic of activated regions, leaving unresolved questions about their sensitivity and specificity to sexual stimuli per se, generalizability across individuals, and potential utility as neuromarkers for sexual stimulus processing. In this study, data on sexual, negative, non-sexual positive, and neutral images from Wehrum et al. (2013) (N = 100) were re-analyzed with multivariate Support Vector Machine models to create the Brain Activation-based Sexual Image Classifier (BASIC) model. This model was tested for sensitivity, specificity, and generalizability in cross-validation (N = 100) and an independent test cohort (N = 18; Kragel et al. 2019). The BASIC model showed highly accurate performance (94-100%) in classifying sexual versus neutral or nonsexual affective images in both datasets. Virtual lesions and test of individual large-scale networks (e.g.,  visual or  attention networks) show that these individual networks are neither necessary nor sufficient to capture sexual stimulus processing. These findings suggest that brain responses to sexual stimuli constitute a category of mental event that is distinct from general affect and involves multiple brain networks. It is, however, largely conserved across individuals, permitting the development of neuromarkers for sexual processing in individual persons. Future studies could assess performance of BASIC to a broader array of affective/motivational stimuli and link brain responses with physiological and subjective measures of sexual arousal.",

    "abstract": "Nerve regeneration is associated with plasticity of sensory neurons, so that even muscle afferents directed to skin form mechanosensitive receptive fields appropriate for the new target. STOML3 is an essential mechanotransduction component in many cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Here we asked whether STOML3 is required for functional and anatomical plasticity following peripheral nerve regeneration. We used a cross-anastomosis model adapted to the mouse in which the medial gastrocnemius nerve was redirected to innervate hairy skin previously occupied by the sural nerve. We recorded from muscle afferents innervating the skin and found that in wild-type mice their receptive properties were largely identical to normal skin mechanoreceptors. However, in mice lacking STOML3, muscle afferents largely failed to form functional mechanosensitive receptive fields, despite making anatomically appropriate endings in the skin. Our tracing experiments demonstrated that muscle afferents from both wild-type and stoml3 mutant mice display remarkable anatomically plasticity, forming new somatotopically appropriate synaptic terminals in the region of the dorsal horn representing the sural nerve territory. The dramatic reduction in stimulus evoked activity from the cross-anastomosed gastrocnemius nerve in stoml3 mutant mice did not prevent central anatomical plasticity. Our results have identified a molecular factor that is required for functional plasticity following peripheral nerve injury.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian gut contains trillions of microbes that interact with host cells and monitor changes in the environment. Opportunistic pathogens exploit environmental conditions to stimulate their growth and virulence, leading to a resurgence of chronic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current therapies are effective in less than 30% of patients due to the lack of adherence to prescription schedules and overall, off-target effects. Smart microbial therapeutics can be engineered to colonize the gut, providing in situ surveillance and conditional disease modulation. However, many current engineered microbes can only respond to single gut environmental factors, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we implement the previously characterized split activator AND logic gate in the probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917. Our system can respond to two input signals: the inflammatory biomarker tetrathionate and a second input signal, IPTG. We report 4-6 fold induction with minimal leak when both signals are present. We model the dynamics of the AND gate using chemical reaction networks, and by tuning parameters in silico, we identified perturbations that affect our circuits selectivity. We anticipate that our results will prove useful for designing living therapeutics for spatial targeting and signal processing in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling pathways are responsible for decision making that sustains life. Most signaling pathways include post-translational modification cycles, that process multiple inputs and are tightly interconnected. Here we consider a model for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles, and we show that under some assumptions they can operate as molecular neurons or perceptrons, that generate sigmoidal-like activation functions by processing sums of inputs with positive and negative weights. We carry out a steady-state and structural stability analysis for single molecular perceptrons as well as for feedforward interconnections, concluding that interconnected phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles may work as multi-layer biomolecular neural networks (BNNs) with the capacity to perform a variety of computations. As an application, we design signaling networks that behave as linear and non-linear classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Anti-disease breeding is becoming the most promising solution to cyprinid herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3) infection, the major threat to common carp aquaculture. Virus challenging studies suggested that a breeding strain of common carp is resistant to this disease. This study illustrates the immune mechanisms involved in anti-CyHV-3 ability. An integrative analysis of the protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) using transcriptomic data was performed. Tissues from the head kidney of common carp were extracted at day 0 (the healthy control) and day 7 after CyHV-3 infection (the survivors), and used to analyze the transcriptome through both Illumina and PacBio sequencing. Following analysis of the GO terms and KEGG pathways involved, the immune-related terms and pathways were merged. In order to dig out details in the immune aspect, The DEGs were filtered using the current common carp immune gene library. Immune gene categories and their corresponding genes in different comparison groups were revealed. Also, the immunological Gene Ontology terms for lncRNA modulation were retained. The weighted gene co-XSexpression network analysis was used to reveal the regulation of immune genes by lncRNA. The results demonstrated that the breeding carp strain develops marked resistance to CyHV-3 through a specific innate immune mechanism. The featured biological processes were autophagy, phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, and virus blockage by lectins and MUC3. Moreover, the immune suppressive signals, such as suppression of IL21R on STAT3, PI3K mediated inhibition on inflammation by dopamine upon infection, as well as the inhibition of NLRC3 on STING during a steady state. Possible susceptible factors for CyHV-3, such as ITGB1, TLR18, and CCL4, were also revealed from the non-breeding strain. The results of this study also suggested that Nramp and PAI regulated by LncRNA could facilitate virus infection and proliferation for infected cells respectively, while T cell leukemia homeobox 3 (TLX3) as well as galectin 3 function by lncRNA may play a role in the resistance mechanism. Therefore, immune factors that are immunogenetically insensitive or susceptible to CyHV-3 infection have been revealed.",

Here, we identified an inducible population of CD127-expressing human monocytes under inflammatory conditions and named the subset M127. M127 is nearly absent in healthy individuals yet abundantly present in patients with infectious and inflammatory conditions such as COVID-19 and rheumatoid arthritis. Multiple genomic and functional approaches revealed unique gene signatures of M127 and unified anti-inflammatory properties imposed by the CD127-STAT5 axis. M127 expansion correlated with mild COVID-19 disease outcomes. Thereby, we phenotypically and molecularly characterized a human monocyte subset marked by CD127 that retained anti-inflammatory properties within the pro-inflammatory environments, uncovering remarkable functional diversity among monocytes and signifying M127 as a potential therapeutic target for human inflammatory disorders.",

    "abstract": "Viral respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, the transmission routes and shedding kinetics of respiratory viruses remain poorly understood. Air sampling techniques to quantify infectious viruses in the air are indispensable to improve intervention strategies to control and prevent spreading of respiratory viruses. Here, the collection of infectious virus with the six-stage Andersen cascade impactor was optimized with semi-solid gelatin as collection surface. Subsequently, the collection efficiency of the cascade impactor, the SKC BioSampler, and an in-house developed electrostatic precipitator was compared. In an in-vitro setup, influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus were nebulized and the amount of collected infectious virus and viral RNA was quantified with each air sampler. Whereas only low amounts of virus were collected using the electrostatic precipitator, high amounts were collected with the BioSampler and cascade impactor. The BioSampler allowed straight-forward sampling in liquid medium, whereas the more laborious cascade impactor allowed size fractionation of virus-containing particles. Depending on the research question, either the BioSampler or the cascade impactor can be applied in laboratory and field settings, such as hospitals to gain more insight into the transmission routes of respiratory viruses.\n\nPractical ImplicationsRespiratory viruses pose a continuous health threat, especially to vulnerable groups such as young children, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. It is important to understand via which routes these viruses can transmit to and between individuals that are at risk. If we can determine the amount of a certain respiratory virus in the air, then this will help to predict the importance of transmission through the air for this virus. Most currently available air sampling devices have not been designed to collect infectious viruses from the air. Therefore, we here optimized and compared the performance of three air samplers for four different respiratory viruses.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell walls are essential barriers that protect bacteria against the onslaught of potentially lethal molecules from the outside. Small molecule therapeutics, proteins from bacterial foes, and host immune proteins must navigate past a dense layer of bacterial biomacromolecules (e.g., capsular proteins, teichoic acids, and anchored proteins) to reach the peptidoglycan (PG) layer of Gram-positive bacteria. A subclass of molecules (e.g., antibiotics with intracellular targets) must also permeate through the PG (in a molecular sieving manner) to reach the cytoplasmic membrane. In the case of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), teichoic acids are the major biopolymers that decorate bacterial cell surfaces. Despite the biological and therapeutic importance of surface accessibility, systematic analyses in live bacterial cells have been lacking. We describe a novel live cell fluorescence assay that reports on the permeability of molecules to and within the PG scaffold. The assay has robust reproducibility, is readily adoptable to any Gram-positive organism, and is compatible with high-throughput sample processing. Analysis of the factors controlling permeability to S. aureus and the methicillin resistant MRSA revealed that molecular flexibility plays a central role in molecular permeability. Moreover, teichoic acids impeded permeability of molecules of a wide range of sizes and chemical composition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTicks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population reside, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from North-Western Nigeria.\n\nMethodsIn 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks were screened molecularly for the detection of Apicomplexan DNA.\n\nResultsA total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, including seven Hyalomma spp. (i.e. Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma impeltatum, Hyalomma impressum, Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma rufipes, Hyalomma truncatum and Hyalomma turanicum), Amblyomma variegatum and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus. All species were present in Zamfara, whereas only five species were found in Sokoto. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76.2%), while H. dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (43.7%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region.\n\nOf 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata, the agent of tropical theileriosis.\n\nConclusionsThis study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from North-Western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum, recorded for the first time in Nigeria, indicates a distribution of this tick beyond Northern Africa.\n\nThis study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigeria. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in North Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from Northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious problem for public health since it was identified in the province of Wuhan (China) and spread around the world producing high mortality rates and economic losses. Nowadays, WHO recognizes traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine for treating COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, we investigated the antiviral potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of Uncaria tomentosa stem bark from Peru against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The antiviral activity of U. tomentosa against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro was assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. After 48h of treatment, U. tomentosa showed an inhibition of 92.7 % of SARS-CoV-2 at 25.0 {micro}g/mL (p<0.0001) by plaque reduction assay on Vero E6 cells. In addition, U. tomentosa, induced a reduction of 98.6 % (p=0.02) and 92.7 % (p=0.03) in the CPE caused by SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells at 25 {micro}g/mL and 12.5 {micro}g/mL, respectively. The EC50 calculated for U. tomentosa extract by plaque reduction assay was 6.6 {micro}g/mL (4.89 - 8.85 {micro}g/mL) for a selectivity index of 4.1. The EC50 calculated for U. tomentosa extract by TCID50 assay was 2.57 {micro}g/mL (1.05 - 3.75 {micro}g/mL) for a selectivity index of 10.54. These results showed that U. tomentosa known as Cats claw has antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 observed as a reduction in the viral titer and CPE after 48h of treatment on Vero E6 cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that U. tomentosa stem bark, could be promissory to the development of new therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Commonly used 16S rRNA gene primers miss much of the archaeal diversity present in the vertebrate gut, leaving open the question of which archaea are host associated, the specificities of such associations, and the major factors influencing archaeal diversity. We applied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with Archaea-targeting primers to a dataset of 311 fecal/gut samples spanning 5 taxonomic classes (Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and Actinopterygii) and obtained from mainly wild individuals (76% were wild). We obtained sufficient archaeal sequence data from 185 samples comprising 110 species that span all 5 classes. We provide evidence for novel Archaea-host associations, including Bathyarchaeia and Methanothermobacter -- the latter of which was prevalent among Aves and enriched in higher body temperatures. Host phylogeny more strongly explained archaeal diversity than diet, while specific taxa were associated with each factor. Co-phylogeny was significant and strongest for mammalian herbivores. Methanobacteria was the only class predicted to be present in the last command ancestors of mammals and all host species. Archaea-Bacteria interactions seem to have a limited effect on archaeal diversity. These findings substantially expand on the paradigm of Archaea-vertebrate associations and the factors that explain those associations.\n\nSignificanceArchaea play key roles in the vertebrate gut such as promoting bacterial fermentation via consumption of waste products. Moreover, gut-inhabiting methanogenic Archaea in livestock are a substantial source of greenhouse gas production. Still, much is not known of the archaeal diversity in most vertebrates, especially since 16S rRNA sequence surveys often miss much of the archaeal diversity that is present. By applying Archaea-targeted gut microbiome sequencing to a large collection of diverse vertebrates, we reveal new Archaea-host associations such as a high prevalence of Methanothermobacter in birds. We also show that host evolutionary history explains archaeal diversity better than diet, and certain genera in one particular class of Archaea (Methanobacteria) were likely pervasive in the ancestral vertebrate gut.",

    "abstract": "The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) constitutes a large supergroup of mostly uncultured bacterial lineages discovered through metabarcoding and metagenomics in diverse environments. Having small cell sizes, reduced genomes, and limited biosynthetic capabilities, they are thought to be symbionts of other organisms from which they obtain essential biomolecules. However, the nature of this symbiosis (mutualistic, neutral, or parasitic) has been ascertained only for rare cultured members of the CPR phylum Saccharibacteria, which are epibiotic parasites of other bacteria. Here, we characterize the biology and the genome of Vampirococcus lugosii, which becomes the first described species of Vampirococcus, a genus of epibiotic bacteria morphologically identified decades ago. Vampirococcus belongs to the CPR phylum Absconditabacteria. It feeds on anoxygenic photosynthetic gammaproteobacteria, fully absorbing their cytoplasmic content. The cells divide epibiotically, forming multicellular stalks whose apical cells can more easily reach new hosts. Vampirococcus genome is small (1.3 Mbp) and highly reduced in biosynthetic metabolism genes. However, it is enriched in genes related to an elaborate, fibrous cell surface likely involved in complex interactions with the host. Comparative genomic analyses show that gene loss has been continuous during Absconditabacteria, and generally most CPR bacteria, evolution. Nonetheless, gene loss was compensated by gene acquisition by horizontal gene transfer and evolution de novo. In Vampirococcus, these innovations include new CRISPR-Cas effectors and a novel electron transport chain. Our findings confirm parasitism as a widespread lifestyle of CPR bacteria, which probably play a previously neglected virus-like ecological role in ecosystems, controlling bacterial populations by a unique form of predation.",

DNA was quantified and the V4 segment of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Data were processed to identify the microbial composition and to assess alpha and beta diversity of the samples. Tested DNA isolation kits result in significantly different DNA yields from urine samples but non-significant differences in the number of reads recovered, alpha, or beta diversity. DNA extracted with the Qiagen Biostic Bacteremia and DNeasy Blood & Tissue kits showed the fewest technical issues in downstream analyses, with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit also demonstrating the highest DNA yield.

The NASA Twins Study provided the most comprehensive multi-scale omics data to date from which to extract molecular features of potential clinical significance to spaceflight. From the multivariate data, we identified an elevation of the uremic toxin p-cresol, which is produced by gut microbial fermentation of dietary tyrosine. p-Cresol has adverse metabolic effects via depletion of the hepatic sulfur pool, which impacts metabolism of drugs, endogenous metabolites, and xenobiotics. Moreover, p-cresol reshapes gut microbial community structure by facilitating survival of species such as clostridia and inhibition of butyrate producers. Spaceflight may also impact the genes responsible for the metabolism of p-cresol (e.g. SULT) and for the safe metabolism of common drugs used in space, such as acetaminophen (e.g. SULT, CYP4502E1, GST).

    "abstract": "CIP1-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (CIZ1) forms large assemblies at the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in female fibroblasts in an Xist lncRNA-dependent manner. Here we address the requirements for assembly formation, and show that CIZ1 interacts directly with Xist via two independent domains in its N- and C-terminus. Interaction with Xist repeat E, assembly at Xi in cells, and the complexity of self-assemblies formed in vitro, are all modulated by alternatively-spliced exons that include two glutamine-rich prion-like domains (PLD1 and PLD2), both conditionally excluded from the N-terminal domain. Exclusion of PLD1 alone is sufficient to abrogate de novo establishment of new CIZ1 assemblies and Xi territories enriched for H3K27me3 in CIZ1-null fibroblasts. Together the data suggest that PLD1-driven CIZ1 assemblies form at Xi, are nucleated by interaction with Xist and amplified by multivalent interaction with RNA, so implicating a polyglutamine tract in the maintenance of epigenetic state.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are important for cell-cell communication. Deficiencies in the human dihydroceramide desaturase gene, DEGS1, increase the dihydroceramide-to-ceramide ratio and causes hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. However, the disease mechanism remains unknown. Here, we developed an in vivo assay with spatially controlled expression of exosome markers in Drosophila eye imaginal discs and showed that the level and activity of the DEGS1 ortholog, ifc, correlated with exosome production. Knocking out ifc decreased the density of the exosome precursor intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in the multivesicular endosomes and reduced the number of exosomes released. While ifc overexpression and autophagy inhibition both enhanced exosome production, combining the two had no additive effect. Moreover, DEGS1 activity was sufficient to drive ILV formation in vitro. Together, DEGS1/Ifc controls the dihydroceramide-to-ceramide ration and enhances exosome secretion by promoting ILV formation and preventing the autophagic degradation of MVEs.\n\nThese findings provide a potential cause for the neuropathy associated with DEGS1-deficient mutations.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/376046v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7479corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12e7f46org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5e7f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e7f08_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAn in vivo system was developed for observing exosome production in Drosophila.\nC_LIO_LIDihydroceramide desaturase (DEGS1/Ifc) promotes exosome production by two means.\nC_LIO_LIIfc drives membrane invagination to promote the formation of intraluminal vesicles.\nC_LIO_LIIfc inhibits autophagic degradation of MVEs and increases exosome release.\nC_LI\n\neTOC BlurbThe level and activity of dihydroceramide desaturase (human DEGS1 and Drosophila Ifc) correlate with exosome production.

    "abstract": "During development, multicellular organisms undergo stereotypical patterns of tissue growth to yield organs of highly reproducible sizes and shapes. How this process is orchestrated remains unclear. Analysis of the temporal dynamics of tissue growth in the Drosophila abdomen reveals that cell cycle times are spatially correlated and that growth termination occurs through the rapid emergence of a population of arrested cells rather than a gradual slowing down of cell cycle time. Reduction in apical tension associated with tissue crowding has been proposed as a developmental growth termination mechanism. Surprisingly, we find that growth arrest in the abdomen occurs while apical tension increases, showing that in this tissue a reduction in tension does not underlie the mechanism of growth arrest. However, remodeling of the extracellular matrix is necessary for tissue expansion. Thus, changes in the tissue microenvironment, and a rapid exit from proliferation, control the formation of the adult Drosophila abdomen.",

Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections, and transcriptomic alterations reported in COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very long-lasting transcriptomic changes that, unsurprisingly, mimic viral infections by upregulated antiviral defense response, and, counterintuitively. oppose viral infections by downregulated myeloid cell activation.

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent and widespread of the human malaria parasite species. This parasite has a complex life cycle that involves sexual replication in a mosquito vector and asexual replication in a human host. During the 48-hour intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), parasites develop and multiply through the morphologically distinct ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Stage-specific transcriptomic approaches have shown gene expression profiles continually change throughout the IDC. Cultures of tightly synchronized parasites are required to capture the transcriptome specific to a developmental stage. However, the most commonly used synchronization methods require lysis of late stages, potentially perturbing transcription, and often do not result in tightly synchronized cultures. To produce complete transcriptome profiles of the IDC a synchronous culture requires frequent sampling over a 48-hour period, this is both time consuming and labor intensive. Here we develop a method to sample the IDC densely by isolating parasites from an asynchronous culture with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). We sort parasites in tight windows of IDC progression based on their DNA/RNA abundance. We confirmed the tight synchronization and stage specificity by light microscopy and RNAseq profiling. We optimized our protocol for low numbers of sorted cells allowing us to rapidly capture transcriptome profiles across the entire IDC from a single culture flask. This methodology will allow malaria stage-specific studies to perform experiments directly from asynchronous cultures with high accuracy and without the need for labor-intensive time-course experiments.",

Here, we report the identification of a synthetic nanobody (sybody) pair (Sb#15 and Sb#68) that can bind simultaneously to the SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD and efficiently neutralize pseudotyped and live-viruses by interfering with ACE2 interaction. Two spatially-discrete epitopes identified by cryo-EM translated into the rational design of bispecific and tri-bispecific fusions constructs, exhibiting up to 100- and 1000-fold increase in neutralization potency. Cryo-EM of the sybody-spike complex further revealed a novel up-out RBD conformation. While resistant viruses emerged rapidly in the presence of single binders, no escape variants were observed in presence of the bispecific sybody. The multivalent bispecific constructs further increased the neutralization potency against globally-circulating SARS- CoV-2 variants of concern. Our study illustrates the power of multivalency and biparatopic nanobody fusions for the development of clinically relevant therapeutic strategies that mitigate the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetics has a lot of potential to become an effective neuromodulative therapy for clinical application. Selecting the correct opsin is crucial to have an optimal optogenetic tool. With computational modeling, the neuronal response to the current dynamics of an opsin can be extensively and systematically tested. Unlike electrical stimulation where the effect is directly defined by the applied field, the stimulation in optogenetics is indirect, depending on the selected opsins non-linear kinetics. With the continuous expansion of opsin possibilities, computational studies are difficult due to the need for an accurate model of the selected opsin first. To this end, we propose a Hodgkin-and-Huxley based model (22HH) as alternative to the conventional three and four state Markov models used for opsin modeling. Furthermore, we provide a fitting procedure, which allows for nearly automatic model fitting starting from a vast parameter space. With this procedure, we successfully fitted two distinctive opsins ChR2(H134R) and MerMAID. Both models are able to represent the experimental data with great accuracy and were obtained within an acceptable time frame. This is due to the absence of differential equations in the fitting procedure, with an enormous reduction in computational cost as result. The performance of the proposed model with a fit to ChR2(H134R) was tested, by comparing the neural response in a regular spiking neuron to the response obtained with the non-instantaneous, four state Markov model (4SB), derived by Williams et al. (2013) [1]. Finally, a computational speed gain was observed with the 22HH model in a regular spiking and sparse Pyramidal-Interneuron-Network-Gamma (sPING) network simulation with respect to the 4SB-model, due to the former having two differential equations less. Consequently, the proposed model allows for computationally efficient optogenetic neurostimulation and with the proposed fitting procedure will be valuable for further research in the field of optogenetics.",

Our results demonstrated synergistic cell killing by DHA and carboplatin in OC cell lines. Furthermore, DHA supplementation alone and in combination with carboplatin significantly reduced OC growth in a high-grade serous OC patient-derived xenograft mouse model. Carboplatin administered intraperitoneally significantly reduced tumor growth in DHA-fed mice compared to mice on the control diet. Intravenous carboplatin administration in combination with DHA reduced tumor growth similarly to carboplatin or DHA monotherapies. The DHA-induced reduction in tumor growth in this model was associated with increased tumor necrosis and improved survival. As such, our findings provide a strong rationale to move to clinical trials that will determine whether DHA supplementation enhances the efficacy and tolerance of cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with OC.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes has reached endemic proportions and is a substantial burden for the affected patients and the society. Along with lifestyle factors, a number of genetic loci predisposing to type 2 diabetes have been identified, including SORCS1 that encodes the transmembrane receptor SorCS1. The ectodomain of SorCS1 (sol-SorCS1) is shed from plasma membranes but the biological function of this fragment is unknown. Here we show that sol-SorCS1 acts as a high-affinity binding partner for the insulin receptor to stabilize the receptor and increase insulin affinity, protein kinase B activation, and glucose uptake in myocytes. Sol-SorCS1 is liberated from adipocytes, and in diabetic patients the plasma concentration positively correlates with body mass index, but inversely with plasma glucose. In mouse models of insulin resistance, exogenous sol-SorCS1 restored insulin sensitivity. We conclude that sol-SorCS1 increases peripheral insulin sensitivity and propose sol-SorCS1 as a novel insulin sensitizing adipokine and potential antidiabetic agent.",

Bone grafts are commonly used for bone repair, in which the bone extracellular matrix is stimulated to promote osteogenesis. However, due to its pro-fibrosis effect, this osteoconductive material commonly exhibits implant failure. In addition to providing a basic release profile of EGCG-modified bone graft (E-HA) to clarify the relationship between this material and the environment, we have examined the integration effect via subcutaneous implantation experiments. In this manner, we have assessed the aggregation of pro-inflammatory macrophages, initial angiogenesis, the formation of fibrous capsules, and an enhanced cell viability observed in cultured RAW 264.7 cells. Among these results, we focus on pro-inflammatory macrophages due to their close relationship with fibrosis, which is the most important process in the immune response. Immunofluorescent staining results showed that E-HA substantially compromised the formation of fibrous capsules in hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, which exhibited less pro-inflammatory macrophage recruitment; meanwhile, the cell viability and primary angiogenesis were improved. This work lays the foundation for future studies on GBR.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus suis is a common pathogen colonising the respiratory tract of pigs. It can cause meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia leading to economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its metabolites play an important regulatory role in different biological processes like modulation of inflammation and immune activation. In this report we analysed the induction of COX-2 and the production of its metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a porcine precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) model. Using Western blot analysis, we found a time-dependent induction of COX-2 in the infected tissue resulting in increased PGE2 levels. Immunohistological analysis revealed a strong COX-2 expression in the proximity of the bronchioles between the ciliated epithelial cells and the adjacent alveolar tissue. The morphology, location and vimentin staining suggested that these cells are subepithelial bronchial fibroblasts. Furthermore, we showed that COX-2 expression as well as PGE2 production was detected following infection with two prevalent S. suis serotypes and that the pore-forming toxin suilysin played an important role in this process. Therefore, this study provides new insights in the response of porcine lung cells to S. suis infections and serves as a basis for further studies to define the role of COX-2 and its metabolites in the inflammatory response in porcine lung tissue during infection with S. suis.",

We identified several microbial taxa, including Serratia proteamaculans and Rickettsia australis which appear to have been transferred from the ISS to the commensal microbiomes of the astronaut. Strains were matched at the SNP and haplotype-level, and notably some strains persisted even after the astronauts return to Earth. Some transferred taxa correspond to secondary strains in the ISS environment, suggesting that transfer may be mediated by evolutionary selection.

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection represents as one of the most predictive and common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. However, the causal link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory disorders remains lacking. Herein we demonstrate intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 induces robust viral replication in the olfactory epithelium (OE), resulting in transient olfactory dysfunction in humanized ACE2 mice. The sustentacular cells and Bowmans gland cells in OE were identified as the major targets of SARS-CoV-2 before the invasion into olfactory sensory neurons. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers cell death and immune cell infiltration, and impairs the uniformity of OE structure. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, as well as the downregulation of olfactory receptors in OE from the infected animals. Overall, our mouse model recapitulates the olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and provides critical clues to understand the physiological basis for extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.",

Although useful for identifying specific progenitors and precursors, this system has not been fully exploited as a source of cells to analyse erythropoiesis. Here, we establish a protocol in which characterised erythroblasts can be isolated in a scalable manner from differentiated embryoid bodies (EBs). Using transcriptional and epigenetic analysis, we demonstrate that this system faithfully recapitulates normal primitive erythropoiesis and fully reproduces the effects of natural and engineered mutations seen in primary cells obtained from mouse models.

    "abstract": "Mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1 are frequently occurring in various cancers and drive tumor progression through the activation of cryptic splice sites in multiple genes. Recent studies also demonstrate a positive correlation between expression levels of wildtype SF3B1 and tumor malignancy, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that SF3B1 acts as an activator of HIF signaling through a splicing-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that SF3B1 forms a heterotrimer with HIF1 and HIF1{beta}, facilitating binding of the HIF1 complex to hypoxia response elements (HREs) to activate target gene expression. We further validate the relevance of this mechanism for tumor progression. Monoallelic deletion of Sf3b1 impedes formation and progression of hypoxic pancreatic cancer via impaired HIF signaling, but is well tolerated in normoxic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Our work uncovers an essential role of SF3B1 in HIF1 signaling, providing a causal link between high SF3B1 expression and aggressiveness of solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Smooth septate junctions (sSJs) regulate the paracellular transport in the intestinal and renal system in arthropods. In Drosophila, the organization and physiological function of sSJs are regulated by at least three sSJ-specific membrane proteins: Ssk, Mesh, and Tsp2A. Here, we report a novel sSJ membrane protein Hoka, which has a single membrane-spanning segment with a short extracellular region having 13-amino acids, and a cytoplasmic region with three repeats of the Tyr-Thr-Pro-Ala motif. The larval midgut in hoka-mutants shows a defect in sSJ structure. Hoka forms a complex with Ssk, Mesh, and Tsp2A and is required for the correct localization of these proteins to sSJs. Knockdown of hoka in the adult midgut leads to intestinal barrier dysfunction, stem cell overproliferation, and epithelial tumors. In hoka-knockdown midguts, aPKC is up-regulated in the cytoplasm and the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The depletion of aPKC and yki in hoka-knockdown midguts results in reduced stem cell overproliferation. These findings indicate that Hoka cooperates with the sSJ-proteins Ssk, Mesh, and Tsp2A to organize sSJs, and is required for maintaining intestinal stem cell homeostasis through the regulation of aPKC and Yki activities in the Drosophila midgut.\n\nSummary statementDepletion of hoka, a gene encoding a novel septate junction protein, from the Drosophila midgut results in the disruption of septate junctions, intestinal barrier dysfunction, stem cell overproliferation, and epithelial tumors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe development of collateral arteries after a myocardial infarction (MI) was intensively studied, while the mechanism by which pericytes (PCs) contribute to arteriologenesis remains unexplored. This study aimed to 1) investigate if cardiac PCs gain functional features of contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro, and 2) determine if this potential can be evoked pharmacologically to encourage heart arteriologenesis in vivo.\n\nMethodsPCs were immunosorted as CD31neg/CD34pos cells from human and mouse hearts. Contractile reprogramming was induced by either depletion of growth factors or addition of PD0325901, a clinically available MEK inhibitor. Next generation RNA-Sequencing was performed in naive and differentiated human PCs to assess the whole-transcriptome profile. Three in vivo studies were conducted in C57BL6/J mice to determine: 1) the ability of human PCs to promote arteriole formation when implanted subcutaneously within PD0325901-containing Matrigel plugs, 2) the effect of orally administered PD0325901 on the arteriole density of normoperfused hearts, and 3) the possibility of promoting capillary formation and muscularization of the infarcted heart through the same pharmacological approach.\n\nResultsRemoval of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) from the culture medium induced the differentiation of PCs into contractile VSMC-like cells. Because both growth factors induce the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signalling, we attempted to induce PC differentiation in vitro and in vivo using PD0325901. RNA-sequencing revealed that differentiated PCs were enriched in transcripts associated with smooth muscle contraction and biological function. PD0325901-treated PCs rapidly acquired antigenic and functional features of contractile VSMCs in vitro. Moreover, human PCs formed new arterioles when implanted subcutaneously within PD0325901-containing Matrigel plugs in mice. Oral administration of PD0325901 for two weeks increased the density and expression of contractile proteins in small-calibre arterioles of the murine heart, thereby increasing myocardial perfusion. Similarly, PD0325901 induced reparative arteriologenesis and capillarization, reduced the scar, and improved left ventricular performance in a murine model of MI.\n\nConclusionWe propose a novel method to promote the heart vascularization through the pharmacological modulation of resident mural cells. This novel approach could have an immediate impact on the treatment of coronary artery disease.\n\nClinical perspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIHuman myocardial pericytes have intrinsic vascular plasticity that can be pharmacologically evoked using PD0325901, a clinically available MEK inhibitor.\nC_LIO_LIIn mice, the pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 signalling, by the oral administration of PD0325901 for 2 weeks, encouraged the heart arteriologenesis through pericyte differentiation.\nC_LIO_LIIn a preclinical mouse model of myocardial infarction, the oral administration of PD0325901 for 2 weeks induced reparative arteriologenesis and capillarization, reduced the scar, and improved left ventricular performance.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the clinical implications?O_LIThis novel drug-based therapeutic approach is readily available to all patients.\nC_LIO_LITherefore, it could have an immediate clinical impact for the treatment of coronary artery disease and other heart conditions associated with deficient coronary vascularization.\nC_LI",

As a component of cullin E3 ubiquitin ligases, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1) has crucial roles in cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction and other processes in animals and fungi. Unexpectedly, trypanosomes possess multiple Skp1 paralogs, including a divergent paralog designated SkpZ. SkpZ is implicated in suramin-sensitivity and endocytosis and decreases in abundance following TbUsp7 knockdown and physically interacts with TbUsp7 and TbTpr86. The latter is a tetratricopeptide-repeat protein also implicated in suramin sensitivity and located close to the flagellar pocket/endosomes, consistent with a role in endocytosis. Further, silencing SkpZ reduced abundance of TbUsp7 and TbTpr86 and many trans-membrane domain surface proteins. Our data indicate that TbTpr86, TbUsp7 and SkpZ form the  TUS complex that regulates abundance of a significant cohort of trypanosome surface proteins.",

Host-pathogen interactions often implicate lectins that have become therapeutic targets for the development of carbohydrate mimics for antiadhesive therapy. Here, we present the first report on the identification and characterization of a lectin from S. apiospermum named SapL1. SapL1 was found using bioinformatics as a homolog to the conidial surface lectin FleA from Aspergillus fumigatus known to play a role in the adhesion to host glycoconjugates present in human lung epithelium. In our strategy to obtain recombinant SapL1, we discovered the importance of osmolytes to achieve its expression in soluble form in bacteria. Analysis of glycan arrays indicates specificity for fucosylated oligosaccharides as expected. Submicromolar affinity was measured for fucose using isothermal titration calorimetry. We solved SapL1 crystal structure in complex with -methyl-L-fucoside and analyzed its structural basis for fucose binding. We finally demonstrated that SapL1 binds to bronchial epithelial cells in a fucose-dependent manner. The information gathered here will contribute to the design and development of glycodrugs targeting SapL1.",

    "abstract": "Molecular feedback control circuits can improve robustness of gene expression at the single cell-level. This achievement can be offset by requirements of rapid protein expression, that may induce cellular stress, known as burden, that reduces colony growth. To begin to address this challenge we take inspiration by  division-of-labor in heterogeneous cell populations: we propose to combine bistable switches and quorum sensing systems to coordinate gene expression at the population-level. We show that bistable switches in individual cells operating in parallel yield an ultrasensitive response, while cells maintain heterogeneous levels of gene expression to avoid burden across all cells. Within a feedback loop, these switches can achieve robust reference tracking and adaptation to disturbances at the population-level. We also demonstrate that molecular sequestration enables tunable hysteresis in individual switches, making it possible to obtain a wide range of stable population-level expressions.",

    "abstract": "Spaceflight has been documented to produce detrimental effects to physiology and genomic stability, partly a result of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR). In recent years, extensive research into extremotolerant organisms has begun to reveal how they survive harsh conditions, such as ionizing radiation. One such organism is the tardigrade (Ramazzottius varieornatus) which can survive up to 5kGy of ionizing radiation and the vacuum of space. In addition to their extensive network of DNA damage response mechanisms, the tardigrade also possesses a unique damage suppressor protein (Dsup) that co-localizes with chromatin in both tardigrade and transduced human cells to protect against DNA damage from reactive oxygen species induced by ionizing radiation. While Dsup has been shown to confer human cells with increased radiotolerance; much of the mechanism of how it does this in the context of human cells remains unknown. Until now there is no knowledge yet of how introduction of Dsup into human cells can perturb molecular networks and if there are any systemic risks associated with foreign gene introduction. Here, we created a stable HEK293 cell line expressing Dsup, validated its radioprotective phenotype, and performed multi-omic analyses across different time points and doses of radiation to delineate molecular mechanism of the radioprotection and assess molecular network pertubations. Dsup expressing human cells showed an enrichment for pathways seen in cells overexpressing HMGN1, a chromosomal architectural protein that has a highly similar nucleosome binding motif. As HMGN1 binding to nucleosomes promotes a less transcriptionally repressed chromatin state, we further explored the hypothesis that Dsup could behave similarly via ATAC-seq analysis and discovered overall selective differential opening and closing of the chromatin landscape. Cut&Run analysis further revealed global increases in histone post translational modifications indicative of open chromatin and global decreases in repressive marks, with Dsup binding preferentially towards promoter regions marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me3. We further validated some of the enriched pathways via in-vitro assays and revealed novel phenotypes that Dsup confers to human cells such as reduction in apoptosis, increased cell proliferation, and increased cell adhesion properties. Our analysis provides evidence that the Dsup protein in the context of HEK293 cells may behave as a chromatin architectural protein and that in addition to its nucleosome shielding effect, may confer radio-resistance via chromatin modulation. These results provide future insight into mitigating some of the major challenges involved with long term spaceflight as well as understanding some of the molecular architectural underpinnings that lead to radioresistant cancer phenotypes back home.",

    "abstract": "Extended space travel, such as crewed missions to Mars and beyond, is a goal for both government space agencies and private companies. Research over the past decades, however, has shown that spaceflight poses risks to human health, including negative effects on musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Details regarding effects on the nervous system have been less well described. The use of animal models holds great potential to identify and dissect conserved mechanisms of neuronal response to spaceflight. Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how spaceflight affects adult neurons in vivo, at the single-cell level. We found that animals that lived 5 days of their adult life on the International Space Station exhibited considerable dendritic remodeling of the highly branched PVD neuron and modest morphological changes in touch receptor neurons when compared to ground control animals. Our results indicate hyperbranching as a common response of adult neurons to spaceflight. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues (especially hypodermis), suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris that is released from neurons. Overall, our data reveal that spaceflight can significantly affect adult neuronal morphology and clearance of neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system and to develop countermeasures to protect human health during space exploration.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) and other tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cellular accumulation of aggregated tau protein. Tau pathology within these disorders is accompanied by chronic neuroinflammation, such as activation of the classical complement pathway by complement initiation factor C1q. Additionally, about half of the AD cases present with inclusions composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein called Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies in disorders such as Parkinsons disease and Lewy body dementia also frequently occur together with tau pathology. Immunotherapy is currently the most promising treatment strategy for tauopathies. However, the presence of multiple pathological processes within tauopathies makes it desirable to simultaneously target more than one disease pathway.\n\nMethodsHerein, we have developed three bispecific antibodies based on published antibody binding region sequences. One bispecific antibody binds to tau plus alpha-synuclein and two bispecific antibodies bind to tau plus C1q.\n\nResultsThe affinity of the bispecific antibodies to their targets compared to their monospecific counterparts ranged from nearly identical to one order of magnitude lower. All bispecific antibodies retained binding to aggregated protein in patient-derived brain sections. The bispecific antibodies also retained their ability to inhibit aggregation of recombinant tau, regardless of whether the tau binding sites were in IgG or scFv format. Mono- and bispecific antibodies inhibited cellular seeding induced by AD-derived pathological tau with similar efficacy. Finally, both Tau-C1q bispecific antibodies completely inhibited the classical complement pathway.\n\nConclusionBispecific antibodies that bind to multiple pathological targets may therefore present a promising approach to treat tauopathies and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Bioengineered muscle tissues are contractile and respond to electrical and chemical stimulation.

We focus on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle disorder involving the skeletal muscle system. The dystrophin gene, which when mutated causes DMD, encodes for the Dystrophin protein, which anchors the cytoskeletal network inside of a muscle cell to the extracellular matrix outside the cell. Here, we enlist a 3D in vitro model of DMD muscle tissue, to evaluate an understudied aspect of DMD, muscle cell electrical properties uncoupled from presynaptic neural inputs. Our data shows that electrophysiological aspects of DMD are replicated in the 3D bioengineered skeletal muscle tissue model. Furthermore, we test a block co-polymer, poloxamer 188, and demonstrate capacity for improving the membrane potential in DMD muscle.Therefore, this study serves as the baseline for a new in vitro method to examine potential therapies directed at muscular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of gene expression at the single-cell level has led to important advances in the study of transcriptional regulation programs in healthy and disease states. In particular, single-cell gene expression approaches have shed light on the high level of transcriptional heterogeneity of individual cells, both at baseline and in response to experimental or environmental perturbations. We have developed a method for High-Content Imaging (HCI)-based quantification of transcript abundance at the single-cell level in primary human immune cells and have validated its performance under multiple experimental conditions to demonstrate its general applicability. This method, which we abbreviate as hcHCR, combines the high sensitivity of the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for the visualization of mRNA molecules in single cells, with the speed, scalability, and technical reproducibility of HCI. We first tested eight microscopy-compatible attachment substrates for short-term culture of primary human B cells, T cells, monocytes, or neutrophils. We then miniaturized HCR in a 384-well format and documented the ability of the method to detect increased or decreased transcript abundance at the single-cell level in thousands of cells for each experimental condition by HCI. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of multiplexing gene expression measurements by simultaneously assaying the abundance of two transcripts per cell, both at baseline and in response to an experimental stimulus. Finally, we tested the robustness of the assay to technical and biological variation. We anticipate that hcHCR will be a suitable and cost-effective assay for low- to medium-throughput chemical, genetic or functional genomic screens in primary human cells, with the possibility of performing personalized screens or screens on cells obtained from patients with a specific disease.",

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-regulated transcription factor (TF) that controls the tissue- and gene-specific transactivation and transrepression of thousands of target genes. Distinct GR DNA binding sequences with activating or repressive activities have been identified, but how they modulate transcription in opposite ways is not known. We show that GR forms phase-separated condensates that specifically concentrate known co-regulators via their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in vitro. A combination of dynamic, multivalent (between IDRs) and specific, stable interactions (between LxxLL motifs and the GR ligand binding domain) control the degree of recruitment. Importantly, GR DNA-binding directs the selective partitioning of co-regulators within GR condensates such that activating DNAs cause enhanced recruitment of co-activators. Our work shows that condensation controls GR function by modulating co-regulator recruitment and provides a mechanism for the up- and down-regulation of GR target genes controlled by distinct DNA recognition elements.",

    "abstract": "What makes a mouse a mouse, and not a hamster? The answer lies in the genome, and more specifically, in differences in gene regulation between the two organisms: where and when each gene is expressed. To quantify differences, a typical study will either compare functional genomics data from homologous tissues, limiting the approach to closely related species; or compare gene repertoires, limiting the resolution of the analysis to gross correlations between phenotypes and gene family size. As an alternative, gene coexpression networks provide a basis for studying the evolution of gene regulation without these constraints. By incorporating data from hundreds of independent experiments, meta-analytic coexpression networks reflect the convergent output of species-specific transcriptional regulation.\n\nIn this work, we develop a measure of regulatory evolution based on gene coexpression. Comparing data from 14 species, we quantify the conservation of coexpression patterns 1) as a function of evolutionary time, 2) across orthology prediction algorithms, and 3) with reference to cell- and tissue-specificity. Strikingly, we uncover deeply conserved patterns of gradient-like expression across cell types from both the animal and plant kingdoms. These results suggest that ancient genes contribute to transcriptional cell identity through mechanisms that are independent of duplication and divergence.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period of development with increased sensitivity toward psychological stressors. Many psychiatric conditions emerge during adolescence and animal studies have shown that that acute stress has long-term effects on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function and behavior. We recently demonstrated that acute stress produces long-term electrophysiological changes in locus coeruleus and long-lasting anxiety-like behavior in adolescent male rats. Based on prior reports of increased stress sensitivity during adolescence and increased sensitivity of female locus coeruleus toward corticotropin releasing factor, we hypothesized that the same acute stressor would cause different behavioral and physiological responses in adolescent female and adult male rats one week after stressor exposure. In this study, we assessed age and sex differences in how an acute psychological stressor affects corticosterone release, anxiety-like behavior, and locus coeruleus physiology at short- and long-term intervals. All groups of animals responded to stress with elevated corticosterone levels at the acute time point. One week after stressor exposure, adolescent females showed decreased firing of locus coeruleus neurons upon current injection and increased exploratory behavior compared to controls. The results were in direct contrast to changes observed in adolescent males, which showed increased anxiety-like behavior and increased spontaneous and induced firing locus coeruleus neurons a week after stressor exposure. Adult males were both behaviorally and electrophysiologically resilient to the long-term effects of acute stress. Therefore, there may be a normal developmental trajectory for locus coeruleus neurons which promotes stress resilience in adults, but stressor exposure during adolescence perturbs their function. Furthermore, while locus coeruleus neurons are more sensitive to stressor exposure during adolescence, the effect varies between adolescent males and females. These findings suggest that endocrine, behavioral, and physiological responses to stress vary among animals of different age and sex, and therefore these variables should be taken into account when selecting models and designing experiments to investigate the effects of stress. These differences in animals may also allude to age and sex differences in the prevalence of various psychiatric illnesses within the human population.",

    "abstract": "The new aggregate data analyses revealed the earlier missing role played by the cerebellum long-term electrical stimulation in the absence epilepsy. Neurophysiologic data gained by authors favor that cerebellar serial deep brain stimulation (DBS) (100 Hz) causes the transformation of penicillin-induced cortical focal discharges into prolonged 3,5-3,75 sec oscillations resembling spike-wave discharges (SWD) in cats. Such SWDs were not organized in the form of bursts and persisted continuously after stimulation. Therefore the appearance of prolonged periods of SWD is regarded as a tonic cerebellar influence upon pacemaker of SWD and might be caused by the long-lasting DBS-induced increase of GABA-ergic extrasynaptic inhibition in forebrain networks. At the same time, cerebellar DBS high-frequency (100 Hz) suppressed bursts of SWD observed during the phase of stimulation. Different types of cerebellar DBS upon epileptic activity emphasized the absence seizure facilitation discussed with the reviewed data on optogenetic stimulation, neuronal activity of cerebellar structures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary health are important considerations in equine neonatal care, as the majority of foals are bred for athletic function. The administration of supplementary oxygen is readily implemented in equine practice settings, but this does not address respiratory insufficiency due to inadequate ventilation and is no longer considered optimal care for hypoxia in some settings. Non-invasive ventilatory strategies including continuous or bi-level positive airway pressure are effective in human and veterinary studies, and may offer improved respiratory support in equine clinical practice. The current study was conducted in two parts to investigate the use of a commercial bilevel positive airway pressure (biPAP) ventilator, designed for home care of people with obstructive respiratory conditions, for respiratory support of foals. In Part 1 a prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sequential application of supplementary oxygen and then biPAP for respiratory support of five foals [&le;] 4 days of age hospitalised with respiratory in sufficiency (Group 1) and four healthy, sedated foals < 28 days of age (Group 2). In Part 2, biPAP and supplementary oxygen were administered to six healthy foals with pharmacologically induced respiratory insufficiency in a two sequence, two phase, cross-over study (Group 3). Non-invasive ventilation by biPAP improved gas exchange and mechanics of breathing (increased tidal volume, decreased respiratory rate and increased peak inspiratory flow) in foals, but modest hypercapnia was observed in healthy, sedated foals (Groups 2 and 3). Clinical cases (Group 1) appeared less likely to develop hypercapnia in response to treatment, however the response in individual foals was variable, and close monitoring is necessary. Clinical observations, pulse oximetry and CO2 monitoring of expired gases were of limited benefit in identification of foals responding inappropriately to biPAP, and improved methods to assess and monitor respiratory function are required in foals.",

    "abstract": "In language, stored representations of lexical items combine into an infinitude of complex expressions. While the neuroscience of composition has begun to mature, we do not yet understand how the stored representations evolve and morph during composition. New decoding techniques allow us to crack open this very hard question: we can train a model to recognize a representation in one context or time-point and assess its accuracy in another. We combined the decoding approach with magnetoencephalography recorded during a picture naming task to investigate the temporal evolution of noun and adjective representations during speech planning. We tracked word representations as they combined into simple two-word phrases, using single words and two-word lists as non-combinatory controls. We found that nouns were generally more decodable than adjectives, suggesting that noun representations were stronger and/or more consistent across trials than those of adjectives. When training and testing across contexts and times, the representations of isolated nouns were recoverable when those nouns were embedded in phrases, but not so if they were embedded in lists. Adjective representations did not show a similar consistency across isolated and phrasal contexts. Noun representations in phrases also sustained over time in a way that was not observed for any other pairing of word class and context. These findings offer a new window into the temporal evolution and context sensitivity of word representations during composition, revealing a clear asymmetry between adjectives and nouns. The impact of phrasal contexts on the decodability of nouns may be due to the nouns status as head of phrase--an intriguing hypothesis for future research.",

    "abstract": "Humans are constantly exposed to a rich tapestry of visual information in a potentially changing environment. To cope with the computational burden this engenders, our perceptual system must use prior context to simultaneously prioritise stimuli of importance and suppress irrelevant surroundings. This study investigated the influence of prediction and attention in visual perception by investigating event-related potentials (ERPs) often associated with these processes, N170 and N2pc for prediction and attention, respectively. A contextual trajectory paradigm was used which violated visual predictions and neglected to predetermine areas of spatial interest, to account for the potentially unpredictable nature of a real-life visual scene. Participants (N=36) viewed a visual display of cued and non-cued shapes rotating in a five-step predictable trajectory, with the fifth and final position of either the cued or non-cued shape occurring in a predictable or unpredictable spatial location. To investigate the predictive coding theory of attention we used factors of attention and prediction, whereby attention was manipulated as either cued or non-cued conditions, and prediction manipulated in either predictable or unpredictable conditions. Results showed both enhanced N170 and N2pc amplitudes to unpredictable compared to predictable stimuli. Stimulus cueing status also increased N170 amplitude, but this did not interact with stimulus predictability. The N2pc amplitude was not affected by stimulus cueing status. In accordance with previous research these results suggest the N170 is in part a visual prediction error response with respect to higher-level visual processes, and furthermore the N2pc may index attention reorientation. The results demonstrate prior context influences the sensitivity of the N170 and N2pc electrophysiological responses. These findings add further support to the role of N170 as a prediction error signal and suggest that the N2pc may reflect attentional reorientation in response to unpredicted stimulus locations.",

    "abstract": "Secondary bacterial infection, especially with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is a common complication in fatal and ICU cases of influenza virus infection. During the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 (H1N1pdm09), there was higher mortality in healthy young adults due to secondary bacterial pneumonia, with Spn being the most frequent bacterial species. Previous studies in mice and ferrets have suggested a synergistic relationship between Spn and influenza viruses. In this study, we used the ferret model to study whether airborne transmission of H1N1pdm09 was influenced by coinfection with two Spn serotypes: type 2 (D39) and type 19F (BHN97). We found that coinfected animals experienced more severe clinical symptoms as well as increased bacterial colonization of the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, we observed that coinfection resulted in reduced airborne transmission of influenza virus. Only 1/3 animals coinfected with D39 transmitted H1N1pdm09 virus to a naive recipient compared to 3/3 transmission efficiency in animals infected with influenza virus alone. A similar trend was seen in coinfection with BHN97, suggesting that coinfection with Spn reduces influenza virus airborne transmission. The decrease in transmission does not appear to be caused by decreased stability of H1N1pdm09 in expelled droplets in the presence of Spn. Rather, coinfection resulted in decreased viral shedding in the ferret upper respiratory tract. Thus, we conclude that coinfection enhances colonization and airborne transmission of Spn but decreases replication and transmission of H1N1pdm09. Our data points to an asymmetrical relationship between these two pathogens rather than a synergistic one.\n\nSignificanceAirborne transmission of respiratory viruses is influenced by many host and environmental parameters. The complex interplay between bacterial and viral coinfections on transmission of respiratory viruses has been understudied. We demonstrate that coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae reduces airborne transmission of influenza A viruses by decreasing viral titers in the upper respiratory tract. Instead of implicating a synergistic relationship between bacteria and virus, our work demonstrates an asymmetric relationship where bacteria benefit from the virus but where the fitness of influenza A viruses is negatively impacted by coinfection. The implications of exploring how microbial communities can influence the fitness of pathogenic organisms is a novel avenue for transmission control of pandemic respiratory viruses.",

    "abstract": "The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein CHD8 is among the most frequently found de-novo mutations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1-4. Despite its prominent disease involvement, little is known about its molecular function in the human brain. CHD8 is believed to be a chromatin regulator, but mechanisms for its genomic targeting is also unclear. To elucidate the role of CHD8 in human neurons, we generated conditional loss-of-function alleles in pluripotent stem cells. Chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiling showed that CHD8 is a potent chromatin opener and transcriptional activator of its direct neuronal targets, including a distinct group of ASD genes. We found the chromatin targeting of CHD8 to be highly context-dependent. In human neurons, CHD8 was preferentially bound at promoter sequences which were significantly enriched in ETS motifs. Indeed, the chromatin state of ETS motif-containing promoters was preferentially affected upon loss of CHD8. Among the many ETS transcription factors, we found ELK1 to be the best correlated with CHD8 expression in primary human fetal and adult cortical neurons and most highly expressed in our ES cell-derived neurons. Remarkably, ELK1 was necessary to recruit CHD8 specifically to ETS motifcontaining sites. These findings imply the functional cooperativity between ELK1, a key downstream factor of the MAPK/ERK pathway, and CHD8 on chromatin involvement in human neurons. THEREFORE, the MAPK/ERK/ELK1 axis may also play a role in the pathogenesis caused by CHD8 mutations 5.",

    "abstract": "In forensic science, accurate estimation of the age of a victim or suspect can facilitate the investigators to narrow a search and aid in solving a crime. Aging is a complex process associated with various molecular regulation on DNA or RNA levels. Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) upregulate globally during aging in multiple organisms such as mice and elegans because of their ability to resist degradation by exoribonucleases. In the current study, we attempted to investigate circRNAs potential capability of age prediction. Here, we identified more than 40,000 circRNAs in the blood of thirteen Chinese unrelated healthy individuals with ages of 20-62 years according to their circRNA-seq profiles. Three methods were applied to select age-related circRNAs candidates including false discovery rate, lasso regression, and support vector machine. The analysis uncovered a strong bias for circRNA upregulation during aging in human blood. A total of 28 circRNAs were chosen for further validation in 50 healthy unrelated subjects aged between 19 and 72 years by RT-qPCR and finally, 7 age-related circRNAs were chosen for final age prediction models. Several different algorithms including multivariate linear regression (MLR), regression tree, bagging regression, random forest regression (RFR), and support vector regression (SVR) were compared based on root mean square error (RMSE) and mean average error (MAE) values. Among five modeling methods, random forest regression (RFR) performed better than the others with an RMSE value of 5.072 years and an MAE value of 4.065 years (R2 = 0.902). In this preliminary study, we firstly used circRNAs as additional novel age-related biomarkers for developing forensic age estimation models. We propose that the use of circRNAs to obtain additional clues for forensic investigations and serve as aging indicators for age prediction would become a promising field of interest.\n\nAuthor summaryIn forensic investigations, estimation of the age of biological evidence recovered from crime scenes can provide additional information such as chronological age or the appearance of a culprit, which could give valuable investigative leads especially when there is no eyewitness available. Hence, generating an accurate model for age prediction using body fluids such as blood commonly seen at a crime scene can be of vital importance. Various molecular changes on DNA or RNA levels were discovered that they upregulated or downregulated during a persons lifetime. Although some biomarkers have been proved to be associated with aging and used to predict age, several disadvantages such as low sensitivity, prediction accuracy, instability and susceptibility of diseases or immune states, thus limiting their applicability in the field of age estimation. Here, we utilized a novel biomarker namely circular RNA (circRNA) to generate highly accurate age prediction models. We propose that circRNA is more suitable for forensic degradation samples because of its unique molecular structure. This preliminary research offers a new thought for exploring potential biomarker for age prediction.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies suggest alcohol use promotes the development of some adverse cardiometabolic traits but protects against others including outcomes related to coronary artery disease. We used Mendelian randomization to explore causal relationships between the degree of alcohol consumption and several cardiometabolic traits in the UK Biobank. We found carriers of the ADH1B Arg47His variant (rs1229984) reported a 26% lower amount of alcohol consumption compared to non-carriers. In our one-sample, two-stage least squares analyses of the UK Biobank using rs1229984 as an instrument, one additional drink/day was associated with statistically significant elevated level of systolic blood pressure (3.0 mmHg), body mass index (0.87 kg/m^2), waist circumference (1.3 cm), body fat percentage (1.7%), low-density lipoprotein levels in blood (0.16 mmol/L), and the risk of myocardial infarction (OR=1.50), stroke (OR=1.52), any cardiovascular disease (OR=1.43), and all-cause mortality (OR=1.41). Conversely, increasing use of alcohol was associated with reduced levels of triglycerides (-0.059 mmol/L) and HbA1C (-0.42 mmol/mol) in the blood, the latter possibly a consequence of a statistically elevated mean corpuscular volume among ADH1B Arg47His carriers. Stratifications by sex and smoking revealed a pattern of more harm of alcohol use among men compared to women, but no consistent difference by smoking status. Men had an increased risk of heart failure (OR = 1.76), atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.35), and type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.31) per additional drink/day. Using summary statistics from external datasets in 2-sample analyses for replication, we found causal associations between alcohol and obesity, stroke, ischemic stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Our results are consistent with an overall harmful effect of alcohol on cardiometabolic health at all levels of use and suggest that even moderate alcohol use should not be promoted as a part of a healthy diet and lifestyle.",
