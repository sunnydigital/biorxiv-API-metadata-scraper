    "abstract": "Prefrontal cortex (PFC) spike activity and local field potential (LFP) oscillation dynamics are broadly linked to various aspects of behavior. PFC neurons can encode the identity of sensory stimuli and related behavioral outcome in a range of sensory discrimination tasks. However, it remains largely unclear how different neuron subtypes and related LFP oscillation features are modulated in mice during sensory discrimination. To understand how excitatory and inhibitory neurons in PFC are selectively engaged during sensory discrimination and how they relate to LFPs oscillations, we used tetrode devices to probe well isolated individual PFC neurons, and LFP oscillations, in mice performing a three-choice auditory discrimination task. We found that a majority of the PFC neurons, 78% of a total of 711 individual neurons, exhibited sensory evoked responses that are context and task-progression dependent. Using spike waveforms, we classified these responsive neurons into excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and found that both neuron subtypes were transiently modulated, with individual neurons responses peaking throughout the entire task duration. While the number of responsive excitatory neurons remain largely constant throughout the task, an increasing fraction of inhibitory neurons were gradually recruited as trial progressed. Further examination of the coherences between individual neurons and LFPs revealed that inhibitory neurons in general exhibit higher spike-field coherence with LFP oscillations than excitatory neurons, first at higher gamma frequencies at the beginning of the task, and then at theta frequencies during the task, and finally across theta, beta and gamma frequencies at task completion. Together, our results demonstrate that while PFC excitatory neurons are continuously engaged during sensory discrimination, PFC inhibitory neurons are preferentially engaged as task progresses and selectively coordinated with distinct LFP oscillations. These results demonstrate increasing involvement of inhibitory neurons in shaping the overall PFC network dynamics as sensory discrimination progressed towards completion.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial multiple drug resistance is a significant issue for the medical community. Gram-negative bacteria exhibit higher rates of multi-drug resistance, partly due to the impermeability of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall and double-membrane cell envelope, which limits the internal accumulation of antibiotic agents. The outer lipopolysaccharide membrane regulates the transport of hydrophobic molecules, while the inner phospholipid membrane controls influx of hydrophilic particles. In Escherichia coli, the gene accA produces the acetyl-CoA carboxylase transferase enzyme required for catalyzing synthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids that compose the inner membrane. To increase antibiotic susceptibility and decrease growth, this study interrupted fatty acid synthesis and disrupted the composition of the inner membrane through inhibiting the gene accA with antisense RNA. This inhibition suppressed expression of luxS, a vital virulence factor that regulates cell growth, transfers intercellular quorum-sensing signals mediated by autoinducer-2, and is necessary for biofilm formation. Bacterial cells in which accA was inhibited also displayed a greater magnitude of antibiotic susceptibility. These findings confirm accA as a potent target for developing novel antibiotics such as antimicrobial gene therapies.",

    "abstract": "Scintillators emit visible luminescence when irradiated with X-rays. Given the unlimited tissue penetration of X-rays, the employment of scintillators could enable remote optogenetic control of neural functions at any depth of the brain. Here we show that a yellow-emitting inorganic scintillator, Ce-doped Gd3(Al,Ga)5O12 (Ce:GAGG), could effectively activate red-shifted excitatory and inhibitory opsins, ChRmine and GtACR1, respectively. Using injectable Ce:GAGG microparticles, we successfully activated and inhibited midbrain dopamine neurons in freely moving mice by X-ray irradiation, producing bidirectional modulation of place preference behavior. Ce:GAGG microparticles were non-cytotoxic and biocompatible, allowing for chronic implantation. Pulsed X-ray irradiation at a clinical dose level was sufficient to elicit behavioral changes without reducing the number of radiosensitive cells in the brain and bone marrow. Thus, scintillator-mediated optogenetics enables less invasive, wireless control of cellular functions at any tissue depth in living animals, expanding X-ray applications to functional studies of biology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Learning and memory play a central role in emotional disorders, particularly in depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. We present a new, transdiagnostic theory of how memory and mood interact in emotional disorders. Drawing upon retrieved-context models of episodic memory, we propose that memories form associations with the contexts in which they are encoded, including emotional valence and arousal. Later, encountering contextual cues retrieves their associated memories, which in turn reactivate the context that was present during encoding. We first show how our retrieved-context model accounts for findings regarding the organization of emotional memories in list-learning experiments. We then show how this model predicts clinical phenomena, including persistent negative mood after chronic stressors, intrusive memories of painful events, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSystematic errors can be introduced from DNA amplification during massively parallel sequencing (MPS) library preparation and sequencing array formation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-free genomic library preparation methods were previously shown to improve whole genome sequencing (WGS) quality on the Illumina platform, especially in calling insertions and deletions (InDels). We hypothesized that substantial InDel errors continue to be introduced by the remaining PCR step of DNA cluster generation. In addition to library preparation and sequencing, data analysis methods are also important for the accuracy of the output data.In recent years, several machine learning variant calling pipelines have emerged, which can correct the systematic errors from MPS and improve the data performance of variant calling.\n\nResultsHere, PCR-free libraries were sequenced on the PCR-free DNBSEQ arrays from MGI Tech Co., Ltd. (referred to as MGI) to accomplish the first true PCR-free WGS which the whole process is truly not only PCR-free during library preparation but also PCR-free during sequencing. We demonstrated that PCR-based WGS libraries have significantly (about 5 times) more InDel errors than PCR-free libraries.Furthermore, PCR-free WGS libraries sequenced on the PCR-free DNBSEQ platform have up to 55% less InDel errors compared to the NovaSeq platform, confirming that DNA clusters contain PCR-generated errors.In addition, low coverage bias and less than 1% read duplication rate was reproducibly obtained in DNBSEQ PCR-free using either ultrasonic or enzymatic DNA fragmentation MGI kits combined with MGISEQ-2000. Meanwhile, variant calling performance (single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) F-score>99.94%, InDels F-score>99.6%) exceeded widely accepted standards using machine learning (ML) methods (DeepVariant or DNAscope).\n\nConclusionsEnabled by the new PCR-free library preparation kits, ultra high-thoughput PCR-free sequencers and ML-based variant calling, true PCR-free DNBSEQ WGS provides a powerful solution for improving WGS accuracy while reducing cost and analysis time, thus facilitating future precision medicine, cohort studies, and large population genome projects.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether this relationship is causal.\n\nWe performed two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) using summary data on associations between genotype-B12 (10 genetic variants) or genotype-folate (4 genetic variants) levels from a genome-wide association study of 45,576 individuals (sample 1) and maternal-specific genetic effects on offspring birthweight from the latest EGG consortium meta-analysis with 297,356 individuals reporting their own birthweight and 210,248 women reporting their offsprings birthweight (sample 2). To investigate the effect of offsprings own B12 or folate levels on their own birthweight, we performed two-sample MR using the fetal-specific genetic effects from the latest EGG consortium meta-analysis. We used the inverse variance weighted method, and sensitivity analyses to account for pleiotropy, in addition to sensitivity analyses excluding a potentially pleiotropic variant in the FUT2 gene for B12.\n\nWe did not find evidence for a causal effect of maternal B12 on offspring birthweight, nor evidence for an effect of offspring B12 on their own birthweight using the fetal-specific genetic effect. The results were consistent across the different methods and in sensitivity analyses excluding the FUT2 variant. We found a positive effect of maternal folate on offspring birthweight (0.146 [0.065, 0.227], which corresponds to an increase in birthweight of 71g per 1SD higher folate). We found some evidence for a small inverse effect of fetal folate on their own birthweight (-0.051 [-0.100, -0.003]).\n\nIn conclusion, our results are consistent with evidence from randomized controlled trials that increased maternal folate levels increase offspring birthweight. We did not find evidence for a causal effect of B12 on offspring birthweight, suggesting previous observational studies may have been due to confounding.",

    "abstract": "Overactive bladder patients suffer from a frequent, uncontrollable urge to urinate, which can lead to a poor quality of life. We aim to improve open-loop sacral neuromodulation therapy by developing a conditional stimulation paradigm using neural recordings from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as sensory feedback. Experiments were performed in 5 anesthetized felines. We implemented a Kalman filter-based algorithm to estimate the bladder pressure in real-time using sacral-level DRG neural recordings and initiated sacral root electrical stimulation when the algorithm detected an increase in bladder pressure. Closed-loop neuromodulation was performed during continuous cystometry and compared to bladder fills with continuous and no stimulation. Overall, closed-loop stimulation increased bladder capacity by 13.8% over no stimulation (p < 0.001) and reduced stimulation time versus continuous stimulation by 57.7%. High-confidence bladder single units had a reduced sensitivity during stimulation, with lower linear trendline fits and higher pressure thresholds for firing observed during stimulation trials. This study demonstrates the utility of decoding bladder pressure from neural activity for closed-loop control of sacral neuromodulation. An underlying mechanism for sacral neuromodulation may be a reduction in bladder sensory neuron activity during stimulation. Real-time validation during behavioral studies is necessary prior to clinical translation of closed-loop sacral neuromodulation.",

Further investigation of ARHGEF3 revealed structural requirements and functional relevance of its newly discovered PI(4,5)P2 binding.

FMT was found to regulate mitochondrial morphology and dynamics as well as germination, root length, and flowering time. Here, we show that it also affects leaf expansion growth, salt stress-responses and hyponasty. Strikingly, FMT impacted the speed of hyponasty with corresponding change in speed of locomotion of CLU heterozygous knockout mice. These observations indicate that homologous genes affect homologous functions in plants and animals offering the possibility to develop plant models for the study of mammalian behaviors.",

Optical trapping experiments have provided crucial insights into the operation of these molecular machines under load. However, the throughput of such force spectroscopy experiments is typically limited to one measurement at a time. Here, we introduce a highly-parallel, microfluidics-based method that allows for rapid collection of force-dependent motility parameters of cytoskeletal motors with two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput compared to currently available methods. We apply tunable hydrodynamic forces to stepping kinesin-1 motors via DNA-tethered beads and utilize a large field of view to simultaneously track the velocities, run lengths and interaction times of hundreds of individual kinesin-1 molecules under varying resisting and assisting loads. Importantly, the 16-m long DNA tethers between the motors and the beads significantly reduces the vertical component of the applied force pulling the motors away from the microtubule. Our approach is readily applicable to other molecular systems and constitutes a new methodology for parallelized single-molecule force studies on cytoskeletal motors.",

In this study, we propose to examine the structural connectivity between motor areas in NAIS patients compared to healthy controls in order to define the cortical and subcortical connections that can reflect the motor outcome\n\nMethods30 healthy controls and 32 NAIS patients with and without Cerebral Palsy (CP) underwent MRI acquisition and manual assessment.

    "abstract": "The oxidative modification of DNA can result in the loss of genome integrity and must be repaired to maintain overall genomic stability. We have recently demonstrated that human single stranded DNA binding protein 1 (hSSB1/NABP2/OBFC2B) plays a crucial role in the removal of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro- guanine (8-oxoG), the most common form of oxidative DNA damage. The ability of hSSB1 to form disulphide-bonded tetramers and higher oligomers in an oxidative environment is critical for this process. In this study, we have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to determine the molecular details of ssDNA binding by oligomeric hSSB1. We reveal that hSSB1 oligomers interact with single DNA strands containing damaged DNA bases; however, our data also show that oxidised bases are recognised in the same manner as undamaged DNA bases. We further demonstrate that oxidised hSSB1 interacts with ssDNA with a significantly higher affinity than its monomeric form confirming that oligomeric proteins such as tetramers can bind directly to ssDNA. NMR experiments provide evidence that oligomeric hSSB1 is able to bind longer ssDNA in both binding polarities using a distinct set of residues different to those of the related SSB from Escherichia coli.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe need for safe and effective antiviral treatments is pressing given the number of viral infections that are prevalent in animal and human populations, often causing devastating economic losses and mortality. Informal accounts of anecdotal use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, in COVID-19 patients has raised concern about potential toxicity, but also raises the question that ClO2 might elicit antiviral effects, a possibility that has never been examined in vivo in any animal model. Here, we challenged the hypothesis that ClO2 decreases the viral load and virus-induced mortality in a vertebrate model. For this, we determined viral load, virus-induced lesions and mortality in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated with 104 mean EID50/mL of attenuated Massachusetts and Connecticut avian coronavirus (IBV) strains.\n\nResultsThe ClO2 treatment had a marked impact on IBV infection. Namely, viral titres were 2.4-fold lower and mortality was reduced by half in infected embryos that were treated with ClO2. Infection led to developmental abnormalities regardless of treatment. Lesions typical of IBV infections were observed in all inoculated embryos, but severity tended to be significantly lower in ClO2-treated embryos. We found no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the doses used herein.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows that ClO2 could be a safe and viable way of treating and mitigating the effects of avian coronavirus infections, and raises the possibility that similar effects could be observed in other organisms.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/336768v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7eb076org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1733722org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@128ad69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19108b0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCross-frequency coupling (CFC) refers to the non linear interaction between oscillations in different frequency bands, and it is a rather ubiquitous phenomenon that has been observed in a variety of physical and biophysical systems. In particular, the coupling between the phase of slow oscillations and the amplitude of fast oscillations, referred as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), has been intensively explored in the brain activity recorded from animals and humans. However, the interpretation of these CFC patterns remains challenging since harmonic spectral correlations characterizing non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics can act as a confounding factor.\n\nMethodsSpecialized signal processing techniques are proposed to address the complex interplay between spectral harmonicity and different types of CFC, not restricted only to PAC. For this, we provide an in-depth characterization of the Time Locked Index (TLI) as a novel tool aimed to efficiently quantify the harmonic content of noisy time series. It is shown that the proposed TLI measure is more robust and outperform traditional phase coherence metrics (e.g. Phase Locking Value, Pairwise Phase Consistency) in several aspects.\n\nResultsWe found that a non linear oscillator under the effect of additive noise can produce spurious CFC with low spectral harmonic content. On the other hand, two coupled oscillatory dynamics with independent fundamental frequencies can produce true CFC with high spectral harmonic content via a rectification mechanism or other post-interaction nonlinear processing mechanisms. These results reveal a complex interplay between CFC and harmonicity emerging in the dynamics of biologically plausible neural network models and more generic non linear and parametric oscillators.\n\nConclusionsWe show that, contrary to what is usually assumed in the literature, the high harmonic content observed in non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics, is neither sufficient nor necessary condition to interpret the associated CFC patterns as epiphenomenal. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the combination of multimodal recordings, specialized signal processing techniques and theoretical modeling is becoming a required step to completely understand CFC patterns observed in oscillatory rich dynamics of physical and biophysical systems.\n\nHighlightsO_LITime locked index efficiently quantifies the harmonic content of noisy time series.\nC_LIO_LIA non linear oscillator under the effect of additive noise can produce spurious cross frequency couplings (CFC) with low spectral harmonic content.\nC_LIO_LITwo coupled oscillatory dynamics with independent fundamental frequencies can produce true CFC with high spectral harmonic content via rectification mechanisms or other post-interaction nonlinear processing mechanisms.\nC_LIO_LIA non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics with high harmonic content is neither sufficient nor necessary condition for spurious CFC.\nC_LIO_LIA complex interplay between CFC and harmonicity emerges from the dynamics of nonlinear, parametric and biologically plausible oscillators.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Processing time-dependent information requires cells to quantify the duration of past regulatory events and program the time span of future signals. At the single-cell level, timer mechanisms can be implemented with genetic circuits: sets of genes connected to achieve specific tasks. However, such systems are difficult to implement in single cells due to saturation in molecular components and stochasticity in the limited intracellular space. Multicellular implementations, on the other hand, outsource some of the components of information-processing circuits to the extracellular space, and thereby might escape those constraints. Here we develop a theoretical framework, based on a trilinear coordinate representation, to study the collective behavior of a cellular population composed of three cell types under stationary conditions. This framework reveals that distributing different processes (in our case the production, detection and degradation of a time-encoding signal) across distinct cell types enables the robust implementation of a multicellular timer. Our analysis also shows the circuit to be easily tunable by varying the cellular composition of the consortium.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of the human microbiome using metagenomic sequencing data has demonstrated high ability in discriminating various human diseases. Raw metagenomic sequencing data require multiple complex and computationally heavy bioinformatics steps prior to data analysis. Such data contain millions of short sequences read from the fragmented DNA sequences and are stored as fastq files. Conventional processing pipelines consist in multiple steps including quality control, filtering, alignment of sequences against genomic catalogs (genes, species, taxonomic levels, functional pathways, etc.). These pipelines are complex to use, time consuming and rely on a large number of parameters that often provide variability and impact the estimation of the microbiome elements.\n\nTraining Deep Neural Networks directly from raw sequencing data is a promising approach to bypass some of the challenges associated with mainstream bioinformatics pipelines. Most of these methods use the concept of word and sentence embeddings that create a meaningful and numerical representation of DNA sequences, while extracting features and reducing the dimensionality of the data. In this paper we present an end-to-end approach that classifies patients into disease groups directly from raw metagenomic reads: metagenome2vec. This approach is composed of four steps (i) generating a vocabulary of k-mers and learning their numerical embeddings; (ii) learning DNA sequence (read) embeddings; (iii) identifying the genome from which the sequence is most likely to come and (iv) training a multiple instance learning classifier which predicts the phenotype based on the vector representation of the raw data. An attention mechanism is applied in the network so that the model can be interpreted, assigning a weight to the influence of the prediction for each genome. Using two public real-life data-sets as well a simulated one, we demonstrated that this original approach reaches high performance, comparable with the state-of-the-art methods applied directly on processed data though mainstream bioinformatics workflows. These results are encouraging for this proof of concept work. We believe that with further dedication, the DNN models have the potential to surpass mainstream bioinformatics workflows in disease classification tasks.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of plant organs, including leaves, stems, roots, and flowers, mediated the explosive radiation of land plants, which shaped the biosphere and allowed the establishment of terrestrial animal life. Furthermore, the fertilization products of angiosperms, seeds serve as the basis for most of our food. The evolution of organs and immobile gametes required the coordinated acquisition of novel gene functions, the co-option of existing genes, and the development of novel regulatory programs. However, our knowledge of these events is limited, as no large-scale analyses of genomic and transcriptomic data have been performed for land plants. To remedy this, we have generated gene expression atlases for various organs and gametes of 10 plant species comprising bryophytes, vascular plants, gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Comparative analysis of the atlases identified hundreds of organ- and gamete-specific gene families and revealed that most of the specific transcriptomes are significantly conserved. Interestingly, the appearance of organ-specific gene families does not coincide with the corresponding organs appearance, suggesting that co-option of existing genes is the main mechanism for evolving new organs. In contrast to female gametes, male gametes showed a high number and conservation of specific genes, suggesting that male reproduction is highly specialized. The expression atlas capturing pollen development revealed numerous transcription factors and kinases essential for pollen biogenesis and function. To provide easy access to the expression atlases and these comparative analyses, we provide an online database, www.evorepro.plant.tools, that allows the exploration of expression profiles, organ-specific genes, phylogenetic trees, co-expression networks, and others.",

Structural and phylogenetic analyses were used to pinpoint where and when these amino acid substitutions occurred: around the 3'-5' exonuclease domain in later mammal ancestry, after the split between monotremes and therians. The 3'-5' exonuclease domain of this protein is known to have an impact on the fidelity of replication.

    "abstract": "A typical single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiment will measure on the order of 20,000 transcripts and thousands, if not millions, of cells. The high dimensionality of such data presents serious complications for traditional data analysis methods and, as such, methods to reduce dimensionality play an integral role in many analysis pipelines. However, few studies benchmark the performance of these methods on scRNA-seq data, with existing comparisons assessing performance via downstream analysis accuracy measures which may confound the interpretation of their results. Here, we present the most comprehensive benchmark of dimensionality reduction methods in scRNA-seq data to date, utilizing over 300,000 compute hours to assess the performance of over 25,000 low dimension embeddings across 33 dimensionality reduction methods and 55 scRNA-seq datasets (ranging from 66-27,500 cells). We employ a simple-yet-novel approach which does not rely on the results of downstream analyses. Internal validation measures (IVMs), traditionally used as an unsupervised method to assess clustering performance, are repurposed to measure how well-formed biological clusters are after dimensionality reduction. Performance was further evaluated using nearly 200,000,000 iterations of DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm, showing that hyperparameter optimization using IVMs as the objective function leads to near-optimal clustering. Methods were also assessed on the extent to which they preserve the global structure of the data, and on their computational memory and time requirements across a large range of sample sizes. Our comprehensive benchmarking analysis provides a valuable resource for researchers and aims to guide best practice for dimensionality reduction in scRNA-seq analyses, and we highlight LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding) as high-performing algorithms.",

Species face a range of stressors in human-dominated landscapes, often with contrasting effects. White-tailed deer (deer) are expanding in the northern part of their range following decreasing winter severity and increasing forage availability. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease affecting cervids, is likewise expanding and represents a major threat to deer and other cervids. We obtained tissue samples from free-ranging deer across their native range in Ontario, Canada which has yet to detect CWD in wild populations of cervids. We used high-throughput sequencing to assess neutral genomic variation, and variation in the PRNP gene that is partly responsible for the protein misfolding when deer contract CWD. Neutral variation revealed a high number of rare alleles and no population structure, and demographic models suggested a rapid historical population expansion. Allele frequencies of PRNP variants associated with CWD susceptibility and disease progression were evenly distributed across the landscape and consistent with deer populations not infected with CWD. We then estimated the selection coefficient of CWD, with simulations showing an observable and rapid shift in PRNP allele frequencies that coincides with the start of a novel CWD epidemic. Sustained surveillance of genomic and PRNP variation can be a useful tool for CWD-free regions where deer are managed for ecological and economic benefits.",

    "abstract": "CRSIPR-Cas9 system has opened up the avenue to efficient genome editing1-4. However, together with known off-target effects, several concerns of current CRISPR-Cas9 platform, including severe DNA damage, cytotoxicity, and large genomic alteration, have emerged in recent reports5-7 and establish a formidable obstacle to precisely model allele dosage effects of disease mutations and risk variants, especially mono-allelic effects, and correct them. Here, by developing an allele-specific indel monitor system (AIMS), we demonstrate that small and simple modification of conventional single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) enable programmable tuning of CRISPR-Cas9 activities and alleviate such adverse effects. AIMS, which visualizes various indel events in two alleles separately in living cells, is convenient and accurate to determine the in vitro editing efficiency and revealed frequent mosaicism during genome editing. Using AIMS, we show that adding cytosine stretches to the 5 end of conventional sgRNA efficiently reduced Cas9 activity in a length dependent manner. By combining systematic experiments and computational modeling, we established the quantitative relationships between the length of cytosine extension and multiple aspects of CRISPR-Cas9 system. In general, short cytosine extension dramatically relieves p53-dependent cytotoxicity and suppression of homology-directed repair (HDR) while relatively maintaining on-target activity. Long cytosine extension further decreases on-target activity, thereby maximizing mono-allelic editing, while conventional system typically induces bi-allelic editing. Furthermore, such downregulation of on-target activity contributes to downregulation of relative off-target activity and protection of HDR-allele from second off-target editing. Therefore, cytosine extension method finally enables both single-step generation of heterozygous single-nucleotide disease mutations from homozygous states in mouse ES cells and correction of heterozygous disease mutations in human iPS cells. Taken together, our study proposes updates of standard CRISPR-Cas9 platform in mammalian cells toward precise and safe genome editing in diverse applications.",

Given these arms race dynamics (ARD), viruses and hosts are each predicted to evolve along a single trajectory as more recently evolved genotypes replace their predecessors. Here, by coupling phenotypic and genomic analyses of coevolving populations of bacteriophage {lambda} and Escherichia coli, we find conflicting evidence for ARD. Virus-host infection phenotypes fit the ARD model, yet whole genome analyses did not. Rather than coevolution unfolding along a single trajectory, cryptic genetic variation emerges during initial virus-host coevolution. This variation is maintained across generations and eventually supplants dominant lineages. These observations constitute what we term  leapfrog coevolutionary dynamics, revealing weaknesses in the predictive power of standard coevolutionary models. The findings shed light on the mechanisms that structure coevolving ecological networks and reveal the limits of using phenotypic assays alone in characterizing coevolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation during cell division requires engagement of the kinetochores of sister chromatids with microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. In yeast, these \"bioriented\" metaphase sister chromatids experience tension as the corresponding microtubules (one per sister chromatid) shorten. Spindle-assembly checkpoint signaling appears to cease from a kinetochore under tension, which also stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachment in single-kinetochore experiments in vitro. The microtubule polymerase, Stu2, the yeast member of the XMAP215/ch-TOG protein family, associates with kinetochores in cells and contributes to tension-dependent stabilization, both in vitro and in vivo. We show here that a C-terminal segment of Stu2 binds the four-way junction of the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) and that amino-acid residues conserved both in yeast Stu2 orthologs and in their metazoan counterparts make specific contacts with Ndc80 and Spc24. Mutations that perturb this interaction prevent association of Stu2 with kinetochores, impair cell viability, produce biorientation defects, and delay cell-cycle progression. Ectopic tethering of the mutant Stu2 species to the Ndc80c junction restores wild-type function. These findings show that the role of Stu2 in tension sensing depends on its association with kinetochores by binding with Ndc80c.",

    "abstract": "Sugar fatty acid esters, especially glucose fatty acid esters (GEs), have broad applications in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In this research the fatty acid moieties derived from polyunsaturated fatty acid containing single cell oils (SCOs), i.e. those produced from Cunninghamella echinulata, Umbelopsis isabellina and Nannochloropsis gaditana as well as from olive oil and an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrate were converted into GEs by enzymatic synthesis, using lipases as biocatalysts. The GE synthesis was monitored using thin-layer chromatography, FT-IR and in situ NMR. It was found that GE synthesis carried out using immobilized Candida antarctica B lipase was very effective reaching high yields, near to 100%. It was shown that EPA-GEs were very effective against several pathogenic bacteria and their activity can be attributed to their high EPA content. Furthermore, C. echinulata-GEs were more effective against pathogens comparing to U. isabellina-GEs, probably due to the presence of gamma linolenic acid (GLA) in the lipids of C. echinulate, which is known for its antimicrobial activity, in higher concentrations. C. echinulata-GEs also showed a strong insecticidal activity against Aedes aegypti larvae, followed by EPA-GEs, olive oil-GEs, and N. gaditana-GEs. All synthesized GEs induced apoptosis of the SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line, with the apoptotic rate increasing significantly after 48 h. A higher percentage of apoptosis was observed in the cells treated with EPA-GEs, followed by C. echinulata-GEs, U. isabellina-GEs and olive oil-GEs. We conclude that SCOs can be used in the synthesis of GEs with interesting biological properties.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease in which outcomes vary among different racial groups. The aim of this study is to leverage large-scale transcriptomic data from diverse populations to better sub-classify SLE patients into more clinically actionable groups. We leverage cell sorted RNA-seq data (CD14+ monocytes, B cells, CD4+T cells, and NK cells) from 120 SLE patients (63 Asian and 57 White individuals) and apply a four tier analytical approach to identify SLE subgroups within this multiethnic cohort: unsupervised clustering, differential expression analyses, gene co-expression analyses, and machine learning. K-means clustering on the individual cell type data resulted in three clusters for CD4 and CD14, and two clusters for B cells and NK cells. Correlation analysis revealed significant positive associations between the transcriptomic clusters of each immune cell and clinical parameters including disease activity and ethnicity. We then explored differentially expressed genes between Asian and White groups for each cell-type. The shared differentially expressed genes across the four cell types were involved in SLE or other autoimmune related pathways. Co-expression analysis identified similarly regulated genes across samples and grouped these genes into modules. Samples were grouped into White-high, Asians-high (high disease activity defined by SLEDAI score >=6) and White-low, Asians-low (SLEDAI < 6). Random forest classification of disease activity in the White and Asian cohorts showed the best classification in CD4+ T cells in White. The results from these analyses will help stratify patients based on their gene expression signatures to enable precision medicine for SLE.",

    "abstract": "AimDefects in hepatic glycogen synthesis contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. Chromogranin A (CgA) peptide Catestatin (CST: hCgA352-372) has been shown to improve glucose tolerance in insulin-resistant mice. Here, we seek to determine whether CST also reduces hyperglycemia by increasing hepatic glycogen synthesis.\n\nMethodsWe determined liver glycogen, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG), and glycogen synthase (GYS2) activities; plasma insulin, glucagon, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI) levels in fed and fasted liver of lean and obese mice as well as in CST knockout (CST-KO) mice after treatments with saline, CST, or insulin. We also determined glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis in primary hepatocytes. In addition, we analyzed phosphorylation signals of Insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), GYS2, glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta}), AKT (an enzyme in AKR mouse that produces Thymoma)/PKB (protein kinase B) and mTOR (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin) by immunoblotting.\n\nResultsCST stimulated glycogen accumulation in fed and fasted liver and in primary hepatocytes. CST reduced plasma NE and EPI levels, suggesting that CST promotes glycogenesis by inhibiting catecholamine-induced glycogenolysis. CST also directly stimulated glycogenesis and inhibited NE and EPI-induced glycogenolysis in hepatocytes. CST elevated the levels of UDPG and increased GYS2 activity, thus redirecting G6P to the glycogenic pathway. CST-KO mice had decreased liver glycogen that was restored by treatment with CST, reinforcing the crucial role of CST in hepatic glycogenesis. CST can improve insulin signals downstream of insulin receptor IR and IRS-1 by enhancing phospho-AKT signals through stimulation of PDK-1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) activities.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that CST directly promotes the glycogenic pathway and reduces plasma glucose levels in insulin-resistant mice by (i) reducing glucose production, (ii) increasing glycogen synthesis from UDPG, and (iii) reducing glycogenolysis. This is achieved by enhancing downstream insulin signaling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the early stages of the coronavirus disease pandemic, the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic drug azithromycin (AZM) were widely used as emerging treatments. However, controversial cardiac toxicity results obtained from clinical trials and epidemic studies suggest that the cardiotoxicity of these two drugs should be re-evaluated. In the present study, we aimed to assess the impact of a short course of AZM or HCQ + AZM combination treatment on ECG and cardiac function in healthy guinea pigs.\n\nMethodsThirty-two male guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups: control; AZM; HCQ; and HCQ + AZM groups. At 3, 6, and 9 days after treatment, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiographic techniques were used to determine important ECG parameters and cardiac functional parameters of the left ventricle (including posterior wall thickness, end systolic/end diastolic volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening).\n\nResultsAlthough AZM decreased the heart rates of guinea pigs on day 9 (under anesthetized conditions), HCQ + AZM decreased heart rates on days 3, 6, and 9. The corrected QT intervals of guinea pigs after AZM and HCQ + AZM treatments were significantly increased, compared with CON and HCQ treatment respectively, on days 3, 6, and 9. However, QRS complex durations were not significantly different between the groups. AZM significantly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) on days 3, 6, and 9, whereas HCQ + AZM only decreased LVEF and LVFS on day 9. Posterior wall thickness and of the left ventricle in the diastolic and systolic states were not significantly different between these groups. In addition, compared with CON, AZM and HCQ decreased the EDV. And, in comparison with HCQ treatment, HCQ + AZM treatment increased ESV on day 9.\n\nConclusionsAccording to our study, AZM significantly prolongs the QT interval and damages cardiac function. Moreover, HCQ + AZM treatment increased the risk of cardiac dysfunction compared with HCQ treatment.",

    "abstract": "Common bean is a legume grown globally especially in developing countries including Cameroon for human consumption. In Cameroon it is grown in a wide variety of agro ecological zones in quantities enough to last through the off growing season after harvest. Stored common bean after harvest in Cameroon are prone to fungal spoilage which contributes to post harvest losses. This study aimed at characterising storage fungi on cultivars of stored common bean using morphological and molecular techniques. Fungi were isolated from six stored cultivars of common bean; Kidney bean, Black bean, Navy bean, Pinto bean, Pea bean and Large seeded bean plated on potato dextrose agar media. Cultural, micro-morphological and molecular techniques were used to characterise the isolates. A total of four fungi isolates resulted. Homology matches of the gene sequences in the Genbank databases identified the isolates to be; Xylaria hypoxylon, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium aethiopicum and Fusarium oxysporium. Phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment showed these isolates were of distinct species. The species of fungi recovered from the stored cultivars signified poor preservation methods carried out after harvest. Effective management and control of these fungal species in common bean at storage will help reduce post-harvest losses and increase seed health.",

Recent observations in multiple cancers have unravelled the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in driving metastasis and therapy recalcitrance. However, the origins of such phenotypic heterogeneity are poorly understood in most cancers. Here, we investigate a regulatory network underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer, a devastating disease with no molecular targeted therapy. Discrete and continuous dynamical simulations of this network reveal its multistable behavior that can explain co-existence of four experimentally observed phenotypes. Analysis of the network topology uncovers that multistability emerges from two teams of players that mutually inhibit each other but members of a team activate one another, forming a  toggle switch between the two teams. Deciphering these topological signatures in cancer-related regulatory networks can unravel their  latent design principles and offer a rational approach to characterize phenotypic heterogeneity in a tumor.",

    "abstract": "The correlation coefficient squared, r2, is often used to validate quantitative models on neural data. Yet it is biased by trial-to-trial variability: as trial-to-trial variability increases, measured correlation to a models predictions decreases; therefore, models that perfectly explain neural tuning can appear to perform poorly. Many solutions to this problem have been proposed, but some prior methods overestimate model fit, the utility of even the best performing methods is limited by the lack of confidence intervals and asymptotic analysis, and no consensus has been reached on which is the least biased estimator. We provide a new estimator, [Formula], that outperforms all prior estimators in our testing, and we provide confidence intervals and asymptotic guarantees. We apply our estimator to a variety of neural data to validate its utility. We find that neural noise is often so great that confidence intervals of the estimator cover the entire possible range of values ([0, 1]), preventing meaningful evaluation of the quality of a models predictions. We demonstrate the use of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a quality metric for making quantitative comparisons across neural recordings. Analyzing a variety of neural data sets, we find ~ 40% or less of some neural recordings do not pass even a liberal SNR criterion.\n\nAuthor SummaryQuantifying the similarity between a model and noisy data is fundamental to the verification of advances in scientific understanding of biological phenomena, and it is particularly relevant to modeling neuronal responses. A ubiquitous metric of similarity is the correlation coefficient. Here we point out how the correlation coefficient depends on a variety of factors that are irrelevant to the similarity between a model and data. While neuroscientists have recognized this problem and proposed corrected methods, no consensus has been reached as to which are effective. Prior methods have wide variation in their precision, and even the most successful methods lack confidence intervals, leaving uncertainty about the reliability of any particular estimate. We address these issues by developing a new estimator along with an associated confidence interval that outperforms all prior methods.",

    "abstract": "The study of the hippocampus across the healthy adult lifespan has rendered inconsistent findings. While volumetric measurements have often been a popular technique for analysis, more advanced morphometric techniques have demonstrated compelling results that highlight the importance and improved specificity of shape-based measures. Here, the MAGeT Brain algorithm was applied on 134 healthy individuals aged 18-81 years old to extract hippocampal subfield volumes and hippocampal shape measurements, notably: local surface area (SA) and displacement. We used linear, second or third order natural splines to examine the relationships between hippocampal measures and age. In addition, partial least squares analyses were performed to relate measurements with cognitive and demographic information. Volumetric results indicated a relative preservation of the right cornus ammonis 1 with age and a global volume reduction linked with older age, female sex, lower levels of education and cognitive performance. Vertex-wise analysis demonstrated an SA preservation in the anterior hippocampus with a peak during the sixth decade, while the posterior hippocampal SA gradually decreased across lifespan. Overall, SA decrease was linked to older age, female sex and, to a lesser extent lower levels of education and cognitive performance. Outward displacement in the lateral hippocampus and inward displacement in the medial hippocampus were enlarged with older age, lower levels of cognition and education, indicating an accentuation of the hippocampal \"C\" shape with age. Taken together, our findings suggest that vertex-wise analyses have higher spatial specifity and that sex, education and cognition are implicated in the differential impact of age on hippocampal subregions throughout its antero-posterior and medial-lateral axes.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: It has been known for some time that normal retinal signaling is disrupted early on in diabetes, before the onset of the vascular pathologies associated with diabetic retinopathy. There is growing evidence that levels of retinal dopamine, a neuromodulator that mediates light adaptation, may also be reduced in early diabetes. Previously, we have shown that after six weeks of diabetes in a mouse model, light adaptation is impaired at the level of ON-sustained (ON-s) ganglion cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in dopamine receptor sensitivity contribute to this dysfunction. Here we used single cell retinal patch-clamp recordings from the mouse retina to determine how activating dopamine type D4 receptors (D4Rs) changes the light-evoked and spontaneous excitatory inputs to ON-s ganglion cells, in both control and diabetic animals. We also used in-situ fluorescent hybridization to assess whether D4R expression was impacted by diabetes. We found that D4R activation had a smaller impact on light-evoked excitatory inputs to ON-s ganglion cells in diabetic retinas compared to controls. This impaired D4R signaling is not attributable to a decline in D4R expression, as we found increased D4R mRNA density in the outer plexiform layer in diabetic retinas. This suggests that the cellular machinery of dopaminergic signaling is itself disrupted in early diabetes and may be amenable to chronic dopamine supplementation therapy.",

Yet, due to the multi-faceted stochastic nature of tree mortality, large-scale spatial patterns of mortality across species ranges and their underlying drivers remain difficult to understand. Our main goal is to describe the geographical patterns and drivers of the occurrence and intensity of tree mortality in Europe. We hypothesize that the occurrence of mortality represents background mortality and is higher in the margin than the core populations, whereas the intensity of mortality could have a more even distribution according to the spatial and temporal stochasticity of die-off events.\n\nLocationEurope (Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and Finland)\n\nTime period1981 to 2014.\n\nMajor taxa studiedMore than 1.5 million trees belonging to 20 major forest tree species\n\nMethodsWe develop hurdle models to tease apart the occurrence and intensity of tree mortality in National Forest Inventory plots at range-wide scale. The occurrence of mortality indicates that at least one tree has died in the plot and the intensity of mortality refers to the number of trees dead per plot.\n\nResultsThe highest mortality occurrence was found in peripheral regions and the climatic trailing edge linked with drought, whereas the intensity of mortality was driven by competition, drought and high temperatures and was uniformly scattered across species ranges.\n\nMain conclusionsOur findings provide a new perspective in our understanding of tree mortality across species ranges. We show that tree background mortality but not die-off is generally higher in the trailing edge populations, but whether other demographic traits such as growth, reproduction and regeneration would also decrease at the trailing edge of European tree populations needs to be explored.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of eukaryotic cellular complexity is interwoven with the extensive diversification of many protein families. One key family is the ARF GTPases that act in eukaryote-specific processes, including membrane traffic, tubulin assembly, actin dynamics, and cilia-related functions. Unfortunately, our understanding of the evolution of this family is limited. Sampling an extensive set of available genome and transcriptome sequences, we have assembled a dataset of over 2,000 manually curated ARF family genes from 114 eukaryotic species, including many deeply diverged protist lineages, and carried out comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analyses. These reconstructed as many as 16 ARF family members present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), nearly doubling the previously inferred ancient system complexity. Evidence for the wide occurrence and ancestral origin of Arf6, Arl13 and Arl16 is presented for the first time. Moreover, Arl17, Arl18 and SarB, newly described here, are absent from well-studied model organisms and as a result their function(s) remain unknown. Analyses of our dataset revealed a previously unsuspected diversity of membrane association modes and domain architectures within the ARF family. We detail the step-wise expansion of the ARF family in the metazoan lineage, including discovery of several new animal-specific family members. Delving back to its earliest evolution in eukaryotes, the resolved relationship observed between the ARF family paralogs sets boundaries for scenarios of vesicle coat origins during eukaryogenesis. Altogether, our work fundamentally broadens the understanding of the diversity and evolution of a protein family underpinning the structural and functional complexity of the eukaryote cells.\n\nSignificanceARF Family GTPases are crucial regulations of a diversity of cellular compartments and processes and as such the extent of this system in eukaryotes reflects both cellular complexity in modern eukaryotes and its evolution. Strikingly, a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the protein family is lacking, leaving its recent and ancient evolution poorly resolved. We performed a comprehensive molecular evolutionary analysis, reconstructing a highly complex ARF family complement in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, including a number of paralogs never before identified as such, and we find resolved relationships between the paralogs. This work has implications for cellular evolution from eukaryogenesis to cellular complexity in metazoans.",

The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius is an obligate hematophagous ectoparasite that requires host blood for growth, development, and reproduction. We investigated how mating, starvation and social factors such as harassment by males affect host-seeking, blood feeding, oviposition, and survival of female bed bugs. The percentage of females that fed and the amount of blood they ingested were greater in mated females (90-100%) than in unmated females (48-60%). Mating state also modulated the females orientation towards human skin odor in an olfactometer; more mated (69%) than unmated (23%) females responded to human odors. The response rate of unmated females (60%) to human odor increased with longer starvation period, while the opposite pattern was observed in mated females (20%). Although fecundity after a single blood meal was unaffected by long or short residence with males, females subjected to frequent copulations had lower survivorship and lifespan than females subjected to males for only 24 h. Taken together, these results indicate that behaviors are adaptively expressed based on the internal physiological state to maximize survival and reproductive fitness.",

    "abstract": "Advances in sensing technology have enabled rapid analysis of various biomolecules including complex carbohydrates. However, glycan analysis is limited by the throughput and complexity of assays for quantifying them. We describe a simple, low-cost enzymatic assay for the rapid analysis of fucosylation, down to linkage specificity, and its application to high-throughput screening of biologically relevant fucosylated compounds, to facilitate simple and straightforward analytical techniques. Paper-based devices integrate biosensor platforms and other diagnostic assays by fusing them with wax printing technology, making their fabrication even more inexpensive and simple. The specificity of the assay is established by linkage-specific glycosidic enzymes and the colorimetric output is visible to the naked eye, with costs that are lower than fluorescence/luminescence-based assays ($0.02/reaction). This platform was further improved by enhancing storage stability to retain analytical performance over time using desiccation and freeze-drying techniques. The assay platform allows analysis of hundreds of samples in minutes and we anticipate that this rapid and simple analytical method will be extended towards developing a universal glyco-barcoding platform for high throughput screening of glycosylation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionType 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a long-term metabolic disorder that primarily characterized by impaired insulin resistance to become hyperglycemia. People suffering from T2DM have a higher risk of developing various diseases but, on top of that, some diabetic drugs are also suspected of increasing the risk in some cases. Aldose reductase is a key target enzyme to catalyze the reduction of glucose to sorbitol and does not readily diffuse across cell membranes and cause retinopathy and neuropathy. The aldolase reductase inhibitors prevent the conversion of glucose to sorbitol and may have the capacity of preventing and / or treating several diabetic complications. It will be expected to be twofold in the subsequent decade due to intensification in the senile population with the number of people affected, thus adding to the liability on medical providers in poor developed countries using herbal medicine to control the diabetes. In recent investigation, the antidiabetic property of phytochemicals extracted from leafs of Abutilon indicum (L.) is elucidated using animal models.\n\nMaterials and MethodsIn the current study using aldose reductase enzyme assay inhibitor of Rat lens Aldose reductase were treated with A. indicum methanolic leaf extract at different concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200g/mL). Copper sulphate was used as reference drug and docking studies to predict the screen the best aldose reductase inhibitor.\n\nResults and DiscussionThe crude extract exhibited cytotoxicity against rat lens aldose reductase (IC50 = 135.8 g/L vs ref 13.60 g/L) using In Vitro. The docking is performed with 11 compounds shows Ertugliflozin, 9H-Cycloisolongifolene, 8-oxo and 7-hydroxy cadalene showed a good binding interaction with aldose reductase.\n\nConclusionWe are concluding that the invitro and in silico analysis helps researchers to utilize these compound for aldose reductase inhibitors and further can be used for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "A powerful tool to improve tissue integration with biomaterial scaffolds for the regeneration of damaged tissues is to promote cell migration using chemotactic gradients of growth factors. This approach has been realized by the exogenous delivery of growth factors, which unfortunately also limits the scaffolds ability to meet each wounds unique spatial and temporal regenerative needs. To address this limitation, we present a new approach to gradient generation by incorporating heparin microislands, which are spatially isolated heparin-containing microparticles that create chemotactic microgradients through reorganization of endogenous local growth factors. We incorporated heparin microislands within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds, which allows us to tune their incorporation ratiometrically to create a heterogenous microenvironment. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the ability of heparin microislands to organize uniform growth factors into spontaneous microgradients and control downstream cell migration in vitro. Further, we present their ability to significantly improve wound healing outcomes (epidermal regeneration and vascularization) in a diabetic wound model relative to two clinically relevant controls.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are mobile genetic elements found across all domains of life. As plasmids often encode determinants of fitness, their evolution is intertwined with their hosts. However, naturally occurring plasmids remain far less understood than their hosts due to the lack of frameworks to recognize plasmids and to classify them into evolutionary groups. Here we trained a machine learning model that recognizes plasmids based on genetic architecture with state-of-the-art accuracy. We applied this model to a global collection of human gut metagenomes to identify 68,350 unique plasmids, 13,280 of which had a very high model confidence and represent more than an order of magnitude increase over the number of known plasmids that we detected in this environment. To understand the evolution of these plasmids, we developed a generalizable approach that enabled us to define 1,169  plasmid systems. Each system consists of plasmids that share a backbone sequence containing core plasmid functions, such as replication and conjugation, but vary in cargo genes that are often critical to the host, such as antibiotic resistance, amino acid biosynthesis, and tRNA modification. Members of the same system are often found in geographically distinct human populations, revealing cargo genes that likely respond to environmental selection. The ecological patterns of plasmids we observed could not be explained by microbial taxonomy. This work uncovers the tremendous diversity of plasmids and demonstrates the need to characterize them as a separate component of microbiomes distinct from their hosts.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium are a genus of Actinobacteria known to be responsible for several deadly diseases in both humans and animals, including tuberculosis. Luciferase is the primary protein in Mycobacteria that plays a role in bioluminescence. It also plays a role in some bacteria of being a source of energy transference, such as in the case of lumazine proteins. Although studies have been conducted in different luciferase in bacteria, there has been hardly any structural studies on luciferase expressed in Mycobacterium sp. EPa45. Therefore, in this paper we have studied luciferase expressed in Mycobacterium sp. EPa45 by insilico analysis of its structure from its protein sequence. We report the observed differences within luciferase reported from other strains of mycobacterium and pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms of bacteria in terms of their (i) physiochemical characteristics, (ii) protein structure, (iii) multiple sequence alignment and (iv) phylogenetic relationships. We report for the first time the relation of this specific strain of Luciferase in mycobacterium and bacterium at large.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMycobacterium sp.

    "abstract": "Voltage-dependent sodium (Nav) current in adrenal chromaffin cells (CCs) is rapidly inactivating and TTX-sensitive. The fractional availability of CC Nav current has been implicated in regulation of action potential (AP) frequency and the occurrence of slow-wave burst firing. To ascertain whether features of CC Nav inactivation might influence AP firing, we recorded Nav current in rat CCs, primarily from adrenal medullary slices. A key feature of CC Nav current is that recovery from inactivation, even following brief (5 ms) inactivation steps, exhibits two exponential components of generally similar amplitude. Variations of standard paired pulse protocols support the view that entry into the fast and slower recovery processes result from largely independent, competing inactivation pathways, both of which occur with similar onset times at depolarizing potentials. Over voltages from -120 to -80 mV, faster recovery varies from ~3 to 30 ms, while slower recovery from about 50-400 ms. At strong activation voltages (+0 mV and more positive), the relative entry into slow or fast recovery pathways is similar and independent of voltage. Trains of brief inactivating steps result in cumulative increases in the slower recovery fraction. This supports idea that brief recovery intervals preferentially allow recovery of channels from fast recovery pathways, thereby increasing the fraction of channels in the slow recovery pathway with each subsequent inactivation step. This provides a mechanism whereby differential rates of recovery produce use-dependent accumulation in slower recovery pathways. Consistent with use-dependent accumulation of channels in slow recovery pathways, repetitive AP clamp waveforms at 1-10 Hz frequencies reduce Nav availability to 10-20% of initial amplitude dependent on holding potential. The results indicate that there are two distinct pathways of fast inactivation, one that leads to normal fast recovery and the other with a slower time course, which together are well-suited to mediate use-dependent changes in Nav availability.",

    "abstract": "For hepatitis B antiviral treatment, there has been no comprehensive method yet. Interferon has poor antiviral efficacy, while nucleoside drugs have long course of treatment and high relapse rate. To improve the anti-HBV curative effect, treatment methods such as thymosin combined with entecavir have become a focus of clinical investigation. To explore potential mechanism of the combination therapy, based on previous studies, this paper explores the relationship between TLR9 expression in PBMCs, secretion of corresponding downstream inflammatory factors and HBV load in anti-HBV treatment with Thymosin a1 (Ta1) combined with entecavir. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with PCR method was adopted to detect H3K9 acetylation modification in patients. The relationship between TLR9 expression was explored using RT-QPCR, the relationship between secretion of inflammatory factors, efficacy and TLR9 mRNA expression was determined using Luminex technology. The results showed that during anti-HBV treatment with Ta1 combined with entecavir, histone acetylation increased in patients PBMCs, acetylated protein H3K9Ac had significant binding with promoter region of the TRL9 gene, thereby increasing the expression of TRL9 mRNA, activating the immune pathway under TRL9 regulation, promoting secretion of inflammation factors IL-6, IL-12, IFN-{gamma}, and TNF-, boosting the progress of antiviral therapy. H3K9 acetylation modification of TLR9 exists and plays an important role in patients with chronic hepatitis B. During the combination therapy with entecavir and Ta1, histone acetylation modification of TLR9 was significantly improved, which increased the expression of TLR9 at the mRNA and protein levels, and further regulated IL-6, IL-12 and other cytokines.",

    "abstract": "A characteristic feature of most plants is their ability to perform photosynthesis, which ultimately provides energy and organic substrates to most life. Photosynthesis dominates chloroplast physiology but represents only a fraction of the tightly interconnected metabolic network that spans the entire cell. Here, we explore how photosynthetic activity affects the energy physiological status in cell compartments beyond the chloroplast. We develop precision live monitoring of subcellular energy physiology under illumination to investigate pH, MgATP2- and NADH/NAD+ dynamics at dark-light transitions by confocal imaging of genetically encoded fluorescent protein biosensors in Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll. We resolve the in vivo signature of stromal alkalinisation resulting from photosynthetic proton pumping and observe a similar pH signature also in the cytosol and the mitochondria suggesting that photosynthesis triggers an  alkalinisation wave that affects the pH landscape of large parts of the cell. MgATP2- increases in the stroma at illumination, but no major effects on MgATP2- concentrations in the cytosol were resolved. Photosynthetic activity triggers a signature of substantial NAD reduction in the cytosol that is driven by photosynthesis-derived electron export. Strikingly, cytosolic NAD redox status was deregulated in mutants of chloroplastic NADP- and mitochondrial NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenases even at darkness, pinpointing the participation of the chloroplasts and mitochondria in shaping cytosolic redox metabolism in vivo with a dominant function of malate metabolism. Our data illustrate how profoundly and rapidly changes in photosynthetic activity affect the physiological and metabolic landscape throughout green plant cells.\n\nOne-sentence summaryDark-light transitions trigger profound re-orchestration of subcellular pH and NAD redox physiology not only in the chloroplast but also beyond, in the cytosol and the mitochondria, as revealed by precision live-monitoring using fluorescent protein biosensors.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous spawning is an important behavior to increase fertilization success of invertebrates with external fertilization. Previous work has shown that it is possible to induce spawning behavior using free radicals in tank experiments, but the stimulus for spawning in the wild is not fully understood. Ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai mainly spawn during stormy weather. Rainwater contains H2O2 and iron (II) ions (Fe2+). We propose that during stormy weather water layers in the ocean are mixed and the surface layer containing H2O2 and Fe2+ interacts with the ocean bottom; this leads to conditions suitable for the Fenton reaction to occur. Hydroxyl radicals ({middle dot}OH) are generated during the oxidization of Fe2+ by H2O2 and we hypothesized these induce spawning behavior of abalone in the wild. This study observed that H. discus hannai released eggs after salinity decreased due to the rainfall during stormy conditions. In addition, our tank experiment demonstrated that {middle dot}OH generated by the Fenton reaction induced synchronous spawning behavior between the sexes. This study provides a new hypothesis about control of synchronous spawning in H. discus hannai and the results could be applicable to other invertebrates.",

Here, we show a novel sleep-regulating neuronal circuit in the protocerebral bridge (PB) of the central complex. Activation of the PB interneurons labeled by the R59E08-Gal4 and the PB columnar neurons in the R52B10-Gal4 promoted sleep and wakefulness, respectively. A targeted GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (t-GRASP) analysis demonstrated synaptic contacts between these two groups of sleep-regulating PB neurons. Furthermore, we found that activation of a pair of dopaminergic (DA) neurons projecting to the PB (T1 DA neurons) decreased sleep. The wake-promoting T1 DA neurons and the sleep-promoting PB interneurons formed close associations. Dopamine 2-like receptor (Dop2R) knockdown in the sleep-promoting PB interneurons increased sleep. These results indicated that the neuronal circuit in the PB regulated by dopamine signaling mediates sleep-wakefulness.",

    "abstract": "Cortical synchrony is theorized to contribute to communication between connected networks during executive functioning. To understand the functional role of neural synchrony in cognitive flexibility, we recorded from auditory cortex (AC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while mice performed an auditory extinction learning task. We found that while animals gradually showed reduced responding to the unrewarded tone over hundreds of trials, the power of local field potential (LFP) oscillations (8-18 Hz, centered at alpha/beta frequencies) in AC and mPFC exhibited immediate and robust increases, prior to behavioral changes. The strength of LFP alpha/beta power in the mPFC, but not AC, was strongly correlated with the behavioral performance that mice would achieve later in the training session. Further, we found that coherence between AC and mPFC at 8-18Hz was selectively enhanced only after mice learned to suppress licking, and this LFP coherence increase coincided with a reduction in spiking rate for the unrewarded tone in AC. These results reveal that enhanced interactions between PFC and AC is an inherent property of auditory discrimination learning, and that coordinated alpha/beta oscillations contribute to cognitive flexibility.",

Here, we present an in-depth analysis of their steady-state transcriptomes, highlighting pronounced functional specializations. Gene transcription indicates that pro-inflammatory and antibacterial processes are associated with cM, while ncM appear to be specialized in regulatory/anti-inflammatory functions and tissue repair, as well as antiviral responses and T-cell immunomodulation. In support of these functional differences, we found that oxidative phosphorylation prevails in ncM, whereas cM are clearly biased towards aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, bovine monocyte subsets differed in their responsiveness to TLR ligands, supporting an antiviral role of ncM. Taken together, these data clearly indicate a variety of subset-specific functions in cM and ncM that are likely to be transferable to monocyte subsets of other species, including humans.",

    "abstract": "Functional traits determine an organisms performance in a given environment and as such determine which organisms will be found where. Species respond to local conditions, but also to larger scale gradients, such as climate. Trait ecology links these responses of species to community composition and species distributions. Yet, we often do not know which environmental gradients are most important in determining community trait composition at either local or biogeographical scales, or their interaction. Here we quantify the relative contribution of local and climatic conditions to the structure and composition of functional traits found within bromeliad invertebrate communities. We conclude that climate explains more variation in invertebrate trait composition within bromeliads than does local conditions. Importantly, climate mediated the response of traits to local conditions; for example, invertebrates with benthic life-history traits increased with bromeliad water volume only under certain precipitation regimes. Our ability to detect this and other patterns hinged on the compilation of multiple fine-grained datasets, allowing us to contrast the effect of climate vs. local conditions. We suggest that, in addition to sampling communities at local scales, we need to aggregate studies that span large ranges in climate variation in order to fully understand trait filtering at local, regional and global scales.",

    "abstract": "Many metrics that describe the structure of mutualistic plant-pollinator networks have been found to be important for network stability and robustness. These metrics are impacted by a suite of variables, including species traits, species abundances, their spatial configuration, and their phylogenetic history. Here, we consider a specific trait, phenology, or the timing of life history events. We expect that timing and duration of activity of pollinators, or of flowering in plants, could greatly affect the structure of the networks in which they are embedded. Using plant-pollinator networks from 33 sites in southern British Columbia, Canada, we asked a) how phenological species traits, specifically timing of first appearance in the network and duration of activity in a network, were related to network structure, and b) how those traits affected network robustness to phenologically biased species loss. We found that long duration of activity increased connection within modules for both pollinators and plants and among modules for plants. We also found that date of first appearance was positively related to interaction strength asymmetry in plants but negatively related in pollinators. Networks were generally more robust to the loss of pollinators than plants, but robustness declined with loss of early-flying or long-duration pollinators. These pollinators tended to be among-module connectors. Our results show that changes in phenology have the potential to impact plant-pollinator networks, which may have conservation relevance in a time of changing climate.",

In MINSTED, the intensity minimum of the STED donut, and hence the point of minimal STED, serves as a movable reference coordinate for fluorophore localization. As the STED rate, the background, and the required number of fluorescence detections are low compared to most other STED microscopy and localization methods, MINSTED entails substantially less fluorophore bleaching. In our implementation, 200-1000 detections per fluorophore provide a localization precision of 1-3 nm in standard deviation, which in conjunction with independent single fluorophore switching translates to a ~100-fold improvement of far-field microscopy resolution over the diffraction limit. The performance of MINSTED nanoscopy is demonstrated by imaging the distribution of Mic60 proteins in the mitochondrial inner membrane of human cells.",

    "abstract": "An anxious or inhibited temperament (IT) early in life is a major risk factor for the later development of stress-related psychopathology. Starting in infancy, nonhuman primates, like humans, begin to reveal their temperament when exposed to novel situations. Here, in Study 1 we demonstrate this infant IT predicts adult behavior. Specifically, in over 600 monkeys, we found that individuals scored as inhibited during infancy were more likely to refuse treats offered by potentially-threatening human experimenters as adults. In Study 2, using a sample of over 4000 monkeys from a large multi-generational family pedigree, we demonstrate that infant IT is partially heritable. The data revealed infant IT to reflect a co-inherited substrate that manifests across multiple latent variables. Finally, in Study 3 we performed whole-genome sequencing in 106 monkeys to identify IT-associated single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). Results demonstrated a genome-wide significant SNV near CTNNA2, suggesting a molecular target worthy of additional investigation. Moreover, we observed lower p-values in genes implicated in human association studies of neuroticism and depression. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of our model of infant inhibited temperament in the rhesus monkey to facilitate discovery of genes that are relevant to the long-term inherited risk to develop anxiety and depressive disorders.",

Our method utilizes state-of-the-art optimization strategies to reduce the computational cost.

    "abstract": "The largest extinct volant birds (Pelagornis sandersi and Argentavis magnificens) and pterosaurs (Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus) are thought to have used wind-dependent soaring flight, similar to modern large birds. There are two types of soaring: thermal soaring, used by condors and frigatebirds, which involves the use of updrafts to ascend and then glide horizontally over the land or the sea; and dynamic soaring, used by albatrosses, which involves the use of wind speed differences with height above the sea surface. Previous studies have suggested that Pelagornis sandersi used dynamic soaring, while Argenthavis magnificens, Pteranodon, and Quetzalcoatlus used thermal soaring. However, the performance and wind speed requirements of dynamic and thermal soaring for these species have not yet been quantified comprehensively. We quantified these values using aerodynamic models and compared them with that of extant birds. For dynamic soaring, we quantified maximum flight speeds and maximum upwind flight speeds. For thermal soaring, we quantified the animals sinking speed circling at a given radius and how far it could glide losing a given height. Our results confirmed those from previous studies that Pteranodon and Argentavis magnificens used thermal soaring. Conversely, the results for Pelagornis sandersi and Quetzalcoatlus were contrary to those from previous studies. Pelagornis sandersi used thermal soaring, and Quetzalcoatlus had a poor ability both in dynamic and thermal soaring. Our results demonstrate the need for comprehensive assessments of performance and required wind conditions when estimating soaring styles of extinct flying species.",

    "abstract": "Evaluative beauty judgments are very common, but in spite of this commonality, are rarely studied in cognitive neuroscience. Here we investigated the neural and musical attributes of musical beauty using a naturalistic free-listening paradigm applied to behavioral and neuroimaging recordings and validated by experts judgments. In Study 1, 30 Western healthy adult participants rated continuously the perceived beauty of three musical pieces using a motion sensor. This allowed us to identify the passages in the three musical pieces that were inter-subjectively judged as beautiful or ugly. This informed the analysis for Study 2, where additional 36 participants were recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they listened attentively to the same musical pieces as in Study 1. In Study 3, in order to identify the musicological features characterizing the passages that were consistently rated as beautiful or ugly in Study 1, we collected post-hoc questionnaires from 12 music-composition experts. Results from Study 2 evidenced focal regional activity in the orbitofrontal brain structure when listening to beautiful passages of music, irrespectively of the subjective reactions and individual listening biographies. In turn, the moments in the music that were consistently rated as ugly were associated with bilateral supratemporal activity. Effective connectivity analysis also discovered inhibition of auditory activation and neural communication with orbitofrontal cortex, especially in the right hemisphere, during listening to beautiful musical passages as opposed to intrinsic activation of auditory cortices and decreased coupling to orbitofrontal cortex during listening to ugly musical passages. Experts questionnaires indicated that the beautiful passages were more melodic, calm, sad, slow, tonal, traditional and simple than the ones negatively valenced. In sum, we identified a neural mechanism for inter-subjective beauty judgments of music in the supratemporal-orbitofrontal circuit, irrespectively of individual taste and listening biography. Furthermore, some invariance in objective musical attributes of beautiful and ugly passages was evidenced. Future studies might address the generalizability of the findings to non-Western listeners.",

    "abstract": "Detection of novel stimuli that violate statistical regularities in the sensory scene is of paramount importance for the survival of biological organisms. Event-related potentials, phasic increases in pupil size, and evoked changes in oscillatory power in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range have been proposed as markers of sensory novelty detection. However, how conscious access to novelty modulates these different brain responses is not well understood. Here, we studied the neural responses to sensory novelty in the auditory modality with and without conscious access. We identified individual thresholds for conscious auditory discrimination and presented to our participants sequences of tones, where the last stimulus could be another standard, a subthreshold target or a suprathreshold target. Participants were instructed to report whether the last tone of each sequence was the same or different from those preceding it. Results indicate that stimulus evaluation and overt decision-making mechanisms, indexed by the P3 event-related response and reaction times, best predict whether a novel stimulus will be consciously accessed or not. In contrast, increased pupil size does not predict conscious access to novelty but reflects unexpected sensory uncertainty. These results highlight the interplay between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms and how the brain weights neural responses to novelty and uncertainty during perception and goal-directed behavior.",

Confirmed active tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial cells of intestine and kidney proximal tubule, and in aging cardiomyocytes, capriciously manifests extra-pulmonary organ-related clinical symptoms in about half of COVID-19 patients, occurring by poorly understood mechanisms. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing a clue that these three particular cell types share a common denominator kindred of uniquely expressing the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 protein (alternatively called NBB, B, B0) serving glutamine and tryptophan uptake. B0AT1 is a cellular trafficking chaperone partner of ACE2, shown by cryo-EM to form a thermodynamically-favored stabilized 2ACE2:2B0AT1 dimer-of-heterodimers. The gut is the bodys site of greatest magnitude expression depot of both ACE2 and B0AT1. This starkly contrasts with pulmonary pneumocyte expression of monomeric ACE2 with conspicuously undetectable B0AT1. We hypothesized that B0AT1 steers the organ-related interplay amongst ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The present study employed molecular docking modeling that indicated active site catalytic pocket residues of TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 each formed bonds [&le;] 2 A with monomer ACE2 specific residues within a span R652-D713 involved in cleaving sACE2 soluble ectodomain release. These bonds are consistent with competitive binding interactions of experimental anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug small molecules including Camostat and Nafamostat. Without B0AT1, ACE2 residues K657 and N699 dominated docking bonding with TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 active sites, with ACE2 R710 and R709 contributing electrostatic attractions, but notably ACE2 S708 never closer than 16-44 A. However, in the dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement all ACE2 neck region residues were limited to TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 approaches 35 A, with the interference directly attributed to the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of 2ACE2:2B0AT1; ADAM17 failed to dock by bumping its active site pocket oriented dysfunctionally outwardly facing 1800 away. Results were the same whether the dimer-of-heterodimers was in either the \"closed\" or \"open\" conformation, or whether or not SARS-CoV-2 RBD was complexed to ACE2. The results implicate B0AT1-and in particular the 2ACE2:2B0AT1 complex-as a maJor player in the landscape of COVID-19 pathophysiology engaging TMPRSS2 and ADAM17, consistent with experimental evidence in the literature and in clinical reports. These findings provide a gateway to understanding the roles of B0AT1 relating to COVID-19 manifestations putatively assigned to intestinal and renal epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with underpinnings useful for considerations in public hygiene policy and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Intraviral protein-protein interactions are crucial for replication, pathogenicity, and viral assembly. Among these, virus assembly is a critical step as it regulates the arrangements of viral structural proteins and helps in the encapsulation of genomic material. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins play an essential role in the self-rearrangement, RNA encapsulation, and mature virus particle formation. In SARS-CoV, the membrane protein interacts with the envelope and spike protein in Endoplasmic Reticulum Golgi Intermediate Complex (ERGIC) to form an assembly in the lipid bilayer, followed by membrane-ribonucleoprotein (nucleocapsid) interaction. In this study, we tried to understand the interaction of membrane proteins interaction with envelope, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins using protein-protein docking. Further, simulation studies performed up to 100 ns to examine the stability of protein-protein complexes of Membrane-Envelope, Membrane-Spike, and Membrane-Nucleocapsid. Prime MM-GBSA showed high binding energy calculations than the docked complex. The interactions identified in our study will be of great importance, as it provides valuable insight into the protein-protein complex, which could be the potential drug targets for future studies.",

    "abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a serious health threat to humans and a number of countries are already in the middle of the second wave of infection. There is an urgent need to develop therapeutics against this deadly virus. Recent scientific evidences have suggested that the main protease (Mpro) enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 can be an ideal drug target due to its crucial role in the viral replication and transcription processes. Therefore, there are ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that resulted in hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand bound Mpro complexes in the protein data bank (PDB) that describe structural details of different chemotypes of fragments binding within different sites in Mpro. In this work, we perform rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their interactions at atomic level. Using a total of ~2.25 s long MD trajectories, we identified and characterized different pockets and their conformational dynamics in the apo Mpro structure. Later, using the published PDB structures, we analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of small ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands in the catalytic sites and other pockets in Mpro. Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket in the catalytic site in Mpro that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in this lateral pocket towards ligand binding and affinity against Mpro through computational mutation analyses. Further, we revealed the effects of explicit water molecules and Mpro dimerization in the ligand association with the target. Thus, comprehensive molecular level insights gained from this work can be useful to identify or design potent small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in renin-angiotensin system regulation and amino acid homeostasis. Human ACE2 acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is also widely expressed in epithelial cells of lungs, heart, kidney and pancreas. It is considered an important drug target for treating SARS-CoV-2, as well as pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension, renal diseases and diabetes. Despite the critical importance, the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2 receptor remains unknown. Here, we address this challenge through all-atom simulations using a novel ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) method. Microsecond LiGaMD simulations have successfully captured both binding and unbinding of the MLN-4760 inhibitor in the ACE2 receptor. In the ligand unbound state, the ACE2 receptor samples distinct Open, Partially Open and Closed conformations. Ligand binding biases the receptor conformational ensemble towards the Closed state. The LiGaMD simulations thus suggest a conformational selection mechanism for ligand recognition by the ACE2 receptor. Our simulation findings are expected to facilitate rational drug design of ACE2 against coronaviruses and other related human diseases.",

    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to fold out, the morbidity and mortality are increasing daily. Effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We recently discovered four SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII and GC-376 with potent antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Despite the weaker enzymatic inhibition of calpain inhibitors II and XII against Mpro compared to GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII had more potent cellular antiviral activity. This observation promoted us to hypothesize that the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII might also involve the inhibition of cathepsin L in addition to Mpro. To test this hypothesis, we tested calpain inhibitors II and XII in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay in Vero E6 cells and found that both compounds significantly decreased pseudoviral particle entry into cells, indicating their role in inhibiting cathepsin L. The involvement of cathepsin L was further confirmed in the drug time-of-addition experiment. In addition, we found that these four compounds not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2, but also SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as human coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the viral Mpro, which was supported by the thermal shift binding assay and enzymatic FRET assay. We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with remdesivir. Altogether, these results suggest that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 are not only promising antiviral drug candidates against existing human coronaviruses, but also might work against future emerging CoVs.",

Here, we describe protein engineering and modular design principles that have led to the development of synthetic bivalent and tetravalent nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. The best nAb targets the host receptor binding site of the viral S-protein and its tetravalent versions can block entry with a potency that exceeds the bivalent nAbs by an order of magnitude. Structural studies show that both the bivalent and tetravalent nAbs can make multivalent interactions with a single S-protein trimer, observations consistent with the avidity and potency of these molecules. Significantly, we show that the tetravalent nAbs show much increased tolerance to potential virus escape mutants. Bivalent and tetravalent nAbs can be produced at large-scale and are as stable and specific as approved antibody drugs. Our results provide a general framework for developing potent antiviral therapies against COVID-19 and related viral threats, and our strategy can be readily applied to any antibody drug currently in development.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is thought to release its RNA genome at either the cell surface or within endosomes, the balance being dependent on spike protein stability, and the complement of receptors, co-receptors and proteases. To investigate possible mediators of pH-dependence, pKa calculations have been made on a set of structures for spike protein ectodomain and fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, 3 histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilising in pre-fusion (all 3) and post-fusion (2 of 3) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface salt-bridge interactions, and sidechain-mainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges (D290 - R273 and R355 - D398) have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilising in more open forms of the spike trimer. These aspartic acids are most stabilised in a tightly closed conformation that has been observed when linoleic acid is bound, and which also affects the interactions of D614. The D614G mutation is known to modulate the balance of closed to open trimer. It is suggested that D398 in particular contributes to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium, potentially coupled to the effects of linoleic acid binding and D614G mutation, and possibly also A570D mutation. These observations are discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mutagenesis studies, and other human coronaviruses.",

The lack of a comprehensive database for human-associated viruses, along with inadequate methods for high-throughput identification of highly divergent viruses in metagenomic data, has historically stymied efforts to characterize virus sequences in a comprehensive way. In this study, a new high-specificity and high-sensitivity bioinformatic tool, Cenote-Taker 2, was applied to thousands of human metagenome datasets, uncovering over 50,000 unique virus operational taxonomic units.

    "abstract": "Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is lost in approximately 70% of sporadic breast cancers, with an inclination towards triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is treated with traditional chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel (PTX); however, tumors often develop drug resistance. We previously created APC knockdown cells (APC shRNA1) using the human TNBC cells, MDA-MB-157, and showed that APC loss induces PTX resistance. To understand the mechanisms behind APC-mediated PTX response, we performed cell cycle analysis and analyzed cell cycle related proteins. Cell cycle analysis indicated increased G2/M population in PTX-treated APC shRNA1 cells compared to PTX-treated controls, suggesting that APC expression does not alter PTX-induced G2/M arrest. We further studied the subcellular localization of the G2/M transition proteins, cyclin B1 and CDK1. The APC shRNA1 cells had increased CDK1, which was preferentially localized to the cytoplasm, and increased CDK6. RNA-sequencing was performed to gain a global understanding of changes downstream of APC loss and identified a broad mis-regulation of cell cycle-related genes in APC shRNA1 cells. Our studies are the first to show an interaction between APC and taxane response in breast cancer. The implications include designing combination therapy to re-sensitize APC-mutant breast cancers to taxanes using the specific cell cycle alterations.",

However, the mechano-sensing and -responding properties of mitochondria and the correlation between mitochondrial morphologies and functions are unclear due to the lack of methods to precisely exert mechano-stimulation on and deform mitochondria inside live cells. Here we present an optogenetic approach that uses light to induce deformation of mitochondria by recruiting molecular motors to the outer mitochondrial membrane via light-activated protein-protein hetero-dimerization. Mechanical forces generated by motor proteins distort the outer membrane, during which the inner mitochondrial membrane can also be deformed. Moreover, this optical method can achieve subcellular spatial precision and be combined with other optical dimerizers and molecular motors. This method presents a novel mitochondria-specific mechano-stimulator for studying mitochondria mechanobiology and the interplay between mitochondria shapes and functions.",

However, the ever-growing gathering of biological data implied in larger and more complex models that are computationally challenging for current discrete-stochastic simulation methods. In this work, we propose a constraint-based algorithm to simulate such reaction systems, called the Constraint-Based Simulation Algorithm (CBSA). The main advantage of the proposed method is that it is intrinsically parallelizable, thus being able to be implemented in GPGPU architectures. We show through examples that our method can provide valid solutions when compared to the well-known Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). An analysis of computational efficiency showed that the CBSA tend to outperform other considered methods when dealing with a high number of molecules and reaction channels. Therefore, we believe that the proposed method constitutes an interesting alternative when simulating large chemical reaction systems.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been widely used as an efficient transgenic vector in biomedical research, as well as gene therapy. Serotype-associated transduction efficiency, tissue- or cell-type tropism and immunological profile are major considerations in the various applications of rAAVs. There are increasing needs for different serotypes of rAAV, either naturally isolated or artificially engineered. However, affordable and scalable production of a desired serotype of rAAV remains very difficult, especially for researchers lacking relevant experience. On the basis of our previously established single recombinant baculovirus expression vector (BEV)-derived OneBac system, we have optimized the process and expanded the rAAV production range to the full range of serotypes rAAV1-13. Firstly, the AAV Cap gene was optimized to translate by ribosome leaky scanning and the gene of interest (GOI) was cloned into the pFD/Cap-(ITR-GOI)-Rep2 shutte plasmid. Following the classical Bac-to-Bac method, sufficient BEV stock containing all rAAV packaging elements can be quickly obtained. Finally, we can repeatedly scale up production of rAAVs in one week by using a single BEV to infect suspension-cultured Sf9 cells. The rAAV1-13 show relatively high yields ranging from 5x104 to 4x105 VG/cell. More than 1x1015 VG purified rAAVs can be easily obtained from 5 L suspension-cultured Sf9 cells. As expected, rAAV serotypes 1-13 show different potencies for in vitro transduction and cell-type tropisms. In summary, the single BEV-derived OneBac system should prove popular for laboratory scaling-up production of any serotype of rAAV.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLimited information is available on whether blaKPC-containing plasmids from isolates in a hospital outbreak can be differentiated from epidemiologically unrelated blaKPC-containing plasmids based on sequence data.\n\nObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the performance of three approaches to distinguish epidemiologically related from unrelated blaKPC-containing IncF plasmids.\n\nMethodEpidemiologically related isolates, were short- and long-read whole genome sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq and MinION sequencer. A hybrid assembly was performed and plasmid sequences were extracted from the assembly graph. Epidemiologically unrelated plasmid sequences were extracted from the GenBank. Pairwise comparisons were performed of epidemiologically related and unrelated plasmids based on SNP differences using snippy, phylogenetic distance using Roary and using a similarity index that penalizes size differences between plasmids (Stoesser-index). The percentage of pairwise comparisons misclassified as genetically related or as clonally unrelated was determined using different genetic thresholds for genetic relatedness for all three comparison methods.\n\nResultsDespite the median number of SNP differences, Roary phylogenetic distance, and Stoesser-index differed between the epidemiologically related and unrelated plasmids, the range of differences overlapped between the two comparison groups for all three comparison methods. When using a genetic similarity threshold that classified 100% of epidemiologically related plasmid pairs as genetically related, the percentages of plasmids misclassified as epidemiologically related ranged from 6.7% (Roary) to 20.8% (Stoesser-index).\n\nDiscussionAlthough epidemiologically related plasmids can be distinguished from unrelated plasmids based on genetic similarity, epidemiologically related and unrelated blaKPC-containing IncF plasmids show a high degree of sequence similarity. The phylogenetic distance as determined using Roary showed the highest degree of discriminatory power between the epidemiologically related and unrelated plasmids.\n\nImpact statementAccurately distinguishing epidemiologically related from unrelated plasmids is essential to detect nosocomial plasmid transmission in outbreaks. However, limited information is available on whether blaKPC-containing plasmids from isolates in a hospital outbreak can be differentiated from epidemiologically unrelated blaKPC-containing plasmids based on sequence data. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three approaches to distinguish epidemiologically related from unrelated blaKPC-containing IncF plasmids. Pairwise comparisons were performed of epidemiologically related and unrelated plasmids based on SNP differences using snippy, phylogenetic distance using Roary and using a similarity index that penalizes size differences between plasmids (Stoesser-index). Based on our results, epidemiologically related plasmids can be distinguished from unrelated plasmids based on genetic similarity. Despite this, epidemiologically related and unrelated blaKPC-containing IncF plasmids show a high degree of sequence similarity and judgements on the horizontal transfer of these plasmids during hospital outbreaks based on genetic identity should be made with caution. The phylogenetic distance determined using Roary showed the highest discriminatory power between the epidemiologically related and unrelated plasmids.\n\nData summaryShort-and long-read sequence data of the epidemiologically related Enterobacteriaceae isolates included in this study are available from the publicly available European Nucleotide Archive of the European Bioinformatics Institute under study accession number: PRJEB41009.

    "abstract": "A tightly regulated innate immune response to trypanosome infections is critical to strike a balance between parasite control and inflammation-associated pathology. In the present study, we make use of the recently established Trypanosoma carassii infection model in larval zebrafish to study the early response of macrophages and neutrophils to trypanosome infections in vivo. We consistently identified high- and low-infected individuals and were able to simultaneously characterize their differential innate response. Not only did macrophage and neutrophil number and distribution differ between the two groups, but also macrophage morphology and activation state. Exclusive to high-infected zebrafish, was the appearance of macrophages rich in lipid droplets, confirmed to be foamy macrophages and characterized by a strong pro-inflammatory profile. Altogether, we provide an in vivo characterization of the differential response of macrophage and neutrophil to trypanosome infection and identify foamy macrophages as potentially associated with an exacerbated immune response and susceptibility to the infection. To our knowledge this is the first report of the occurrence of foamy macrophages during an extracellular trypanosome infection.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003 caused by SARS-CoV, and the pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020 caused by 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2), have threatened human health globally and raised the urgency to develop effective antivirals against the viruses. In this study, we expressed and purified the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) nsp12 of SARS-CoV and developed a primer extension assay for the evaluation of nsp12 activity. We found that nsp12 could efficiently extend single-stranded RNA, while having low activity towards double-stranded RNA. Nsp12 required a catalytic metal (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for polymerase activity and the activity was also K+-dependent, while Na+ promoted pyrophosphorylation, the reverse process of polymerization. To identify antivirals against nsp12, a competitive assay was developed containing 4 natural rNTPs and a nucleotide analog, and the inhibitory effects of 24 FDA-approved nucleotide analogs were evaluated in their corresponding active triphosphate forms. Ten of the analogs, including 2 HIV NRTIs, could inhibit the RNA extension of nsp12 by more than 40%. The 10 hits were verified which showed dose-dependent inhibition. In addition, the 24 nucleotide analogs were screened on SARS-CoV primase nsp8 which revealed stavudine and remdesivir were specific inhibitors to nsp12. Furthermore, the 2 HIV NRTIs were evaluated on 2019-nCoV nsp12 which showed inhibition as well. Then we expanded the evaluation to all 8 FDA-approved HIV NRTIs and discovered 5 of them, tenofovir, stavudine, abacavir, zidovudine and zalcitabine, could inhibit the RNA extension by nsp12 of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. In conclusion, 5 FDA-approved HIV NRTIs inhibited the RNA extension by nsp12 and were promising candidates for the treatment of SARS and COVID-19.",

STM is able to obtain all nutrients required for rapid proliferation, although being separated from direct access to host cell metabolites. The formation of specific tubular membrane compartment, called Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs) are known to provides bacterial nutrition by giving STM access to endocytosed material and enabling proliferation. Additionally, STM expresses a range of nutrient uptake system for growth in nutrient limited environments to overcome the nutrition depletion inside the host. By utilizing dual fluorescence reporters, we shed light on the nutritional environment of intracellular STM in various host cells and distinct intracellular niches. We showed that STM uses nutrients of the host cell and adapts uniquely to the different nutrient conditions. In addition, we provide further evidence for improved nutrient supply by SIF formation or presence in the cytosol of epithelial cells, and the correlation of nutrient supply to bacterial proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Manipulation of gene expression is one of the best approaches for studying gene function in vivo. CRISPR-Cas13 has the potential to be a powerful technique for manipulating RNA expression in diverse animal systems in vivo, including Drosophila melanogaster. Studies using Cas13 in mammalian cell lines for gene knockdown showed increased on-target efficiency and decreased off-targeting relative to RNAi. Moreover, catalytically inactive Cas13 fusions can be used to image RNA molecules, install precise changes to the epitranscriptome, or alter splicing. However, recent studies have suggested that there may be limitations to the deployment of these tools in Drosophila, so further optimization of the system is required. Here, we report a new set of PspCas13b and RfxCas13d expression constructs and use these reagents to successfully knockdown both reporter and endogenous transcripts in Drosophila cells. As toxicity issues have been reported with high level of Cas13, we effectively decreased PspCas13b expression without impairing its function by tuning down translation. Furthermore, we altered the spatial activity of both PspCas13b and RfxCas13d by introducing Nuclear Exportation Sequences (NES) and Nuclear Localization Sequences (NLS) while maintaining activity. Finally, we generated a stable cell line expressing RfxCas13d under the inducible metallothionein promoter, establishing a useful tool for high-throughput genetic screening. Thus, we report new reagents for performing RNA CRISPR-Cas13 experiments in Drosophila, providing additional Cas13 expression constructs that retain activity.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a degradative pathway required to maintain neuronal homeostasis. Neuronal autophagosomes form constitutively at the axon terminal and mature via lysosomal fusion during dynein-mediated transport to the soma. How the dynein-autophagosome interaction is regulated during maturation is unknown. Here, we identify a series of handoffs between dynein effectors as autophagosomes transit along the axons of primary neurons. In the distal axon, JIP1 initiates autophagosomal transport, while autophagosomes in the mid-axon require HAP1 and Huntingtin for motility. We demonstrate that HAP1 is a bonafide dynein activator, binding the dynein-dynactin complex via canonical and noncanonical interactions. JIP3 is found on most axonal autophagosomes but specifically regulates the transport of acidified autolysosomes. Inhibiting autophagosomal transport disrupts maturation, while inhibiting autophagosomal maturation perturbs the association and function of dynein effectors. Thus maturation and transport are tightly linked. These results describe a novel maturation-based dynein effector handoff on neuronal autophagosomes that is key to autophagosomal motility, cargo degradation, and the maintenance of axonal health.\n\nSummaryNeuronal autophagosomes form in the distal axon and mature via fusion with lysosomes during their dynein-driven transport to the soma. Dynein is regulated on autophagosomes by distinct effector proteins--JIP1, HAP1, and JIP3--depending on location and autophagosomal maturity. In this sequential pathway, transport and maturation state are tightly linked to maintain neuronal health.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells are in most instances characterized by rapid proliferation and uncontrolled cell division. Hence, they must adapt to proliferation-induced metabolic stress through intrinsic or acquired anti-metabolic stress responses to maintain homeostasis and survival. One mechanism to achieve this is to reprogram gene expression in a metabolism-dependent manner. MondoA (also known as MLXIP), a member of the MYC interactome, has been described as an example of such a metabolic sensor. However, the role of MondoA in malignancy is not fully understood and the underlying mechanism in metabolic responses remains elusive. By assessing patient data sets we found that MondoA overexpression is associated with a worse survival in pediatric common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL). Using CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference approaches, we observed that MondoA depletion reduces transformational capacity of cALL cells in vitro and dramatically inhibits malignant potential in an in vivo mouse model. Interestingly, reduced expression of MondoA in patient data sets correlated with enrichment in metabolic pathways. The loss of MondoA correlated with increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Mechanistically, MondoA senses metabolic stress in cALL cells by restricting oxidative phosphorylation through reduced PDH activity. Glutamine starvation conditions greatly enhance this effect and highlight the inability to mitigate metabolic stress upon loss of MondoA in cALL. Our findings give a novel insight into the function of MondoA in pediatric cALL and support the notion that MondoA inhibition in this entity offers a therapeutic opportunity and should be further explored.\n\nKey PointsMondoA maintains aggressiveness and leukemic burden in common ALL, modulating metabolic stress response.",

Here we show that dermal EZH2, the methyltransferase enzyme of the epigenetic Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is a new coordinator of both these processes. Dermal EZH2 activity is present during dermal fibroblast differentiation and is required for spatially restricting Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling to reinforce dermal fibroblast cell fate. Later in development, dermal EZH2 regulates the differentiation to reticular dermal fibroblasts and initiation of secondary hair follicles. Embryos lacking dermal Ezh2 have elevated epidermal proliferation and differentiation that can be rescued by small molecule inhibition of retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Together, our study reveals that dermal EZH2 acts as a rheostat to control the levels of Wnt/{beta}-catenin and RA signaling to impact fibroblast differentiation cell autonomously and epidermal keratinocyte development non-cell autonomously, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Many insect species exhibit basal social behaviors such as aggregation, which play important roles in their feeding and mating ecologies. However, the evolutionary, genetic, and physiological mechanisms that regulate insect aggregation remain unknown for most species. Here, we used natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster to identify the genetic architecture that drives larval aggregation feeding behavior. By using quantitative and reverse genetic approaches, we have identified a complex neurogenetic network that plays a role in regulating the decision of larvae to feed in either solitude or as a group. Results from single gene, RNAi-knockdown experiments show that several of the identified genes represent key nodes in the genetic network that determines the level of aggregation while feeding. Furthermore, we show that a single non-coding SNP in the gene CG14205, a putative acyltransferase, is associated with both decreased mRNA expression and increased aggregate formation, which suggests that it has a specific role in inhibiting aggregation behavior. Our results identify, for the first time, the genetic components which interact to regulate naturally occurring levels of aggregation in D. melanogaster larvae.",

    "abstract": "The use of designed antimicrobial peptides as drugs has been impeded by the absence of simple sequence-structure-function relationships and design rules. The likely cause is that many of these peptides permeabilize membranes via highly disordered, heterogeneous mechanisms, forming aggregates without well-defined tertiary or secondary structure. We demonstrate that the combination of high-throughput library screening with atomistic computer simulations can successfully address this challenge by tuning a previously developed general pore forming peptide into a selective pore former for different lipid types. A library of 2,916 peptides was designed based on the LDKA template. The library peptides were synthesized and screened using a high-throughput orthogonal vesicle leakage assay. Dyes of different sizes were entrapped inside vesicles with varying lipid composition to simultaneously screen for both pore size and affinity for negatively charged and neutral lipid membranes. From this screen, nine different LDKA variants that have unique activity were selected, sequenced, synthesized, and characterized. Despite the minor sequence changes, each of these peptides has unique functional properties, forming either small or large pores and being selective for either neutral or anionic lipid bilayers. Long-scale, unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations directly reveal that rather than rigid, well-defined pores, these peptides can form a large repertoire of functional dynamic and heterogeneous aggregates, strongly affected by single mutations. Predicting the propensity to aggregate and assemble in a given environment from sequence alone holds the key to functional prediction of membrane permeabilization.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous CLC protein superfamily consists of channels, that permit passive diffusion of Cl ions across biological membranes, and pumps, that can actively transport Cl ions against their electrochemical gradient; yet, puzzlingly, both types share a strongly conserved Cl ion transport pathway comprised of three consecutive binding sites. This raises the question; how does the same pathway support passive diffusion in CLC channels and active transport in CLC pumps? Based on high-resolution structural data current theories suggest that subtle structural differences in the conserved pathway allow CLC channels to  leak Cl ions. A recent cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human ClC-1 channel does not show occupancy of the central Cl ion binding site but reveals a wide intracellular vestibule that bifurcates from the conserved pathway in this region. Here we show that replacing residues that line the ClC-1 intracellular vestibule with the corresponding residues of CLC pumps resulted in interactions between permeating anions at neighbouring binding sites and altered anion selectivity. Removing the side chain of a strictly conserved tyrosine residue, that coordinates Cl ion at the central binding site of CLC pumps, removed multi-ion behaviour in ClC-1 mutants. In contrast, removing the side chain of a highly conserved glutamate residue that transiently occupies Cl ion binding sites, as part of the transport mechanism of CLC pumps and the mechanism that opens and closes CLC channels, only partially removed multi-ion behaviour in ClC-1 mutants. Our findings show that structural differences between CLC channels and pumps, outside of the conserved Cl ion transport pathway, fundamentally affect anion permeation in ClC-1 channels.\n\nSummarySome CLC proteins are passive Cl- channels while others are active Cl- pumps but, paradoxically, both share a conserved, canonical, Cl- permeation pathway. Here Bennetts, Morton and Parker show that  pump-like mutations in a poorly conserved region, located remotely from the canonical pathway, affect anion permeation in human ClC-1 channels.",

    "abstract": "Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies composed of architectural RNA (arcRNA) and RNA-binding proteins. In the wild type, the blocks at the two terminal regions of arcRNAs compose the shell of paraspeckles and the middle region between the two terminal blocks composes the core, analogous to micelles of ABC triblock copolymers. We here use an extension of the theory of polymer micelles to predict the structure and size of paraspeckles as one decreases the length of one of the terminal blocks of arcRNA by CRISPR/Cas9, assuming that paraspeckles are spherical. Our theory predicts that when the length of the edited terminal blocks is larger than a critical value, paraspeckles show discontinuous transitions between the structure in which all the edited terminal blocks are localized in the shell and the structure in which all the edited terminal blocks are localized in the core at a threshold value of the transcription rate of arcRNA. In contrast, when the length of the edited terminal blocks is smaller than the critical value, the population of edited terminal blocks in the shell decreases continuously as one increases the transcription rate of arcRNA. The size of paraspeckles increases as one decreases the length of the edited terminal blocks. These predictions are consistent with our experiments.",

    "abstract": "Iron is critical for many processes including oxygen transport and erythropoiesis. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrates that HIF-2 regulates over 90% of all transcripts induced following iron deficiency in the intestine. However, beyond divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) and duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), no other genes/pathways have been critically assessed with respects to their importance in intestinal iron absorption. Ferritinophagy is associated with cargo specific autophagic breakdown of ferritin and subsequent release of iron. We show here that nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated intestinal ferritinophagy is integrated to systemic iron demand via HIF-2. Duodenal NCOA4 expression is regulated by HIF-2 during high systemic iron demands. Moreover, overexpression of intestinal HIF-2 is sufficient to activate NCOA4 and promote lysosomal degradation of ferritin. Promoter analysis revealed NCOA4 as a direct HIF-2 target. To demonstrate the importance of intestinal HIF-2/ferritinophagy axis in systemic iron homeostasis, whole body and intestine-specific NCOA4-null mouse lines were assessed. These analyses demonstrate an iron sequestration in the enterocytes, and significantly high tissue ferritin levels in the dietary iron deficiency and acute hemolytic anemia models. Together, our data suggests efficient ferritinophagy is critical for intestinal iron absorption and systemic iron homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases present a challenge for systems biology, due to the lack of reliable animal models and the difficulties in obtaining samples from patients at early stages of disease, when interventions might be most effective. Studying induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons could overcome these challenges and dramatically accelerate and broaden therapeutic strategies. Here we undertook a network-based multi-omic characterization of iPSC-derived motor neurons from ALS patients carrying genetically dominant hexanucleotide expansions in C9orf72 to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between DNA, RNA, epigenetics and protein in the same pool of tissue. ALS motor neurons showed the expected C9orf72-related alterations to specific nucleoporins and production of dipeptide repeats. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and data-independent acquisition mass-spectrometry (DIA-MS) proteomics were then performed on the same motor neuron cultures. Using integrative computational methods that combined all of the omics, we discovered a number of novel dysregulated pathways including biological adhesion and extracellular matrix organization and disruption in other expected pathways such as RNA splicing and nuclear transport. We tested the relevance of these pathways in vivo in a C9orf72 Drosophila model, analyzing the data to determine which pathways were causing disease phenotypes and which were compensatory. We also confirmed that some pathways are altered in late-stage neurodegeneration by analyzing human postmortem C9 cervical spine data. To validate that these key pathways were integral to the C9 signature, we prepared a separate set of C9orf72 and control motor neuron cultures using a different differentiation protocol and applied the same methods. As expected, there were major overall differences between the differentiation protocols, especially at the level of in individual omics data. However, a number of the core dysregulated pathways remained significant using the integrated multiomic analysis. This new method of analyzing patient specific neural cultures allows the generation of disease-related hypotheses with a small number of patient lines which can be tested in larger cohorts of patients.",

    "abstract": "Allergic diseases arise in susceptible individuals in part because of decrements in protective pathways. The mechanism by which these anti-inflammatory molecules become repressed remains unclear. We have previously reported that epithelial dectin-1 prevents aberrant type 2 responses and is downregulated in the epithelium of allergic patients. Here we report that dectin-1 is constitutively expressed by the respiratory epithelium in humans, and that IL-33 specifically acts as a repressor of dectin-1. Mechanistically, this occurs via IL-33-dependent STAT3 activation and the subsequent repression of the dectin-1 gene, CLEC7A. We have identified a novel enhancer region upstream of the proximal promoter of CLEC7A that is only accessible in epithelial cells, but not in hematopoietic cells. Epigenetic repression of CLEC7A through this newly identified locus, downstream of an aberrant IL-33-STAT3 axis, occurs in the epithelium of allergic individuals. Collectively, our data identify a mechanism of epigenetic fine-tuning of dectin-1 expression in epithelial cells that may participate in allergenicity.",

    "abstract": "Mesendodermal specification is one of the earliest events in embryogenesis, where cells first acquire distinct identities. Cell differentiation is a highly regulated process that involves the function of numerous transcription factors (TFs) and signaling molecules, which can be described with gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Cell differentiation GRNs are difficult to build because existing mechanistic methods are low-throughput, and high-throughput methods tend to be non-mechanistic. Additionally, integrating highly dimensional data comprised of more than two data types is challenging. Here, we use linked self-organizing maps to combine ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq with temporal, spatial and perturbation RNA-seq data from Xenopus tropicalis mesendoderm development to build a high resolution genome scale mechanistic GRN. We recovered both known and previously unsuspected TF-DNA/TF-TF interactions and validated through reporter assays. Our analysis provides new insights into transcriptional regulation of early cell fate decisions and provides a general approach to building GRNs using highly-dimensional multi-omic data sets.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBuilt a generally applicable pipeline to creating GRNs using highly-dimensional multi-omic data sets\nC_LIO_LIPredicted new TF-DNA/TF-TF interactions during mesendoderm development\nC_LIO_LIGenerate the first genome scale GRN for vertebrate mesendoderm and expanded the core mesendodermal developmental network with high fidelity\nC_LIO_LIDeveloped a resource to visualize hundreds of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data using 2D SOM metaclusters.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Existing pre-clinical methods for acquiring dissemination kinetics of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) en route to forming metastases have not been capable of providing a direct measure of CTC intravasation rate and subsequent half-life in the circulation. Here, we demonstrate an approach for measuring endogenous CTC kinetics by continuously exchanging CTC-containing blood over several hours between un-anesthetized, tumor-bearing mice and healthy, tumor-free counterparts. By tracking CTC transfer rates using an autochthonous small cell lung cancer model, we extrapolated half-life times in the circulation of 50-100 seconds and intravasation rates between 4,000 and 27,000 CTCs/hour - an average daily shedding rate equivalent to [~]0.07% of the total number of primary tumor cells in the lung. Additionally, transfer of 1-2% of daily-shed CTCs from late-stage tumor-bearing mice generated macrometastases in healthy recipient mice. We envision that our technique will help further elucidate the role of CTCs and the rate-limiting steps in metastasis.",
