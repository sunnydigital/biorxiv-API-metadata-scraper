    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that the mutational load in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is largely derived from their parental cells, but it is still unknown whether reprogramming may enrich for individual mutations. 30 hiPSC lines were analyzed by whole exome sequencing. High accuracy amplicon sequencing showed that all analyzed small scale variants pre-existed in their parental cells and that individual mutations present in small subpopulations of parental cells become enriched among hiPSC clones during reprogramming. Among those, putatively actionable driver mutations affect genes related to cell cycle control, cell death and pluripotency, and may confer a selective advantage during reprogramming. Finally, a shRNA-based experimental approach was applied to provide additional evidence for the individual impact of such genes on the reprogramming efficiency. In conclusion, we show that enriched mutations in curated onco- and tumor suppressor genes may account for an increased tumor risk and impact the clinical value of patient-derived hiPSCs.",

    "abstract": "Recently, oxytocin (OXT) has generated considerable interest as potential treatment for psychiatric disorders, including general anxiety disorder or autism spectrum disorder. Therefore, knowledge on the involved molecular processes downstream of OXT receptor (OXTR) activation is indispensable. We reveal that alternative splicing of corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2) parallels increased anxiety-like behavior following chronic OXT treatment, contrasting the well-known anxiolysis of acute OXT. In detail, chronic OXT shifts the splicing ratio between membrane-bound (mCRFR2) and soluble CRFR2 (sCRFR2) in favor of the latter via ERK1/2-MEF2A signaling. Targeted manipulations of Crfr2 splicing mimic the effect of chronic OXT, confirming its role in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, chronic OXT triggers cytoplasmic distribution and extracellular release of sCRFR2 into the cerebrospinal fluid, with sCRFR2 levels positively correlating with anxiety-like behavior. Concluding, the dichotomy between anxiolytic mCRFR2 and anxiogenic sCRFR2 is the basis for the deleterious effects of chronic OXT on anxiety.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/255844v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b50691org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c22efborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19a772eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@69af7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mice of the C57BL/6ByJ (B6) strain have higher consumption of, and stronger peripheral neural responses to, sucrose solution than do mice of the 129P3/J (129) strain. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for this strain difference and evaluate the contribution of peripheral taste responsiveness to individual differences in sucrose intake, we produced an intercross (F2) of 627 mice, measured their sucrose consumption in two-bottle choice tests, recorded the electrophysiological activity of the chorda tympani nerve elicited by sucrose in a subset of F2 mice, and genotyped the mice with DNA markers distributed in every mouse chromosome. We confirmed a sucrose consumption QTL (Scon2, or Sac) on mouse chromosome (Chr) 4, harboring the Tas1r3 gene, which encodes the sweet taste receptor subunit T1R3 and affects both behavioral and neural responses to sucrose. For sucrose consumption, we also detected five new main-effect QTLs Scon6 (Chr2), Scon7 (Chr5), Scon8 (Chr8), Scon3 (Chr9) and a sex-specific QTL Scon9 (Chr15), and an interacting QTL pair Scon4 (Chr1) and Scon3 (Chr9). No additional QTLs for the taste nerve responses to sucrose were detected besides the previously known one on Chr4 (Scon2). Identification of the causal genes and variants for these sucrose consumption QTLs may point to novel mechanisms beyond peripheral taste sensitivity that could be harnessed to control obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in automated liquid handling and microfluidics, preparing samples for RNA sequencing at scale generally requires expensive equipment, which is beyond the reach of many academic labs. Manual sample preparation remains a slow, expensive, and error-prone process. Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts - RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (-11x), cost (-3x), and biohazardous waste produced (-4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total). This pipeline is also generalizable for many nucleic acid extraction applications, thereby increasing the scale of studies, which can be performed in small research labs.",

    "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a blood-borne bioactive lipid mediator of endothelial barrier function. Prior studies have implicated mechanical stimulation due to intravascular laminar shear stress in co-regulating S1P signaling in endothelial cells (ECs). Yet, vascular networks in vivo consist of vessel bifurcations, and this geometry produces hemodynamic forces that are distinct from laminar shear stress. However, the role of these forces at vessel bifurcations in regulating S1P-dependent endothelial barrier function is not known. In this study, we implemented a microfluidic platform that recapitulates the flow dynamics of vessel bifurcations with in situ quantification of the permeability of microvessel analogues. Co-application of S1P with impinging bifurcated fluid flow, which was characterized by approximately zero shear stress and 38 dyn cm-2 stagnation pressure at the vessel bifurcation point, promotes vessel stabilization. Similarly, co-treatment of carrier-free S1P with 3 dyn cm-2 laminar shear stress is also protective of endothelial barrier function. Moreover, it is shown that vessel stabilization due to laminar shear stress, but not bifurcated fluid flow, is dependent on S1P receptor 1 or 2 signaling. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the endothelium-protective function of fluid forces at vessel bifurcations and their involvement in coordinating S1P-dependent regulation of vessel permeability.",

Tuning of network architectures is essential for CNNs performance, yet it requires substantial knowledge of machine learning and commitment of time and effort. This process thus imposes a major barrier to broad and effective application of modern deep learning in genomics. Here, we present AMBER, a fully automated framework to efficiently design and apply CNNs for genomic sequences. AMBER designs optimal models for user-specified biological questions through the state-of-the-art Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We applied AMBER to the task of modelling genomic regulatory features and demonstrated that the predictions of the AMBER-designed model are significantly more accurate than the equivalent baseline non-NAS models and match or even exceed published expert-designed models. Interpretation of AMBER architecture search revealed its design principles of utilizing the full space of computational operations for accurately modelling genomic sequences. Furthermore, we illustrated the use of AMBER to accurately discover functional genomic variants in allele-specific binding and disease heritability enrichment. AMBER provides an efficient automated method for designing accurate deep learning models in genomics.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is well orchestrated in mammalian cells through a tight regulation of the temporal order of replication origin activation, named the replication timing, a robust and conserved process in each cell type. Upon low replication stress, the slowing of replication forks induces delayed replication of fragile regions leading to genetic instability. The impact of low replication stress on the replication timing in different cellular backgrounds has not been explored yet. Here we analysed the whole genome replication timing in a panel of 6 human cell lines under low replication stress. We first demonstrated that cancer cells were more impacted than non-tumour cells. Strikingly, we unveiled an enrichment of specific replication domains undergoing a switch from late to early replication in some cancer cells. We found that advances in replication timing correlate with heterochromatin regions poorly sensitive to DNA damage signalling while being subject to an increase of chromatin accessibility. Finally, our data indicate that, following release from replication stress conditions, replication timing advances can be inherited by the next cellular generation, suggesting a new mechanism by which cancer cells would adapt to cellular or environmental stress.",

Importantly, Pcal can infect not only a wide range of Brassicaceae, but also green manure crops such as oat. However, Pcal virulence mechanisms have not been investigated and are not fully understood. We focused on coronatine (COR) function, which is one of the well-known P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 virulence factors, in Pcal infection processes on both dicot and monocot plants. Cabbage and oat plants dip-inoculated with a Pcal KB211 COR mutant ({Delta}cmaA) exhibited reduced virulence compared to Pcal WT. Moreover, {Delta}cmaA failed to reopen stomata on both cabbage and oat, suggesting that COR facilitates Pcal entry through stomata into both plants. Furthermore, cabbage and oat plants syringe-infiltrated with {Delta}cmaA also showed reduced virulence, suggesting that COR is involved in overcoming not only stomatal-based defense, but also apoplastic defense. Indeed, defense related genes, including PR1 and PR2, were highly expressed in plants inoculated with {Delta}cmaA compared to Pcal WT, indicating that COR suppresses defense-related genes of both cabbage and oat. Additionally, SA accumulation increases after {Delta}cmaA inoculation compared to Pcal WT. Taken together, COR contributes to cause disease by suppressing stomatal-based defense and apoplastic defense in both dicot and monocot plants. This is the first study to investigate COR functions in the interaction of Pcal and different host plants (dicot and monocot plants) using genetically and biochemically defined COR deletion mutants.\n\nAuthor summaryDisease outbreaks caused by new Pseudomonas syringae isolates are problems worldwide. P. cannabina pv. alisalensis (Pcal) causes bacterial blight on a wide range of cruciferous plants and bacterial brown spot on oat plants. Although P. syringae deploys a variety of virulence factors, Pcal virulence factors have not been investigated. We focused on coronatine (COR) function, which is one of the well-known P. syringae virulence factors. COR is a non-host-specific phytotoxin and contributes to P. syringae growth and lesion formation or expansion in several host plants. COR function has been mainly studied in the model pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and model the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Thus, COR roles in Pcal infection especially on monocot plants have not been well studied. Therefore, we investigated COR role in Pcal interaction with both dicot and monocot plants. Here, we revealed that COR functions as a multifunctional suppressor to manage Pcal virulence on both plants.",

We found that the reaction behaviours show trends that correlate with phenotypic classes of the simulation output, highlighting particular cellular subsystems that malfunction after gene knockouts. From a graphical representation of the metabolic network, we saw that there is a set of reactions that can be used as markers of a phenotypic class, showing their importance within the network. Our analysis pipeline can support the understanding of the complexity of in silico cells without detailed knowledge of the constituent parts, which can help to understand the effects of gene knockouts, and, as whole-cell models become more widely built and used, aid genome design.",

Some evidence suggests that spatiotemporally coherent waves are a core feature of spontaneous activity that shapes functional connectivity, though this has been difficult to establish using fMRI given the temporal constraints of the hemodynamic signal. Here we investigated the structure of spontaneous waves in human fMRI and monkey electrocorticography. In both species, we found clear, repeatable, and directionally constrained activity waves coursed along a spatial axis approximately representing cortical hierarchical organization. These cortical propagations were closely associated with activity changes in distinct subcortical structures, particularly those related to arousal regulation, and modulated across different states of vigilance. The findings demonstrate a neural origin of spatiotemporal fMRI wave propagation at rest and link it to the principal gradient of resting-state fMRI connectivity.",

To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactics and therapeutics in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques until 28 days after virus inoculation in the present study. Cynomolgus macaques showed body temperature rises after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening clinical signs of disease corresponding that approximately 80% of human patients did not show a critical disease in COVID-19. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. On the other hand, in the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-{gamma} specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14 prior to an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes that produced IL-2. These results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-{gamma} has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild clinical signs of disease and low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.\n\nAuthor SummarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate their efficacy in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in a non-human primate model until 28 days after virus inoculation. Cynomolgus macaques showed a fever after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening symptoms. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. In the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-{gamma} specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14. These results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-{gamma} has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild symptoms and low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Disrupted antiviral immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-CoV-2. Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line. Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.\n\nOne-sentence summarySARS-CoV-2 ORF9c is the first human coronavirus protein localized to membrane, suppressing antiviral response, resembling full viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Dietary methionine restriction is associated with a reduction in tumor growth in preclinical studies and an increase in lifespan in animal models. The mechanism by which methionine restriction inhibits tumor growth while sparing normal cells is incompletely understood, except for the observation that normal cells can utilize methionine or homocysteine interchangeably (methionine independence) while most cancer cells are strictly dependent on methionine availability. Here, we compared a typical methionine dependent and a rare methionine independent melanoma cell line. We found that replacing methionine with homocysteine generally induced hypomethylation in gene promoters. We isolated nuclear proteins and submitted it for tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics. This analysis revealed that several proteins involved in the mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISR) were upregulated in response to the replacement of methionine to homocysteine in both cell lines, but to a much greater degree in the methionine dependent cell line. Consistent with the ISR signature, a proteomic analysis of a subcellular fraction enriched for mitochondrial content revealed a strong enrichment for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Analysis of cellular bioenergetics confirmed that homocysteine induces a decrease in ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, but to a similar extent in methionine dependent and methionine independent cells. The mitochondrial integrated stress response shared a signature with ferroptosis. Methionine dependent cells displayed a strong ferroptotic signature, which was decreased by half in methionine independent cells. Consistent with ferroptosis, lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in methionine independent cells grown in homocysteine, and viability could be rescued partially but significantly with the inhibitor ferrostatin. Therefore, we propose that methionine stress induces ferroptotic cell death in methionine dependent cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Oncogene induced senescence (OIS) is characterized by increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p16, leading to a hallmark cell cycle arrest. Suppression of p16 in this context drives proliferation, senescence bypass, and contributes to tumorigenesis. OIS cells are also characterized by the expression and secretion of a widely variable group of factors collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP can be both beneficial and detrimental and affects the microenvironment in a highly context-dependent manner. The relationship between p16 suppression and the SASP remains unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of p16 decreases expression of the SASP factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and CXCL8 in both RASG12V-and BRAFV600E-induced senescence. Notably, this is likely not due to suppression of senescence as LMNB1 and cyclin A expression remain low and p21 remains high. Moreover, low p16 expression in both cancer cell lines and patient samples correspond to decreased SASP gene expression, suggesting this is a universal effect of loss of p16 expression. Together, our data suggest that p16 transcriptionally regulates SASP gene expression, which has implications for understanding how p16 modulates both the senescent and tumor microenvironment.",

We previously found that antigens derived from vaccination or viral infection persist within lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) beyond the clearance of the infection, a process we termed \"antigen archiving\". Technical limitations of fluorescent labeling have precluded a complete picture of antigen archiving across cell types in the lymph node. We developed a \"molecular tracking device\" to follow the distribution, acquisition, and retention of antigen in the lymph node. We immunized mice with an antigen conjugated to a nuclease-resistant DNA tag and used single-cell mRNA sequencing to quantify its abundance in lymph node hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types. At early and late time points after vaccination we found antigen acquisition by dendritic cell populations (DCs), associated expression of genes involved in DC activation and antigen processing, and antigen acquisition and archiving by LECs as well as unexpected stromal cell types. Variable antigen levels in LECs enabled the identification of caveolar endocytosis as a mechanism of antigen acquisition or retention. Molecular tracking devices enable new approaches to study dynamic tissue dissemination of antigens and identify new mechanisms of antigen acquisition and retention at cellular resolution in vivo.",

The stability of E-cadherin-based junctions highly depends on their attachment to the actin cytoskeleton, but little is known about how the assembly of junctional actin filaments is regulated. Formins are a conserved group of proteins responsible for the formation and elongation of filamentous actin (F-actin). In this study, using Xenopus embryonic kidney and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, we investigate the role of the Wnt/ planar cell polarity (PCP) formin protein Daam1 (Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1) in regulating E-cadherin based intercellular adhesion. Using live imaging we show that Daam1 localizes to newly formed cell-cell contacts in the developing nephron. Furthermore, analyses of junctional F-actin upon Daam1 depletion indicate a decrease in microfilament localization and their slowed turnover. We also show that Daam1 is necessary for efficient and timely localization of junctional E-cadherin, which is mediated by Daam1s formin homology domain 2 (FH2). Finally, we establish that Daam1 signaling is essential for promoting organized movement of renal cells. This study demonstrates that Daam1 formin junctional activity is critical for epithelial tissue organization.",

    "abstract": "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes encode for proteins that recognize foreign protein antigens to initiate T-cell mediated adaptive immune responses. They are often the most polymorphic genes in vertebrate genomes. How evolution maintains this diversity is still an unsettled issue. Three main hypotheses seek to explain the maintenance of MHC diversity by invoking pathogen-mediated selection: heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent selection, and fluctuating selection across landscapes or through time. Here, we use a large-scale field parasite survey in a stickleback metapopulation to test predictions derived from each of these hypotheses. We identify over a thousand MHCII{beta} alleles and find that many of them covary positively or negatively with parasite load, suggesting that these genes contribute to resistance or susceptibility. However, despite our large sample-size, we find no evidence for the widely-cited stabilizing selection on MHC heterozygosity, in which individuals with an intermediate number of MHC alleles have the lowest parasite burden. Nor do we observe a rare-allele advantage, or widespread fluctuating selection across populations. In contrast, we find that MHC diversity is best predicted by neutral genome-wide heterozygosity and between-population genomic divergence, suggesting neutral processes are important in shaping the pattern of metapopulation MHC diversity. Thus, although MHCII{beta} is highly diverse and relevant to the type and intensity of macroparasite infection in these populations of stickleback, the main models of MHC evolution still provide little explanatory power in this system.",

    "abstract": "Terpenoids are the largest class of natural products and have applications in a wide variety of industries. Many terpenoids can be chemically synthesized or extracted from plants, but this is often uneconomical or unsustainable. An alternative production method relies on the heterologous expression of terpene synthase enzymes in cyanobacteria, producing the desired compounds directly from carbon dioxide. In this work, a patchoulol synthase enzyme from Pogostemon cablin (patchouli) was expressed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under four different growth conditions. Final yields of patchoulol from each growth condition were as follows: 249 g L-1, photoautotrophic growth; 6.5 g L-1, mixotrophic growth; 27.6 g L-1, bicarbonate low light; 31.7 g L-1, bicarbonate high light. By comparing patchoulol production across growth conditions, we identified a significant positive correlation between the production of photopigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids) and the production of patchoulol. Importantly, this relationship was found to be stronger than the correlation between cell density and patchoulol production across growth conditions, which was not statistically significant. The relationship between photopigments and patchoulol should be generalizable to the production of other terpenoids that rely on expression of the endogenous methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in cyanobacteria. Based on the results of this work, we propose a strategy for maximizing terpenoid production in cyanobacteria by optimizing growth conditions for photopigment production, resulting in increased flux through the MEP pathway. This strategy has the advantage of facile photopigment quantification using simple spectroscopic methods, and optimized growth conditions can be utilized in partnership with conventional terpenoid production strategies to further improve yields.",

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be isolated via a minimally invasive blood draw and are considered a \"liquid biopsy\" of their originating solid tumors. CTCs contain a small subset of metastatic precursors that can form metastases in secondary organs, and provide a resource to identify mechanisms underlying metastasis-initiating properties. Despite technological advancements that allow for highly sensitive approaches of detection and isolation, CTCs are very rare and often present as single cells, posing an extreme challenge for ex vivo expansion after isolation. Here, using previously established patient-derived CTC lines, we performed a small molecule drug screening to identify compounds that can improve ex vivo culture efficiency for single CTCs. We found that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and other antioxidants can promote ex vivo expansion of single CTCs, by reducing oxidative and other stress particularly at the initial stage of single cell expansion. RNA-seq analysis of growing clones and non-growing clones confirmed the effect by NAC, but also indicate that NAC-induced decrease in oxidative stress is insufficient for promoting proliferation of a subset of cells with heterogeneous quiescent and senescent features. Despite the challenge in expanding all CTCs, NAC treatment lead to establishment of single CTC clones that have similar tumorigenic features, which will facilitate future functional analyses.",

    "abstract": "Forest recreation can be successfully used for the psychological relaxation of respondents and can be used as a remedy for common problems with stress. The special form of forest recreation intended for restoration is forest bathing. These activities might be distracted by some factors, such as viewing buildings in the forest or using a computer in nature, which interrupt psychological relaxation. One factor that might interrupt psychological relaxation is the occurrence of an open dump in the forest during an outdoor experience. To test the hypothesis that an open dump might decrease psychological relaxation, a case study was planned that used a randomized, controlled crossover design. For this purpose, two groups of healthy young adults viewed a control forest or a forest with an open dump in reverse order and filled in psychological questionnaires after each stimulus. A pretest was used. Participants wore oblique eye patches to stop their visual stimulation before the experimental stimulation, and the physical environment was monitored. The results were analyzed using the two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The measured negative psychological indicators significantly increased after viewing the forest with waste, and the five indicators of the Profile of Mood States increased: Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Fatigue, and Confusion. In addition, the negative aspect of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule increased in comparison to the control and pretest. The measured positive indicators significantly decreased after viewing the forest with waste, the positive aspect of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule decreased, and the Restorative Outcome Scale and Subjective Vitality scores decreased (in comparison to the control and pretest). The occurrence of an open dump in the forest might interrupt a normal restorative experience in the forest by reducing psychological relaxation. Nevertheless, the mechanism of these relevancies is not known, and thus, it will be further investigated. In addition, in a future study, the size of the impact of these open dumps on normal everyday experiences should be investigated. It is proposed that different mechanisms might be responsible for these reactions; however, the aim of this manuscript is to only measure this reaction. The identified psychological reasons for these mechanisms can be assessed in further studies.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are a major determinant of eukaryotic genome size. The collective properties of a genomic TE community reveal the history of TE/host evolutionary dynamics and impact present-day host structure and function, from genome to organism levels. In rare cases, TE community/genome size has greatly expanded in animals, associated with increased cell size and altered anatomy and physiology. We characterize the TE landscape of the genome and transcriptome in an amphibian with a giant genome -- the caecilian Ichthyophis bannanicus, which we show has a genome size of 12.2 Gb. Amphibians are an important model system because the clade includes independent cases of genomic gigantism. The I. bannanicus genome differs compositionally from other giant amphibian genomes, but shares a low rate of ectopic-recombination-mediated deletion. We examine TE activity using expression and divergence plots; TEs account for 15% of somatic transcription, and most superfamilies appear active. We quantify TE diversity in the caecilian, as well as other vertebrates with a range of genome sizes, using diversity indices commonly applied in community ecology. We synthesize previous models integrating TE abundance, diversity, and activity, and we test whether the caecilian meets model predictions for genomes with high TE abundance. We propose thorough, consistent characterization of TEs to strengthen future comparative analyses. Such analyses will ultimately be required to reveal whether the divergent TE assemblages found across convergent gigantic genomes reflect fundamental shared features of TE/host genome evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe aim to propose a novel method of evaluating the degree of rhythmic irregularity during repetitive tasks in Parkinsons disease (PD) by using autocorrelation to extract serial perturbation in the periodicity of body part movements as recorded by objective devices.\n\nMethodsWe used publicly distributed sequential joint movement data recorded during a leg agility task or pronation-supination task. The sequences of body part trajectory were processed to extract their short-time autocorrelation (STACF) matrices; the sequences of single task conducted by participants were then divided into two clusters according to their similarity in terms of their STACF representation. The Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale sub-score rated for each task was compared with cluster membership to obtain the area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the discrimination performance of the clustering. We compared the AUC with those obtained from the clustering of the raw sequence or short-time Fourier transform (STFT).\n\nResultsIn classifying the pose estimator-based trajectory data of the knee during the leg agility task, the AUC was the highest when the STACF sequence was used for clustering instead of other types of sequences with up to 0.815, being comparable to the results reported in the original analysis of the data using an approach different from ours. In addition, in classifying another dataset of accelerometer-based trajectory data of the wrist during a pronation-supination task, the AUC was again highest up to 0.785 when clustering was performed using the STACF rather than other types of sequence.\n\nConclusionOur autocorrelation-based method achieved a fair performance in detecting sequences with irregular rhythm, suggesting that it might be used as another evaluation strategy that is potentially widely applicable to qualify the disordered rhythm of PD regardless of the kinds of task or the modality of devices, although further refinement is needed.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSimultaneously recorded electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) is highly informative yet technically challenging. Until recently, there has been little information about EEG data quality and safety when used with newer multi-band (MB) fMRI sequences. Here, we measure the relative heating of a MB protocol compared with a standard single-band (SB) protocol considered to be safe. We also evaluated EEG quality recorded concurrently with the MB protocol on humans.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe compared radiofrequency (RF)-related heating at multiple electrodes and magnetic field magnitude, B1+RMS, of a MB fMRI sequence with whole-brain coverage (TR = 440 ms, MB factor = 4) against a previously recommended, safe SB sequence using a phantom outfitted with a 64-channel EEG cap. Next, 9 human subjects underwent eyes-closed resting state EEG-fMRI using the MB sequence. Additionally, in three of the subjects resting state EEG was recorded also during the SB sequence and in an fMRI-free condition to directly compare EEG data quality across scanning conditions. EEG data quality was assessed by the ability to remove gradient and cardioballistic artifacts along with a clean spectrogram.\n\nResultsThe heating induced by the MB sequence was lower than that of the SB sequence by a factor of 0.73 {+/-} 0.38. This is consistent with an expected heating ratio of 0.64, calculated from the square of the ratio of B1+RMS values of the sequences. In the resting state EEG data, gradient and cardioballistic artifacts were successfully removed using traditional template subtraction. All subjects showed an individual alpha peak in the spectrogram with a posterior topography characteristic of eyes-closed EEG. The success of artifact rejection for the MB sequence was comparable to that in traditional SB sequences.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows that B1+RMS is a useful indication of the relative heating of fMRI protocols. This observation indicates that simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings using this MB sequence can be safe in terms of RF-related heating, and that EEG data recorded using this sequence is of acceptable quality after traditional artifact removal techniques.",

    "abstract": "Antigen cross presentation, whereby exogenous antigens are presented by MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells, is essential for generating adaptive immunity to pathogens and tumor cells (1). Following endocytosis, it is widely understood that protein antigens must be transferred from endosomes to the cytosol where they are subject to ubiquitination and proteasome degradation prior to being translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or possibly endosomes, via the TAP1/TAP2 complex (2, 3). Revealing how antigens egress from endocytic organelles (endosome-to-cytosol transfer, ECT), however, has proved vexing. Here, we used two independent screens to identify the hydrogen peroxide-transporting channel aquaporin-3 (AQP3) as a regulator of ECT. AQP3 overexpression increased ECT, whereas AQP3 knockout or knockdown decreased ECT. Mechanistically, AQP3 appears to be important for hydrogen peroxide entry into the endosomal lumen where it affects lipid peroxidation and subsequent antigen release. AQP3-mediated regulation of ECT was functionally significant, as AQP3 modulation had a direct impact on the efficiency of antigen cross presentation in vitro. Finally, AQP3-/- mice exhibited a reduced ability to mount an anti-viral response and cross present exogenous extended peptide. Together, these results indicate that the AQP3-mediated transport of hydrogen peroxide can regulate endosomal lipid peroxidation and suggest that compromised membrane integrity and coordinated release of endosomal cargo is a likely mechanism for ECT.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs act as mRNA posttranscriptional regulators, playing important roles in cell differentiation, transcriptional regulation, growth and development. In this study, microRNA expression profiles of Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum ticks at different developmental stages were detected by high-throughput sequencing and functionally assessed. In total, 2,585,169, 1,252,678, 1,558,217 and 1,155,283 unique reads were obtained from eggs, larvae, nymphs and adults, respectively, with 42, 46, 45 and 41 conserved microRNAs in these stages, respectively. Using eggs as a control, 48, 43 and 39 microRNAs were upregulated and 3, 10 and 9 downregulated in larvae, nymphs and adults, respectively. microRNA-1 (miR-1) was expressed in high abundance throughout Ha. anatolicum development, with an average of nearly one million transcripts, and it is highly conserved among tick species. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) showed that miR-1 expression gradually increased with tick development, reaching the highest level at engorgement. Differential tissue expression was detected, with significantly higher levels in the salivary glands and epidermis than in the midgut. Inhibition assays showed no significant change in body weight or spawning time or amount between experimental and control groups, but there was a significant difference (p<0.01) in engorgement time. With miR-1 inhibition, ticks displayed obvious deformities during later development. To more fully explain the microRNA mechanism of action, the miR-1 family was analyzed regarding target gene; members acting on Hsp60 include miR-5, miR-994, miR-969, and miR-1011, which jointly play a role. Therefore, microRNAs are critical for normal tick development, and the primary structure of the mature sequence of miR-1 is highly conserved. Nonetheless, different developmental stages and tissues show different expression patterns, with a certain role in prolonging feeding. miR-1, together with other family members, regulates mRNA function and may be used as a molecular marker for species origin and evolution analysis and internal reference gene selection.",

If the plant height of rapeseed is too high, on the one hand, it will cause rapeseed to lodge and affect the yield, on the other hand, it will also affect the mechanized harvesting of rapeseed. In this research, the high-stalked line (YY50) and the dwarfed line (DW871) are crossed to obtain an F2 rapeseed population which was used to build pools, and then we used this to mine the main dwarfing genes. In the pools composed of tall and short stalks, we obtained 192.80Mb clean reads, which can be used for BSA (bulked segregant analysis). Preliminary positioning around the candidate section identified 23 SNP markers. Then 17 polymorphic SNP markers were obtained through polymorphism screening. Further we narrowed the candidate interval, and finally determined between 15.51-16.60Mb of ChrA10. Through identifying 231 genes from the above interval, its predicted that the production of dwarf traits may be related to lignin synthesis and limited inflorescence. It provides a basis for further mapping and cloning of the dwarfing gene DW871.",

    "abstract": "The function of the higher-order sensory thalamus remains unresolved. Here, POm nucleus was examined by in vivo extracellular recordings across a range of complex sensory patterns. We found that POm was highly sensitive to multiwhisker stimuli involving complex spatiotemporal interactions. The dynamical spatiotemporal structure of sensory patterns and the different complexity of their parts were accurately reflected in precise POm activity changes. Importantly, POm was also able to respond to ipsilateral stimulation and was implicated in the representation of bilateral tactile events by integrating simultaneous signals arising from both whisker pads. We found that POm nuclei are mutually connected through the cortex forming a functional POm-POm loop. We unravelled the nature and content of the messages travelling through this loop showing that they were  structured patterns of sustained activity. These structured messages were transmitted preserving their integrated structure. The implication of different cortical areas was investigated revealing that S1 plays a protagonist role in this functional loop. Our results also demonstrated different laminar implication in the processing of sustained activity in this cortical area and its transmission between hemispheres. We propose a theoretical model in which these  structured patterns of sustained activity generated by POm may play important roles in perceptual, motor and cognitive functions. From a functional perspective, this proposal, supported by the results described here, provides a novel theoretical framework to understand the implication of the thalamus in cognition. In addition, a profound difference was found between VPM and POm functioning. The hypothesis of Complementary Components is proposed here to explain it.\n\nHighlightsPOm is implicated in the representation of complex sensory patterns.\nPOm is implicated in the encoding of bilateral tactile events.\nPOm nuclei are mutually connected through the cortex forming a functional POm-POm loop.\n Structured patterns of sustained activity travelling through the loop\n\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=199 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/257667v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@217b4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26a381org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b88b0eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b15904_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

One major fiber tract implicated in the development of CP is the uncinate fasciculus (UF), which connects amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The goals of the current study were to 1) explore differences in the white matter microstructure in the UF and other major fiber tracks (inferior longitudinal fasciculus [ILF], inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus [IFOF], cingulum, and corticospinal tract [CST]) between young typically developing (TD) children and those with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and 2) explore, within the ADHD group, whether individual differences in these white matter microstructures relate to co-occurring CP and CU behaviors, respectively.\n\nMethodsParticipants included 198 young children (78% boys, Mage = 4.95 years; 80% Latinx; 49% TD). CU behaviors and CP were measured via a combination of teacher/parent ratings. Non-invasive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was used to measure fractional anisotropy (FA), an indirect indicator of white matter properties.\n\nResultsRelative to TD children, children with ADHD had reduced FA on four out of the five fiber tracks we examined (except for cingulum). Within the ADHD group, no associations were found between CP and reduced white matter integrity across any of the fiber tracks examined. However, we found that even after accounting for CP and a host of covariates including whole brain FA, CU behaviors were independently related to reduced FA in bilateral UF and left IFOF.\n\nConclusionsThe bilateral UF and IFOF may be a biomarker of CU behaviors, even in very young children.",

Here we show that ion flow-independent NMDAR signaling is required for the long-term dendritic spine growth that is a vital component of brain circuit plasticity. We found that inhibition of p38 MAPK, shown to be downstream of non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling in LTD and spine shrinkage, blocked LTP-induced spine growth but not LTP. We hypothesized that non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling drives the cytoskeletal changes that support bidirectional spine structural plasticity. Indeed, we found that key signaling components downstream of non-ionotropic NMDAR function in LTD-induced spine shrinkage also are necessary for LTP-induced spine growth. Furthermore, NMDAR conformational signaling with coincident Ca2+ influx is sufficient to drive CaMKII-dependent long-term spine growth, even when Ca2+ is artificially driven through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Our results support a model in which non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling gates the bidirectional spine structural changes vital for brain plasticity.",
