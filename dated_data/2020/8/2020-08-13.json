    "abstract": "Neurovascular coupling is a critical brain mechanism whereby changes to blood flow accompany localised neural activity. The breakdown of neurovascular coupling is linked to the development and progression of several neurological conditions including dementia. In this study, we examined cortical haemodynamics in preparations that modelled Alzheimers disease (J20-AD) and atherosclerosis (PCSK9-ATH) between 9-12m of age. We report novel findings with atherosclerosis where neurovascular decline is characterised by significantly reduced blood volume, levels of oxyhaemoglobin & deoxyhaemoglobin, in addition to global neuroinflammation. In the comorbid mixed model (J20-PCSK9-MIX), we report a 3x fold increase in hippocampal amyloid-beta plaques. A key finding was that cortical spreading depression (CSD) due to electrode insertion into the brain was worse in the diseased animals and led to a prolonged period of hypoxia. These findings suggest that systemic atherosclerosis can be detrimental to neurovascular health and that having cardiovascular comorbidities can exacerbate pre-existing Alzheimers-related amyloid-plaques.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutation of the muscle membrane protein dystrophin and characterized by severe degeneration of myofibers, progressive muscle wasting and loss of mobility, ultimately cardiorespiratory failure and premature death. Here we report that skeletal muscle-specific knockout (KO) of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) gene in an animal model of DMD (mdx mice) alleviates myofiber degeneration and restores muscle function without increasing tumor incidences. Specifically, Pten KO normalizes myofiber size and prevents muscular atrophy, and improves grip strength and exercise performance of mdx mice. Pten KO also reduces fibrosis and inflammation; and ameliorates muscle pathology in mdx mice. Moreover, we found that Pten KO upregulates extracellular matrix and basement membrane components positively correlated to wound healing, but suppresses negative regulators of wound healing and lipid biosynthesis; and restores the integrity of muscle basement membrane in mdx mice. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of PTEN similarly ameliorates muscle pathology and improves muscle integrity and function in mdx mice. Our finding provides evidence that PTEN inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to restore muscle function in DMD.",

    "abstract": "The Hydra head organizer acts as a signaling center that initiates and maintains the primary body axis in steady state polyps and during budding or regeneration. Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling functions as a primary cue controlling this process, but how Wnt ligand activity is locally restricted at the protein level is poorly understood.\n\nHere we report the identification of an astacin family proteinase as a Wnt processing factor. Hydra astacin-7 (HAS-7) is expressed from gland cells as an apical-distal gradient in the body column, peaking close beneath the tentacle zone. HAS-7 siRNA knockdown abrogates HyWnt3 proteolysis in the head tissue and induces a robust double axis phenotype, which is rescued by simultaneous HyWnt3 knockdown. Accordingly, double axes are also observed in conditions of increased Wnt levels as in transgenic actin::HyWnt3 and HyDkk1/2/4 siRNA treated animals. HyWnt3-induced double axes in Xenopus embryos could be rescued by co-injection of HAS-7 mRNA. Mathematical modelling combined with experimental promotor analysis indicate an indirect regulation of HAS-7 by beta-Catenin, expanding the classical Turing-type activator-inhibitor model.\n\nOur data suggest a negative regulatory function of Wnt processing astacin proteinases in the global patterning of the oral-aboral axis in Hydra.",

    "abstract": "Bovine brucellosis is an infectious bacterial disease caused by members of genus Brucella, affecting both animals and humans, and resulting in a serious economic loss in animal production sector and deterioration of public health. This cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2014 to April 2015 to determine the sero-prevalence and associated risk factors of bovine brucellosis in Sendafa, Oromia special Zone, Ethiopia. A total of 503 blood samples were collected using simple random sampling technique from dairy cattle of above 6 months of age with no history of previous vaccination against brucellosis. All sera samples were demonstrated using both Rose Bengal Plate Test for screening and Compliment Fixation Test for confirmation. Accordingly, the overall sero-prevalence of bovine brucellosis in this area was 0.40%. The result showed that the sero-prevalence of bovine brucellosis in the study area was not statistically significant with all proposed risk factors. Thus, the study revealed the absence of significant statistical variation in the sero-prevalence of bovine brucellosis in different age, sex groups, breeding method and history of previous abortions (P>0.05). No reactors were observed in male animals. Sero-prevalence of 0.40% was observed in animals without previous history of abortion. Moreover, information was gathered on individual animal and farm-level risk factors and other farm characteristics using a questionnaire. The awareness among the society was poor, so the positive animals can be a potential hazard to animals and humans in the study area. Therefore, public education should be done in order to improve the awareness of people on bovine brucellosis and its public health impact with due consideration on the safely consumption of food of animal origin.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the role of the microstructure of real scars in the success of optogenetic defibrillation. To reduce the computational cost of high-order models (like Ten Tusscher Model, TTM) for a single cell as well as to take advantage of their ability to generate a more realistic output, we developed a low-order model of optogenetic cardiac tissue based on the modified Alieve-Panfilov single-cell model and estimated its parameters using a TTM. Two-dimensional electrophysiological cardiac tissue models were produced including different scar shapes that were extracted from Late Gadolinium-Enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging data set of 10 patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. The scar shapes were classified based on four criteria: transmurality, relative area, scar entropy, and interface length. Scar with the highest 25% of the relative area showed 25% of successful cases, this ratio is 27%, and 25% for a scar with the most top 25% of entropy, and transmurality, respectively. In comparison, the proportions are 61.54%, 44.44%, and 61.76%, for the lowest 25% of the area, entropy, and transmurality. We also investigated the efficacy of various methods for light-sensitive cells distribution within the cardiac tissue with scar. Four types of distributions were defined. Defibrillation within tissues with 0.1 light-sensitive out of all cells was 15 to 25% more successful than their counterparts with 0.05 light-sensitive cells. Lastly, we examined the effect of an earlier stimulation on the success probability of defibrillation. Our results indicated that inducing 0.5 msec earlier resulted in a roughly 15% rise in successful cases.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates containing amyloid fibrils has been observed in many different human protein misfolding diseases1,2, and their pathological features have been recapitulated in diverse model systems3. In vitro kinetic studies have provided a quantitative understanding of how the fundamental molecular level processes of nucleation and growth lead to amyloid formation4. However, it is not yet clear to what extent these basic biophysical processes translate to amyloid formation in vivo, given the complexity of the cellular and organismal environment. Here we show that the aggregation of a fluorescently tagged polyglutamine (polyQ) protein into {micro}m-sized inclusions in the muscle tissue of living C. elegans can be quantitatively described by a molecular model where stochastic nucleation occurs independently in each cell, followed by rapid aggregate growth. Global fitting of the image-based aggregation kinetics reveals a nucleation rate corresponding to 0.01 h-1 per cell at 1 mM intracellular protein concentration, and shows that the intrinsic stochasticity of nucleation accounts for a significant fraction of the observed animal-to-animal variation. Our results are consistent with observations for the aggregation of polyQ proteins in vitro5 and in cell culture6, and highlight how nucleation events control the overall progression of aggregation in the organism through the spatial confinement into individual cells. The key finding that the biophysical principles associated with protein aggregation in small volumes remain the governing factors, even in the complex environment of a living organism, will be critical for the interpretation of in vivo data from a wide range of protein aggregation diseases.",

    "abstract": "For many species, vision is one of the most important sensory modalities for mediating essential tasks that include navigation, predation and foraging, predator avoidance, and numerous social behaviors. The vertebrate visual process begins when photons of the light interact with rod and cone photoreceptors that are present in the neural retina. Vertebrate visual photopigments are housed within these photoreceptor cells and are sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths that peak within the light spectrum, the latter of which is a function of the type of chromophore used and how it interacts with specific amino acid residues found within the opsin protein sequence. Minor differences in the amino acid sequences of the opsins are known to lead to large differences in the spectral peak of absorbance (i.e. the {lambda}max value). In our prior studies, we developed a new approach that combined homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to gather structural information associated with chromophore conformation, then used it to generate statistical models for the accurate prediction of {lambda}max values for photopigments derived from Rh1 and Rh2 amino acid sequences. In the present study, we test our novel approach to predict the {lambda}max of phylogenetically distant Sws2 cone opsins. To build a model that can predict the {lambda}max using our approach presented in our prior studies, we selected a spectrally-diverse set of 11 teleost Sws2 photopigments for which both amino acid sequence information and experimentally measured {lambda}max values are known. The final first-order regression model, consisting of three terms associated with chromophore conformation, was sufficient to predict the {lambda}max of Sws2 photopigments with high accuracy. This study further highlights the breadth of our approach in reliably predicting {lambda}max values of Sws2 cone photopigments, evolutionary-more distant from template bovine RH1, and provided mechanistic insights into the role of known spectral tuning sites.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn vertebrates, color vision depends on the complement of cone visual photopigments that have different spectral peaks of absorbance ({lambda}max) within the cone population. Together, the type of chromophore and the amino acid sequence of the opsin protein directly affect the {lambda}max value. To understand this relationship further at a structural level, we previously developed a new molecular modeling approach to study Rh1 and Rh2 opsin classes by combining homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations to extract structural parameters of chromophore conformations and statistical modeling. Here, we used this novel modeling approach to accurately predict the {lambda}max values for teleost Sws2 photopigments. Such a genome-to-phenome approach for predicting visual pigment function will be of great interest to evolutionary biologists, vision scientists, and molecular modelers, to better understand the diversity and mechanisms of sensory function. Moreover, it will pave the way for novel strategies to forward engineer visual pigments suitable for optogenetics applications.",

No comparative studies on the genotypic properties of O. tsutsugamushi have been performed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) in South Korea. Here, we characterized 51 clinical isolates from Jeonju, in southwestern Korea, and we compared them to isolates from Thailand, Laos, and Japan. We also identified 10 new alleles and six novel sequence types. Overall, our results suggest that the relative genetic stability and the clonal populations of O. tsutsugamushi strains in South Korea have remained mostly conserved.\n\nAuthor summaryScrub typhus is a life-threatening disease, caused by infection with O. tsutsugamushi, a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium. Approximately one million people are infected globally every year, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Strains of O. tsutsugamushi are typically distinguished serologically on the basis of sequences of the highly polymorphic 56-kDa outer membrane protein. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a generic typing method that provides a unified bacterial isolate characterization approach that can be used for evolutionary and population studies of bacteria. In this study, we describe the development and application of a MLST scheme that was applied to 51 O. tsutsugamushi isolates. We found 10 new alleles and six new STs, which yielded a total of seven O. tsutsugamushi STs in South Korea. Among seven different STs (ST 48, 93-98), ST 48 account for the largest proportion (49.0%) of O. tsutsugamushi STs in South Korea. With the exception of the appearance of six novel STs, the clonal populations have remained conserved but further study of population structure and evolutionary trends is warranted.",

Towards identifying universal mechanisms of the target search, we used single-molecule tracking of 11 diverse DNA-binding proteins in living Escherichia coli. The mobility of these proteins during the target search was dictated by DNA interactions, rather than by their molecular weights. By generating cells devoid of all chromosomal DNA, we discovered that the nucleoid does not pose a physical barrier for protein diffusion, but significantly slows the motion of DNA-binding proteins through frequent short-lived DNA interactions. The representative DNA-binding proteins (irrespective of their size, concentration, or function) spend the majority (58-99%) of their search time bound to DNA and occupy as much as [~]30% of the chromosomal DNA at any time. Chromosome-crowding likely has important implications for the function of all DNA-binding proteins.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin architecture and gene expression profile undergo tremendous reestablishment during senescence. However, the regulatory mechanism between chromatin reconstruction and gene expression in senescence remain elusive. The chromatin accessibility is an excellent perspective to reveal the latent regulatory elements. Thus, we depicted the landscapes of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during HUVECs senescence. We found that chromatin accessibilities are re-distributed during senescence. The senescence related increased accessible regions (IARs) and the decreased accessible regions (DARs) are mainly distributed in distal intergenic regions. The DARs are correlated with the function declines caused by senescence, whereas the IARs are involved in the regulation for senescence program. Moreover, the heterochromatin contributes most of IARs in senescent cells. We identified that the AP-1 transcription factors, especially ATF3 is responsible for driving chromatin accessibility reconstruction in IARs. In particular, DNA methylation is negatively correlated with chromatin accessibility during senescence. AP-1 motifs with low DNA methylation may improve their binding affinity in IARs and further opens the chromatin nearby. Our results described a dynamic landscape of chromatin accessibility whose remodeling contributes to the senescence program. And we identified a cellular senescence regulator, AP-1, which promotes senescence through organizing the accessibility profile in IARs.",

    "abstract": "FGF signaling is involved in mesoderm induction in deuterostomes, but not in flies and nematodes, where it has a role in mesoderm patterning and migration. However, comparable studies in other protostomic taxa are missing in order to decipher whether this mesoderm-inducing function of FGF extends beyond the lineage of deuterostomes. Here, we investigated the role of FGF signaling during mesoderm development in three species of lophophorates, a clade within the protostome group Spiralia. Our gene expression analyses show that the molecular patterning of mesoderm development is overall conserved between brachiopods and phoronids, but the spatial and temporal recruitment of transcription factors differs significantly. Moreover, inhibitor experiments demonstrate that FGF signaling is involved in mesoderm formation, morphogenetic movements of gastrulation and posterior axial elongation. Our findings suggest that the inductive role of FGF in mesoderm possibly predates the origin of deuterostomes.",
