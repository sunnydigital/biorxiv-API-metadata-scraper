    "abstract": "Diabetic patients taking metformin have lower risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, progression from infection to tuberculosis (TB) disease, TB morality and TB recurrence. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of metformins protective immunological benefits on host resistance to TB is lacking. In this study, using mass cytometry we show that metformin treatment expands memory-like antigen-inexperienced CD8+CXCR3+ T cells in naive mice, and in healthy and diabetic humans. Metformin-educated CD8+ T cells have increased (i) mitochondrial mass, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation; (ii) survival capacity; and (iii) anti-mycobacterial properties. CD8+ T cells from CXCR3-/- mice did not exhibit metformin-mediated metabolic programming. In BCG-vaccinated mice and guinea pigs, metformin enhanced immunogenicity and protective efficacy against Mtb challenge. Collectively, our results demonstrate an important role of CD8+ T cells in metformin-derived host metabolic-fitness towards Mtb infection.",

    "abstract": "Chemokines are positively charged cytokines that attract leukocytes by binding to anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on endothelial cells for efficient presentation to leukocyte G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The atypical chemokine CXCL16 has been reported to also bind the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS), but the biological relevance of this interaction remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that PS binding is in fact a widely shared property of chemokine superfamily members that, like GAG binding, induces chemokine oligomerization. PS is an essential phospholipid of the inner leaflet of the healthy cell plasma membrane but it is exposed in apoptotic cells to act as an  eat-me signal that promotes engulfment of dying cells by phagocytes. We found that chemokines can bind PS in pure form as well as in the context of liposomes and on the surface of apoptotic cells and extracellular vesicles released by apoptotic cells, which are known to act as  find-me signals that chemoattract phagocytes during apoptotic cell clearance. Importantly, we show that GAGs are severely depleted from the surface of apoptotic cells and that extracellular vesicles extracted from apoptotic mouse thymus bind endogenous thymic chemokines and activate cognate chemokine receptors. Together these results indicate that chemokines tethered to surface-exposed PS may be responsible for the chemotactic and find-me signal activity previously attributed to extracellular vesicles, and that PS may substitute for GAGs as the anionic scaffold that regulates chemokine oligomerization and presentation to GPCRs on the GAG-deficient membranes of apoptotic cells and extracellular vesicles. Here, we present a new mechanism by which extracellular vesicles, currently recognized as essential agents for intercellular communication in homeostasis and disease, can transport signaling cytokines.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic mRNAs are an appealing therapeutic platform with multiple biomedical applications ranging from protein replacement therapy to vaccination. In comparison to conventional mRNA, synthetic self-amplifying mRNAs (sa-mRNAs) are gaining increased interest due to their higher and longer-lasting expression. However, sa-mRNAs also elicit an innate immune response, which may complicate the clinical translation of this platform. Approaches to reduce the innate immunity of sa-mRNAs have not been studied in detail. In this work we investigated the effect of several innate immune inhibitors and a novel cellulose-based mRNA purification approach on the type I interferon (IFN) response, translation and vaccination efficacy of our formerly developed sa-mRNA vaccine against Zika virus. Among the investigated inhibitors, we found that topical application of clobetasol at the sa-mRNA injection site was the most efficient in suppressing the type I IFN response and increasing the translation of sa-mRNA. However, clobetasol prevented the formation of antibodies against sa-mRNA encoded antigens and should therefore be avoided in a vaccination context. Residual dsRNA by-products of the in vitro transcription reaction are known inducers of immediate type I IFN responses. We additionally demonstrate drastic reduction of these dsRNA by-products upon cellulose-based purification, consequently reducing the innate immune response and improving sa-mRNA vaccination efficacy.",

    "abstract": "DNA repair pathways are critical processes that need both spatial and temporal fine regulation. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a way to concentrate biochemical reactions, while excluding non-interacting components. Proteins disordered domains, as well as RNA, favor condensation to modulate this process. Recent insights about phase-separation mechanisms pointed to new fascinating models that could explain how cells could cope with DNA damage responses. In this context, it is emerging that RNA-processing pathways and PARylation events, through the addition of an ADP-ribose moiety to both proteins and DNA, participate in different aspects of the DNA Damage Response (DDR). Remarkably, defects in these regulatory connections are associated with genomic instability and human pathologies. In addition, it has been recently noticed that several DNA repair enzymes, such as 53BP1 and APE1, are endowed with RNA binding abilities. APE1 is a multifunctional protein belonging to the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway of non-distorting DNA lesions, bearing additional  non-canonical DNA-repair functions associated with processes coping with RNA metabolism. In this work, after reviewing the recent literature supporting a role of LLPS in DDR, we analyze, as a proof of principle, the interactome of APE1 using a bioinformatics approach to look for clues of LLPS in BER. Some of the APE1 interactors are associated with cellular processes in which LLPS has been either proved or proposed and are involved in several tumorigenic and amyloidogenic events. This work represents a paradigmatical pipeline for evaluating the relevance of LLPS in DDR.\n\nStatement of significanceIn this work, we aimed to test the hypothesis of an involvement of phase-separation in regulating the molecular mechanisms of the multifunctional enzyme APE1 starting from the analysis of its recently-characterized protein-protein interactome (PPI). We compared APE1-PPI to phase-separation databases and we performed functional enrichment analysis, uncovering links between APE1 and already known demixing factors, establishing an association with liquidliquid phase separation. This analysis could represent a starting point for implementing downstream experimental validations, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, to assess actual demixing.",

    "abstract": "Allocating reservoir flows to meet societal and ecosystem needs under increasing demands for water and increasing climatic variability presents challenges to resource managers. Often, regulated rivers have been operated to meet flow and temperature compliance points that mimic historical patterns. Because it is difficult to assess if this approach is efficient or equitable, new more process-based approaches to regulation are being advanced. This paper describes such an approach with a model of egg incubation survival of Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon (SRWRC, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Thermal mortality only occurs in a critical window around egg hatching when the embryo is most sensitive to temperature stress. The duration of the critical window has significant implications for Shasta Reservoir operations that are designed to control temperature during SRWRC incubation. Previous operations sought to maintain a low temperature over the entire incubation period. However, model analysis suggests that targeting cold water directly to the critical egg hatching stage provides higher survival while requiring less cold water resources. The calibrated model is publicly accessible through a web interface connected to real-time river and fish databases and a river temperature forecast model. The system is an example of the next step of river management that integrates databases with hydrological and process-based biological models for real-time analysis and for forecasting effects of river operations on the environment.",

    "abstract": "Although protocols exist for the recovery of ancient DNA from land snail and marine bivalve shells, marine conch shells have yet to be studied from a paleogenomic perspective. We first present reference assemblies for both a 623.7 Mbp nuclear genome and a 15.4 kbp mitochondrial genome for Strombus pugilis, the West Indian fighting conch. We next detail a method to extract and sequence DNA from conch shells and apply it to conch from Bocas del Toro, Panama across three time periods: recently-eaten and discarded (n=3), Late Holocene (984-1258 BP) archaeological midden (n=5), and a mid-Holocene (5711-7187 BP) paleontological fossil coral reef (n=5). These results are compared to control DNA extracted from live-caught tissue and fresh shells (n=5). Using high-throughput sequencing, we were able to obtain S. pugilis nuclear sequence reads from shells across all age periods: up to 92.5 thousand filtered reads per sample in live-caught shell material, 4.57 thousand for modern discarded shells, 12.1 thousand reads for archaeological shells, and 114 reads in paleontological shells. We confirmed authenticity of the ancient DNA recovered from the archaeological and paleontological shells based on 5.7x higher average frequency of deamination-driven misincorporations and 15% shorter average read lengths compared to the modern shells. Reads also mapped to the S. pugilis mitochondrial genome for all but the paleontological shells, with consistent ratios of mitochondrial to nuclear mapped reads across sample types. Our methods can be applied to diverse archaeological sites to facilitate reconstructions of the long-term impacts of human behavior on mollusc evolutionary biology.",

    "abstract": "X chromosome inactivation (XCI) mediated by differential DNA methylation between sexes is well characterized in eutherian mammals. Although XCI is shared between eutherians and marsupials, the role of DNA methylation in marsupial XCI remains contested. Here we examine genome-wide signatures of DNA methylation from methylation maps across fives tissues from a male and female koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and present the first whole genome, multi-tissue marsupial \"methylome atlas.\" Using these novel data, we elucidate divergent versus common features of marsupial and eutherian DNA methylation. First, tissue-specific differential DNA methylation in marsupials primarily occurs in gene bodies. Second, females show significant global reduction (hypomethylation) of X chromosome DNA methylation compared to males. We show that this pattern is also observed in eutherians. Third, on average, promoter DNA methylation shows little difference between male and female koala X chromosomes, a pattern distinct from that of eutherians. Fourth, the sex-specific DNA methylation landscape upstream of Rsx, the primary lncRNA associated with marsupial XCI, is consistent with the epigenetic regulation of female-(and presumably inactive X chromosome-) specific expression. Finally, we utilize the prominent female X chromosome hypomethylation and classify 98 previously unplaced scaffolds as X-linked, contributing an additional 14.6 Mb (21.5 %) to genomic data annotated as the koala X chromosome. Our work demonstrates evolutionarily divergent pathways leading to functionally conserved patterns of XCI in two deep branches of mammals.",

    "abstract": "AimThe exceptional species-richness associated with mountains worldwide is linked to the fragmented topography of these areas, responsible for constantly isolating populations during periods of climatic fluctuations. Consequently, endemism and spatial turnover in mountains are very high and few species are widespread among entire mountain ranges, precluding population-level studies that help understanding how macroevolutionary patterns were shaped. Here, we used the bromeliad Vriesea oligantha, a species endemic to, but widespread in, one of the most species-rich ancient montane areas in the globe, the Espinhaco Range, to test how environmental changes over time may have acted on the evolutionary history of this taxon, contributing to understanding how montane macroevolutionary patterns were shaped. Through analyses of plastidial and nuclear DNA of V. oligantha, we dated its origin and intraspecific diversification, and estimated the genetic diversity, structure and migration rates among populations. Using climatic and geographic variables, we modeled suitable areas for the present and the past, estimating corridors between isolated populations. We also used demographic analyses to estimate ancient population dynamics of V. oligantha. Finally, we tested whether climatic variables or geographical distance explain the observed population structure. The origin and intraspecific diversification of V. oligantha are related to early climatic oscillations during the Plio-Pleistocene. This species has a high population structure due to its low pollen and seed dispersibility. The analysis of species distribution modeling estimated corridors between populations in the past, whereas the structure of V. oligantha results from both models of isolation by distance and isolation by environment. The phylogeographic patterns of Vriesea oligantha reflect previously recognized spatial and temporal macroevolutionary patterns in the Espinhaco Range, providing insights into how microevolutionary processes may have given rise to this astonishing mountain biodiversity.",

Although much has been learned regarding individual epigenetic regulators, their combinatorial functions remain elusive. Here, we report previously unknown combinatorial functions of histone demethylases (HDMs) in gene regulation of mouse ESCs. Generation of a histone demethylome (HDMome) map of 20 well-characterized HDMs based on their genome-wide binding revealed co-occupancy of HDMs in different combinations: KDM1A-KDM4B-KDM6A and JARID2-KDM2B-KDM4A-KDM4C-KDM5B largely co-occupy at enhancers and promoters, respectively. Mechanistic studies uncover that KDM1A-KDM6A combinatorially modulates P300/H3K27ac, H3K4me2 deposition and OCT4 recruitment that directs the OCT4/CORE regulatory network for target gene expression; while co-operative actions of JARID2-KDM2B-KDM4A-KDM4C-KDM5B control H2AK119ub1 and bivalent marks of polycomb-repressive complexes that facilitate the PRC regulatory network for target gene repression.

    "abstract": "Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are useful tools to discover and characterize regulatory elements in human genomes. Partly because enhancer function is assumed to be orientation independent with respect to each strand of the DNA helix, most reported MPRA results ignore stranded information. However, we find pervasive strand asymmetry of MPRA signals in datasets from multiple reporter configurations and in both published and newly reported data. These effects are reproducible across different cell types and in different treatments within a cell type, and are observed both within and outside of annotated regulatory elements. From elements in gene bodies, MPRA strand asymmetry favors the sense strand, suggesting that biological function related to endogenous transcription is driving the phenomenon. Similarly, within Alu mobile element insertions, we find that strand asymmetry favors the transcribed strand of the ancestral retrotransposon. The effect is consistent across the multiplicity of Alu elements in human genomes, and is more pronounced in younger, less diverged Alu elements. We find sequence features driving MPRA strand asymmetry and demonstrate its prediction from sequence alone. We see some evidence for both RNA stabilization and transcriptional activation mechanisms, and hypothesize that the effect is driven by natural selection favoring efficient transcription. Our results indicate that strand asymmetry, as a pervasive and reproducible feature, should be accounted for in analysis of MRPA data. More importantly, the fact that MPRA asymmetry favors naturally transcribed strands suggests that it stems from preserved biological functions that have a substantial, global impact on gene and genome evolution.",

We use the Drosophila melanogaster germline as a model to study the regulation of satDNA transcription and chromatin. Here we show that complex satDNAs (>100-bp repeat units) are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs and processed into piRNAs (PIWI interacting RNAs). This satDNA piRNA production depends on the Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff complex and the transcription factor Moonshiner--a previously-described non-canonical pathway that licenses heterochromatin-dependent transcription of dual-strand piRNA clusters. We show that this pathway is important for establishing heterochromatin at satDNAs. Therefore, satDNAs are regulated by piRNAs originating from their own genomic loci. This novel mechanism of satDNA regulation provides insight into the role of piRNA pathways in heterochromatin formation and genome stability.",

Our findings support the hypothesis that T. gondiis manipulation of host boldness is an extended phenotype that promotes parasite transmission from intermediate hosts to feline predators.

    "abstract": "The oxidative modification of DNA can result in the loss of genome integrity and must be repaired to maintain overall genomic stability. We have recently demonstrated that human single stranded DNA binding protein 1 (hSSB1/NABP2/OBFC2B) plays a crucial role in the removal of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro- guanine (8-oxoG), the most common form of oxidative DNA damage. The ability of hSSB1 to form disulphide-bonded tetramers and higher oligomers in an oxidative environment is critical for this process. In this study, we have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to determine the molecular details of ssDNA binding by oligomeric hSSB1. We reveal that hSSB1 oligomers interact with single DNA strands containing damaged DNA bases; however, our data also show that oxidised bases are recognised in the same manner as undamaged DNA bases. We further demonstrate that oxidised hSSB1 interacts with ssDNA with a significantly higher affinity than its monomeric form confirming that oligomeric proteins such as tetramers can bind directly to ssDNA. NMR experiments provide evidence that oligomeric hSSB1 is able to bind longer ssDNA in both binding polarities using a distinct set of residues different to those of the related SSB from Escherichia coli.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease involving disrupted cellular metabolism, basic biochemical processes, and the microenvironment. However, despite some generally agreed upon unifying principles (Hanahan and Weinberg 2000, 2011), molecular signatures remain largely indistinguishable from tissue-of-origin, presenting a major barrier for precision health and individualized medicine. To address this challenge, we reduce mutation data to disruptions in a select set of pathways relevant to basic cell biology, from DNA replication to cellular communication. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we assign tumor samples into ten clusters distinct from tissue-of-origin and largely free of bias from mutational burden or clinical stage. We show that the clusters vary in prognosis by modeling relative risk of death by cancer type and cluster. We identify cluster-specific mutations in different tissues, demonstrating that tissue-specific signatures contribute to common cellular phenotypes. Moreover, germline risk genes involved in replication fidelity and genome stability are equally distributed among clusters, contrary to the expectation that such genes are avatars of molecular subtype. We investigate metastatic and non-metastatic pathways, and show that most differences are cluster-specific. Some metastatic pathways from one cluster are cluster-specific pathways from non-metastatic tumors of another cluster, suggesting phenotypic convergence. Taken as a whole, our observations suggest that common driver genes combine with tissue-specific disruptions in tumor-promoting pathways to produce a limited number of distinct molecular phenotypes. Thus, we present a coherent view of global tumor biology, and explain how common cellular dysfunction might arise from tissue-specific mutations.",

    "abstract": "Human cancers can exhibit phenotype switching, resulting in cells that are more metastatic or that are more tolerant to treatment. However, the relationship between these aggressive states is not well understood. We investigated the dynamics of phenotypic switching in human melanoma cells by monitoring the fluorescent activity from a transgenic reporter of BRN2 promoter activation. Melanoma cells exhibit heterogeneous BRN2 expression patterns that are reestablished upon isolation and clonal outgrowth. Specifically, stable BRN2 expression was generally inherited over multiple generations while undergoing occasional bidirectional interconversion. We found that BRN2 low cells were required for tumor initiation and metastasis in animal engraftment assays but were more sensitive to targeted BRAF inhibition. In contrast, the BRN2 high state was not tumorigenic, but entry into this state was uniform and persistent among cells tolerant to targeted BRAF therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed core programs exclusive to either the BRN2 high or low cells, each of which is present in ex vivo tumors, demonstrating the physiological relevance of these states. Our findings emphasize that one challenge of effectively targeting phenotype switching in melanoma as a therapeutic strategy could be balancing distinct aggressive phenotypes so that sensitizing tumors to BRAF inhibition does not inadvertently lead to further dissemination.\n\nTeaserUnraveling melanomas shape-shifting behavior: insights into how cancer cells swap between metastasis and drug evasion.",

    "abstract": "Hyperbaric exposure (1.3 atmospheres absolute with 20.9% O2) for 1 h a day was shown to improve exercise capacity. The present study was designed to reveal whether the daily exposure time affects exercise performance and metabolism in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Male mice in the training group were housed in a cage with a wheel activity device for 7 weeks from 5 weeks old. Trained mice were then subjected to hybrid training (HT, endurance exercise for 30 min followed by sprint interval exercise for 30 min). Hyperbaric exposure was applied following daily HT for 15 min (15HT), 30 min (30HT), or 60 min (60HT) for 4 weeks (each group, n = 10). In the endurance capacity test, maximal work values were significantly increased by 30HT and 60HT. In the left ventricle (LV), activity levels of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 2 were significantly increased by 60HT. CPT2 activity levels were markedly increased by 60HT in the plantaris muscle (PL). Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) activity values in PL were enhanced more by 30HT and 60HT than by HT. In both 30HT and 60HT groups, lactate dehydrogenase activity levels were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the gastrocnemius muscle and LV. These results indicate that hyperbaric exposure for 30 min or longer has beneficial effects on endurance, and 60-min exposure has the potential to further increase performance by facilitating fatty acid metabolism in skeletal and cardiac muscles in highly-trained mice.",

    "abstract": "Winter chill accumulation is critical for the productivity and profitability of perennial tree fruit systems. Several studies have quantified the impacts of global warming on chill accumulation in the warmer production regions of the world, where insufficient chill events occur and their frequency is increasing. In contrast, we focus on a region with relatively cold winters-the Pacific Northwest United States (PNW)-where insufficient chill events are currently absent, and quantify the potential for introduction of these risks under climate change. Results identified spatial variation within the PNW, with chill accumulation projected to increase in some areas but decrease in others. There was also spatiotemporal variation in the driving factors of changes to chill accumulation. Even with decreases in chill accumulations, there are likely minimal issues with insufficient chill accumulation. However, delayed chill accumulation in combination with advances in the onset of heat accumulation can potentially shift the region from one where spring phenology is primarily forcing-driven to one where the dynamic interplay between chilling and forcing processes become important. These interactions might create production risks for varieties with high chill requirements, post mid-21st-century under high emissions scenarios. Future work should focus on understanding, modeling, and projecting responses across these overlapping chilling and forcing processes. Additionally, given significant spatial differences across a relatively small geographic range, it is also critical to understand and model these dynamics at a local landscape resolution for regions such as the PNW.",

However, such in vivo optical recordings are typically subject to motion artifact and background contamination from neurons and blood vessels. Further, population cell tracking across multiple recordings is complicated by non-rigid transformation induced by cell movements and field shifts. We introduce the novel method SCOUT for Single-Cell SpatiOtemporal LongitUdinal Tracking, consisting of two crucial parts: (1) imposition of spatial constraints on neuronal footprints extracted from individual optical recordings to improve ROI selection and eliminate false discoveries, and (2) application of a predictor-corrector, using spatiotemporal correlation of extracted neurons across sessions, for population cell tracking across multiple sessions. SCOUT empirically outperforms current methods for cell extraction and tracking in long-term multi-session imaging experiments across multiple brain regions. Application of this method allows for robust longitudinal analysis of contextual discrimination associated neural ensemble dynamics in the hippocampus up to 60 days.",

    "abstract": "Auditory beats are composed of two sine waves using nearby frequencies, which can either be applied as a superposed signal to both ears or to each ear separately. In the first case, the beat sensation results from hearing an amplitude-modulated signal (monaural beat). In the second case, it is generated by phase-sensitive neurons in the brain stem (binaural beat). We investigated the effects of monaural and binaural 5 Hz beat stimulation on neural activity and memory performance in neurosurgical patients performing an associative recognition task. Previously, we had reported that these beat stimulation conditions modulated memory performance in opposite directions. Here, we analyzed data from a patient subgroup, in which microwires were implanted in the amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex. We identified neurons responding with firing rate changes to binaural versus monaural 5 Hz beat stimulation. In these neurons, we correlated the differences in firing rates for binaural versus monaural beats to the memory-related differences for remembered versus forgotten items and associations. In the left hemisphere for these neurons, we detected statistically significant negative correlations between firing rate differences for binaural versus monaural beats and remembered versus forgotten items/associations. Importantly, such negative correlations were also observed between beat stimulation-related firing rate differences in the baseline window and memory-related firing rate differences in the poststimulus windows. In line with concepts of homeostatic plasticity, we interpret our findings as indicating that beat stimulation is linked to memory performance via shifting baseline firing levels.",

    "abstract": "Alternative RNA splicing varies across brain regions, but the single-cell resolution of such regional variation is unknown. Here we present the first single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions, by performing single cell long-read transcriptome sequencing in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 (www.isoformAtlas.com). Using isoform tests for brain-region specific DIE, which outperform exon-based tests, we detect hundreds of brain-region specific DIE events traceable to specific cell-types. Many DIE events correspond to functionally distinct protein isoforms, some with just a 6-nucleotide exon variant. In most instances, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. Cell types indigenous to only one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, where for example, the choroid plexus epithelium manifest unique transcription start sites. However, for some genes, multiple cell-types are responsible for DIE in bulk data, indicating that regional identity can, although less frequently, override cell-type specificity. We validated our findings with spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing, yielding the first spatially resolved splicing map in the postnatal mouse brain (www.isoformAtlas.com). Our methods are highly generalizable. They provide a robust means of quantifying isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution, and reveal how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity to serve function.",

    "abstract": "L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC) integrate synaptic signals to facilitate a plethora of cellular mechanisms. L-VDCC dysfunction is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Despite their importance, signals upstream of L-VDCC activity that regulate their channel density, however, are poorly defined. In disease models with overactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (or mTORopathies), including tuberous sclerosis (TS) and Alzheimers disease (AD), we report a novel mechanism downstream of mTORC1 signaling that results in a deficit in dendritic L-VDCC activity. Deficits in L-VDCC activity are associated with increased expression of the mTORC1-regulated RNA-binding protein DJ-1. DJ-1 binds the mRNA coding the auxiliary Ca2+ channel subunit 2{delta}2 responsible for shuttling L-VDCC to the membrane and represses its expression. Moreover, this novel DJ-1/2{delta}2/L-VDCC pathway is disrupted in human AD and preclinical models of AD and TS. Our discovery that DJ-1 directs L-VDCC activity and L-VDCC-associated protein 2{delta}2 at the synapse suggests that DJ-1/2{delta}2/L-VDCC is a common, fundamental pathway disrupted in TS and AD that can be targeted in clinical mTORopathies.\n\nSignificance StatementMany neurological disorders share symptoms, despite disparity among diseases. Treatments are prescribed based on diagnosis rather than individual symptoms. While only treating symptoms may obscure the disease, mechanism-based drug development allows the two approaches to converge. Hub proteins, those that coordinate the expression of proteins that mediate specific cellular functions, may be dysregulated across a broad range of disorders. Herein, we show that the RNA-binding protein DJ-1 controls the activity of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC), via the expression of its auxiliary subunit alpha2delta2 (2{delta}2). Importantly, we demonstrate that this novel DJ-1/2{delta}2/L-VDCC pathway is commonly disrupted among neurological disorders, namely Alzheimers disease (AD) and Tuberous Sclerosis (TS). Collectively, these data rationalize mechanism-based drug therapy to treat disease.",

In this study, we dissect the requirements of IFN{gamma} produced by innate immune cells and CD4 T cells for resolution of Chlamydia muridarum female reproductive tract (FRT) infection. After C. muridarum intravaginal inoculation, IFN{gamma}-deficient and T cell-deficient mice exhibited opposite phenotypes for survival and bacterial shedding at the FRT mucosa, demonstrating the distinct requirements for IFN{gamma} and CD4 T cells in host defense against Chlamydia. In Rag-deficient mice, IFN{gamma} produced by innate lymphocytes (ILCs) accounted for early bacterial containment and prolonged survival in the absence of adaptive immunity. Although group I ILCs are potent IFN{gamma} producers, we found that mature NK cells and ILC1 were not the sole source for innate IFN{gamma} in response to Chlamydia. T cell adoptive transfer experiments revealed that WT and IFN{gamma}-deficient CD4 T cells were equally capable of mediating effective bacterial killing in the FRT during the early stage of Chlamydia infection. Together, our results revealed that innate IFN{gamma} is essential for preventing systemic Chlamydia dissemination, whereas IFN{gamma} produced by CD4 T cells is largely dispensable at the FRT mucosa.",

Such forecasts require robust estimators of fecundity, survival and density-dependence. While survival estimation is the main focus of mark-recapture modelling, fecundity and density dependence are rarely the subject of these models. Here, we demonstrate that these parameters can be simultaneously estimated in a Bayesian framework using only robust design mark-recapture data. Using simulated capture histories, we show that this framework (which we named CJS-pop) can estimate vital rates and their density dependence with little bias. When CJS-pop is applied to capture history data from Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), it provides estimates of fecundity that is expected from the breeding biology of this species. Finally, we illustrate that density dependence, even when estimated with uncertainty in the CJS-pop framework, regularizes population dynamics and reduces the frequent population extinctions and explosions observed under density-independent models. While CJS-pop as a whole is a useful addition to the current mark-recapture modelling toolbox, we argue that the independent components of this framework in estimating fecundity and density dependence can be integrated to other CJS frameworks, potentially creating models capable of population projections.",

As a case study, we model HD-ClvR in the grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), which is an invasive pest in the UK and responsible for both biodiversity and economic losses. HD-ClvR combats resistance allele formation by combining a homing gene drive with a cleave-and-rescue gene drive. The inclusion of a self-limiting daisyfield gene drive allows for controllable localisation based on animal supplementation. We use both randomly mating and spatial models to simulate this strategy.

    "abstract": "Self-assembly of proteins holds great promise for the bottom-up design and production of synthetic biomaterials. In conventional approaches, designer proteins are pre-programmed with specific recognition sites that drive the association process towards a desired organized state. Although proven effective, this approach poses restrictions on the complexity and material properties of the end-state. An alternative, hierarchical approach that has found wide adoption for inorganic systems, relies on the production of crystalline nanoparticles which in turn become the building blocks of a next-level assembly process driven by oriented attachment (OA). As it stands, OA has not been observed for proteins. Here we employ cryoEM in the high nucleation rate limit of protein crystals and map the self-assembly route at molecular resolution. We observe the initial formation of facetted nanocrystals that merge lattices by means of OA alignment well before contact is made, satisfying non-trivial symmetry rules in the process. The OA mechanism yields crystal morphologies that are not attainable through conventional crystallization routes. Based on these insights we revisit a system of protein crystallization that has long been classified as non-classical, but our data is in direct conflict with that conclusion supporting a classical mechanism that implicates OA. These observations raise further questions about past conclusions for other proteins and illustrate the importance of maturation stages after primary nucleation has taken place.",

    "abstract": "Ribose-Map is a user-friendly, standardized bioinformatics toolkit for the comprehensive analysis of ribonucleotide sequencing experiments. It allows researchers to map the locations of ribonucleotides in DNA to single-nucleotide resolution and identify biological signatures of ribonucleotide incorporation. In addition, it can be applied to data generated using any currently available high-throughput ribonucleotide sequencing technique, thus standardizing the analysis of ribonucleotide sequencing experiments and allowing direct comparisons of results. This protocol describes in detail how to use Ribose-Map to analyze raw ribonucleotide sequencing data, including preparing the reads for analysis, locating the genomic coordinates of ribonucleotides, exploring the genome-wide distribution of ribonucleotides, determining the nucleotide sequence context of ribonucleotides, and identifying hotspots of ribonucleotide incorporation. Ribose-Map does not require background knowledge of ribonucleotide sequencing analysis and assumes only basic command-line skills. The protocol requires less than 3 hr of computing time for most datasets and about 30 min of hands-on time.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer that metastasizes largely via tumor emboli, and has a 5-year survival rate of less than 30%. No unique genomic signature has yet been identified for IBC nor has any specific molecular therapeutic been developed to manage the disease. Thus, identifying gene expression signatures specific to IBC remains crucial. Here, we compare various gene lists that have been proposed as molecular footprints of IBC using different clinical samples as training and validation sets and using independent training algorithms, and determine their accuracy in identifying IBC samples in three independent datasets. We show that these gene lists have little to no mutual overlap, and have limited predictive accuracy in identifying IBC samples. Despite this inconsistency, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) of IBC samples correlate with their position on the epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal spectrum. This positioning, together with ssGSEA scores, improves the accuracy of IBC identification across the three independent datasets. Finally, we observed that IBC samples robustly displayed a higher coefficient of variation in terms of EMT scores, as compared to non-IBC samples. Pending verification that this patient-to-patient variability extends to intratumor heterogeneity within a single patient, these results suggest that higher heterogeneity along the epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal spectrum can be regarded to be a hallmark of IBC and a possibly useful biomarker.",

    "abstract": "We describe a unique three-dimensionally preserved fossil down feather from the Late Cretaceous of Myanmar. Its morphology is highly congruent with Stage IIIb of the widely accepted Prum and Brush model of feather evolution-development. This makes the new specimen the first evidence of this developmental stage in the fossil record. The Stage IIIb diagnosis is robustly supported by the absence of a central rachis and by its paired barbules emanating from radially positioned barbs that are attached to a short calamus. Prum and Brushs model hypothesises a bifurcation in the evolution-development pathway at Stage III. Stage IIIa involves rachis development and branching into barbs. Stage IIIb involves branching of the barbs from the calamus and then further branching of the barbules from the barbs. These two pathways then converge into Stage IIIa+b where feathers produce a rachis, barbs and barbules in nested order, finally leading to Stage IV. Evolution-development studies on the morphogenesis of feathers have unequivocally shown that such feather branching can be controlled by BMP, Noggin, Shh and several other proteins. Therefore, molecular crosstalk can convert a barb into a rachis and vice versa. The topology of this down feather, consistent with specific patterns of modular protein-protein signalling already observed, provides the first definitive evidence that such signalling was responsible for the evolution of a diverse inventory of feather morphologies in non-avialan dinosaurs and early birds since the middle Jurassic.",

    "abstract": "Existing computational methods that use single-cell RNA-sequencing for cell fate prediction either summarize observations of cell states and their couplings without modeling the underlying differentiation process, or are limited in their capacity to model complex differentiation landscapes. Thus, contemporary methods cannot predict how cells evolve stochastically and in physical time from an arbitrary starting expression state, nor can they model the cell fate consequences of gene expression perturbations. We introduce PRESCIENT (Potential eneRgy undErlying Single Cell gradIENTs), a generative modeling framework that learns an underlying differentiation landscape from single-cell time-series gene expression data. Our generative model framework provides insight into the process of differentiation and can simulate differentiation trajectories for arbitrary gene expression progenitor states. We validate our method on a recently published experimental lineage tracing dataset that provides observed trajectories. We show that this model is able to predict the fate biases of progenitor cells in neutrophil/macrophage lineages when accounting for cell proliferation, improving upon the best-performing existing method. We also show how a model can predict trajectories for cells not found in the models training set, including cells in which genes or sets of genes have been perturbed. PRESCIENT is able to accommodate complex perturbations of multiple genes, at different time points and from different starting cell populations. PRESCIENT models are able to recover the expected effects of known modulators of cell fate in hematopoiesis and pancreatic {beta} cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "To identify potential regions of the voltage-sensing domain that could shift the voltage sensitivity of Ciona intestinalis based Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs), we aligned 183 voltage-gated sodium channels from different organisms. Conserved polar residues were identified at multiple transmembrane loop junctions in the voltage sensing domain. Similar conservation of polar amino acids was found in the voltage sensing domain of the voltage-sensing phosphatase gene family. These conserved residues were mutated to nonpolar or oppositely charged amino acids in a GEVI that utilizes the voltage sensing domain of the voltage sensing phosphatase from Ciona fused to the fluorescent protein, super ecliptic pHlorin (A227D). Different mutations shifted the voltage sensitivity in a more positive or a more negative direction. Double mutants were then created by selecting constructs that shifted the optical signal to more negative potentials resulting in an improved signal in the physiological voltage range. The combination of two mutations, Y172A (intracellular loop between transmembrane segments S2 and S3) and D204K (extracellular loop between transmembrane segments S3 and S4) showed the increased the signal size from 2.5% to 13.8% for a 100 mV depolarization.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus and contains GU-rich sequences distributed abundantly in the genome. In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. In this report, we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms as well as diseases that generate a cytokine storm.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes a tremendous threat to global health. Although vaccines against the virus are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulated the three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with high performance computer, predicted the B cell epitopes on spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches, and then validated the epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induced antibody production, six of which were immunodominant epitopes in patients identified via the binding of epitopes with the sera from domestic and imported COVID-19 patients, and 23 were conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We also found that the immunodominant epitopes of domestic SARS-CoV-2 were different from that of the imported, which may be caused by the mutations on S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we validated that eight epitopes on S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies that blocked the cell entry of both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus of SARS-CoV-2, three and nine epitopes induced D614 or G614 neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Our present study shed light on the immunodominance, neutralization, and conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 which are potently used for the diagnosis, virus classification and the vaccine design tackling inefficiency, virus mutation and different species of coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is currently the only FDA-approved antiviral drug for the treatment of SARS CoV-2 infection. The drug is approved for use in adults or children 12-years or older who are hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19 on the basis of an acceleration of clinical recovery for inpatients with this disease. Unfortunately, the drug must be administered intravenously, restricting its use to those requiring hospitalization for relatively advanced disease. RDV is also unstable in plasma and has a complex activation pathway which may contribute to its highly variable antiviral efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Potent orally bioavailable antiviral drugs for early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed and several including molnupiravir and PF-07321332 are currently in clinical development. We focused on making simple, orally bioavailable lipid analogs of Remdesivir nucleoside (RVn, GS-441524) that are processed to RVn-monophosphate, the precursor of the active RVn-triphosphate, by a single-step intracellular cleavage. In addition to high oral bioavailability, stability in plasma and simpler metabolic activation, new oral lipid prodrugs of RVn had submicromolar anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a variety of cell types including Vero E6, Calu-3, Caco-2, human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived lung cells and Huh7.5 cells. In Syrian hamsters oral treatment with ODBG-P-RVn was well tolerated and achieved therapeutic levels in plasma above the EC90 for SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest further evaluation as an early oral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection to minimize severe disease and reduce hospitalizations.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread rapidly and became a pandemic. Since there is no therapy available that is proven as fully protective against COVID-19, a vaccine to protect against deadly COVID-19 is urgently needed. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), is one of the most abundant proteins in coronaviruses and is a potential target for both vaccine development and point of care diagnostics. The variable mass of N protein (45 to 60 kDa), suggests the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and it is critical to clearly define these PTMs to gain the structural understanding necessary for further vaccine research. There have been several reports suggesting that the N protein is phosphorylated but lacks glycosylation. Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to confirm one phosphorylation site. Recent studies have indicated that the N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of the N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of glycosylation on viral pathogenesis and also in vaccine design and development.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic with a high morbidity rate is posing serious global concern. There is an urgent need to design a suitable therapy or vaccine that could fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in receptor binding and membrane fusion inside the host, it could be a suitable target for designing of an epitope-based vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus has a property to mutate. So, a conserved peptide region of spike glycoprotein was used for predicting suitable B cell and T cell epitopes. 4 T cell epitopes were selected based on stability, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Further, MHC-I were found from the immune database that could best interact with the selected epitopes. Population coverage analysis was also done to check the presence of identified MHC-I, in the human population of the affected countries. The T cell epitope that binds with the respective MHC-I with highest affinity was chosen. Molecular dynamic simulation results show that the epitope is well selected. This is an in-silico based study that predicts a novel T cell epitope from the conserved spike glycoprotein that could act as a target for designing of the epitope-based vaccine. Further, B cell epitopes have also been found but the main work focuses on T cell epitope as the immunity generated by it is long lasting as compared to B cell epitope.",

    "abstract": "Reward motivation is known to enhance cognitive control. However, detrimental effects have also been observed, which have been attributed to overdosing of already high baseline dopamine levels by further dopamine increases elicited by reward cues. Aarts et al. (2014) indeed demonstrated, in 14 individuals, that reward effects depended on striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, measured with [18F]FMT-PET: promised reward improved Stroop control in low-dopamine individuals, while impairing it in high-dopamine individuals. Here, we aimed to assess this same effect in 44 new participants, who had previously undergone an [18F]DOPA-PET scan to quantify dopamine synthesis capacity. This sample performed the exact same rewarded Stroop paradigm as in the prior study. However, we did not find any correlation between reward effects on cognitive control and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. The discrepancy between the current and our previous findings might reflect the use of different radiotracers for indexing dopamine synthesis capacity.\n\nSTATEMENT OF RELEVANCEReward motivation is generally thought to enhance cognitive control, but paradoxical negative effects of rewards on cognitive control have also been observed. A previous PET study demonstrated that reward effects on Stroop control depended on baseline striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, indexed by uptake of the radiotracer [18F]FMT.

Replicating the exact same Stroop paradigm within a larger sample is therefore crucial to robustly establish the mechanistic link between incentive motivation and cognitive control and advancing our understanding of who chokes under pressure and why, a topic of great societal relevance today. The present study did not reveal any correlation between reward effects on cognitive control and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, indexed with [18F]FDOPA-PET. Future studies might consider putative differential sensitivity of the radiotracer [18F]FMT and [18F]FDOPA, while also addressing other indices of dopamine transmission.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of chronic infections are polymicrobial biofilms. The forces governing assembly and maturation of these microbial ecosystems are largely unexplored but the consequences on host response and clinical outcome can be significant. In the context of wound healing, formation of a biofilm and a stable microbial community structure is associated with impaired tissue repair resulting in a non-healing chronic wound. These types of wounds can persist for years simmering below the threshold of classical clinical infection or cycling through phases of recurrent infection. In the most severe outcome amputation of lower extremities may occur if spreading infection ensues. Here we take an ecological perspective to study priority effects and competitive exclusion on overall biofilm community structure in a three-membered community of microbes derived from a chronic wound. We find that priority effects occur across both biotic and abiotic substrates, and ecological interactions can alter both fungal physiology and host inflammatory response. We show that bacterial-competition occurs for binding to fungal structures, and some species trigger the yeast-hyphae switch, resulting in enhanced neutrophil killing and inflammation. Collectively, the results presented here facilitate our understanding of fungal-bacterial microbial community dynamics and their effects on, host-microbe interactions, pathogenesis, and ultimately, wound healing.",

Accordingly, many studies have relied on characterizing overexpressed proteins, which might not recapitulate endogenous protein activities. We present two approaches for higher throughput production of endogenous protein reporters. Our first approach makes use of a split fluorescent protein mNeonGreen2 (mNG2). Knock-in of a small portion of the mNG2 gene, in frame with gene coding regions of interest was highly efficient in embryos, eliminating the need to establish mouse lines. When complemented by the larger portion of the mNG2 gene, fluorescence was reconstituted and endogenous protein localization faithfully reported in living embryos. However, we report a threshold of detection using this approach. By contrast, the V5 epitope enabled high efficiency and higher sensitivity protein reporting. We describe complementary advantages and prospective applications of these two approaches.\n\nHighlightsO_LISplit fluorescent protein for in vivo protein localization in living embryos\nC_LIO_LIV5 tagging for in vivo localization of low abundance proteins\nC_LIO_LIBypassing the need for founder mouse lines for preimplantation studies\nC_LIO_LIGuidelines and strategies for implementation and prospective applications\nC_LI",

By G4 ChIP-seq/RNA-seq analysis on liposarcoma cells we confirmed that G4s in promoters are invariably associated with high transcription levels in open chromatin. Comparing G4 presence, location and transcript levels in liposarcoma cells to available data on keratinocytes, we showed that the same promoter sequences of the same genes in the two cell lines had different G4-folding state: high transcript levels consistently associated with high G4-folding. Transcription factors AP-1 and SP1, whose binding sites were the most significantly represented in G4-folded sequences, coimmunoprecipitated with their G4-folded promoters. Thus G4s and their associated transcription factors cooperate to determine cell-specific transcriptional programs, making G4s strongly emerge as new epigenetic regulators of the transcription machinery.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMine tailings contain rare earth elements, including lanthanum and cerium, and plant micronutrients including iron. Previous studies have demonstrated that fertilizers containing rare earth elements and/or micronutrients can influence plant physiology, nutrient uptake and crop yield. However, applying the right dose of these fertilizers is critical since the concentration range associated with benefits is often narrow, and overapplication can lead to crop yield reductions. This study aimed to quantify the effects of a water-soluble fertilizer, REAP, on the yield of greenhouse crops.\n\nMethodsIn the first experiment, the effects of three concentrations of REAP (100, 250 or 500 ppm) were compared to a control (0 ppm REAP) on growth of lettuce, tomato and pepper growing in soilless media. In the second experiments, the effects of REAP applied at higher rates (500, 1000 and 2000 ppm) were compared to a control (0 ppm REAP) on the growth of lettuce, peppers, tomato and cantaloupe.\n\nResultsIn the first experiment, there were no significant differences in yield between treatments, REAP appeared to promote root development. In the second experiment, there were significant yield increases for all crops treated with REAP. Gas exchange rates and nutrient concentration of tomato plants receiving REAP were not significantly different from the control. These results demonstrated that nutrient elements in REAP, including lanthanum, cerium, and micronutrients, improved the growth and yield of vegetable crops when applied at rates ranging from 500 to 2000 ppm.",

Impaired decision making is a consequence of cognitive decline caused by various physiological conditions, such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we exploited the value-based feeding decision (VBFD) assay, which is a simple sensory-motor task, to determine the cognitive status of Drosophila. Our results indicated the deterioration of VBFD is notably correlated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Restriction of the mushroom body (MB) neuronal activity partly blunted the proper VBFD. Furthermore, using the Drosophila polyQ disease model, we demonstrated the impaired VBFD is ameliorated by the dinitrosyl iron complex (DNIC-1), a novel and steady nitric oxide (NO)-releasing compound. Therefore we propose that the VBFD assay provides a robust assessment of Drosophila cognition and can be used to characterize additional neuroprotective interventions.",

    "abstract": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been proposed to encode expected outcomes, which is thought to be important for outcome-directed behavior. However, such neural encoding can also often be explained by the recall of information about the recent past. To dissociate the retrospective and prospective aspects of encoding in the OFC, we designed a non-spatial, continuous, alternating odor-sequence task that mimicked a continuous T-maze. The task consisted of two alternating sequences of four odor-guided trials (2 sequences x 4 positions). In each trial, rats were asked to make a \"go\" or \"no-go\" action based on a fixed odor-reward contingency. Odors at both the first and last positions were distinct across the two sequences, such that they resembled unique paths in the past and future, respectively; odors at positions in between were the same and thus resembled a common path. We trained classifiers using neural activity to distinguish between either sequences or positions and asked whether the neural activity patterns in the common path were more like the ones in the past or the future. We found a proximal prospective code for sequence information as well as a distal prospective code for positional information, the latter of which was closely associated with rats ability to predict future outcomes. This study demonstrates a prospective behaviorally-relevant predictive code in rat OFC.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies from Slc4a11 KO mice have identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a major contributor toward oxidative stress and cell death in Congenital Hereditary Endothelial Dystrophy. Here we asked if this stress activated autophagy in the Slc4a11 KO cell line and in KO mouse endothelial tissue. Early indicators of autophagy, phospho-mTOR and LC3-II indicated activation, however P62 was elevated suggesting an impairment of autophagy flux. The activity and the number of lysosomes, the organelle responsible for the final degradation of autophagy substrates, were found to be reduced in the KO. In addition, the expression of the master regulator of lysosomal function and biogenesis, TFEB, was significantly reduced in the KO corneal endothelia. Also, we observed increased Unfolded Protein Response, as well as elevated expression of ER stress markers, BIP and CHOP. To test if lysosomal and ER stress stems from elevated mitochondrial ROS, we treated Slc4a11 KO corneal endothelial cells with the mitochondrial ROS quencher, MitoQ. MitoQ restored lysosomal enzymes as well as TFEB, reduced ER stress, and increased autophagy flux. MitoQ injections of Slc4a11 KO mice decreased corneal edema, the major phenotype associated with CHED. We conclude that mitochondrial ROS causes ER stress and lysosomal dysfunction with impairment of autophagy in Slc4a11 KO corneal endothelium. Our study is the first to identify the presence as well as cause of lysosomal dysfunction and ER stress in an animal model of CHED, and to characterize inter-organelle relationship in a corneal cell type.",

    "abstract": "Gene drives offer the possibility of altering and even suppressing wild populations of countless plant and animal species, and CRISPR technology now provides the technical feasibility of engineering them. However, population-suppression gene drives are prone to select resistance, should it arise. Here we develop mathematical and computational models to identify conditions under which suppression drives will evade resistance, even if resistance is present initially. Previous models assumed resistance is allelic to the drive. We relax this assumption and show that linkage between the resistance and drive loci is critical to the evolution of resistance and that evolution of resistance requires (negative) linkage disequilibrium between the two loci. When the two loci are unlinked or only partially so, a suppression drive that causes limited inviability can evolve to fixation while causing only a minor increase in resistance frequency. Once fixed, the drive allele no longer selects resistance. Our analyses suggest that among gene drives that cause moderate suppression, toxin-antidote systems are less apt to select for resistance than homing drives. Single drives of moderate effect might cause only moderate population suppression, but multiple drives (perhaps delivered sequentially) would allow arbitrary levels of suppression. The most favorable case for evolution of resistance appears to be with suppression homing drives in which resistance is dominant and fully suppresses transmission distortion; partial suppression by resistance heterozygotes or recessive resistance are less prone to resistance evolution. Given that it is now possible to engineer CRISPR-based gene drives capable of circumventing allelic resistance, this design may allow for the engineering of suppression gene drives that are effectively resistance-proof.",

    "abstract": "To date, no publicly available disease-modifying therapy for Parkinsons disease has been developed. This can be partly attributed to the absence of techniques for in vivo deletion of the SNCA gene (encoding -synuclein), which is one of the key players in Parkinsons disease pathology. In particular, A53T-mutated SNCA (A53T-SNCA) is one of the most studied familial pathologic mutations in Parkinsons disease. Here we utilized a recently discovered genome editing technique, CRISPR/Cas9, to delete A53T-SNCA in vitro and in vivo. Among various CRISPR/Cas9 systems, SaCas9-KKH with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting A53T-SNCA was packaged into adeno-associated virus. Adeno-associated virus carrying SaCas9-KKH significantly reduced A53T-SNCA levels in A53T-SNCA-overexpressed HEK293T cells, without off-target effects on wild-type SNCA. Furthermore, we tested the techniques in vivo therapeutic potential in a viral A53T-SNCA overexpression rat model of Parkinsons disease. Gene deletion of A53T-SNCA significantly prevented the overexpression of -synuclein, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and parkinsonian motor symptoms, whereas a negative control without sgRNA did not. Our findings propose CRISPR/Cas9 system as a potential therapeutic tool for A53T-SNCA familial Parkinsons disease.",

A 1.25 [A]-resolution crystal structure of the CYP124-SQ109 complex unambiguously shows two conformations of the drug, both positioned for hydroxylation of the {omega}-methyl group in the trans position. The hydroxylated SQ109 presumably forms stabilizing H-bonds with its target, the Mycobacterial membrane protein Large 3 (MmpL3).

We combined in vitro transcription/translation of the genes of interest with a microliter-scale enzymatic assay in 96-well plates. The substrate conversion was indirectly measured by quantifying the consumption of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine co-factor by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer rather than time-consuming product analysis by chromatography.

    "abstract": "The molecular basis for the severity and rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown. ORF8 is a rapidly evolving accessory protein that has been proposed to interfere with immune responses. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 was determined at 2.04 [A] resolution by x-ray crystallography. The structure reveals a ~60 residue core similar to SARS-CoV ORF7a with the addition of two dimerization interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. A covalent disulfide-linked dimer is formed through an N-terminal sequence specific to SARS-CoV-2, while a separate non-covalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence, 73YIDI76. Together the presence of these interfaces shows how SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can form unique large-scale assemblies not possible for SARS-CoV, potentially mediating unique immune suppression and evasion activities.",

    "abstract": "The perception of mechanical force is a fundamental property of most, if not all cells. PIEZO channels are plasma membrane-embedded mechanosensitive calcium channels that play diverse and essential roles in mechanobiological processes in animals1,2. PIEZO channel homologs are found in plants3,4, but their role(s) in the green lineage are almost completely unknown. Plants and animals diverged approximately 1.5 billion years ago, independently evolved multicellularity, and have vastly different cellular mechanics5. Here, we investigate PIEZO channel function in the moss Physcomitrium patens, a representative of one of the first land plant lineages. PpPIEZO1 and PpPIEZO2 were redundantly required for normal growth, size, and shape of tip-growing caulonema cells. Both were localized to vacuolar membranes and facilitated the release of calcium into the cytosol in response to hypoosmotic shock. Loss-of-function ({Delta}Pppiezo1/2) and gain-of-function (PpPIEZO2-R2508K and -R2508H) mutants revealed a role for moss PIEZO homologs in regulating vacuole morphology. Our work here shows that plant and animal PIEZO homologs have diverged in both subcellular localization and in function, likely co-opted to serve different needs in each lineage. The plant homologs of PIEZO channels thus provide a compelling lens through which to study plant mechanobiology and the evolution of mechanoperceptive strategies in multicellular eukaryotes.",

Tolerant bacteria disrupt antibiotic efficacy and increase the likelihood that a population gains antibiotic resistance, a growing health concern. We examined how E. coli transcriptional networks changed in response to lethal ampicillin concentrations. We are the first to apply transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) analysis to antibiotic tolerance by leveraging existing knowledge and our transcriptional data. TRN analysis shows that gene expression changes specific to ampicillin treatment are likely caused by specific sigma and transcription factors typically regulated by proteolysis. These results demonstrate that to survive lethal concentration of ampicillin specific regulatory proteins change activity and cause a coordinated transcriptional response that leverages multiple gene systems.",

We have developed and characterized a mouse model with inducible muscle specific RYR1 deletion. Recombination in the RYR1 gene resulted in a progressive reduction in the protein amount and was associated with a progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Calcium fluxes in isolated muscle fibers were accordingly reduced. Alterations in the muscle structure were observed, with fibers atrophy, abnormal mitochondria distribution, membrane remodeling, associated with increase in the expression level of many proteins and inhibition of the autophagy process. This model demonstrates that RyR1 reduction is sufficient to recapitulate most features of Central Core Disease, and accordingly similar alterations were observed in muscle biopsies from Central Core Disease patients, pointing to common pathophysiological mechanisms related to RyR1 reduction.",

Recent metatranscriptomic studies have uncovered divergent influenza viruses in amphibians, fish and jawless vertebrates, suggesting that these viruses may be widely distributed. We sought to identify additional vertebrate influenza-like viruses through the analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing data. Accordingly, by data mining, we identified the complete coding segments of five divergent vertebrate influenza-like viruses. Three fell as sister lineages to influenza B virus: salamander influenza-like virus in Mexican walking fish (Ambystoma mexicanum) and plateau tiger salamander (Ambystoma velasci), siamese algae-eater influenza-like virus in siamese algae-eater fish (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri) and chum salmon influenza-like virus in chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta). Similarly, we identified two influenza-like viruses of amphibians that fell as sister lineages to influenza D virus: cane toad influenza-like virus and the ornate chorus frog influenza-like virus, in the cane toad (Rhinella marina) and ornate chorus frog (Microhyla fissipes), respectively. Despite their divergent phylogenetic positions, these viruses retained segment conservation and splicing consistent with transcriptional regulation in influenza B and influenza D viruses, and were detected in respiratory tissues. These data suggest that influenza viruses have been associated with vertebrates for their entire evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria use cyclic di-AMP as a second messenger to control potassium and osmotic homeostasis. In Bacillus subtilis, several c-di-AMP binding proteins and RNA molecules have been identified. Most of these targets play a role in controlling potassium uptake and export. In addition, c-di-AMP binds to two conserved target proteins of unknown function, DarA and DarB, that exclusively consist of the c-di-AMP binding domain. Most likely these proteins transduce their signal by regulatory interactions with other proteins. Here, we have investigated the function of the c-di-AMP-binding protein DarB in B. subtilis, a protein consisting of two CBS (cystathionine-beta synthase) domains. We have used an unbiased search for DarB interaction partners and identified the (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase Rel as a major interaction partner of DarB. (p)ppGpp is another second messenger that is formed upon amino acid starvation and under other stress conditions to stop translation and active metabolism. The interaction between DarB and Rel only takes place if the bacteria grow at very low potassium concentrations and intracellular levels of c-di-AMP are low. Indeed, c-di-AMP inhibits the binding of DarB to Rel. The interaction results in the Rel-dependent accumulation of pppGpp. Our results link potassium and c-di-AMP signaling to the stringent response and thus to the global control of cellular physiology.",

Using in silico analyses, we previously showed that the hmqABCDEFG operon, which encodes enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of HMAQs, is carried by about one-third of Bcc strains, with considerable inter- and intra-species variability. In the present study, we investigated by PCR, using consensus primers, the distribution of hmqABCDEFG in a collection of 313 Bcc strains (222 of clinical and 91 of environmental origins) - belonging to 18 Bcc species. We confirmed that the distribution is species-specific, although not all strains within a species carry the hmqABCDEFG operon. Among the 30% of strains bearing the hmqABCDEFG operon, we measured the total HMAQs production and showed that 90% of environmental isolates and 68% of clinically isolated Bcc produce detectable levels of HMAQs when cultured in TSB medium. For the strains having the hmqABCDEFG operon but not producing HMAQs, we studied the transcription and showed that none expressed the hmqA gene under the specified culture conditions. Interestingly, the hmqABCDEFG operon is more prevalent among plant root environment species (e.g. B. ambifaria, B. cepacia) and absent in species commonly found in chronically colonized individuals with cystic fibrosis (e.g. B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans), suggesting that the Hmq system could play a role in niche adaptation by influencing rhizosphere microbial community and could have been lost through evolution. Understanding the Hmq system and its regulation will provide clues concerning the production of HMAQs and their functions in Bcc.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 and its causative pathogen SARS-CoV-2 have rushed the world into a staggering pandemic in a few months and a global fight against both is still going on. Here, we describe an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the genetic code, to molecular mechanisms based on understanding of RNA replication and its feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information and identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluation of sequence variation patterns as mutation spectrum and its 12 permutations among organized clades tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our findings include: (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation whose abundant second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight and lower hydrophobicity albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance group includes: three negative-strand mutations U-to-C, A-to-G, G-to-A and a positive-strand mutation G-to-U generated through an identical mechanism as C-to-U. (3) A clade-associated and biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of the negative-sense strand synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a bioinformatics platform where emerging mutations are mapped on to mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral proteomes and transcriptomes to provide biological and clinical information after logical convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such thoughts and actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.",

In this study we used a bioinformatics approach to identify RNASEH2A co-expressed genes in different human tissues to uncover biological processes in which RNASEH2A is involved. By implementing this approach, we identified functional networks for RNASEH2A that are not only involved in the processes of DNA replication and DNA damage response, but also in cell cycle regulation. Additional examination of protein-protein networks for RNASEH2A by the STRING database analysis, revealed a high co-expression correlation between RNASEH2A and the genes of the protein networks identified. Mass spectrometry analysis of RNASEH2A-bound proteins highlighted players functioning in cell cycle regulation. Further bioinformatics investigation showed increased gene expression of RNASEH2A in different types of actively cycling cells and tissues, and particularly in several cancers, supporting a biological role for RNASEH2A, but not the other two subunits of RNase H2, in cell proliferation.",

SGI1 carries five AcaCD-responsive promoters that drive the expression of genes involved in its excision, replication, and mobilisation. SGI1 encodes an AcaCD homologue, the transcriptional activator complex SgaCD (also known as FlhDCSGI1) that seems to recognise and activate the same SGI1 promoters. Here, we investigated the relevance of SgaCD in SGI1s lifecycle. Mating assays revealed the requirement for SgaCD and its IncC-encoded counterpart AcaCD in the mobilisation of SGI1. An integrative approach combining ChIP-exo, Cappable-seq, and RNA-seq confirmed that SgaCD activates each of the 18 AcaCD-responsive promoters driving the expression of the plasmid transfer functions. A comprehensive analysis of the activity of the complete set of AcaCD-responsive promoters in both SGI1 and IncC plasmid was performed through reporter assays. qPCR and flow cytometry assays revealed that SgaCD is essential for the excision and replication of SGI1, and the destabilisation of the helper IncC plasmid.",

    "abstract": "Clinical genetic testing readily detects germline genetic variants. Yet, the evidence available for variant classification as benign or pathogenic is often limited by the rarity of individual variants, leading to many \"variant of uncertain significance\" (VUS) classifications. VUS cannot guide clinical decisions, complicating counseling and management. Laboratory assays can potentially aid reclassification, but require benchmarking against variants with definitive interpretations to have sufficient predictive power for clinical use. Of all clinically identified germline variants in hereditary breast cancer gene PALB2 (Partner and Localizer of BRCA2), ~50% are VUS and ~90% of VUS are missense. Truncating PALB2 variants have homologous recombination (HR) defects and instead rely on error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) for DNA damage repair (DDR). Recent reports show some missense PALB2 variants may also be damaging, but thus far functional studies have lacked benchmarking controls. Using the Traffic Light Reporter (TLR) to quantify cellular HR and NHEJ using fluorescent markers, we assessed variant-level DDR capacity in hereditary breast cancer genes. We first determined the TLRs dynamic range using BRCA2 missense variants of known significance as benchmarks for normal/abnormal HR function. We then tested 37 PALB2 variants, generating functional data for germline PALB2 variants at a moderate level of evidence for a pathogenic interpretation (PS3_moderate) for 8 variants, or a supporting level of evidence in favor of a benign interpretation (BS3_supporting) for 13 variants, based on the ability of the assay to correctly classify PALB2 validation controls. This new data can be applied in subsequent variant interpretations for direct clinical benefit.",

    "abstract": "Animals display characteristic behavioral patterns when performing a task, such as the spiraling of a soaring bird or the surge-and-cast of a male moth searching for a female. Identifying such recurring sequences occurring rarely in noisy behavioral data is key to understanding the behavioral response to a distributed stimulus in unrestrained animals. Existing models seek to describe the dynamics of behavior or segment individual locomotor episodes rather than to identify the rare and transient sequences of locomotor episodes that make up the behavioral response. To fill this gap, we develop a lexical, hierarchical model of behavior. We designed an unsupervised algorithm called \"BASS\" to efficiently identify and segment recurring behavioral action sequences transiently occurring in long behavioral recordings. When applied to navigating larval zebrafish, BASS extracts a dictionary of remarkably long, non-Markovian sequences consisting of repeats and mixtures of slow forward and turn bouts. Applied to a novel chemotaxis assay, BASS uncovers chemotactic strategies deployed by zebrafish to avoid aversive cues consisting of sequences of fast large-angle turns and burst swims. In a simulated dataset of soaring gliders climbing thermals, BASS finds the spiraling patterns characteristic of soaring behavior. In both cases, BASS succeeds in identifying rare action sequences in the behavior deployed by freely moving animals. BASS can be easily incorporated into the pipelines of existing behavioral analyses across diverse species, and even more broadly used as a generic algorithm for pattern recognition in low-dimensional sequential data.",

Yet, the cerebellum is reciprocally connected to two main players of motor learning, the motor cortex and the basal ganglia, via the ventral and midline thalamus respectively. Here, we evaluated the contribution of cerebellar neurons projecting to these thalamic nuclei in a skilled locomotion task in mice. In the cerebellar nuclei, we found task-specific neuronal activities during the task, and lasting changes after the task suggesting an offline processing of task-related information. Using pathway-specific inhibition, we found that dentate neurons projecting to the midline thalamus contribute to learning and retrieval, while interposed neurons projecting to the ventral thalamus contribute to the offline consolidation of savings. Our results thus show that two parallel cerebello-thalamic pathways perform distinct computations operating on distinct timescales in motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) represent the most common non-standard nucleotides found in the genomic DNA of cells. The distribution of rNMPs in DNA has been studied only in limited genomes, such as yeast nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, as well as human mitochondrial DNA. In this study, we used the ribose-seq protocol and the Ribose-Map bioinformatics toolkit to reveal the distribution of rNMPs incorporated into the whole genome of a photosynthetic unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The study presents the discovery of a disproportionate incorporation of adenosine in the mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA, in contrast to the nuclear DNA, relative to the nucleotide content of these C. reinhardtii genomes. Our results demonstrate that the rNMP content in the DNA of the algal organelles reflects an elevated ATP level present in the algal cells. In addition, we reveal specific rNMP biases and patterns in the mitochondrial, chloroplast and nuclear DNA of C. reinhardtii.",

    "abstract": "The cell cycle is an ordered process in which cells replicate their DNA in S-phase and divide them into two identical daughter cells in mitosis. DNA replication takes place only once per cell cycle to preserve genome integrity, which is tightly regulated by Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK). Formation of the pre-replicative complex, a platform for origin licensing, is inhibited through CDK-dependent phosphorylation. Failure of this control leads to re-licensing, re-replication and DNA damage. Eukaryotic cells have evolved surveillance mechanisms to maintain genome integrity, termed cell cycle checkpoints. It has been shown that the DNA damage checkpoint is activated upon the induction of DNA re-replication and arrests cell cycle in mitosis in S. cerevisiae. In this study, we show that PP2A-Cdc55 is responsible for the metaphase arrest induced by DNA re-replication, leading to dephosphorylation of APC component, Exclusion of Cdc55 from the nucleus bypassed the mitotic arrest and resulted in enhanced cell lethality in re-replicating cells. The metaphase arrest in re-replication cells was retained in the absence of Mad2, a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Moreover, re-replicating cells showed the same rate of DNA damage induction in the presence or absence of Cdc55. These results indicate that PP2A-Cdc55 maintains metaphase arrest upon DNA re-replication and DNA damage through APC inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is central to prokaryotic evolution. However, little is known about the \"scale\" of individual HGT events. In this work, we introduce the first computational framework to help answer the following fundamental question: How often does more than one gene get horizontally transferred in a single HGT event? Our method, called HoMer, uses phylogenetic reconciliation to infer single-gene HGT events across a given set of species/strains, employs several techniques to account for inference error and uncertainty, combines that information with gene order information from extant genomes, and uses statistical analysis to identify candidate horizontal multi-gene transfers (HMGTs) in both extant and ancestral species/strains. HoMer is highly scalable and can be easily used to infer HMGTs across hundreds of genomes.\n\nWe apply HoMer to a genome-scale dataset of over 22000 gene families from 103 Aeromonas genomes and identify a large number of plausible HMGTs of various scales at both small and large phylogenetic distances. Analysis of these HMGTs reveals interesting relationships between gene function, phylogenetic distance, and frequency of multi-gene transfer. Among other insights, we find that (i) the relative frequency of HMGT increases as divergence between genomes increases, (ii) HMGTs often have conserved gene functions, and (iii) rare genes are frequently acquired through HMGT. We also analyze in detail HMGTs involving the zonula occludens toxin and type III secretion systems. By enabling the systematic inference of HMGTs on a large scale, HoMer will facilitate a more accurate and more complete understanding of HGT and microbial evolution.",

    "abstract": "There is an abundance of malaria genetic data being collected from the field, yet using this data to understand features of regional epidemiology remains a challenge. A key issue is the lack of models that relate parasite genetic diversity to epidemiological parameters. Classical models in population genetics characterize changes in genetic diversity in relation to demographic parameters, but fail to account for the unique features of the malaria life cycle. In contrast, epidemiological models, such as the Ross-Macdonald model, capture malaria transmission dynamics but do not consider genetics. Here, we have developed an integrated model encompassing both parasite evolution and regional epidemiology. We achieve this by combining the Ross-Macdonald model with an intra-host continuous-time Moran model, thus explicitly representing the evolution of individual parasite genomes in a traditional epidemiological framework. Implemented as a stochastic simulation, we use the model to explore relationships between measures of parasite genetic diversity and parasite prevalence, a widely-used metric of transmission intensity. First, we explore how varying parasite prevalence influences genetic diversity at equilibrium. We find that multiple genetic diversity statistics are correlated with prevalence, but the strength of the relationships depends on whether variation in prevalence is driven by host- or vector-related factors. Next, we assess the responsiveness of a variety of statistics to malaria control interventions, finding that those related to mixed infections respond quickly (~ months) whereas other statistics, such as nucleotide diversity, may take decades to respond. These findings provide insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with using genetic data to monitor malaria epidemiology.\n\nAuthor summaryKnowledge of how the prevalence of P.falciparum malaria varies, either between regions or through time, is critical to the operation of malaria control programs. Yet obtaining this information through traditional methods is fraught with challenges. Parasite genetic data is increasingly accessible, and may provide an alternative means to estimate P.falciparum prevalence in the field. However, our understanding of how the genetic diversity of parasite populations relates to prevalence is limited, and suitable models to guide our understanding are largely lacking. Here, we merge two classical models - the Ross-Macondald and the Moran - to produce a framework in which the relationships between parasite genetic diversity and prevalence can be explored. We find that several genetic diversity statistics are correlated with prevalence, although to differing degrees, and over different time scales. Overall, statistics related to mixed infection are robustly and rapidly responsive to changes in prevalence, suggesting they may be a useful focal point for the development of malaria surveillance methods that harness genetic data.",

    "abstract": "Comparative functional genomic studies have shown that differences in gene expression between species can often be explained by corresponding inter-species differences in genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. In the quest to understand gene regulatory evolution in primates, the role of co-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative polyadenylation (APA), have so far received little attention. To begin addressing this gap, we studied APA in lymphoblastoid cell lines from six humans and six chimpanzees, and estimated usage for 44,432 polyadenylation sites (PAS) in 9,518 genes in both species. While APA is largely conserved in humans and chimpanzees, we identified 1,705 genes with significantly different PAS usage (FDR of 0.05) between the two species. We found that genes with divergent APA patterns are enriched among differentially expressed genes, as well as among genes that show differences in protein translation between species. In particular, differences in APA between humans and chimpanzees can explain a subset of observed inter-species protein expression differences that do not display corresponding differences at the transcript level. Finally, we focused on genes that have a dominant PAS, namely a PAS that is used more often than all others. Dominant PAS are highly conserved, and inter-species differences in dominant PAS are particularly enriched for genes that also show expression differences between the species. This study establishes APA as another key mechanism underlying the genetic regulation of transcript and protein expression levels in primates.",

    "abstract": "The generation of engineered models of the osteochondral complex to study its pathologies and develop possible treatments is hindered by the distinctly different properties of articular cartilage and subchondral bone, with the latter characterized by vascularization. In vitro models of the osteochondral complex have been mainly engineered as biphasic constructs containing just cartilage and bone cells, a condition very dissimilar from the in vivo environment. The different cellular components of the osteochondral complex are governed by interacting biochemical signaling; hence, to study the crosstalk among chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells, we have developed a novel triphasic model of the osteochondral tissue interface. Wet-spun poly({varepsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds in combination with a methacrylated gelatin (gelMA) hydrogel were used as the polymeric backbone of the constructs. The scaffold components were engineered with human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and differentiated using a dual chamber microphysiological system (MPS) bioreactor that allows the simultaneous, separate flow of media of different compositions for induced differentiation of each compartment towards a cartilaginous or osseous lineage. Within the engineered Microphysiological Vascularized Osteochondral System (microVOCS), hMSCs showed spatially distinct chondrogenic and osteogenic markers in terms of histology and gene expression. HUVECs formed a stable capillary-like network in the engineered bone compartment and enhanced both chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, resulting in the generation of an in vitro system that mimics a vascularized osteochondral interface tissue.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of multiple cellular pathways and play a key role in the development and progression of tumor. Based on the cellular function of their targets, miRNAs play the role of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Multiple studies have shown that abnormal expression of miRNAs has close relation with the incidence of HCC, but the mechanism of miRNAs in HCC still needs further research. In the present study, we showed that the overexpression of miR-224 can reduce the mRNA and protein expression of ADAM17 and HOXA5, the silencing of miR-224 can increase the protein expression of ADAM17 and HOXA5. Dual luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-224 can directly regulate the expression of ADAM17 and HOXA5. Importantly, we found that miR-224 positively regulates cell migration and invasion in HCC, miR-224 overexpression can promote the migration and invasion of BEL-7402 cell, and miR-224 silencing can suppress the migration and invasion of BEL-7402 cell. miR-224 overexpression can result in the redistribution of cell cycle, the cell percentage of S phase was increased significantly, the cell percentage of G1 phase was decreased significantly, and there is no noticeable change for the cell percentage of G2 phase. These results demonstrated that it may be exert the function of oncogenes in a particular link of cancer cell growth. In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-224 will become a promising biological target in the treatment strategy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).",

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of rapamycin and platelet factor-4 toward breast carcinoma at the proteomic and genomic levels. A total of 60 N-Methyl-N-Nitrosourea-induced rat breast carcinomas were treated with rapamycin, platelet factor-4, and rapamycin+platelet factor-4. The tumors were subsequently subjected to immunohistological protein analysis and polymerase chain reaction gene analysis. Protein analysis was performed using a semi-quantitative scoring method, while the mRNA expression levels were analyzed based on the relative expression ratio. There was a significant difference in the protein and mRNA expression levels for the selected markers. In the rapamycin+platelet factor-4 treated group, the Flt-4 marker was downregulated, whereas there were no differences in the expression levels of other markers, such as Flt-1 and Flk-1. On the other hand, platelet factor-4 did not exhibit a superior angiogenic inhibiting ability in this study. Rapamycin is a potent anti-angiogenic drug; however, platelet factor-4 proved to be a less effective drug of anti-angiogenesis on rat breast carcinoma model.",

In order to better understand the molecular changes that occur with age, we measured mRNA and protein levels in 188 genetically diverse mice at ages 6, 12, and 18 months. We observed distinctive change in mRNA and protein levels as a function of age. Changes in both mRNA and protein are associated with increased immune infiltration and decreases in mitochondrial function. Proteins show a greater extent of change and reveal changes in a wide array of biological processes including unique, organ-specific features of aging in kidney. Most importantly, we observed functionally important age-related changes in protein that occur in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA. Our findings suggest that mRNA profiling alone provides an incomplete picture of molecular aging in the kidney and that examination of changes in proteins is essential to understand aging processes that are not transcriptionally regulated.",

A fifth M. ulcerans 19423 strain stained negative in DDD and slowly regrew in 27 days. Three tested M. ulcerans strains yielded microcalorimetric pattern similar to that of the negative (dead) homologous controls, differing from that of the homologous positive (replicative) controls. The relevance of these experimental observations, suggesting a previously unreported dormancy state of M. ulcerans, needs to be investigated in the natural ecological niches where M. ulcerans thrive and in Buruli ulcer lesions.\n\nAuthor summaryMycobacterium ulcerans is an environmental opportunistic pathogen of mammals and humans, causing a subcutaneous necrotizing infection named Buruli ulcer. Molecular detection of M. ulcerans DNA revealed different ecological niches where M. ulcerans may thrive, but the molecular biology approach does not catch the physiological state of M. ulcerans in these different ecological niches. Thus, the reservoir and the mode of transmission of M. ulcerans remain elusive. Here, we investigated experimental dormancy of M. ulcerans by using a previously described Wayne model of dormancy coupled with microscopy using DDD staining, microcalorimetry and subculture. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that some M. ulcerans strains exhibit a physiological state of dormancy; potentially limiting isolation and culture of M. ulcerans from environmental niches.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs of June 30, 2020, Malaysia had confirmed 8,639 cases of COVID-19. About 39% of these were associated with a religious mass gathering event held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 1, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysias main wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to understand the molecular epidemiology.\n\nMethodsWe obtained whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 58 COVID-19 patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 50 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Malaysian lineage B.6 sequences were further analysed with all available worldwide lineage B.6 sequences.\n\nResultsNine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the mass gathering and became predominant (63%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) among available global sequences. Increases in reported cases and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly associated with travel and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally-correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. We also report the presence of a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences which has associated with reduced sensitivity in a commercial assay.\n\nConclusionLineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the region.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia was driven mainly by transmission following a religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of February. To study the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia, we analysed 50 available and 58 newly-generated Malaysian whole genome virus sequences. We found that lineage B.6, rare (1.4%) globally, first appeared after the mass gathering and became the most predominant (62.9%) in Malaysia. Increases in COVID-19 cases and locally-acquired B.6 strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 viruses were mainly associated with travel and showed limited spread. Increases in B.6 viruses in Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia were linked to participants returning from this mass gathering. Altogether, 95.3% of global B.6 sequences originated in Asia or Australia. We also report a mutation in the virus nsP3 gene found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences and associated with reduced detection by a commercial diagnostic test. In conclusion, the religious mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur was associated with the main wave of COVID-19 cases of predominantly B.6 lineage in Malaysia, and subsequent spread of B.6 viruses regionally. Genome sequence data provides valuable insight into virus spread and is important for monitoring continued accuracy of diagnostic kits.",

    "abstract": "ContextAvailable molecular epidemiological data from recent studies suggest significant genetic variation between the different phylogenetic lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and the MTBC lineages might have adapted to different human populations\n\nAimThis study sought to determine the phylogenetic population structure of clinical MTBC isolates from the Volta Region of Ghana.\n\nMethodsThe MTBC isolates obtained from collected sputum samples were characterized by standard methods. Non-tuberculous mycobacterial isolates were characterized by amplification of the heat shock protein 65 (hsp65) gene and sequencing. The drug susceptibility profiles of the MTBCs determined using GenoType MTBDRplus\n\nResultsOne hundred and seventeen (117, 93.6%) out of 125 mycobacterial positive isolates were characterized as members of the MTBC of which M. tuberculosis sensu stricto (MTBss) and M. africanum (Maf) were respectively 94 (80.3%) and 23 (19.7%). In all, 39 distinct spoligotype patterns were obtained; 26 for MTBss and 13 for Maf lineages. Spoligotyping identified 89 (76.04 %) Lineage 4, 16 (13.7 %) Lineage 5, 7 (6.0%) Lineage 6, 3 (2.6%) Lineage 2, 1(0.9%) Lineage 3 and 1 (0.9%) Lineage 1. Among the Lineage 4 isolates, 62/89 (69.7%) belonged to Cameroon sub-lineage, 13 (14.6%) Ghana, 8 (9.0%) Haarlem, 2 (2.2%) LAM, 1 (1.1%) Uganda I, 1 (1.1%) X and the remaining two were orphan. Significant localization of Maf was found within the Ho municipality (n=13, 29.5%) compared to the more cosmopolitan Ketu-South/Aflao (n=3, 8.3%) (p-value= 0.017). Eight (8) non-tuberculous mycobacteria were characterized as M. abscessus (7) and M. fortuitum (1)\n\nConclusionWe confirmed the importance of M. africanum lineages as a cause of TB in the Volta region of Ghana.\n\nKey MessageThe phylogenetic population structure obtained agrees with previously described prevalence of M. tuberculosis complex phylogenetic lineages from other regions of Ghana. It also confirms the stable prevalence of M. africanum as an important human TB causing pathogen in Ghana.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent increase in interest in indoor air quality regarding mould, there is no single widely accepted standard media for the detection of airborne fungi, nor verification of many commonly used techniques. Commonly used media including malt-extract agar (MEA), Sabouraud dextrose agar (Sab, SDA, SabCG), potato dextrose agar (PDA) with and without antibiotics chloramphenicol & gentamycin (CG) were compared for their suitability in detecting a range of common airborne fungi by collecting 150 L outdoor air on a number of different days and seasons via an Anderson 400-hole sampler in suburban Melbourne, Australia. There was relatively little variation in mean numbers of colony forming units (CFU) and types of fungi recovered between MEA, PDA, SabCG media groups relative to variation within each group. There was a significant difference between SabCG, Dichloran-18% glycerol (DG18) and V8(R) Original juice agar media, however. Antibiotics reliably prevented the growth of bacteria that typically interfered with the growth and appearance of fungal colonies. There was no significant evidence for a growth enhancing factor from potato, mineral supplements or various vegetable juices. Differing glucose concentrations had modest effects, showing a vague ideal at 2%-4% with peptone. Sanitisation/sterilisation of the aluminium Andersen 400-hole sampler top-plate by flame is possible, but not strictly required nor advisable. The use of SabCG as a standard medium was generally supported.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDengue is one of the newest emerging diseases in Nepal with increasing burden and geographic spread over the last 14 years. The main objective of this study was to explore the spatio-temporal epidemiological patterns of Dengue since its first report (2006) till 2019 in Nepal.\n\nMethodsThis study is a retrospective analysis of dengue data available from the Epidemiological Disease Control Division (EDCD) of Government of Nepal. The data in this study cover the last 14 years (2006-2019) of reported dengue cases in Nepal. Epidemiological trend and spatio-temporal analyses were performed. Maps of reported case incidence were created using QGIS version 3.4.\n\nResultsSince the first report of dengue in a foreigner in 2004, Nepal reported a total of 17,992 dengue cases in 68 districts of Nepal in 2019. The incidence was approximately five times higher in 2018 (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR): 4.8; 95% CI: 1.5 - 15.3) and over 140 times higher in 2019 (IRR: 141.6; CI: 45.8 - 438.4). Population density was not a statistically significant predictor of case incidence. Mean elevation had a negative association with case incidence. A one standard deviation increase in elevation was associated with a 90% decrease in reported case incidence (IRR: 0.10; CI: 0.01 - 0.20). However, the association with mean elevation varied across the years. In comparison to 2016, incidence was greater at higher elevations in 2018 (IRR: 22.7; CI: 6.0 - 86.1) and 2019 (IRR: 9.6; CI: 2.6 - 36.1).\n\nConclusionThere is a high risk of dengue outbreak in the Terai region with increasing spread towards the mid-mountains and beyond as seen over the last 14 years. Urgent measures are required to increase the availability of diagnostics and resources to mitigate future dengue epidemics. Findings from this study can inform the spatio-temporal distribution of dengue and can help in resource allocation and priority setting for future epidemic.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue in humans is caused by four different serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 & DENV-4). Globally it is the most pervasive vector borne diseases with increasing number of cases in recent years. Dengue is one of the youngest emerging diseases in Nepal with increasing cases and spread from the tropical lowland to the highland (hilly) regions. We conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of national data to consolidate the information using QGIS to measure the dengue incidence at district levels of Nepal. Spatio-temporal analysis exploring the incidence and distribution of dengue cases aids in identification of high-risk areas which can ultimately enable national dengue programme to mobilize and allocate resources for the control and treatment. This study shows, the persistent high risk of dengue outbreak in lowland Terai region with annual rise in the risk of spread towards the mid-mountains and beyond. Urgent measures are required to increase the diagnostics and resources to mitigate the epidemic burden of dengue in Terai and peripheral regions.",

    "abstract": "miR-92a miRNAs are immune molecules that regulate apoptosis (programmed cell death) during the immune response. Apoptosis helps to maintain the dynamic balance in tissues of fish under hypoxia stress. The aim of this study was to explore the role and potential mechanisms of miR-92a in the liver of tilapia under hypoxia stress. We first confirmed that CaSR (encoding a calcium-sensing receptor) is a target gene of miR-92a in genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) using luciferase reporter gene assays. In GIFT under hypoxia stress, miR-92a was up-regulated and CaSR was down-regulated in a time-dependent manner. Knocked-down CaSR expression led to inhibited expression of p53, TP53INP1 and caspase-3/8, reduced the proportion of apoptotic hepatocytes, and decreased the activity of calcium ions induced by hypoxia in hepatocytes. GIFT injected in the tail vein with an miR-92a agomir showed up-regulation of miR-92a and down-regulation of CaSR, p53, TP53INP1, and caspase-3/8 genes in the liver, resulting in lower serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities under hypoxia stress. These findings suggest that stimulation of miR-92a interferes with hypoxia-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes of GIFT by targeting CaSR, thereby alleviating liver damage. These results provide new insights into the adaptation mechanisms of GIFT to hypoxia stress.",
