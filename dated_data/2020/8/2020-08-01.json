    "abstract": "Current methods for comparing scRNA-seq datasets collected in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state space, such as clusters of cells. Here, we quantify the effects of perturbations at the single-cell level using a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation across the transcriptomic space. We describe this space as a manifold and develop a relative likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental conditions using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used to identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm to identify clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition is on average 57% higher than the next best-performing algorithm tested. Gene signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate compared to six alternative algorithms in ground-truth comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Human cognition exhibits a striking degree of variability: Sometimes we rapidly forge new associations whereas at other times new information simply does not stick. Correlations between neural activity during encoding and subsequent retrieval performance have implicated such \"subsequent memory effects\" (SMEs) as important for understanding the neural basis of memory formation. Uncontrolled variability in external factors that also predict memory performance, however, confounds the interpretation of these effects. By controlling for a comprehensive set of external variables, we investigated the extent to which neural correlates of successful memory encoding reflect variability in endogenous brain states. We show that external variables that reliably predict memory performance have relatively small effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of successful memory encoding. Instead, the brain activity that is diagnostic of successful encoding primarily reflects fluctuations in endogenous neural activity. These findings link neural activity during learning to endogenous states that drive variability in human cognition.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxin systems are found in many bacterial chromosomes and plasmids with roles ranging from plasmid stabilization to biofilm formation and persistence. In these systems, the expression/activity of the toxin is counteracted by an antitoxin, which in type I systems is an antisense-RNA. While the regulatory mechanisms of these systems are mostly well-defined, the toxins biological activity and expression conditions are less understood. Here, these questions were investigated for a type I toxin-antitoxin system (AapA1-IsoA1) expressed from the chromosome of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori. We show that expression of the AapA1 toxin in H. pylori causes growth arrest associated with rapid morphological transformation from spiral-shaped bacteria to round coccoid cells. Coccoids are observed in patients and during in vitro growth as a response to different stress conditions. The AapA1 toxin, first molecular effector of coccoids to be identified, targets H. pylori inner membrane without disrupting it, as visualized by Cryo-EM. The peptidoglycan composition of coccoids is modified with respect to spiral bacteria. No major changes in membrane potential or ATP concentration result from AapA1 expression, suggesting coccoid viability. Single-cell live microscopy tracking the shape conversion suggests a possible association of this process with cell elongation/division interference. Oxidative stress induces coccoid formation and is associated with repression of the antitoxin promoter and enhanced processing of its transcript, leading to an imbalance in favor of AapA1 toxin expression.\n\nOur data support the hypothesis of viable coccoids with characteristics of dormant bacteria that might be important in H. pylori infections refractory to treatment.\n\nSignificance StatementHelicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen causing 800,000 deaths in the world annually, is encountered both in vitro and in patients as spiral-shaped bacteria and as round cells named coccoids. We discovered that the toxin from a chromosomal type I toxin-antitoxin system is targeting H. pylori membrane and acting as an effector of H. pylori morphological conversion to coccoids. We showed that these round cells maintain their membrane integrity and metabolism, strongly suggesting that they are viable dormant bacteria. Oxidative stress was identified as a signal inducing toxin expression and coccoid formation. Our findings reveal new insights into a form of dormancy of this bacterium that might be associated with H. pylori infections refractory to treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study is part of a larger attempt to explore how the brain produces conscious experience. Our main objective here was to take advantage of a neural signature conveyed by the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) technique (1) to explore the extent to which complex visual images can be processed in the absence of consciousness and (2) to determine whether this tool can be used to shed light on participants phenomenal experience of these images. To this end, we embedded faces within sequences of non-face stimuli and manipulated their contrast to create a subliminal condition. Our results were threefold. First, we show that a significant brain activation can be delineated with the SSVEP tool even when participants report being unable to see the stimuli. In this subliminal condition, the brain response was confined to the back of the scalp. Second, we observe that the face signal increases in magnitude and propagates bilaterally along a posterior-to-anterior axis as image contrast increases. Third, we suggest that SSVEP could be used as a novel instance of a no-report paradigm because it requires no overt behavioural response, and because at some contrast levels and electrodes, its outputs (signal magnitude and scalp topography) predict peoples self-reported phenomenal experience.",

We sought to establish the heritability of plasma NAEs (including the endocannabinoid anandamide) and CERs, and identify common DNA variants influencing the circulating concentrations of the heritable lipid species. Nine NAE and sixteen CER species were analysed in plasma samples from 999 members of 196 British Caucasian families, using targeted mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Heritability was estimated and GWAS analyses were undertaken; all target lipids were significantly heritable (h2 = 36%-62%). A missense variant (rs324420) in the gene encoding the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which degrades NAEs, associated at GWAS significance (P<2.15x10-8) with four NAEs (DHEA, PEA, LEA, VEA). The A allele of this SNP was associated with a 0.23 SD per-allele increase in plasma NAE species. Additionally, we found association between rs680379 in the SPTLC3 gene, which encodes a subunit of the rate limiting enzyme in CER biosynthesis, and a range of CER species (e.g. CER[N(24)S(19)]; P =4.82x10-27). We also observed three novel associations (CD83, SGPP1, FBXO28-DEGS1) influencing plasma CER traits, two of which (SGPP1 and DEGS1) implicate CER species in haematological phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Environmental fluctuations can mediate coexistence between competing species via the storage effect. This fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanism requires three conditions: (i) a positive covariance between environment conditions and the strength of competition, (ii) species-specific environmental responses, and (iii) species are less sensitive to competition in environmentally unfavorable years. In serially uncorrelated environments, condition (i) only occurs if favorable environmental conditions immediately and directly increase the strength of competition. For many demographic parameters, this direct link between favorable years and competition may not exist. Moreover, many environmental variables are temporal autocorrelated, but theory has largely focused on serially uncorrelated environments. To address this gap, a model of competing species in autocorrelated environments is analyzed. This analysis shows that positive autocorrelations in demographic rates that increase fitness (e.g. maximal fecundity or adult survival) produce the positive environment-competition covariance. Hence, when these demographic rates contribute to buffered population growth, positive temporal autocorrelations generate a storage effect, otherwise they destabilize competitive interactions. For negatively autocorrelated environments, this theory highlights an alternative stabilizing mechanism that requires three conditions: (i) a negative environmental-competition covariance, (ii) species-specific environmental responses, and (iii) species are less sensitive to competition in more favorable years. When the conditions for either of these stabilizing mechanisms are violated, temporal autocorrelations can generate stochastic priority effects or hasten competitive exclusion. Collectively, these results highlight that temporal autocorrelations in environmental conditions can play a fundamental role in determining ecological outcomes of competing species.",

    "abstract": "Signal interactions in brain network communication have been little studied. We describe how nonlinear collision rules on simulated mammal brain networks can result in sparse activity dynamics characteristic of mammalian neural systems. We tested the effects of collisions in \"information spreading\" (IS) routing models and in standard random walk (RW) routing models. Simulations employed synchronous agents on tracer-based mesoscale mammal connectomes at a range of signal loads. We find that RW models have high average activity that increases with load. Activity in RW models is also densely distributed over nodes: a substantial fraction is highly active in a given time window, and this fraction increases with load. Surprisingly, while IS models make many more attempts to pass signals, they show lower net activity due to collisions compared to RW, and activity in IS increases little as function of load. Activity in IS also shows greater sparseness than RW, and sparseness decreases slowly with load. Results hold on two networks of the monkey cortex and one of the mouse whole-brain. We also find evidence that activity is lower and more sparse for empirical networks compared to degree-matched randomized networks under IS, suggesting that brain network topology supports IS-like routing strategies.",

    "abstract": "Recent biological invasions offer  natural laboratories to understand the genetics and ecology of adaptation, hybridization, and range limits. One of the most impressive and well-documented biological invasions of the 20th century began in 1957 when Apis mellifera scutellata honey bees swarmed out of managed experimental colonies in Brazil. This newly-imported subspecies, native to southern and eastern Africa, both hybridized with and out-competed previously-introduced European honey bee subspecies. Populations of scutellata-European hybrid honey bees rapidly expanded and spread across much of the Americas in less than 50 years. We use broad geographic sampling and whole genome sequencing of over 300 bees to map the distribution of scutellata ancestry where the northern and southern invasions have presently stalled, forming replicated hybrid zones with European bee populations in California and Argentina. California is much farther from Brazil, yet these hybrid zones occur at very similar latitudes, consistent with the invasion having reached a climate barrier. At these range limits, we observe genome-wide clines for scutellata ancestry, and parallel clines for wing length that span hundreds of kilometers, supporting a smooth transition from climates favoring scutellata-European hybrid bees to climates where they cannot survive winter. We find no large effect loci maintaining exceptionally steep ancestry transitions. Instead, we find most individual loci have concordant ancestry clines across South America, with a build-up of somewhat steeper clines in regions of the genome with low recombination rates, consistent with many loci of small effect contributing to climate-associated fitness trade-offs. Additionally, we find no substantial reductions in genetic diversity associated with rapid expansions nor complete dropout of scutellata ancestry at any individual loci on either continent, which suggests that the competitive fitness advantage of scutellata ancestry at lower latitudes has a polygenic basis and that scutellata-European hybrid bees maintained large population sizes during their invasion. To test for parallel selection across continents, we develop a null model that accounts for drift in ancestry frequencies during the rapid expansion. We identify several peaks within a larger genomic region where selection has pushed scutellata ancestry to high frequency hundreds of kilometers past the present cline centers in both North and South America and that may underlie high-fitness traits driving the invasion.\n\nAuthor SummaryCrop pollination around the world relies on native and introduced honey bee populations, which vary in their behaviors and climatic ranges. Scutellata-European hybrid honey bees (also known as  Africanized honey bees) have been some of the most ecologically successful; originating in a 1950s experimental breeding program in Brazil, they rapidly came to dominate across most of the Americas. As a recent genetic mixture of multiple imported Apis mellifera subspecies, scutellata-European hybrid honey bees have a patchwork of ancestry across their genomes, which we leverage to identify loci with an excess of scutellata or European ancestry due to selection. We additionally use the natural replication in this invasion to compare outcomes between North and South America (California and Argentina). We identify several genomic regions with exceptionally high scutellata ancestry across continents and that may underlie favored scutellata-European hybrid honey bee traits (e.g. Varroa mite resistance). We find evidence that a climatic barrier has dramatically slowed the invasion at similar latitudes on both continents. At the current range limits, scutellata ancestry decreases over hundreds of kilometers, creating many bee populations with intermediate scutellata ancestry proportions that can be used to map the genetic basis of segregating traits (here, wing length) and call into question the biological basis for binary  Africanized vs. European bee classifications.",

How these miRNAs function after the onset of the transcriptome switch to a neuronal fate remains unclear. Here, we identified direct targets of miRNAs by Argonaute (AGO) HITS-CLIP as reprogramming cells activate the neuronal program and reveal the role of miR-124 that directly promotes the expression of its target genes associated with neuronal development and function. The mode of miR-124 as a positive regulator is determined by a neuron-enriched RNA-binding protein, ELAVL3, that interacts with AGO and binds target transcripts, whereas the non-neuronal ELAVL1 counterpart fails to elevate the miRNA-target gene expression. Although existing literature indicate that miRNA-ELAVL1 interaction can result in either target gene upregulation or downregulation in a context-dependent manner, we specifically identified neuronal ELAVL3 as the driver for miRNA target gene upregulation in neurons. In primary human neurons, repressing miR-124 and ELAVL3 led to the downregulation of genes involved in neuronal function and process outgrowth, and cellular phenotypes of reduced inward currents and neurite outgrowth. Results from our study support the role of miR-124 promoting neuronal function through positive regulation of its target genes.",

    "abstract": "MaxEnt is an important aid in understanding the influence of climate change on species distributions and abundance. There is growing interest in using IPCC-class global climate model outputs as environmental predictors in this work. These models provide realistic, global representations of the climate system, projections for hundreds of variables (including Essential Climate Variables), and combine observations from an array of satellite, airborne, and in-situ sensors. Unfortunately, direct use of this important class of data in MaxEnt modeling has been limited by the large size of climate model output collections and the fact that MaxEnt can only operate on a relatively small set of predictors stored in a computers main memory. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a Monte Carlo method that overcomes this limitation by finding a useful subset of predictors in a larger, externally-stored collection of environmental variables in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposed solution takes an ensemble approach wherein many MaxEnt runs, each drawing on a small random subset of variables, converges on a global estimate of the top contributing subset of variables in the larger collection. In preliminary tests, the Monte Carlo approach selected a consistent set of top six variables within 540 runs, with the four most contributory variables of the top six accounting for approximately 93% of overall permutation importance in the final model. These results suggest that a Monte Carlo approach could offer a viable means of selecting environmental predictors for MaxEnt models that is amenable to parallelization and scalable to very large data sets. This point to the possibility of near-real-time multiprocessor implementations that could enable broader and more exploratory use of global climate model outputs in environmental niche modeling and aid in the discovery of viable predictors.",

MALDI-TOF confirmed the molecular weight of ALSP as 10 kDa. I-TASSER predicted the function of ALSP as a lipase, which was confirmed by preliminary in-vitro experiments using amastigotes of L. donovani. ALSP has GAS amino acid sequences, which might act as the active site for its lipase activity. The selective expression of ALSP in amastigotes probably makes it important in virulence mechanisms such as survival in the phagolysosome and modulation of its membrane and other metabolic functions, necessary for parasite survival in the human host. ALSP can act as a peptide vaccine target and maybe detected in the peripheral blood or urine as a molecular biomarker of active disease in visceral leishmaniasis.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in studying microbial diversity is whether there is a species boundary and if the boundary can be delineated by a universal genetic discontinuity. To address this question, Jain et al. computed the pairwise average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 91,761 microbial (bacterial and archaeal) genomes (the 90K genome dataset) and found that the ANI values from the 8 billion comparisons follow a strong bimodal distribution1. The authors concluded that a clear genetic discontinuum and species boundary were evident from the unprecedented large-scale ANI analysis. As a result, the researchers advocated that an ANI of 95% can be used to accurately demarcate all currently named microbial species. While the FastANI program described in the paper is useful, we argue that the papers conclusion of a universal genetic boundary is questionable and resulted from the substantial biased sampling in genome sequencing. We also caution against being overly confident in using 95% ANI for microbial species delineation as the high benchmarks reported in the paper were inflated by using highly redundant genomes.",

Macaque monkeys are excellent non-human primate models, especially for studying neuroscience. Due to the lack of a dataset allowing training of a deep neural network for the macaques markerless motion capture in the naturalistic context, it has been challenging to apply this technology for macaques-based studies. In this study, we created MacaquePose, a novel open dataset with manually labeled body part positions for macaques in naturalistic scenes, consisting of >13,000 images, refined by researchers. We show that the pose estimation performance of an artificial neural network trained with the dataset is close to that of a human-level. The MacaquePose will provide a platform for innovative behavior analysis for non-human primate.",

However, comprehensive analysis of CBMs through metabolic pathway analysis remains a major computational challenge because pathway numbers grow combinatorially with model sizes. Here, we define the minimal pathways (MPs) of a metabolic (sub)network as a subset of its elementary flux vectors. We enumerate or sample them efficiently using iterative minimization and a simple graph representation of MPs. These methods outperform the state of the art and they allow scalable pathway analysis for microbial and mammalian CBMs. Sampling random MPs from Escherichia colis central carbon metabolism in the context of a genome-scale CBM improves predictions of gene importance, and enumerating all minimal exchanges in a host-microbe model of the human gut predicts exchanges of metabolites associated with host-microbiota homeostasis and human health. MPs thereby open up new possibilities for the detailed analysis of large-scale metabolic networks.",

    "abstract": "1Balancing selection is an important adaptive mechanism underpinning a wide range of phenotypes. Despite its relevance, the detection of recent balancing selection from genomic data is challenging as its signatures are qualitatively similar to those left by ongoing positive selection. In this study we developed and implemented two deep neural networks and tested their performance to predict loci under recent selection, either due to balancing selection or incomplete sweep, from population genomic data. Specifically, we generated forward-in-time simulations to train and test an artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). ANN received as input multiple summary statistics calculated on the locus of interest, while CNN was applied directly on the matrix of haplotypes. We found that both architectures have high accuracy to identify loci under recent selection. CNN generally outperformed ANN to distinguish between signals of balancing selection and incomplete sweep and was less affected by incorrect training data. We deployed both trained networks on neutral genomic regions in European populations and demonstrated a lower false positive rate for CNN than ANN. We finally deployed CNN within the MEFV gene region and identified several common variants predicted to be under incomplete sweep in a European population. Notably, two of these variants are functional changes and could modulate susceptibility to Familial Mediterranean Fever, possibly as a consequence of past adaptation to pathogens. In conclusion, deep neural networks were able to characterise signals of selection on intermediate-frequency variants, an analysis currently inaccessible by commonly used strategies.",

    "abstract": "The disruption of mitochondrial dynamics has detrimental consequences for mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis and leads to the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a quality control mechanism that adjusts cellular metabolism and restores homeostasis. To identify genes involved in the induction of UPRmt in response to a block in mitochondrial fusion, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Caenorhabditis elegans mutants lacking the gene fzo-1, which encodes the ortholog of mammalian Mitofusin. We find that approximately 90% of the 299 suppressors and 86 enhancers identified are conserved in humans and that one third of the conserved genes have been implicated in human disease. Furthermore, many of the 385 genes have roles in developmental processes, which suggests that mitochondrial function and the response to stress are defined during development and maintained throughout life. In addition, we find that enhancers are predominantly  mitochondrial genes and suppressors  non-mitochondrial genes, which indicates that the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis has evolved as a critical cellular function that when disrupted can be compensated for by a variety of cellular processes. Our analysis of  non-mitochondrial enhancers and  mitochondrial suppressors suggests that organellar contact sites, especially between ER and mitochondria, are of importance for mitochondrial homeostasis. Finally, we uncovered several genes involved in IP3 signaling that modulate UPRmt in fzo-1 mutants, found a potential link between pre-mRNA splicing and UPRmt activation and identified the Miga-1/2 ortholog K01D12.6 as required for mitochondrial dynamics in C. elegans.",

Synapse loss correlates with cognitive impairment and may occur independently of the extent of AD pathology. To understand how synaptic composition is changed in relation to AD neuropathology and cognition, highly sensitive multiplexed liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry was used to quantify biochemically enriched synaptic proteins from the parietal association cortex of 100 subjects with contrasting AD pathology and cognitive performance. Functional analysis showed preservation of synaptic signaling, ion transport, and mitochondrial proteins in normal aged and \"resilient\" (cognitively unimpaired with AD pathology) individuals. Compared to these individuals, those with cognitive impairment showed significant metabolic differences and increased immune- and inflammatory-related proteins, establishing the synapse as a potential integration point for multiple AD pathophysiologies.",

Recent studies also observe cortical tracking of higher-level linguistic units, such as words and phrases, using synthesized speech deprived of delta-band acoustic envelope. It remains unclear, however, how cortical activity jointly encodes the acoustic and linguistic information in natural speech. Here, we investigate the neural encoding of words and demonstrate that delta-band cortical activity tracks the rhythm of multi-syllabic words when naturally listening to narratives. Furthermore, by dissociating the word rhythm from acoustic envelope, we find cortical activity primarily tracks the word rhythm during speech comprehension. When listeners attention is diverted, however, neural tracking of words diminishes, and delta-band activity becomes phase locked to the acoustic envelope. These results suggest that large-scale cortical dynamics in the delta band are primarily coupled to the rhythm of linguistic units during natural speech comprehension.",

    "abstract": "For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized reagents used to detect the rhinovirus-specific CD4+ cells, MHCII tetramers, were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead  left out to serve as a test of whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4+ T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by [&ge;]95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots containing virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either prior to infection (Day 0) or after clearing the infection (Day 28). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to understand the origin, transmission, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, which relies on close surveillance of genomic diversity in clinical samples. Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining unbiased genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples.\n\nMethodsEighteen time series fecal samples were collected from nine COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method with different rounds of hybridization.\n\nResultsBy examining the sequencing depth, genome coverage, and allele frequency change, we demonstrated the impeccable performance of the hybrid capture method in samples with Ct value < 34, as well as significant improvement comparing to direct metatranscriptomic sequencing in samples with lower viral loads. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed different frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. Moreover, the evolving of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was still viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period.\n\nConclusionsThe hybrid capture method enables reliable analyses of inter- and intra-host variants of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which changed dramatically in the gastrointestinal tract; its clinical relevance warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial--mesenchymal transition (EMT) drives cellular movements during development to create specialized tissues and structures in metazoans, using mechanisms often coopted during metastasis. Neural crest cells are a multipotent stem cell population that undergo a developmentally regulated EMT and are prone to metastasis in the adult, providing an excellent model to study cell state changes and mechanisms underlying EMT. A hallmark of neural crest EMT during avian development is temporally restricted expression followed by rapid down-regulation of the Wnt antagonist Draxin. Using live RNA imaging, here we demonstrate that rapid clearance of Draxin transcripts is mediated post-transcriptionally via localization to processing bodies (P-bodies), small cytoplasmic granules which are established sites of RNA processing. Contrasting with recent work in immortalized cell lines suggesting that P-bodies are sites of storage rather than degradation, we show that targeted decay of Draxin occurs within P-bodies during neural crest migration. Furthermore, P-body disruption via DDX6 knockdown inhibits not only endogenous Draxin down-regulation but also neural crest EMT in vivo. Together, our data highlight a novel and important role for P-bodies in an intact organismal context--controlling a developmental EMT program via post-transcriptional target degradation.",

Three consecutive treatments increased the percentage of mutations to 50%. The PRIME editing technique was also used to insert specific point mutations in exons 9 and 35 of the DMD gene coding for the dystrophin gene and which is mutated in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Up to 10% desired mutations of the DMD gene were obtained. Three repeated treatments increased the percentage of specific mutations to 16%. Given that there are thousands of nuclei inside a human muscle fiber and that the dystrophin nuclear domain is about 500 m, this level of modifications would be sufficient to produce a phenotype improvement in DMD patients.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas putida S12 is intrinsically solvent-tolerant and constitutes a promising platform for biobased production of aromatic compounds and biopolymers. The genome of P. putida S12 consists of a 5.8 Mbp chromosome, and a 580 kbp megaplasmid pTTS12 that carries several gene clusters involved in solvent tolerance. Removal of pTTS12 caused a significant reduction in solvent tolerance. In this study, we succeeded in restoring solvent tolerance in plasmid-cured P. putida S12 using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE), underscoring the innate solvent-tolerance of this strain.\n\nWhole genome sequencing revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a mobile element insertion, enabling ALE-derived strains to survive and sustain growth in the presence of a high toluene concentration (10% v/v). Mutations were identified in an RND efflux pump regulator arpR, resulting in constitutive upregulation of the multifunctional efflux pump ArpABC. SNPs were also found in the intergenic region and subunits of ATP synthase, RNA polymerase subunit {beta}, global two-component regulatory system (GacA/GacS) and a putative AraC-family transcriptional regulator Afr. RNA-seq analysis further revealed a constitutive down-regulation of energy consuming activities in ALE-derived strains, including flagellar assembly, F0F1 ATP synthase, and membrane transport proteins. Out results indicate that constitutive expression of an alternative solvent extrusion pump in combination with high metabolic flexibility ensures restoration of solvent-tolerance in P. putida S12 lacking its megaplasmid.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is recognized as one of the \"critical\" pathogens by the World Health Organisation (WHO) due to its unprecedented ability to acquire resistance genes and undergo genetic modifications. Carbapenem classes of antibiotics are considered as the \"drugs of choice\" against A. baumannii infections, although increasing incidence of carbapenem resistant isolates have greatly limited their efficacy in clinical settings. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of multi-drug tolerance or persistence exhibited by A. baumannii has further led to therapeutic failure of carbapenems against chronic and recurring infections. Exploring the underlying mechanisms of persistence hosted by the nosocomial pathogen, A. baumannii can facilitate the development of effective anti-persister strategies against them. Accordingly, this study investigates the characteristics and mechanisms responsible for meropenem induced persistence in A. baumannii. Furthermore, it describes the adaptation of a screening strategy for identification of potent anti-persister compounds that cumulatively act by targeting the A. baumannii membrane, inhibiting antibiotic efflux and inducing oxidative stress mediated killing. The screen identified the phytochemical compound, thymol to display excellent activity against persisters of mechanically distinct antibiotics. While meropenem exposed A. baumannii persisters exhibited multi-drug tolerance and indicated the ability to enter a Viable But Non Culturable (VBNC) state, thymol efficiently eradicated all persister cells, irrespective of their culturability. Thymol exhibited no propensity for resistance generation and also inhibited persisters of other Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Collectively, our results establish thymol to have immense potential to act either alone or as an adjunct in combination therapies against persistent infections.\n\nIMPORTANCEApart from the global catastrophe of antibiotic resistance, the phenomenon of \"antibiotic tolerance\" exhibited by a subpopulation of bacterial cells known as \"persisters\" ensue a major clinical threat. Eradication of the persister populations holds extreme importance for an improved long-term recovery from chronic and recurring bacterial infections. This study addresses the problem of antibiotic persistence prevailing in clinics and investigates its associated mechanisms in the nosocomial pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii in reference to the antibiotic meropenem. It further describes the use of a mechanism-based screening approach for the identification of potent multi-targeting anti-persister compounds, thereby leading to the identification of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) molecules exhibiting promising activity against A. baumannii persisters. This strategy can further be utilized for repurposing of FDA approved drugs or other available compound libraries, in order to identify novel anti-persister compounds.",

    "abstract": "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling from the primary cilium drives cerebellar granule cell precursor (GCP) proliferation. Mutations of hedgehog (Hh) pathway repressors could cause medulloblastoma, the most prevalent and malignant childhood brain tumor that arises from aberrant GCP proliferation. We demonstrate that brain-specific knockout of a Shh pathway repressor Rab23 in mice caused mis-patterning of cerebellar folia and elevated GCP proliferation during early development, but with no prevalent occurrence of medulloblastoma at adult stage. Strikingly, Rab23-depleted GCPs exhibited up-regulated basal level of Shh pathway activities despite reduced ciliation, and were desensitized against stimulations by Shh and Smoothened (Smo) agonist in primary GCP culture. These results illustrate dual functions of Rab23 in repressing the basal level of Shh signaling, while facilitating Shh signal transduction via Shh/Smo on primary cilium. Collectively, our findings unravel instrumental roles of Rab23 in GCP proliferation and ciliogenesis. Rab23s potentiation of Shh signaling pathway through the primary cilium and Smo, suggests a potential new therapeutic for Smo/primary cilium-driven medulloblastoma.\n\nAuthor SummaryC.H.H conceived, designed, lead, and performed all in vitro and in vivo experiments, analyzed data and wrote the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in tractography, the gap remains wide between the descriptions of white-matter pathways in the literature and the methods to reconstruct and study them from dMRI images. Here, we tackle this challenge by proposing a language to define white matter tracts, namely WMQLT, and a tool to automatically reconstruct pathways from their WMQLT queries. Our method is performant, flexible enough to allow defining tracts using multiple modalities, and allows to extend ROI-based reconstruction methods. Leveraging our language, we define 19 major brain tracts, alongside their subdivisions, and reconstruct them in a large population. We show that the shape of the reconstructed pathways, as well as their connectivity and lateralizations are in accordance with the current neuroanatomical literature. Finally, we showcase our technique in two scenarios: computing the functional subdivisions of a tract, and assessing the role of handedness and gender in the lateralization of language-related tracts.",

    "abstract": "Selective attentional biases arising from one sensory modality may manifest in another. The effects of visuospatial attention, often considered a foundation for visual object perception, are unclear in the auditory domain during audiovisual (AV) scene processing. This study investigates temporal and spatial factors that facilitate such cross-modal bias transfer at the neural level. Auditory encoding of random tone pips in AV scenes was investigated via a temporal response function model (TRF) of the participants electroencephalogram (N=30). The spatially uninformative pips were associated with spatially distributed visual contrast reversals ( flips) through asynchronous, probabilistic AV temporal onset distributions. Participants deployed visuospatial selection on these AV stimuli to perform a task. A late (~300 ms) cross-modal transfer of the unimodal attentional bias was found on the neural representation of pips. Transfer depended on the selected visual input being (i) presented during or shortly after a related sound in a relatively limited temporal window (<165 ms); and (ii) positioned across limited (1:4) visual foreground to background ratios. In addition, the magnitude of attentional enhancement was proportional to the proximity of flips to the foreground area. The results indicate that ongoing neural representations of sounds can incorporate relevant visuospatial attributes for auditory stream segregation.",
