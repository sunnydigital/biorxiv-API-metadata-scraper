    "abstract": "Visual working memory (WM) storage is largely independent between the left and right visual hemifields/cerebral hemispheres, yet somehow WM feels seamless. We studied how WM is integrated across hemifields by recording neural activity bilaterally from lateral prefrontal cortex. An instructed saccade during the WM delay shifted the remembered location from one hemifield to the other. Before the shift, spike rates and oscillatory power showed clear signatures of memory laterality. After the shift, the lateralization inverted, consistent with transfer of the memory trace from one hemisphere to the other. Transferred traces initially used different neural ensembles from feedforward-induced ones but they converged at the end of the delay. Around the time of transfer, synchrony between the two prefrontal hemispheres peaked in theta and beta frequencies, with a directionality consistent with memory trace transfer. This illustrates how dynamics between the two cortical hemispheres can stitch together WM traces across visual hemifields.",

    "abstract": "The insular cortex (IC) is notably implicated in emotional and cognitive processing; however, little is known regarding to what extent its two main subregions play functionally distinct roles on memory consolidation of conditioned fear tasks. Here we verified the effects of temporary functional inactivation of the anterior (aIC) and posterior IC (pIC) on contextual and tone fear memory. Rats received post-training bilateral infusions of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol into either the aIC or pIC and were tested 48 and 72 hours after the conditioning session to assess contextual (CFC) and tone (TFC) fear conditioning, respectively. Inactivation of the aIC during memory consolidation did not affect fear memory for CFC or TFC. On the other hand, post-training inactivation of the pIC impaired TFC but not CFC. Our findings indicate that the pIC is a necessary part of the neural circuitry related to the consolidation of cued-fear memories.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe studied the role of the anterior (aIC) and posterior (pIC) insula in fear memory\nC_LIO_LIPost-training inactivation of aIC and pIC did not impact contextual fear conditioning\nC_LIO_LIThe pIC but not aIC is necessary for the consolidation of tone fear conditioning\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The role of humoral immunity on the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) has not been investigated, yet naturally acquired immunity is key determinant of antimalarial therapeutic response. We conducted a therapeutic efficacy study in high transmission settings of western Kenya, which showed artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) were more efficacious than artemether-lumefantrine (AL). To investigate the underlying prophylactic mechanism, we compared a broad range of humoral immune responses in cohort I study participants treated with ASMQ or AL, and applied machine-learning (ML) models using immunoprofile data to analyze individual participants treatment outcome. We showed ML models could predict treatment outcome for ASMQ but no AL with high (72-92%) accuracy. Simulated PK profiling provided evidence demonstrating specific humoral immunity confers protection in the presence of sub-therapeutic residual mefloquine concentration. We concluded patient humoral immunity and partner drug interact to provide long prophylactic effect of ASMQ.",

    "abstract": "European canker, caused by the necrotrophic fungal phytopathogen Neonectria ditissima, is one of the most damaging apple diseases worldwide. An understanding of the molecular basis of N. ditissima virulence is currently lacking. Identification of genes with an up-regulation of expression during infection, which are therefore probably involved in virulence, is a first step towards this understanding. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) can be used to identify these candidate virulence genes, but relies on the use of reference genes for relative gene expression data normalisation. However, no report that addresses selecting appropriate fungal reference genes for use in the N. ditissima-apple pathosystem has been published to date. In this study, eight N. ditissima genes were selected as candidate qRT-PCR reference genes for gene expression analysis. A subset of the primers (six) designed to amplify regions from these genes were specific for N. ditissima, failing to amplify PCR products with template from other fungal pathogens present in the apple orchard. The efficiency of amplification of these six primer sets was satisfactory, ranging from 81.8 to 107.53%. Analysis of expression stability when a highly pathogenic N. ditissima isolate was cultured under 10 regimes, using the statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, indicated that actin and myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (mips), or their combination, could be utilised as the most suitable reference genes for normalisation of N. ditissima gene expression. As a test case, these reference genes were used to study expression of three candidate virulence genes during a time course of infection. All three, which shared traits with fungal effector genes, had up-regulated expression in planta compared to in vitro with expression peaking between five and six weeks post inoculation (wpi). Thus, these three genes may well be involved in N. ditissima pathogenicity and are priority candidates for further functional characterization.",

    "abstract": "Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is caused by two species of dimorphic fungi. Based on molecular phylogenetic evidence, the genus Coccidioides contains two reciprocally monophyletic species: C. immitis and C. posadasii. However, phenotypic variation between species has not been deeply investigated. We therefore explored differences in growth rate under various conditions. A collection of 39 C. posadasii and 46 C. immitis isolates, representing the full geographical range of the two species, were screened for mycelial growth rate at 37{degrees}C and 28{degrees}C on solid media. The radial growth rate was measured over 16 days on yeast extract agar. A linear mixed effect model was used to compare the growth rate of C. posadasii and C. immitis at 37{degrees}C and 28{degrees}C respectively. C. posadasii grew significantly faster at 37{degrees}C, when compared to C. immitis; whereas both species had similar growth rates at 28{degrees}C. These results indicate thermotolerance differs between these two species. As the ecological niche has not been well-described for Coccidioides spp., and disease variability between species has not been shown, the evolutionary pressure underlying the adaptation is unclear. However, this research reveals the first significant phenotypic difference between the two species that directly applies to ecological and clinical research.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of cells comprising the superficial zone of articular cartilage is their expression of lubricin, encoded by the Prg4 gene, that lubricates the joint and protects against the development of arthritis. Here, we identify Creb5 as a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in superficial zone articular chondrocytes and is required for TGF-{beta} and EGFR signaling to induce Prg4 expression. Notably, forced expression of Creb5 in chondrocytes derived from the deep zone of the articular cartilage confers the competence for TGF-{beta} and EGFR signals to induce Prg4 expression. Chromatin-IP and ATAC-Seq analyses have revealed that Creb5 directly binds to two Prg4 promoter-proximal regulatory elements, that display an open chromatin conformation specifically in superficial zone articular chondrocytes; and which work in combination with a more distal regulatory element to drive induction of Prg4 by TGF-{beta}. Our results indicate that Creb5 is a critical regulator of Prg4/lubricin expression in the articular cartilage.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial tissues acquire their integrity and function through the apico-basal polarization of their constituent cells. Proteins of the PAR and Crumbs complexes are pivotal to epithelial polarization, but the mechanistic understanding of polarization is challenging to reach, largely because numerous potential interactions between these proteins and others have been found, without clear hierarchy in importance. We identify the regionalized and segregated organization of members of the PAR and Crumbs complexes at epithelial apical junctions by imaging endogenous proteins using STED microscopy on Caco-2 cells, human and murine intestinal samples. Proteins organize in submicrometric clusters, with PAR3 overlapping with the tight junction (TJ) while PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6{beta} form segregated clusters that are apical of the TJ and present in an alternated pattern related to actin organization. CRB3A is also apical of the TJ and weakly overlaps with other polarity proteins. This organization at the nanoscale level significantly simplifies our view on how polarity proteins could cooperate to drive and maintain cell polarity.",

    "abstract": "The spinal vertebral column gives structural support for the adult body plan, protects the spinal cord, and provides muscle attachment and stability, which allows the animal to move within its environment. The development and maturation of the spine and its physiology involve the integration of multiple musculoskeletal tissues including bone, cartilage, and fibrocartilaginous joints, as well as innervation and control by the nervous system. One of the most common disorders of the spine in human is adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), which is characterized by the onset of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine of <10{degrees} around adolescence, in otherwise healthy children. The genetic basis of AIS is largely unknown. Systematic genome-wide mutagenesis screens for embryonic phenotypes in zebrafish have been instrumental in the understanding of early patterning of embryonic tissues necessary to build and pattern the embryonic spine. However, the mechanisms required for postembryonic maturation and homeostasis of the spine remain poorly understood. Here we report the results from a small-scale forward genetic screen for adult-viable recessive and dominant mutant zebrafish, displaying overt morphological abnormalities of the adult spine. Germline mutations induced with N-ethyl N-nitrosourea (ENU) were transmitted and screened for dominant phenotypes in 1,229 F1 animals, and subsequently bred to homozygosity in F3 families, from these, 314 haploid genomes were screened for recessive phenotypes. We cumulatively found 39 adult-viable (3 dominant and 36 recessive) mutations each leading to a defect in the morphogenesis of the spine. The largest phenotypic group displayed larval onset axial curvatures, leading to whole-body scoliosis without vertebral dysplasia in adult fish. Pairwise complementation testing within this phenotypic group revealed at least 16 independent mutant loci. Using massively-parallel whole genome or whole exome sequencing and meiotic mapping we defined the molecular identity of several loci for larval onset whole-body scoliosis in zebrafish. We identified a new mutation in the skolios/kinesin family member 6 (kif6) gene, causing neurodevelopmental and ependymal cilia defects in mouse and zebrafish. We also report several recessive alleles of the scospondin and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 9 (adamts9) genes, which all display defects in spine morphogenesis. Many of the alleles characterized thus far are non-synonymous mutations in known essential scospondin and adamts9 genes. Our results provide evidence of monogenic traits that are critical for normal spine development in zebrafish, that may help to establish new candidate risk loci for spine disorders in humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the model bumble bee species B. terrestris, both males and females exhibit black coloration on the third thoracic and first metasomal segments. We discovered a fortuitous lab-generated mutant in which this typical black coloration is replaced by yellow. As this same color variant is found in several sister lineages to B. terrestris within the Bombus s.s. subgenus, this could be a result of ancestral allele sorting.\n\nResultsUtilizing a combination of RAD-Seq and whole-genome re-sequencing approaches, we localized the color-generating variant to a single SNP in the protein-coding sequence of a homeobox transcription factor, cut. Sanger sequencing confirmed fixation of this SNP between wildtype and yellow mutants. Protein domain analysis revealed this SNP to generate an amino acid change (Ala38Pro) that modifies the conformation of coiled-coil structural elements which lie outside the characteristic DNA binding domains. We found all Hymenopterans including B. terrestris sister lineages possess the non-mutant allele, indicating different mechanism(s) are involved in the same black to yellow transition in nature.\n\nConclusionsCut is a highly pleiotropic gene important for multiple facets of development, yet this mutation generated no noticeable external phenotypic effects outside of setal characteristics. Reproductive capacity was observed to be reduced, however, with queens being less likely to mate and produce female offspring, in a manner similar to workers. Our research implicates a novel developmental player in pigmentation, and potentially caste as well, thus contributing to a better understanding of the evolution of diversity in both of these processes.",
