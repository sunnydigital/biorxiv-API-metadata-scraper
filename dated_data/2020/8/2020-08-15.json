    "abstract": "High quality metadata annotations for data hosted in large public repositories are essential for research reproducibility, and for conducting fast, powerful and scalable meta-analyses. Currently, a majority of sequencing samples in the National Center for Biotechnology Informations (NCBIs) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) are missing metadata across several categories. In an effort to improve the metadata coverage of these samples, we leveraged almost 44 million attribute-value pairs from SRA BioSample to train a scalable, recurrent neural network that predicts missing metadata via Named Entity Recognition (NER). The network was first trained to classify short text phrases according to 11 metadata categories and achieved an overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 85.2% and 0.977 respectively. We then applied our classifier to predict 11 metadata categories from the longer TITLE attribute of samples, evaluating performance on a set of samples withheld from model training. Prediction accuracies were high when extracting sample Species (94.85%), Condition/Disease (95.65%) and Strain (82.03%) from TITLEs, with lower accuracies and lack of predictions for other categories highlighting multiple issues with the current metadata annotations in BioSample. These results indicate the utility of recurrent neural networks for NER-based metadata prediction and the potential for models such as the one presented here to increase metadata coverage in BioSample while minimizing the need for manual curation.\n\nAvailabilityAll the analyses, environments, and Jupyter notebooks pertaining to this manuscript are available on Github: https://github.com/cartercompbio/PredictMEE.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular profiling of complex microbial communities has become the basis for examining the relationship between the microbiome composition, structure and metabolic functions of those communities. Microbial community structure can be partially assessed with universal PCR targeting taxonomic or functional gene markers. Increasingly, shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing is providing more quantitative insight into microbiomes. However, both amplicon-based and shotgun sequencing approaches have shortcomings that limit the ability to study microbiome dynamics.\n\nMethodsWe present a novel, amplicon-free, hybridization-based method (CaptureSeq) for profiling complex microbial communities using probes based on the chaperonin-60 gene. Molecular profiles of a commercially available synthetic microbial community standard were compared using CaptureSeq, whole metagenome sequencing, and 16S universal target amplification. Profiles were also generated for natural ecosystems including antibiotic-amended soils, manure storage tanks, and an agricultural reservoir.\n\nResultsThe CaptureSeq method generated a microbial profile that encompassed all of the bacteria and eukaryotes in the panel with greater reproducibility and more accurate representation of high G/C content microorganisms compared to 16S amplification. In the natural ecosystems, CaptureSeq provided a much greater depth of coverage and sensitivity of detection compared to shotgun sequencing without prior selection. The resulting community profiles provided quantitatively reliable information about all three Domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) in the different ecosystems. The applications of CaptureSeq will facilitate accurate studies of host-microbiome interactions for environmental, crop, animal and human health.",

    "abstract": "Whether we are making life-or-death decisions or thinking about the best way to phrase an email, counterfactual emotions including regret and disappointment play an ever-present role in how we make decisions. Functional theories of counterfactual thinking suggest that the experience and future expectation of counterfactual emotions should promote goal-oriented behavioral change. Although many studies find empirical support for such functional theories, the generative cognitive mechanisms through which counterfactual thinking facilitates changes in behavior are underexplored. Here, we develop generative models of risky decision-making that extend regret and disappointment theory to experience-based tasks, which we use to examine how people incorporate counterfactual information into their decisions across time. Further, we use computer-vision to detect positive and negative affect (valence) intensity from participants faces in response to feedback, which we use to explore how experienced emotion may correspond to cognitive mechanisms of learning, outcome valuation, or exploration/exploitation--any of which could result in functional changes in behavior. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling and Bayesian model comparison methods, we found that a model assuming: (1) people learn to explicitly represent and subjectively weight counterfactual outcomes with increasing experience, and (2) people update their counterfactual expectations more rapidly as they experience increasingly intense negative affect best characterized empirical data. Our findings support functional accounts of regret and disappointment and demonstrate the potential for generative modeling and model-based facial expression analysis to enhance our understanding of cognition-emotion interactions.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that there may be a relationship between the timing of motor events and phases of the cardiac cycle. However, this relationship has thus far only been researched using simple isolated movements such as key-presses in reaction-time tasks and only in a single subject acting alone. Other research has shown both movement and cardiac coordination among interacting individuals. Here, we investigated how the cardiac cycle relates to ongoing self-paced movements in both action execution and observation using a novel dyadic paradigm. We recorded electrocardiography (ECG) in 26 healthy adult subjects who formed 19 dyads (7 comprised of two subjects and 12 subjects paired with an experimenter). Each dyad contained an action executioner and observer as they performed a self-paced sequence of movements. We demonstrated that heartbeats are timed to movements during both action execution and observation. Specifically, movements were less likely to culminate synchronously with the heartbeat, around the time of the R-peak of the ECG. The same pattern was observed for action observation, with the observers heartbeats occurring off-phase with movement culmination. These findings demonstrate that there is coordination between an action executioners cardiac cycle and the timing of their movements, and that the same relationship is mirrored in an observer. This suggests that previous findings of interpersonal coordination may be caused by the mirroring of a phasic relationship between movement and the heart.",

    "abstract": "What enables our mental activities for thinking verbally or humming in our mind? We hypothesized that the interaction between motor and sensory systems induces speech and melodic mental representations, and this motor-to-sensory transformation forms the neural basis that enables our verbal thinking and covert singing. Analogous with the neural entrainment to auditory stimuli, participants imagined singing lyrics of well-known songs rhythmically while their neural electromagnetic signals were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found that when participants imagined singing the same song in similar durations across trials, the delta frequency band (1-3 Hz, similar to the rhythm of the songs) showed more consistent phase coherence across trials. This neural phase tracking of imagined singing was observed in a frontal-parietal-temporal network - the proposed motor-to-sensory transformation pathway, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula, premotor, intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), primary auditory cortex (HG), and superior temporal gyrus and sulcus (STG & STS). These results suggest that neural responses can entrain the rhythm of mental activity. Moreover, the theta band (4-8 Hz) phase coherence was localized in the auditory cortices. The mu (9-12 Hz) and beta (17-20 Hz) bands were observed in the right-lateralized sensorimotor systems that were consistent with the singing context. The gamma band was broadly manifested in the observed network. The coherent activation in the motor-to-sensory transformation network as well as the frequency-specific activation in the motor, somatosensory, and auditory cortices mediate the internal construction of perceptual representations and form the foundation of neural computations for mental operations.",

    "abstract": "While academia is moving forward in terms of diversifying recruitment of undergraduate and graduate students, diverse representation is still not found across the academic hierarchy. At the graduate level, new discussions are emerging around efforts to improve the experiences of women and underrepresented minorities through inclusive graduate programming. Inclusive graduate programs are that which actively center and prioritize support for diverse experiences, identities, career goals, and perspectives, from recruitment through graduation. Establishing regular and rigorous evaluation of equity and inclusion efforts and needs is a critical component of this work. This is recognized by funding agencies that increasingly require reporting on inclusion efforts; here we suggest use of a systems change framework for these evaluations.\n\nA systems change approach emphasizes three levels: explicit change (e.g. policies), semi-explicit change (e.g. power dynamics), and implicit change (e.g. biases). We use the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB) PhD Program at the University of Texas at Austin in an exercise to (1) identify areas of concern regarding inclusive programming voiced by graduate students, (2) categorize efforts to address these concerns, and (3) integrating and evaluating which areas of the systems change framework show the greatest progress or potential for progress. We argue this framework is particularly useful for academic systems as they are complex, composed of variable individuals, and must address diverse stakeholder needs.",

    "abstract": "Maximizing crop yields relies on the use of agrochemicals to control insect pests. One of the most widely used classes of insecticides are neonicotinoids that interfere with signalling of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but these can also disrupt crop-pollination services provided by bees. Here, we analysed whether chronic low dose long-term exposure to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam alters gene expression and alternative splicing in brains of Africanized honey bees, Apis mellifera, as adaptation to altered neuronal signalling. We find differentially regulated genes that show concentration-dependent responses to thiamethoxam, but no changes in alternative splicing. Most differentially expressed genes have no annotated function but encode short Open Reading Frames (sORFs), a characteristic feature of anti-microbial peptides. As this suggested that immune responses may be compromised by thiamethoxam exposure, we tested the impact of thiamethoxam on bee immunity by injecting bacteria. We show that intrinsically sub-lethal thiamethoxam exposure makes bees more vulnerable to normally non-pathogenic bacteria. Our findings imply a synergistic mechanism for the observed bee population declines that concern agriculturists, conservation ecologists and the public.",

    "abstract": "With millions of intoxications each year and over 200,000 deaths, organophosphorus (OP) compounds are an important public health issue worldwide. OP poisoning induces cholinergic syndrome, with muscle weakness, hypertension, and neuron damage that may lead to epileptic seizures and permanent psychomotor deficits. Existing countermeasures are lifesaving but do not prevent long-lasting neuronal comorbidities, emphasizing the urgent need for animal models to better understand OP neurotoxicity and identify novel antidotes. Here, using diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a prototypic and moderately toxic OP, combined with zebrafish larvae, we first showed that DFP poisoning caused major acetylcholinesterase inhibition, resulting in paralysis and CNS neuron hyperactivation, as indicated by increased neuronal calcium transients and overexpression of the immediate early genes fosab, junBa, npas4b, and atf3. In addition to these epileptiform seizure-like events, DFP-exposed larvae showed increased neuronal apoptosis, which were both partially alleviated by diazepam treatment, suggesting a causal link between neuronal hyperexcitation and cell death. Last, DFP poisoning induced an altered balance of glutamatergic/GABAergic synaptic activity with increased NR2B-NMDA receptor accumulation combined with decreased GAD65/67 and gephyrin protein accumulation. The zebrafish DFP model presented here thus provides important novel insights into the pathophysiology of OP intoxication, making it a promising model to identify novel antidotes.",

In this study, we have standardized procedures for isolating phytochemicals from the leaf extract. The ethyl acetate leaf extract selectively affects cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50: 0.57 g/ml in MCF-7 cells) in various cancer cell lines.\n\nNext, we examined if the extract incubation could induce cell cycle arrest and suppress cell migration in the cell culture model. Consistent with this idea, the leaf extract could potentially affect the aggressive migration nature of cancer cells. Moreover, oral administration of extract significantly restored tumor growth in mice. Together, these observations suggest the anti-cancer activities of S. anacardium leaf potential for both in vitro and in vivo models.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=90 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/898940v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fefborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@594510org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c525d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1362978_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Autotrophic microorganisms that convert inorganic carbon into organic matter were key players in the evolution of life on Earth. As the early atmosphere became oxygenated, microorganisms needed to develop mechanisms for oxygen protection, especially those relying on enzymes containing oxygen-sensitive metal clusters (e.g., Fe-S). Here we investigated how 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (4HBD) - the key enzyme of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle for CO2-fixation - adapted as conditions shifted from anoxic to oxic. 4HBD is found in both anaerobic bacteria and aerobic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). The oxygen-sensitive bacterial 4HBD and oxygen-tolerant archaeal 4HBD share 59 % amino acid identity. To examine the structural basis of oxygen tolerance in archaeal 4HBD, we determined the atomic resolution structure of the enzyme. Two tunnels providing access to the canonical [4Fe-4S] cluster in oxygen-sensitive bacterial 4HBD were closed with four conserved mutations found in all aerobic AOA and other archaea. Further biochemical experiments and molecular dynamics simulations support our findings that restricting access to the active site is the key to oxygen tolerance, explaining how active site evolution drove a major evolutionary transition.\n\nSignificance statementAutotrophy (primary production) was the first life strategy on Earth. Before photosynthesis (using solar energy to fix carbon dioxide), life relied on chemical reactions for energy. These chemosynthetic reactions are present in all domains of life, including archaea possessing the most energy-efficient carbon fixation pathway - the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle. This efficiency results from enzyme modifications, including enhanced enzyme stability and catalysis of multiple reactions. We reveal the first structure of aerobic 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (4HBD) from ammonia-oxidizing archaea. These archaea are among the most abundant organisms on the planet, and their 4HBD active site evolved oxygen tolerance to support aerobic metabolism. This modification can provide further insight into enzyme evolution on early earth, as photosynthesis developed and began oxygenating the atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic scaling in neurons has been attributed to the individual contribution of either translation or degradation; however there remains limited insight towards understanding how the interplay between the two processes effectuates synaptic homeostasis. Here, we report that a co-dependence between protein synthesis and degradation mechanisms drives synaptic homeostasis whereas abrogation of either prevents it. Coordination between the two processes is achieved through the formation of a tripartite complex between translation regulators, the 26S proteasome and the miRNA-induced-silencing-complex (miRISC) components such as Argonaute, MOV10 and Trim32 on actively translating transcripts or polysomes. The components of this ternary complex directly interact with each other in an RNA-dependent manner. Disruption of polysomes abolishes this ternary interaction, suggesting that translating RNAs facilitate the combinatorial action of the proteasome and the translational apparatus. We identify that synaptic downscaling involves miRISC remodeling which entails the mTORC1-dependent translation of Trim32, an E3 ligase and the subsequent degradation of its target, MOV10 via the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase. We find that the E3 ligase Trim32 specifically polyubiquitinates MOV10 for its degradation during synaptic downscaling. MOV10 degradation alone is sufficient to invoke downscaling by enhancing Arc translation through its 3 UTR and causing the subsequent removal of post-synaptic AMPA receptors. Synaptic scaling was occluded when we depleted Trim32 and overexpressed MOV10 in neurons, suggesting that the Trim32-MOV10 axis is necessary for synaptic downscaling. We propose a mechanism that exploits a translation-driven protein degradation paradigm to invoke miRISC remodeling and induce homeostatic scaling during chronic network activity.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is an essential element to life and exerts a strong control on global biological productivity. The rise and spread of nitrogen-utilizing microbial metabolisms profoundly shaped the biosphere on the early Earth. Here we reconciled gene and species trees to identify birth and horizontal gene transfer events for key nitrogen-cycling genes, dated with a time-calibrated tree of life, in order to examine the timing of the proliferation of these metabolisms across the tree of life. Our results provide new insights into the evolution of the early nitrogen cycle that expand on geochemical reconstructions. We observed widespread horizontal gene transfer of molybdenum-based nitrogenase back to the Archean, minor horizontal transfer of genes for nitrate reduction in the Archean, and an increase in the proliferation of genes metabolizing nitrite around the time of the Mesoproterozoic ([~]1.5 Ga). The latter coincides with recent geochemical evidence for a mid-Proterozoic rise in oxygen levels. Geochemical evidence of biological nitrate utilization in the Archean and early Proterozoic may reflect at least some contribution of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rather than pure denitrification to N2. Our results thus help unravel the relative dominance of two metabolic pathways that are not distinguishable with current geochemical tools. Overall, our findings thus provide novel constraints for understanding the evolution of the nitrogen cycle over time and provide insights into the bioavailability of various nitrogen sources in the early Earth with possible implications for the emergence of eukaryotic life.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-mediated genome editing has become a powerful tool for genetic modification of biological traits. However, developing an efficient, site-specific, gene knock-in system based on homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) remains a significant challenge in plants, especially in woody species like poplar. Here, we show that simultaneous inhibition of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) recombination cofactor XRCC4 and overexpression of HDR enhancer factors CtIP and MRE11 can improve the HDR efficiency for gene knock-in. Using this approach, the BleoR gene was integrated onto the 3' end of the MKK2 MAP Kinase gene to generate a BleoR-MKK2 fusion protein. Based on exogenous BleoR expression, the HDR-mediated knock-in efficiency was up to [~]40-fold greater when using a XRCC4 silencing incorporated with a combination of CtIP and MRE11 overexpression compared to no HDR enhancement or NHEJ silencing. Furthermore, this corporation of HDR enhancer overexpression and NHEJ repression also resulted in 7-fold fewer CRISPR-induced Insertions and Deletions (InDels), resulting in no functional effects on MKK2-based salt stress responses in poplar. Therefore, this approach may be useful not only in poplar and plants or crops but also in mammalians for improving CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition is essential for the appropriate control of neuronal network activity. Sustained excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance relies on the orchestrated adjustment of synaptic strength, neuronal activity and network circuitry. While growing evidence indicates that extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain is a crucial regulator of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, it remains unclear whether and how ECM contributes to neuronal circuit stability. Here we demonstrate that the integrity of ECM supports the maintenance of E-I balance by retaining inhibitory connectivity. Depletion of ECM in mature neuronal networks preferentially decreases the density of inhibitory synapses and the size of individual inhibitory postsynaptic scaffolds. After ECM depletion, inhibitory synapse strength homeostatically increases via the reduction of presynaptic GABAB receptors. However, the inhibitory connectivity reduces to an extent that inhibitory synapse scaling is no longer efficient in controlling neuronal network activity. Our results indicate that the brain ECM preserves the balanced network state by stabilizing inhibitory synapses.\n\nSignificance statementThe question how the brains extracellular matrix (ECM) controls neuronal plasticity and network activity is key for an appropriate understanding of brain functioning. In this study, we demonstrate that ECM depletion much more strongly affects the integrity of inhibitory than excitatory synapses in vitro and in vivo. We revealed that by retaining inhibitory connectivity, ECM ensures the efficiency of inhibitory control over neuronal network activity. Our work significantly expands our current state of knowledge about the mechanisms of neuronal network activity regulation. Our findings are similarly relevant for researchers working on the physiological regulation of neuronal plasticity in vitro and in vivo and for researchers studying the remodeling of neuronal networks upon brain injury, where prominent ECM alterations occur.",

    "abstract": "Infections with varicella zoster virus (VZV), a member of the Herpesviridae family, are associated with a range of clinical manifestations. Primary infection with VZV causes chicken pox, and due to the viruss capacity to remain latent in neurons, it can reactivate later in life causing herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles. Two different vaccines have been developed to prevent HZ, one based on a live attenuated VZV strain (Zostavax) and the other on adjuvanted gE recombinant protein (Shingrix). While Zostavax efficacy wanes with age, Shingrix protection retains its efficacy in elderly subjects (80 years of age and beyond). In this context, it is of much interest to understand if there is a role for T cell immunity in differential clinical outcome, and if there is a correlate of protection between T cell immunity and Shingrix efficacy. In this study, we characterized Shingrix specific ex vivo CD4 T cell responses in the context of natural exposure and HZ vaccination using pools of predicted epitopes. We show that T cell reactivity following natural infection and Zostavax vaccination dominantly targets non-structural proteins (NS), while Shingrix vaccination redirects dominant reactivity to target gE. We mapped the gE-specific responses following Shingrix vaccination to 89 different gE epitopes, 34 of which accounted for 80% of the response. Using antigen presentation assays and single HLA molecule transfected lines, we experimentally determined HLA restrictions for 94 different donor/peptide combinations. Finally, we used our results as a training set to assess strategies to predict restrictions based on measured or predicted HLA binding and the corresponding HLA types of responding subjects.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the T cell profile associated with the protection observed in elderly vaccinees following Shingrix vaccination is relevant to the general definition of correlates of vaccine efficacy. Our study enables these future studies by clarifying patterns of immunodominance associated with Shingrix vaccination, as opposed to natural infection or Zostavax vaccination. Identification of epitopes recognized by Shingrix-induced CD4 T cells and their associated HLA restrictions enables the generation of tetrameric staining reagents and, more broadly, the capability to characterize specificity, magnitude and phenotype of VZV specific T cells.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of metabolic energy cost as a metric for human performance has expanded across various fields within the scientific, clinical, and engineering communities. As an alternative to measuring metabolic cost experimentally, musculoskeletal models incorporating metabolic cost models have been developed. However, to utilize these models for practical applications, the accuracy of their metabolic cost predictions requires improvement. Previous studies have reported the benefits of using personalized musculoskeletal models for various applications, yet no study has evaluated how model personalization affects metabolic cost estimation. This study investigated the effect of musculoskeletal model personalization on estimates of metabolic cost of transport (CoT) during post-stroke walking using three commonly used metabolic cost models. We analyzed data previously collected from two male stroke survivors with right-sided hemiparesis. The three metabolic cost models were implemented within three musculoskeletal modeling approaches involving different levels of personalization. The first approach used a scaled generic OpenSim model and found muscle activations via static optimization (SOGen). The second approach used a personalized EMG-driven musculoskeletal model with personalized functional axes but found muscle activations via static optimization (SOCal). The third approach used the same personalized EMG-driven model but calculated muscle activations directly from EMG data (EMGCal). For each approach, the muscle activation estimates were used to calculate each subjects cost of transport (CoT) at different gait speeds using three metabolic cost models (Umberger 2003, Umberger 2010, and Bhargava 2004). The calculated CoT values were compared with published CoT trends as a function of stance time, double support time, step positions, walking speed, and severity of motor impairment (i.e., Fugl-Meyer score). Overall, U10-SOCal, U10-EMGCal, U03-SOCal, and U03-EMGCal were able to produce slopes between CoT and the different measures of walking asymmetry that were statistically similar to those found in the literature. Although model personalization seemed to improve CoT estimates, further tuning of parameters associated with the different metabolic cost models in future studies may allow for realistic CoT predictions. An improvement in CoT predictions may allow researchers to predict human performance, surgical, and rehabilitation outcomes reliably using computational simulations.",

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal modeling relies on high-quality measurements of muscle electrical activity to estimate muscle forces. However, a critical challenge for practical deployment of this approach is missing EMG data from muscles that contribute substantially to joint moments. This situation may arise due to either the inability to measure deep muscles with surface electrodes or the lack of a sufficient number of EMG electrodes. Muscle synergy analysis is a dimensionality-reduction approach to decompose a large number of muscle excitations into a small number of time-varying synergy excitations along with time-invariant synergy weights that define the contribution of each corresponding synergy excitation to a specific muscle excitation. This study evaluates how accurately missing muscle excitations can be predicted using synergy excitations extracted from muscles with available EMGs (henceforth called \"synergy extrapolation\"). The results were reported on a gait dataset collected from a stroke survivor walking on an instrumented treadmill at self-selected and fastest-comfortable speeds. The evaluation process started with full calibration of a lower-body EMG-driven model using 16-channel EMGs (including surface and indwelling) in each leg. One indwelling EMG (either iliopsoas or adductor longus) was then treated as unmeasured at a time. The synergy weights associated with the unmeasured muscle were predicted through solving a nonlinear optimization problem where the errors between inverse dynamics and EMG-driven joint moments were minimized. We also quantitatively evaluated how synergy analysis algorithms (principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)), EMG normalization methods, and number of synergies affect the accuracy of the predicted unmeasured muscle excitation. Synergy extrapolation performance was most influenced by the choice of synergy analysis algorithm and number of synergies. PCA with 5 or 6 synergies consistently predicted unmeasured muscle excitations most accurately and with greatest robustness to choice of EMG normalization method. Furthermore, the associated joint moment matching accuracy was comparable to that produced by the full EMG-driven calibration. The synergy extrapolation method described in this study may facilitate the assessment of human neuromuscular control and biomechanics in response to surgical or rehabilitation treatment when important EMG signals are missing.",

    "abstract": "Deoxygenation, the reduction of oxygen level in the oceans induced by global warming and anthropogenic disturbances, is a major threat to marine life. This change in oxygen level could be especially harmful to marine embryos that utilize endogenous hypoxia and redox gradients as morphogens during normal development. Here we show that the tolerance to hypoxic conditions changes between different developmental stages of the sea urchin embryo, due to the structure of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We demonstrate that during normal development, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway restricts the activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway to two lateral domains and by that controls proper skeletal patterning. Hypoxia applied during early development strongly perturbs the activity of Nodal and BMP pathways that affect VEGF pathway, dorsal-ventral (DV) and skeletogenic patterning. These pathways are largely unaffected by hypoxia applied after DV axis formation. We propose that the use of redox and hypoxia as morphogens makes the sea urchin embryo highly sensitive to environmental hypoxia during early development, but the GRN structure provides higher tolerance to hypoxia at later stages.\n\nSummary statementThe use of hypoxia and redox gradients as morphogens makes sea urchin early development sensitive to environmental hypoxia. This sensitivity decreases later, due to the structure of the gene regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "The persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major problem in managing tuberculosis (TB). Host-generated nitric oxide (NO) is perceived as one of the signals by Mtb to reprogram metabolism and respiration for persistence. However, the mechanisms involved in NO sensing and reorganizing Mtbs physiology are not fully understood. Since NO damages Fe-S clusters of essential enzymes, the mechanism(s) involved in regulating iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis could help Mtb persist in host tissues. Here, we show that a transcription factor SufR (Rv1460) senses NO via its 4Fe-4S cluster and promotes persistence of Mtb by mobilizing the Fe-S cluster biogenesis system; suf operon (Rv1460-Rv1466). Analysis of anaerobically purified SufR by UV-visible spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and iron-sulfide estimation confirms the presence of a 4Fe-4S cluster. Atmospheric O2 and H2O2 gradually degrade the 4Fe-4S cluster of SufR. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis demonstrates that NO directly targets SufR 4Fe-4S cluster by forming a protein-bound dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol complex. DNase I footprinting, gel-shift, and in vitro transcription assays confirm that SufR directly regulates the expression of the suf operon in response to NO. Consistent with this, RNA- sequencing of Mtb{Delta}sufR demonstrates deregulation of the suf operon under NO stress. Strikingly, NO inflicted irreversible damage upon Fe-S clusters to exhaust respiratory and redox buffering capacity of Mtb {Delta}sufR. Lastly, Mtb{Delta} sufR failed to recover from a NO-induced non-growing state and displayed persistence defect inside immune-activated macrophages and murine lungs in a NO-dependent manner. Data suggest that SufR is a sensor of NO that supports persistence by reprogramming Fe-S cluster metabolism and bioenergetics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induces the expression of suf operon for Fe-S cluster biogenesis in response to nitric oxide (NO).\nC_LIO_LIWe found that a transcription factor SufR senses NO via its 4Fe-4S cluster and regulates the expression of the suf operon for Fe-S cluster biogenesis.\nC_LIO_LISufR-regulated Fe-S cluster biogenesis confers respiratory and redox features that promote recovery of Mtb from NO stress.\nC_LIO_LISufR activity is required to support the NO-dependent persistence of Mtb in macrophages and mice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing receptors (NLRs) mediate innate immunity by forming inflammasomes. Activation of the NLR protein NLRP1 requires auto-cleavage within its FIIND domain1-7. In resting cells, the dipeptidyl peptidase DPP9 interacts with NLRP1-FIIND and together with a related enzyme DPP8, suppresses spontaneous NLRP1 activation8,9. The mechanisms of DPP8/9-mediated NLRP1 inhibition, however, remain elusive. Here we provide structural and biochemical evidence demonstrating that rat NLRP1 (rNLRP1) interacts with rDPP9 in a stepwise manner to form a 2:1 complex. An auto-inhibited rNLRP1 molecule first interacts with rDPP9 via its ZU5 domain. This 1:1 rNLRP1-rDPP9 complex then captures the UPA domain of a second rNLRP1 molecule via a UPA-interacting site on DPP9 and dimeric UPA-UPA interactions with the first rNLRP1. The 2:1 rNLRP1-rDPP9 complex prevents NLRP1 UPA-mediated higher order oligomerization and maintains NLRP1 in the auto-inhibited state. Structure-guided biochemical and functional assays show that both NLRP1-binding and its enzymatic activity are required for DPP9 to suppress NLRP1, supporting guard-type activation of the NLR. Together, our data reveal the mechanism of DPP9-mediated inhibition of NLRP1 and shed light on activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of neurological disorders (NDs) is challenged by low drug permeability from the systemic circulation into the central nervous system (CNS) owing to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Neuronanomedicine investigates nanotechnology strategies to target the brain and improve the therapeutic outcome in NDs. Two-dimensional adherent cell BBB models show substantial phenogenomic heterogeneity and their ability to predict the permeability of molecules and nanoparticles into the brain is extremely limited. Thus, the high-throughput screening of CNS nanomedicines relies on the use of animal models. To address this dearth, 3D organoids that mimic the in vivo physiology are under development. Still, there exist concerns about the standardization and scale-up of the production process, their proper characterisation, and their industrial application. In this work, we report on a novel multicellular organoid of the neurovascular blood-brain barrier (NV-BBB) that recapitulates the regulated syncytium of human endothelial cells and the function of the human BBB. For this, an advanced organoid comprising human brain microvascular endothelial cells, brain vascular pericytes and human astrocytes combined with primary neurons and microglia isolated from neonate rats is bio-fabricated without the use of an extracellular matrix. The structure and function are fully characterized by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy, western blotting, RNA-sequencing and quantitative gene expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. This bulk of these self-assembloids is comprised of neural cells and microglia and the surface covered by endothelial cells that act as a biological barrier that resembles the BBB endothelium. In addition, the formation of neuron-microglia morphofunctional communication sites is confirmed. Analysis of key transcriptomic expressions show the up-regulation of selected BBB-related genes including tight junction proteins, solute carriers, transporters of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, metabolic enzymes, and prominent basement membrane signatures. Results confirmed the more efficient cell-cell communication in 3D organoids made of multiple neural-tissue cells than in 2D endothelial cell monocultures. These multicellular organoids are utilized to screen the permeability of different polymeric, metallic, and ceramic nanoparticles.

    "abstract": "While vaccines are vital for preventing COVID-19 infections, it is critical to develop new therapies to treat patients who become infected. Pharmacological targeting of a host factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral mutation leading to resistance. In particular, host kinases are highly druggable targets and a number of conserved coronavirus proteins, notably the nucleoprotein (N), require phosphorylation for full functionality. In order to understand how targeting kinases could be used to compromise viral replication, we used a combination of phosphoproteomics and bioinformatics as well as genetic and pharmacological kinase inhibition to define the enzymes important for SARS-CoV-2 N protein phosphorylation and viral replication. From these data, we propose a model whereby SRPK1/2 initiates phosphorylation of the N protein, which primes for further phosphorylation by GSK-3/{beta} and CK1 to achieve extensive phosphorylation of the N protein SR-rich domain. Importantly, we were able to leverage our data to identify an FDA-approved kinase inhibitor, Alectinib, that suppresses N phosphorylation by SRPK1/2 and limits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Together, these data suggest that repurposing or developing novel host-kinase directed therapies may be an efficacious strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-mediated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Anticipation of upcoming events plays a crucial role in automatic behaviors. It is, however, still unclear whether the event-related brain potential (ERP) markers of anticipation could track the implicit acquisition of probabilistic regularities that can be considered as building blocks of automatic behaviors. Therefore, in a four-choice reaction time (RT) task performed by young adults (N = 36), the contingent negative variation (CNV) as an ERP marker of anticipation was measured from the onset of a cue stimulus until the presentation of a target stimulus. Due to the probability structure of the task, target stimuli were either predictable or unpredictable, but this was unknown to participants. The cue did not contain predictive information on the upcoming target. Results showed that the CNV amplitude during response preparation was larger before the unpredictable than before the predictable target stimuli. In addition, although RTs increased, the P3 amplitude decreased for the unpredictable as compared with the predictable target stimuli, possibly due to the stronger response preparation that preceded stimulus presentation. These results suggest that enhanced attentional resources are allocated to the implicit anticipation and processing of unpredictable events. This might originate from the formation of internal models on the probabilistic regularities of the stimulus stream, which primarily facilitates the processing of predictable events. Overall, we provide ERP evidence that supports the role of implicit anticipation and predictive processes in the acquisition of probabilistic regularities.",

    "abstract": "Biomineralization is the process by which organisms use minerals to harden their tissues and provide them with physical support. Biomineralizing cells concentrate the mineral in vesicles that they secret into a dedicated compartment where crystallization occurs. The dynamics of vesicle motion and the molecular mechanisms that control it, are not well understood. Sea urchin larval skeletogenesis provides an excellent platform for investigating the kinetics of mineral-bearing vesicles. Here we used lattice light-sheet microscopy to study the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of calcium-bearing vesicles in the cells of normal sea urchin embryos and of embryos where skeletogenesis is blocked through the inhibition of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR). We developed computational tools for displaying 3D-volumetric movies and for automatically quantifying vesicle dynamics. Our findings imply that calcium vesicles perform an active diffusion motion in both, calcifying (skeletogenic) and non-calcifying (ectodermal) cells of the embryo. The diffusion coefficient and vesicle speed are larger in the mesenchymal skeletogenic cells compared to the epithelial ectodermal cells. These differences are possibly due to the distinct mechanical properties of the two tissues, demonstrated by the enhanced f-actin accumulation and myosinII activity in the ectodermal cells compared to the skeletogenic cells. Vesicle motion is not directed toward the biomineralization compartment, but the vesicles slow down when they approach it, and probably bind for mineral deposition. VEGFR inhibition leads to an increase of vesicle volume but hardly changes vesicle kinetics and doesnt affect f-actin accumulation and myosinII activity. Thus, calcium vesicles perform an active diffusion motion in the cell of the sea urchin embryo, with diffusion length and speed that inversely correlate with the strength of the actomyosin network. Overall, our studies provide an unprecedented view of calcium vesicle 3D-dynamics and point toward cytoskeleton remodeling as an important effector of the motion of mineral-bearing vesicles.\n\nAuthors summaryBiomineralization is a widespread, fundamental process by which organisms use minerals to harden their tissues. Mineral-bearing vesicles were observed in biomineralizing cells and play an essential role in biomineralization, yet little is known about their three-dimensional (3D) dynamics. Here we quantify 3D-vesicle-dynamics during calcite skeleton formation in sea urchin larvae, using lattice-light-sheet microscopy. We discover that calcium vesicles perform a diffusive motion in both calcifying and non-calcifying cells of the embryo. The diffusion coefficient and vesicle speed are higher in the mesenchymal skeletogenic cells compared to the epithelial ectodermal cells. This difference is possibly due to the higher rigidity of the ectodermal cells as demonstrated by the enhanced signal of f-actin and myosinII activity in these cells compared to the skeletogenic cells. The motion of the vesicles in the skeletogenic cells, is not directed toward the biomineralization compartment but the vesicles slow down near it, possibly to deposit their content. Blocking skeletogenesis through the inhibition of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR), increases vesicle volume but doesnt change the diffusion mode and the cytoskeleton markers in the cells. Our studies reveal the active diffusive motion of mineral bearing vesicles that is apparently defined by the mechanical properties of the cells.\n\nCalcium-vesicle diffusion in biomineralization\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/244053v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (110K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15ec7dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1931222org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8b8b80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@173bd4d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The chi-square periodogram (CSP), developed over 40 years ago, continues to be one of the most popular methods to estimate the period of circadian (circa 24-h) rhythms. Previous work has indicated the CSP is sometimes less accurate than other methods, but understanding of why and under what conditions remains incomplete. Using simulated rhythmic time-courses, we found that the CSP is prone to underestimating the period in a manner that depends on the true period and the length of the time-course. This underestimation bias is most severe in short time-courses (e.g., 3 days), but is also visible in longer simulated time-courses (e.g., 12 days) and in experimental time-courses of mouse wheel-running and ex vivo bioluminescence. We traced the source of the bias to discontinuities in the periodogram that are related to the number of time-points the CSP uses to calculate the observed variance for a given test period. By revising the calculation to avoid discontinuities, we developed a new version, the greedy CSP, that shows reduced bias and improved accuracy. Nonetheless, even the greedy CSP tended to be less accurate on our simulated time-courses than an alternative method, namely the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Thus, although our study describes a major improvement to a classic method, it also suggests that users should generally avoid the CSP when estimating the period of biological rhythms.",

    "abstract": "The cholinergic midbrain is involved in a wide range of motor and cognitive processes. Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) send long-ranging axonal projections that target sensorimotor and limbic areas in the thalamus, the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatal complex following a topographical gradient, where they influence a range of functions including attention, reinforcement learning and action-selection. Nevertheless, a comprehensive examination of the afferents to PPN and LDT cholinergic neurons is still lacking, partly due to the neurochemical heterogeneity of this region. Here we characterize the whole-brain input connectome to cholinergic neurons across distinct functional domains (i.e. PPN vs LDT) using conditional transsynaptic retrograde labeling in ChAT::Cre male and female rats. The quantification of input neurons revealed that both PPN and LDT receive similar substantial inputs from the superior colliculus and the output of the basal ganglia (i.e. substantia nigra pars reticulata). In addition, we found that PPN cholinergic neurons receive preferential inputs from basal ganglia structures than from the cortex, whereas LDT cholinergic neurons receive preferential inputs from cortical areas. Our results provide the first characterization of inputs to PPN and LDT cholinergic neurons. The differences in afferents to each cholinergic structure support their differential roles in behavior.\n\nSignificance statementAcetylcholine is a widespread neuromodulator that regulates a wide variety of functions including learning, goal-directed behavior and execution of movements. In this study we characterized the distribution of presynaptic neurons that modulate the activity of functionally distinct midbrain cholinergic neurons located in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) by using a transsynaptic, modified-rabies virus strategy. We reveal that input neurons are widely distributed throughout the brain but segregated into specific functional domains. Motor related areas innervate preferentially the PPN, whereas limbic related areas preferentially innervate the LDT. Our results suggest that input neurons located along distinct functional domains have differential impact over cholinergic midbrain regions.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPrevious work utilizing resting state fMRI to measure functional network connectivity in rodents with moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) revealed several sex- and region-dependent alterations in FNC implicating FNC as potential biomarker for PAE. Given that FNC is sensitive to neurological and psychiatric conditions in humans, here, we explore the use of previously acquired FNC data and machine learning methods to detect PAE among a sample of rodents exposed to moderate PAE and controls exposed to a saccharin solution.\n\nMaterials & MethodsWe utilized previously acquired fMRI data from 48 adult rats 24 PAE (12 male 12 female) and 24 saccharin exposed (SAC) controls (12 male and 12 female) for classification. The entire data sample was utilized to perform binary classification (SAC or PAE) of FNC data with multiple support vector machine (SVM) kernels and out-of-sample cross-validation to evaluate classification performance.\n\nResultsResults revealed accuracy rates of 62.5% for all samples, 58.3% for males, and 79.2% for females using a quadratic SVM kernel to classify moderate PAE from FNC data. In addition, brain networks localized to hippocampal and cortical regions contributed strongly to QSVM classifications.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest overall modest classification performance of a QSVM to detect moderate PAE from FNC data gathered from adult rats, yet good performance among females. Further developments and refinement of the technique hold promise for the detection of PAE in earlier developmental time periods that potentially offer additional tools for the non-invasive detection of PAE from FNC data.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) can be challenging in individuals who lack the hallmark facial dysmorphologies associated with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The absence of a diagnosis prevents individuals with PAE from receiving the treatment and services that improves quality of life outcomes. This research explores the use of preclinical functional network connectivity data and machine learning techniques as a novel and non-invasive means of detecting PAE. Our aim is to contribute basic science towards improving diagnostic strategies that can lead to securing timely and appropriate support for individuals with FASD and their caregivers.",

Although this phenomenon, called priority effect, is widespread in natural communities, it is unclear how it depends on the length of growing season. Using a seasonal stage-structured model, we show that differences in stages of interacting species could generate priority effects by altering the strength of stabilizing and equalizing coexistence mechanisms, changing outcomes between exclusion, coexistence, and positive frequency dependence. However, these priority effects are strongest in systems with just one or a few generations per season and diminish in systems where many overlapping generations per season dilute the importance of stage-specific interactions. Our model reveals a novel link between the number of generations in a season and the consequences of priority effects, suggesting that consequences of phenological shifts driven by climate change should depend on specific life histories of organisms.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIntracellular recordings using sharp microelectrodes often rely on a technique called Discontinuous Current-Clamp to accurately record the membrane potential while injecting current through the same microelectrode. It is well known that a poor choice of DCC switching rate can lead to under-or over-estimation of the cell potential, however, its effect on the cell firing is rarely discussed. Here, we show that sub-optimal switching rates lead to an overestimation of cell excitability. We performed intracellular recordings of mouse spinal motoneurons and recorded their firing in response to pulses and ramps of current in Bridge and DCC mode at various switching rates. We demonstrate that using an incorrect (too low) DCC frequency leads not only to an underestimation of the input resistance, but also, paradoxically, to an artificial overestimation of the firing of these cells: neurons fire at lower current, and at higher frequencies than at higher DCC rates, or than the same neuron recorded in Bridge mode. These effects are dependent on the membrane time constant of the recorded cell, and special care needs to be taken in large cells with very short time constants. Our work highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate DCC switching rate to obtain not only accurate membrane potential readings but also an accurate representation of the firing of the cell.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWTATEMENTC_SCPLOWDiscontinuous Current-Clamp is a technique often used during intracellular recordings in vivo.

    "abstract": "Excitatory synapses of principal hippocampal neurons are frequently located on dendritic spines. The dynamic strengthening or weakening of individual inputs results in a great structural and molecular diversity of dendritic spines. Active spines with large Ca2+ transients are frequently invaded by a single protrusion from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is dynamically transported into and out of spines by the actin-based motor myosin V. An increase in synaptic strength often correlates with stable anchoring of the ER, followed by the formation of the spine apparatus organelle. Here we show that synaptic ER stabilization depends on the interplay of two Ca2+-binding proteins: calmodulin serves as a light chain of myosin V and activates the motor function, whereas caldendrin acts as an inhibitor which transforms myosin into a stationary F-actin tether. Together, they provide a Ca2+-sensing module for fine-tuning myosin V activity and thereby regulate the formation of the spine apparatus in a subset of active dendritic spines.",

    "abstract": "Bats host many viruses pathogenic to humans, and increasing evidence suggests that Rotavirus A (RVA) also belongs to this list. Rotaviruses cause diarrheal disease in many mammals and birds, and their segmented genomes allow them to reassort and increase their genetic diversity. Eighteen out of 2,142 bat fecal samples (0.8%) collected from Europe, Central America and Africa were PCR-positive for RVA and 11 of those were fully characterized using viral metagenomics. Upon contrasting their genomes with publicly available data, at least 7 distinct bat RVA genotype constellations (GCs) were identified, including evidence of reassortments and 6 novel genotypes. Some of these constellations are spread across the world, whereas others appear to be geographically restricted. Our analyses also suggest that several unusual human and equine RVA strains might be of bat RVA origin, based on their phylogenetic clustering, despite varying levels of nucleotide sequence identities between them. Although SA11 is one of the most widely used reference strains for RVA research and forms the backbone of a reverse genetics system, its origin remained enigmatic. Remarkably, the majority of the genotypes of SA11-like strains were shared with Gabonese bat RVAs, suggesting a potential common origin. Overall, our findings suggest an underexplored genetic diversity of RVAs in bats, which is likely only the tip of the iceberg. Increasing contact between humans and bat wildlife will further increase the zoonosis risk, which warrants closer attention to these viruses.\n\nImportanceThe increased research on bat coronaviruses after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVallowed the very rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2. This is an excellent example of the importance of knowing viruses harbored by wildlife in general and bats in particular, for global preparedness against emerging viral pathogens. The current effort to characterize bat rotavirus strains from 3 continents shed light on the vast genetic diversity of rotaviruses and also hinted at a bat origin for several atypical rotaviruses in humans and animals, implying that zoonoses of bat rotaviruses might occur more frequently than currently realized.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has taken a huge toll on human lives and the global economy. Therefore, effective treatments against this disease are urgently needed. Here, we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput screening platform to screen compound libraries to identify drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), in particular those which are FDA-approved, to be used immediately to treat patients with COVID-19. Mpro has been shown to be one of the most important drug targets among SARS-related coronaviruses as impairment of Mpro blocks processing of viral polyproteins which halts viral replication in host cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-malarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ) induces significant conformational change in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and diminishes its protease activity. Specifically, TFQ reduces the -helical content of Mpro, which converts it into an inactive form. Moreover, TFQ greatly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture system. Hence, the current study provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of action of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Moreover, the low clinical toxicity of TFQ and its strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 should warrant further testing in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enhances motility, stemness and chemoresistance of carcinomas and is an important determinant of metastasis. Little is known about how various pathways coordinate to elicit EMTs different functional aspects. Even lesser has been studied in this context in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where EMT is a key event during early tumorigenesis. Thymidylate synthase (TS), a proliferation enzyme, has been previously correlated with EMT transcription factor ZEB1 in NSCLC and is associated with resistance against anti-folate chemotherapy. In this study we establish a functional correlation between TS, EMT, chemotherapy and metastasis and identify a network that might propel the TS mediated EMT phenotype.\n\nMethodsPublished datasets were analysed to evaluate significance of TS in NSCLC fitness and prognosis. mCherry based promoter reporter assay was used to sort Calu-1 and A549 NSCLC cells in TSHIGH and TSLOW. Metastatic potential of TS knock-down was assayed in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice.\n\nResultsLow TS levels were prognostic and predicted chemotherapy response. NSCLC cell lines with higher TS promoter activity were more mesenchymal-like. RNA-seq from these cells, and shRNA mediated TS knocked down cells, identified EMT as one of the most differentially regulated pathways. EMT transcription factors HOXC6 and HMGA2 were identified as upstream regulator of TS whereas, AXL, SPARC and FOSL1 were identified as downstream effectors. TS knock-down reduced the metastatic colonisation in vivo.\n\nConclusionThese results establish the role of TS as a theranostic NSCLC marker integrating survival, chemo-resistance and EMT, and identifies a regulatory network that could be exploited to target EMT-driven NSCLC.",

While dendritic spikes have been studied extensively in apical and basal dendrites of L5PNs, whether oblique dendrites, which ramify in the input layers of the cortex, also generate dendritic spikes is unknown. Here we report the existence of dendritic spikes in apical oblique dendrites of L5PNs. In silico investigations indicate that oblique branch spikes are triggered by brief, low-frequency action potential (AP) trains (~40 Hz) and are characterized by a fast sodium spike followed by activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. In vitro experiments confirmed the existence of oblique branch spikes in L5PNs during brief AP trains at frequencies of around 60 Hz. Oblique branch spikes offer new insights into branch-specific computation in L5PNs and may be critical for sensory processing in the input layers of the cortex.",

    "abstract": "RationaleSARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is facilitated by endogenous and exogenous proteases that proteolytically activate the spike glycoprotein and antiproteases inhibiting this process. Understanding the key actors in viral entry is crucial for advancing knowledge of virus tropism, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to investigate the role of naive serum and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) in inhibiting protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry and explore the implications of AAT deficiency on susceptibility to different SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nFindingsOur study demonstrates that naive serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry, with AAT identified as the major serum protease inhibitor potently restricting entry. Using pseudoparticles, replication-competent pseudoviruses, and authentic SARS-CoV-2, we show that AAT inhibition occurs at low concentrations compared with those in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting physiological relevance. Furthermore, sera from subjects with an AAT-deficient genotype show reduced ability to inhibit entry of both Wuhan-Hu-1 (WT) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) but exhibit no difference in inhibiting B.1.1.529 (Omicron) entry.\n\nConclusionsAAT may have a variant-dependent therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings highlight the importance of further investigating the complex interplay between proteases, antiproteases, and spike glycoprotein activation in SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses to identify potential therapeutic targets and improve understanding of disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an increasingly prevalent condition and endothelial dysfunction is implicated in its etiology. We previously identified nitric oxide (NO) as a calcification inhibitor by its activation of NOTCH1, which is genetically linked to human CAVD. Here, we show that NO rescues calcification by a S-nitrosylation-mediated mechanism in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells (pAVICs) and single cell RNA-seq demonstrated regulation of NOTCH pathway by NO. A unbiased proteomic approach to identify S-nitrosylated proteins in valve cells found enrichment of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and implicated S-nitrosylation of USP9X in NOTCH regulation during calcification. Furthermore, S-nitrosylated USP9X was shown to deubiquitinate and stabilize MIB1 for NOTCH1 activation. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of Usp9x in mice demonstrated aortic valve disease and human calcified aortic valves displayed reduced S-nitrosylation of USP9X. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which S-nitrosylation dependent regulation of ubiquitin-associated pathway prevents CAVD.",

However, the relative impact of genetic and non-genetic factors on DNA methylation patterns across the mammalian genome has not been systematically studied. We performed whole-genome methylation analysis in two inbred mouse strains, revealing striking differences in the global distribution of DNA methylation. Although global methylation patterns were indistinguishable for most genomic features, a significant increase in the number of unmethylated CpG-island promoters and first exons was observed between strains. Experiments using F1 reciprocal hybrid strains demonstrated that the genotype of the mother dictated global DNA methylation patterns. Cross-fostering experiments ruled out a postnatal maternal effect on these differences and suggested that they were driven by a prenatal maternal effect, possibly via differential deposition of maternal gene products into the oocyte or uterine environment. These data demonstrate that maternal effects have a major impact on global DNA methylation patterns.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulates the proliferation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inside the infected immune cells. However, the application of this knowledge to develop therapeutic strategies remained unsuccessful due to unfavorable consequences of manipulating cellular antioxidant systems that respond to ROS. Here, we show that vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanosheets functionally mimic the activity of natural glutathione peroxidase (GPX) to mitigate ROS associated with HIV-1 infection without triggering detrimental changes in cellular physiology. Using genetic reporters of glutathione (GSH) redox potential (EGSH; Grx1-roGFP2) and H2O2 (Orp1-roGFP2), we showed that V2O5-nanosheets catalyze GSH-dependent neutralization of ROS in HIV-1 infected cells. Notably, V2O5-nanosheets uniformly blocked HIV-1 reactivation, multiplication, and impaired survival of drug-resistant Mtb during HIV-TB co-infection. Mechanistically, V2O5-nanosheets suppressed HIV-1 by affecting the expression of pathways coordinating redox balance, virus transactivation (e.g., NF-{kappa}B and FOS), inflammation, and apoptosis. Importantly, a combination of V2O5-nanosheets with a pharmacological inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B (BAY11-7082) abrogated activation of HIV-1 from latency. Lastly, V2O5-nanosheets counteracted ROS, disease pathophysiology, and virus expression in HIV-1 transgenic mice. Our data successfully revealed the usefulness of V2O5-nanosheets against human pathogens and suggest nanozymes as future platforms to develop interventions against infectious diseases.\n\nSignificance StatementRedox stress, such as those caused by the deregulation of the antioxidant glutathione, promotes the multiplication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Here we present a vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)-based antioxidant nanozyme that targets cells infected with HIV-1. The nanozyme, by mimicking the activity of glutathione peroxidase, reprograms redox signaling to subvert HIV-1 from monocytes, lymphocytes, and HIV-1 transgenic mice. Treatment with nanozyme bolsters the antiviral potential of immune cells by reducing the expression of genes involved in virus activation, inflammation, and apoptosis. The nanozyme also inhibited the proliferation of Mtb, which is a major cause of lethality in HIV patients. These V2O5-based nanozymes may be applied to numerous human pathogens where redox signaling contributes to disease progression.",

Here we report the concurrent nanoscale fine-mapping of membrane topography, diffusivity, and packing order in live mammalian cells through a synergy of single-molecule and super-resolution methods. By identifying a bright, lipophilic fluorescence turn-on probe that enables sustained single-molecule imaging of cellular membranes under stroboscopic excitation, we accumulate the positions and transient displacements of >106 probe molecules to achieve super-resolution topography and diffusivity mapping. We thus determine a trend that the membrane diffusivity drops with increased lipid packing order when comparing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, plasma membrane, and nanodomains induced by cholera toxin B. Utilizing our nanoscale mapping capability, we further unveil reduced diffusivity in the ER membrane at ER-plasma membrane contact sites. By next integrating spectrally resolved single-molecule imaging, we show this localized diffusion slowdown is not due to altered lipid packing order, but may instead be attributed to local protein crowding. Our integrated multidimensional single-molecule approach thus unveils and differentiates between nanoscale diffusional heterogeneities of different origins in live-cell membranes.",

    "abstract": "Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs), the most widely used fungicides in agriculture today, act by blocking succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an essential and evolutionarily conserved component of mitochondrial respiratory chain. Recent results showed that several SDHIs used as fungicides not only inhibit the SDH activity of target fungi but also block this activity in human cells in in vitro models, revealing a lack of specificity and thus a possible health risk for exposed organisms, including humans. Despite the frequent detection of SDHIs in the environment and on harvested products and their increasing use in modern agriculture, their potential toxic effects in vivo, especially on neurodevelopment, are still under-evaluated. Here we assessed the neurotoxicity of bixafen, one of the latest-generation SDHIs, which had never been tested during neurodevelopment. For this purpose, we used a well-known vertebrate model for toxicity testing, namely zebrafish transparent embryos, and live imaging using transgenic lines labelling the brain and spinal cord. Here we show that bixafen causes microcephaly and defects on motor neuron axon outgrowth and their branching during development. Our findings show that the central nervous system is highly sensitive to bixafen, thus demonstrating in vivo that bixafen is neurotoxic in vertebrates and causes neurodevelopmental defects. This work adds to our knowledge of the toxic effect of SDHIs on neurodevelopment and may help us take appropriate precautions to ensure protection against the neurotoxicity of these substances.",

    "abstract": "Immune response is a highly coordinated cascade involving all the subsets of PBMCs. In this study, RNA-Seq analysis of PBMC subsets - CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD21+ and CD335+ cells from day 0 and day 5 of Sungri/96 Peste des Petits Ruminants vaccinated sheep and goats was done to delineate the systems biology behind immune - protection of the vaccine in sheep and goats. Assessment of the immune response processes enriched by the differentially expressed genes in all the subsets suggested a strong dysregulation towards development of early inflammatory microenvironment, which is very much required for differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, and for activation and migration of dendritic cells into the draining lymph nodes. The protein - protein interaction networks among the antiviral molecules (IFIT3, ISG15, MX1, MX2, RSAD2, ISG20, IFIT5 and IFIT1) and common DEGs across PBMCs subsets in both the species identified ISG15 to be an ubiquitous hub, that helps in orchestrating antiviral host response against PPRV. IRF7 was found to be the key master regulator activated in most of the subsets in sheep and goats. Most of the pathways were found to be inactivated in B - lymphocytes of both the species indicating that 5 dpv is too early a time point for the B - lymphocytes to react. The cell mediated immune response and humoral immune response pathways were found more enriched in goats than in sheep. Though, animals from both the species survived the challenge, a contrast in pathway activation was observed in CD335+ cells.\n\nImportancePeste des petits ruminants (PPR) by PPRV is an OIE listed acute, contagious transboundary viral disease of small ruminants. Attenuated Sungri/96 PPRV vaccine used all over India against this PPR, provides long-lasting robust innate and adaptive immune response. The early antiviral response was found mediated through type I interferon independent ISGs expression. However, systems biology behind this immune response is unknown. In this study, in vivo transcriptome profiling of PBMC subsets (CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD21+ and CD335+) in vaccinated goats and sheep (at 5 days of post vaccination) was done to understand this systems biology. Though there are a few differences in the systems biology across cells (specially the NK cells) between sheep and goats, the co-ordinated response that is inclusive of all the cell subsets was found to be towards induction of strong innate immune response, which is needed for an appropriate adaptive immune response.",

The nature of the pools and trafficking between them is not well understood, but pools that are slow to mobilize when synapses are active are usually assumed to feed pools that are mobilized more quickly, in a series. However, results from electrophysiological studies of synaptic transmission suggested instead a parallel organization where vesicles within slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools would separately feed independent reluctant- and fast-releasing subdivisions of the readily releasable pool, without intermixing. We now use FM-dyes to confirm the existence of multiple reserve pools at hippocampal synapses. We then confirm the prediction that slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools do not intermix, even when mobilized by high frequency stimulation. The result provides a simplifying new constraint on the dynamics of vesicle recycling within presynaptic terminals. The experiments additionally demonstrated extensive heterogeneity among synapses in the relative sizes of slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools. The heterogeneity suggests equivalent heterogeneity in the probability of release among readily releasable vesicles that may be relevant for understanding information processing and storage.",

Using a combination of single cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we investigate the functional organization of TIL populations in primary NSCLC. We identify two CD8+ TIL subpopulations expressing memory-like gene modules: one is also present in blood (circulating precursors) and the other one in juxta-tumor tissue (tissue resident precursors). In tumors, these two precursor populations converge through a unique transitional state into terminally differentiated cells, often referred to as dysfunctional or exhausted. Differentiation is associated with TCR expansion, and transition from precursor to late differentiated states correlates with intratumor T cell cycling.

    "abstract": "Predictive models are becoming more and more commonplace as tools for candidate antigen discovery to meet the challenges of enabling epitope mapping of cohorts with diverse HLA properties. Here we build on the concept of using two key parameters, diversity metric of the HLA profile of individuals within a population and consideration of sequence diversity in the context of an individuals CD8 T-cell immune repertoire to assess the HIV proteome for defined regions of immunogenicity. Using this approach, Analysis of HLA adaptation and functional immunogenicity data enabled the identification of regions within the proteome that offer significant conservation, HLA recognition within a population, low prevalence of HLA adaptation and demonstrated immunogenicity. We believe this unique and novel approach to vaccine design that, in combination with in vitro functional assays, offers a bespoke pipeline for expedited and rational CD8 T-cell vaccine design for HIV and potentially other pathogens with the potential for both global and local coverage.",

    "abstract": "The birds oomorphology has far escaped mathematical formulation universally applicable. All bird egg shapes can be laid in four basic geometric figures: sphere, ellipsoid, ovoid, and pyriform (conical/pear-shaped). The first three have a clear mathematical definition, each derived from expression of the previous, but a formula for the pyriform profile has yet to be inferred. To rectify this, we introduced an additional function into the ovoid formula. The subsequent mathematical model fits a completely novel geometric shape that can be characterized as the last stage in the evolution of the sphere--ellipsoid--Hugelschaffers ovoid transformation applicable to any avian egg shape geometry. Required measurements are the egg length, maximum breadth, and diameter at the terminus from the pointed end. This mathematical description is invariably a significant step in understanding not only the egg shape itself, but how and why it evolved, thus making widespread biological and technological applications theoretically possible.",

Early parameters for clustering of related Mycobacteria and Arthrobacter phage genomes relied on nucleotide identity thresholds but, more recently, clustering of Gordonia and Microbacterium phages has been performed according to shared gene content. Singleton phages lack the nucleotide identity and/or shared gene content required for clustering newly sequenced genomes with known phages. Whole genome metrics of novel Arthrobacter phage BlueFeather, originally designated a putative singleton, showed low nucleotide identity but high amino acid and gene content similarity with Arthrobacter phages originally assigned to Clusters FE and FI. Gene content similarity revealed that BlueFeather shared genes with these phages in excess of the parameter for clustering Gordonia and Microbacterium phages. Single gene analyses revealed evidence of horizontal gene transfer between BlueFeather and phages in unique clusters that infect a variety of bacterial hosts. Our findings highlight the advantage of using shared gene content to study seemingly genetically isolated phages and have resulted in the reclustering of BlueFeather, a putative singleton, as well as former Cluster FI phages, into a newly expanded Cluster FE.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in developmental biology is how distinct cell fates are established and maintained through epigenetic mechanisms in multicellular organisms. Here, we report that preexisting (old) and newly synthesized (new) histones H3 and H4 are asymmetrically inherited by the distinct daughter cells during asymmetric division of Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs). By contrast, in symmetrically dividing ISCs that produce two self-renewed stem cells, old and new H3 and H4 show symmetric inheritance patterns. These results indicate that asymmetric histone inheritance is tightly associated with the distinct daughter cell fates. To further understand the biological significance of this asymmetry, we express a mutant histone that compromises asymmetric histone inheritance pattern. We find increased symmetric ISC division and ISC tumors during aging under this condition. Together, our results demonstrate that asymmetric histone inheritance is important for establishing distinct cell identities in a somatic stem cell lineage, consistent with previous findings in asymmetrically dividing male germline stem cells in Drosophila. Therefore, this work sheds light on the principles of histone inheritance in regulating stem cell fate in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Human migration in response to climate change during the Holocene has been recorded in many regions of the world. The Todas are a pastoralist people who are believed to have colonized the higher elevations (>2000 m asl) of the Nilgiris in the Western Ghats, India, not earlier than about 2000 cal. yr BP. Vegetation shifts in response to changing climate in tropical montane forest-grassland mosaic of the Ghats have been well documented using stable carbon isotopes and pollen profiles; however, there have been no corresponding investigations of human presence and activity at the highest elevations. We used a number of other proxies to infer the human ecology of this montane region. Radiocarbon dated (~22,000 cal. BP to the present) peat samples from the Sandynallah basin (2200m asl, Nilgiri hills, Tamil Nadu State) were used to reconstruct fire history, animal abundance, and human presence since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). While the macro-charcoal record indicates fires at the LGM, macro- and micro-charcoal counts indicate intense fire at ~3500 cal. yr BP, coprophilous fungal spores indicate a large population of herbivorous mammals, and steroid biomarkers indicate human faecal remains for the first time. This period is also characterized by dry arid conditions and dominant grassy vegetation as inferred from n-alkane signatures. We thus infer that a pastoralist people, most likely the Todas, migrated to the highest elevations of the Western Ghats along with their buffalo herds in response to prolonged or abrupt climate change in peninsular India, about 3500 cal. yr BP or at least 1500 years prior to what historical accounts assume.",

Previous studies have showed the presence of earthworms improves treatment performance of vermifilter (VF), but earthworm microbial community dynamics, their structure and functional characteristics in VF were not fully investigated. To investigate the effects of earthworms on the inherent microbial community of the VF, the present study envisages the dynamics of the complex symbiosis of earthworms & microorganisms associated to the treatment mechanisms. In this study, the design, operations and performance evaluation and influent, effluent and filter media layer were investigated for microbial diversity inside the earthworm population, along with the antimicrobial activity, enzymatic activity, and protein profiling assays. The results showed that earthworm gut microbial communities were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, and the percentages arrived to 59-60% of the microbial species detected, while filter media layer showed presence of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The protein profiling of the microbiota associated with the VF showed that earthworms feeding and earthworm-microorganism interaction were responsible for enhanced treatment performance. The finding provides an insight into the complex earthworm microbial dynamics and mechanisms for wastewater treatment in VF. Furthermore, earthworm predation strongly regulated microbial biomass while improving microbial activity, and is deciphered as the possible mechanisms behind the vermifiltration technology.",

By reverse evolution, we mean a scenario where selection is reversed. In this work, we use evolution (and reversal from) of multicellularity in S. cerevisiae as a model to answer this question. When selected for fast-settling variants, multicellularity evolves rapidly in the organism. On reversing selection, unicellularity evolves from the multicellular clusters. However, the dynamic trajectories of the two processes are different. In this context, evolution is not reversed dynamically at a phenotypic level. The phenotypic reversal is not driven by reversal of the original mutations during the forward evolution. Overall, our results show that the dynamics of molecular and phenotypic trajectories of evolution are distinct, and reversal of selection leads to unique trajectories of phenotypic reversal.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster LS2 protein is a tissue-specific paralog of U2AF2 that mediates testis-specific alternative splicing. In order to understand the structural mechanisms underlying the distinct RNA binding specificity we determined the solution structures of the LS2 RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and characterized their interaction with cis-regulatory guanosine-rich RNA motifs found in intron regions upstream of alternatively spliced exons. We show that the guanosine-rich RNA adopts a G quadruplex (G4) fold in vitro. The LS2 tandem RRMs adopt canonical RRM folds that are connected by a 38-residue linker that harbors a small helical motif 0. The LS2 RRM2 domain and the 0 helix in the interdomain linker mediate interactions with the G4 RNA. The functional importance of these unique molecular features in LS2 is validated by mutational analysis in vitro and RNA splicing assays in vivo. RNA sequencing data confirm the enrichment of G4-forming LS2 target motifs near LS2-affected exons. Our data indicate a role of G quadruplex structures as cis-regulatory motifs in introns for the regulation of alternative splicing, that engage non-canonical interactions with a tandem RRM protein. These results highlight the intriguing molecular evolution of a tissue-specific splicing factor from its conserved U2AF2 paralog as a result of (retro-) gene duplication in D. melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Label-free separation of rare cells (e.g. circulating tumor cells (CTCs)) based on their size is attractive due to its wider applicability, simpler sample preparation, faster turnaround, better efficiency and higher purity. Amongst cognate protocols for the same, vortex-trapping based techniques offer high throughput but operate at high flow velocities where the resulting hydrodynamic shear stress is likely to damage cells and compromise their viability for subsequent assays. We present here an orthogonal vortex chip which can carry out size-differentiated trapping at significantly lower (38% of previously reported) flow velocities. Fluid flowing through the chip is constrained to exit the trapping chamber at right angles to that of its entry. Such a flow configuration leads to the formation of vortex in the chamber. Above a critical flow velocity, larger particles are trapped in the vortex whereas smaller particles get ejected with the flow: we call this phenomenon the turn-effect. We have characterized the critical velocities for trapping of cells and particles of different sizes on chips with distinct entry-exit configurations. Optimal architectures for stable vortex trapping at low flow velocities are identified. We explain how shear-gradient lift, centrifugal and Dean flow drag forces contribute to the turn-effect by acting on cells which pushes them into specific vortices in a size- and velocity-dependent fashion. Finally, we demonstrate selective trapping of human breast cancer cells mixed with whole blood at low-concentration. Our findings suggest that the device shows promise for the gentle isolation of rare cells from blood.",

    "abstract": "Ras superfamily GTPases are molecular switches which regulate critical cellular processes. Extensive structural and computational studies on these G proteins have established a general framework for their switching mechanism, which involves conformational changes in their two loops, Switch I and Switch II, upon GTP binding and hydrolysis. Since the extent of these conformational changes is not uniform amongst the members of the Ras superfamily, there is no generic modus operandi defining their switching mechanism. Here, we have developed a novel approach employing wavelet coherence analysis to correlate the structural changes with their functional states. Our analysis shows that the structural coupling between the Switch I and Switch II regions is manifested in terms of conserved wavelet coherence phases, which could serve as useful parameters to define functional states of the GTPases. In oncogenic GTPases mutants, this phase coupling gets disentangled, which perhaps provides an alternative explanation for their aberrant function. We have tested the statistical significance of the observed phase angle correlations on multiple switch region conformers, generated through MD simulations.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of dual SGLT1/2 inhibition, using sotagliflozin, on cardiac outcomes in non-diabetic and diabetic mice with cardiac pressure overload.\n\nMethods and ResultsFive-week old male C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive a high fat diet (HFD; 60% of calories from fat) to induce diabetes or remain on normal diet (ND) for 12 weeks. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was then employed to induce cardiac pressure-overload (50% increase in right:left carotid pressure versus sham surgery), resulting in features representative of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. At five weeks into the dietary protocol, mice were treated for seven weeks by oral gavage once daily with sotagliflozin (10mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (0.1% tween 80). In ND non-diabetic mice, treatment with sotagliflozin attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and histological markers of cardiac fibrosis induced by TAC. These benefits were associated with profound diuresis and glucosuria, without shifts toward whole-body fatty acid utilisation nor increased cardiac ketolysis. In HFD diabetic mice, sotagliflozin did not attenuate cardiac injury induced by TAC. HFD mice had vacuolation of proximal tubular cells, associated with less profound diuresis and glucosuria, which may have compromised drug action and subsequent cardio-protection.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate the utility of dual SGLT1/2 inhibition in treating heart failure risk factors in the non-diabetic state. Its efficacy in high fat-induced diabetes with proximal tubular damage requires further study.",

    "abstract": "The human corpus callosum exhibits substantial atrophy in old age, which is stronger than what would be predicted from parallel changes in overall brain anatomy. To date, however, it has not been conclusively established whether this accentuated decline represents a common feature of brain aging across species, or whether it is a specific characteristic of the aging human brain. In the present cross-sectional study, we address this question by comparing age-related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans. For this purpose, we measured total midsagittal area and regional thickness of the corpus callosum from T1-weighted MRI data from 213 chimpanzees, aged between 9 and 54 years. The results were compared with data drawn from a large-scale human samples which was age-range matched using two strategies: (a) matching by chronological age (human sample size: n = 562), or (b) matching by accounting for differences in longevity and various maturational events between the species (i.e., adjusted human age range: 13.6 to 80.9 years; n = 664). Using generalized additive modelling to fit and compare aging trajectories, we found significant differences between the two species. The chimpanzee aging trajectory compared to the human trajectory was characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, and by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood, which, however, was present in humans. Thus, the accentuated decline of the corpus callosum found in aging humans, is not an universal characteristic of the aging brain, and appears to be human-specific.",

    "abstract": "The BAM complex in Escherichia coli is composed of five proteins, BamA-E. BamA and BamD are essential for cell viability and are required for the assembly of {beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins. Consequently, BamA and BamD are indispensable for secretion via the classical autotransporter pathway (Type 5a secretion). In contrast, BamB, BamC and BamE are not required for the biogenesis of classical autotransporters. Recently, we demonstrated that TamA, a homologue of BamA, and its partner protein TamB, were required for efficient secretion of proteins via the classical autotransporter pathway. The trimeric autotransporters are a subset of the Type 5-secreted proteins. Unlike the classical autotransporters, they are composed of three identical polypeptide chains which must be assembled together to allow secretion of their cognate passenger domains. In contrast to the classical autotransporters, the role of the Bam and Tam complex components in the biogenesis of the trimeric autotransporters has not been investigated fully. Here, using the Salmonella enterica trimeric autotransporter SadA and the structurally similar YadA protein of Yersinia spp., we identify the importance of BamA and BamD in the biogenesis of the trimeric autotransporters and reveal that BamB, BamC, BamE, TamA and TamB are not required for secretion of functional passenger domain on the cell surface.\n\nImportanceThe secretion of trimeric autotransporters (TAAs) has yet to be fully understood. Here we show that efficient secretion of TAAs requires the BamA and D proteins, but does not require BamB, C or E. In contrast to classical autotransporter secretion, neither trimeric autotransporter tested required TamA or B proteins to be functionally secreted.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransposable elements (TEs) are major components of plant genomes. Despite being regarded as \"junk DNA\" at first, TEs play important roles for the organisms they are found in. The most obvious and easily recognizable effects caused by TEs result from their mobility, which can disrupt coding sequences or promoter regions. However, with the recent advances in transcriptomics, it is becoming increasingly evident that TEs can act as an additional layer of gene expression regulation through a number of processes, which can involve production of non-coding RNAs. Here, we describe how Tnt1, a stress-responsive LTR-retrotransposon, interferes with gene expression and modulate a number of developmental aspects in tobacco.\n\nResultsThrough an RNAi approach, we generated tobacco (HP) lines knocked-down for Tnt1 expression. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments confirm that Tnt1 is downregulated in HP lines after ethylene exposure. A RNA-seq experiment was performed and through two independent bioinformatic approaches (with different stringencies) we found 932 and 97 differentially expressed genes in HP lines. A number of phenotypes were observed in such lines, namely lesion mimicry in leaves, underdevelopment of the root system, overproduction of root hairs and early loss of seed viability. Folding prediction of part of the Tnt1 mRNA reveals putative stem-loop secondary structures containing transcriptional regulation sequences, suggesting it could be a source of small RNAs. We also propose a model to explain the Tnt1 expression in both homeostatic and stress conditions, and how it could interact with stress-responsive genes.\n\nConclusionsOur results are consistent that interferences with Tnt1 transcript levels correlate with transcriptomic and phenotypic changes, suggesting a functional role for this element during plant development and stress response.",

These existing methods are costly, require extensive sample handling time, and have limited throughput. Here, we describe V-seq, an inexpensive, fast, and scalable method that performs targeted viral genome sequencing by multiplexing virus-specific primers at the cDNA synthesis step. We designed densely tiled reverse transcription (RT) primers across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a subset of hexamers at the 3 end to minimize mis-priming from the abundant human rRNA repeats and human RNA PolII transcriptome. We found that overlapping RT primers do not interfere, but rather act in concert to improve viral genome coverage in samples with low viral load. We provide a path to optimize V-seq with SARS-CoV-2 as an example. We anticipate that V-seq can be applied to investigate genome evolution and track outbreaks of RNA viruses in a cost-effective manner. More broadly, the multiplexed RT approach by V-seq can be generalized to other applications of targeted RNA sequencing.",

Enrichment is a way to increase an animals well-being and may require problem solving through thinking, tolerance of ambiguity, openness, and intrinsic motivation. It is unclear if it is enriching when an animal participates in different types of research. Therefore, it is important to answer the question of whether research can be used as an enrichment tool in zoological facilities. Here, we examine if participation in psychophysical research affected the mental stimulation of three grey seals under human care. The effects varied amongst the three individuals that took part in the research, and indicated that their participation in the research task was dependent on their individual personalities and life history. Two seals indicated that their involvement in the research was positive and motivating, and therefore can be considered enriching. In comparison, the third seal displayed a tendency for frustration and low motivation. Our results indicate that research can be a powerful enrichment tool with animals that find research motivating.",

All the data were uniformly processed with a standardized workflow, including quality control, batch effect removal, malignant cell classification, cell clustering, cell-type annotation, differential expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis. TISCH provides interactive gene expression visualization across multiple datasets at the single-cell level or cluster level, allowing systematic comparison between different cell-types, patients, tissue origins, treatment and response groups, and even different cancer-types. In summary, TISCH provides a user-friendly interface for systematically visualizing, searching, and downloading gene expression atlas in the TME from multiple cancer types, enabling fast, flexible and comprehensive exploration of the TME.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAnnotating genetic variants from summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is crucial for predicting risk genes of various disorders. The multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) is one of the most popular tools for this purpose, where MAGMA aggregates signals of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to their nearby genes. However, SNPs may also affect genes in a distance, thus missed by MAGMA. Although different upgrades of MAGMA have been proposed to extend gene-wise variant annotations with more information (e.g. Hi-C or eQTL), the regulatory relationships among genes and the tissue-specificity of signals have not been taken into account.\n\nResultsWe propose a new approach, namely network-enhanced MAGMA (nMAGMA), for gene-wise annotation of variants from GWAS summary statistics. Compared with MAGMA and H-MAGMA, nMAGMA significantly extends the lists of genes that can be annotated to SNPs by integrating local signals, long-range regulation signals, and tissue-specific gene networks. When applied to schizophrenia, nMAGMA is able to detect more risk genes (217% more than MAGMA and 57% more than H-MAGMA) that are reasonably involved in schizophrenia compared to MAGMA and H-MAGMA. Some disease-related functions (e.g. the ATPase pathway in Cortex) tissues are also uncovered in nMAGMA but not in MAGMA or H-MAGMA. Moreover, nMAGMA provides tissue-specific risk signals, which are useful for understanding disorders with multi-tissue origins.",

    "abstract": "How stromal cells fill voids in wounded tissue remains one of the most fundamental questions in regenerative medicine. Fibroblasts are known to fill voids by depositing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins while migrating towards the wound site; however, their ability to adopt an epithelial-like purse-string behaviour remains unexplored. Here, we fabricated an artificial wound with a deep void space to investigate fibroblasts behaviour during gap closure. We found that fibroblasts can form a free-standing bridge on deep microvoids and consequently close the void through the purse-string contraction, which was previously believed to be exclusively an epithelial wound closure mechanism. The results also revealed that the fibroblast gap closure in our fabricated 3D artificial wound depends on myosin II-mediated contractility and intercellular adherent junctions. Our study reveals that stromal cells can gain the structural features of epithelial cells, namely, intercellular contractile rings, to fulfil their functions under the specific microenvironmental conditions of tissue repair. Furthermore, fibroblasts can close artificial wounds with gap widths up to 300 m, approximately twice as large as the critical epithelial gap closure size on non-adherent substrates. Fibroblasts exhibited a zip-up gap closure mechanism with a geometrical size effect. These findings reveal a new mechanism for gap closure by stromal cells during wound healing and pave a way to groundbreaking therapeutic strategies for tissue repair.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates enable spatial and temporal control over cellular processes by concentrating biomolecules into non-stoichiometric assemblies. Many condensates form via reversible phase transitions of condensate-specific multivalent macromolecules known as scaffolds. Phase transitions of scaffolds can be regulated by changing the concentrations of ligands, which are defined as non-scaffold molecules that bind to specific sites on scaffolds. Here, we use theory and computation to uncover rules that underlie ligand-mediated control over scaffold phase behavior. We use the stickers-and-spacers model wherein reversible non-covalent crosslinks among stickers drive phase transitions of scaffolds, and spacers modulate the driving forces for phase transitions. We find that the modulatory effects of ligands are governed by: the valence of ligands; whether they bind directly to stickers versus spacers; and the relative affinities of ligand-scaffold versus scaffold-scaffold interactions. In general, all ligands have a diluting effect on the concentration of scaffolds within condensates. Whereas monovalent ligands destabilize condensates, multivalent ligands can stabilize condensates by binding directly to spacers or destabilize condensates by binding directly to stickers. Bipartite ligands that bind to stickers and spacers can alter the structural organization of scaffold molecules within condensates even when they have a null effect on condensate stability. Our work highlights the importance of measuring dilute phase concentrations of scaffolds as a function of ligand concentration in cells. This can reveal whether ligands modulate scaffold phase behavior by enabling or suppressing phase separation at endogeneous levels thereby regulating the formation and dissolution of condensates in vivo.\n\nSignificancePhase transitions of multivalent macromolecules known as scaffolds help drive the formation of functional biomolecular condensates in cells. The formation and dissolution of condensates is tightly regulated, as aberrant phase behavior is associated with disease. Here, we show that distinct types of ligands can exert control over the formation and dissolution of condensates by binding to distinct sites on scaffold molecules. We further show that the extent and direction of regulation can be inferred through direct measurements of how ligands impact scaffold phase boundaries. Our findings have broad implications for understanding and modeling ligand-mediated regulation of condensates in cells, and for designing novel molecules that exert regulatory control over condensates.",

Invading tumor cells evade treatment, limiting the efficacy of the current standard of care regimen. Understanding the underlying invasive behaviors that support tumor growth may allow for generation of novel GBM therapies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are attractive for genetics and live imaging, and have in recent years, emerged as a model system suitable for cancer biology research. While other groups have studied CNS tumors using zebrafish, few have concentrated on the invasive behaviors supporting the development of these diseases. Previous studies demonstrated that one of the main mechanisms of GBM invasion is perivascular invasion, i.e. single tumor cell migration along blood vessels. Here, we characterize phenotypes, methodology, and potential therapeutic avenues for utilizing zebrafish to model perivascular GBM invasion. Using patient derived xenolines or an adherent cell line, we demonstrate tumor expansion within the zebrafish brain. Within 24 hours post-intracranial injection, D54-MG-tdTomato glioma cells produce finger-like projections along the zebrafish brain vasculature. As few as 25 GBM cells were sufficient to promote single cell vessel co-option. Of note, these tumor-vessel interactions are CNS specific, and do not occur on pre-existing blood vessels when injected into the animals peripheral tissue. Tumor-vessel interactions increase over time and can be pharmacologically disrupted through inhibition of Wnt signaling. Therefore, zebrafish serve as a favorable model system to study perivascular glioma invasion, one of the deadly characteristics that make GBM so difficult to treat.",

In this study we aimed to investigate the causative relationship of e-cig exposure on TLR9 activation and atherosclerosis development.\n\nApproach and ResultsEight-week-old ApoE-/- mice fed normal chow diet were exposed to e-cig vapor (ECV) for 2 h/day, 5 days/week for 16 weeks. We found that ECV exposure significantly induced atherosclerotic lesions as examined by Oil Red O staining of aortic root and greatly upregulated TLR9 expression in classical monocytes and in the atherosclerotic plaques, which the latter was corroborated by upregulated TLR9 expression in human femoral artery atherosclerotic plaques in e-cig smokers. Intriguingly, we found a significant increase of damaged mitochondria DNA level in the circulating blood of ECV exposed mice. Furthermore, administration of TLR9 antagonist prior to ECV exposure not only alleviated atherosclerotic lesion and the upregulation of TLR9 in plaques, but also attenuated the increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, reduced the accumulation of lipid and macrophages, and decreased the frequency of blood CCR2+ classical monocytes. Surprisingly, we found that the cytoplasmic mtDNA isolated from ECV extract-treated cells can greatly enhance the expression of TLR9 in reporter cells.\n\nConclusionE-cig induces mtDNA damage and the mtDNA in circulating blood stimulates the expression of TLR9, which elevate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in monocyte/macrophage and consequently lead to atherosclerosis. Our results raise the possibility that intervention of TLR9 activation is a potential pharmacologic target of ECV-related inflammation and cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recent data have found that aging-related hearing loss (ARHL) is associated with the development of Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, the nature of the relationship between these two disorders is not clear. There are multiple potential factors that link ARHL and AD, and previous investigators have speculated that shared metabolic dysregulation may underlie the propensity to develop both disorders. Here, we investigate the distribution of serum lipidomic biomarkers in AD subjects with or without hearing loss in a publicly available dataset. Serum levels of 349 known lipids from 16 lipid classes were measured in 185 AD patients. Using previously defined co-regulated sets of lipids, both age- and sex-adjusted, we found that lipid sets enriched in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine showed a strong inverse association with hearing loss. Examination of biochemical classes confirmed these relationships and revealed that serum phosphatidylcholine levels were significantly lower in AD subjects with hearing loss. A similar relationship was not found in normal subjects. These data suggest that a synergistic relationship may exist between AD, hearing loss and metabolic biomarkers, such that in the context of a pathological state such as AD, alterations in serum metabolic profiles are associated with hearing loss. These data also point to a potential role for phosphatidylcholine, a molecule with antioxidant properties, in the underlying pathophysiology of ARHL in the context of AD, which has implications for our understanding and potential treatment of both disorders.",

Here, we investigate genetic differences as a possible source of variation and variability in Drosophila grooming. Grooming confers survival and social benefits. Grooming features of five Drosophila species exposed to a dust irritant were analyzed. Aspects of grooming behavior, such as anterior to posterior progression, were conserved between and within species. However, significant differences in activity levels, proportion of time spent in different cleaning movements, and grooming syntax were identified between species. All species tested showed individual variability in the order and duration of action sequences. Genetic diversity was not found to correlate with grooming variability within a species: melanogaster flies bred to increase or decrease genetic heterogeneity exhibited similar variability in grooming syntax. Individual flies observed on consecutive days also showed grooming sequence variability. Standardization of sensory input using optogenetics reduced but did not eliminate this variability. In aggregate, these data suggest that sequence variability may be a conserved feature of grooming behavior itself. These results also demonstrate that large genetic differences result in distinguishable grooming phenotypes (variation), but that genetic heterogeneity within a population does not necessarily correspond to an increase in the range of grooming behavior (variability).",

    "abstract": "Disruption of essential genes leads to pregnancy loss, early lethality, or severe disease. Current methods to predict genes that underlie severe phenotypes include knockout animal model systems, evolutionary conservation, and variation intolerance metrics. With existing methods, human lethal genes are missed due to interspecies differences or paucity of gene characterization. We analyzed global gene expression in stages of early human development (1-cell to the blastocyst). These data were integrated with all 4049 current murine knockout phenotypes, genome-wide evolutionary gene conservation, and human genic intolerance metrics. We found that currently established human essential genes and orthologs of murine essential genes demonstrate higher gene expression across developmental stages compared to non-essential genes (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<8.5e-10), indicating that higher expression correlates with essentiality. Of 1438 unique genes candidates with the highest expression, an estimated 1115 (78%) have not yet been associated with human disease and are thus novel candidates. The essential gene candidates concur with four prediction metrics, further supporting essentiality. We also assessed gene-specific expression changes during early development for their ability to predict essentiality. Genes that increase in expression were more likely to be essential (Fishers exact test, p<2.4e-06), suggesting that dynamic temporal expression during development may be particularly important. We find that embryonic gene expression can be used to prioritize genes that currently lack a Mendelian phenotype. Human embryonic gene expression is readily available, and applied as a novel tool, it may identify highly conserved processes vital in development.",
