    "abstract": "We describe a fluidic X-ray visualized strain indicator under applied load (X-VISUAL) to quantify orthopedic plate strain and inform rehabilitative care. This sensor uses a liquid-level gauge with hydro-mechanical amplification and is visualized in plain radiographs which are routinely acquired during patient recovery to find pathologies but are usually insufficient to quantify fracture stiffness. The sensor has two components: a stainless-steel lever which attaches to the plate, and an acrylic fluidic component which sits between the plate and lever. The fluidic component has a reservoir filled with radio-dense solution and an adjoining capillary wherein the fluid level is measured. When the plate bends under load, the lever squeezes the reservoir, which pushes the fluid along the channel. A tibial osteotomy model (5 mm gap) was used to simulate an unstable fracture, and allograft repair used to simulate a stiffer healed fracture. A cadaveric tibia and a mechanically equivalent composite tibia mimic were cyclically loaded five times (0 - 400 N axial force) while fluid displacement was measured from radiographs. The sensor displayed reversible and repeatable behavior with a slope of 0.096 mm/kg and fluid level noise of 50 to 80 micrometers (equivalent to 5-10 N). The allograft-repaired composite fracture was 13 times stiffer than the unstable fracture. An analysis of prior external fracture fixation studies and fatigue curves for internal plates indicates that the threshold for safe weight bearing should be 1/5th -1/10th of the initial bending for an unstable fracture. The precision of our device (<2% body weight) should thus be sufficient to track fracture healing from unstable through safe weight bearing.",

    "abstract": "Glassy dynamics in a confluent monolayer is indispensable in morphogenesis, wound healing, bronchial asthma, and many others; a detailed theoretical understanding for such a system is, therefore, important. We combine numerical simulations of a cellular Potts model and an analytical study based on random first order transition (RFOT) theory of glass, develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for a confluent glassy system, and show that glassiness is controlled by the underlying disordered energy landscape. Our study elucidates the crucial role of geometric constraints in bringing about two distinct regimes in the dynamics, as the target perimeter P0 is varied. The extended RFOT theory provides a number of testable predictions that we verify in our simulations. The unusual sub-Arrhenius relaxation results from the distinctive interaction potential arising from the perimeter constraint in a regime controlled by geometric restriction. Fragility of the system decreases with increasing P0 in the low-P0 regime, whereas the dynamics is independent of P0 in the other regime. The mechanism, controlling glassiness in a confluent system, is different in our study in comparison with vertex model simulations, and can be tested in experiments.",

    "abstract": "Interpersonal synchrony is a widely studied phenomenon. A great challenge is to statistically capture the dynamics of social interactions with fluctuating levels of synchrony and varying delays between responses of individuals. Windowed Cross-Correlation analysis accounts for both characteristics by segmenting the time series into smaller windows and shifting the segments of two interacting individuals away from each other up to a maximum lag. Despite evidence showing that these parameters affect the estimated synchrony level, there is a lack of guidelines on which parameter configurations to use. The current study aimed to close this knowledge gap by comparing the effect of different parameter configurations on two outcome criteria: (1) the ability to distinguish synchrony from pseudosynchrony by means of surrogate data analyses, and (2) the sensitivity to detect change in synchrony as measured by the difference between two within-subject conditions. Focusing on physiological synchrony, we performed these analyses on heartrate, skin conductance level, pupil size, and facial expressions data. Results revealed that a range of parameters was able to discriminate synchrony from pseudosynchrony. Window size was more influential than the maximum lag with smaller window sizes showing better discrimination. No clear patterns emerged for the second criterion. Integrating the statistical findings and theoretical considerations regarding the physiological characteristics and biological boundaries of the signals, we provide recommendations for optimizing the parameter settings to the signal of interest.",

In 126 cognitively normal elderly at risk of AD, we focussed on free-water corrected diffusion measures in the cingulum, posterior cingulum, fornix and uncinate fasciculus. We found higher tissue fractional anisotropy and lower mean and radial diffusivity related to increased A{beta} at the cortical endpoints of the cingulum and fornix. We observed similar but stronger associations in the uncinate fasciculus, but with increased A{beta} and tau at the endpoints of this bundle.

    "abstract": "Anti-IgLON5 disease is a progressive neurological disorder, associated with autoantibodies against a neuronal cell adhesion molecule, IgLON5. In human post-mortem brain tissue neurodegeneration and accumulation of phosphorylated-Tau is found. Whether IgLON5 antibodies induce neurodegeneration or neurodegeneration provokes an immune response remains to be elucidated. To clarify this, we exposed human stem cell derived neurons to patient anti-IgLON5 antibodies.\n\nHuman neural stem cells were differentiated for 14-48 days, and exposed from day 9-14, or day 13-48 to either 1) IgG from a patient with confirmed anti-IgLON5 antibodies; 2) IgG from a healthy person or left untreated. Electrical neuronal activity was quantified using a multi electrode array. Cultures were immunostained for {beta}-tubulin III, phosphorylated-Tau and counterstained with DAPI. Other cultures were immunostained for synaptic proteins PSD95 and synaptophysin. Lactate dehydrogenase release and nuclei morphology analyses were performed to assess cell viability.\n\nSpike rates and quantity of synaptic clusters were significantly reduced in anti-IgLON5 exposed cultures, and the proportion of cells with degenerative appearance was significantly higher for the anti-IgLON5 IgG group. Furthermore, the content of cells displaying accumulation of phosphorylated-Tau was higher for anti-IgLON5 exposed cultures. After five weeks, cultures exposed to anti-IgLON5 IgG contained significantly more dying cells.\n\nIn conclusion, exposure of human neurons to pathological anti-IgLON5 antibodies cause functional impairment, synaptic and neurodegenerative changes, ultimately leading to cell death. This supports autoantibodies as a causative factor responsible for the neurodegenerative changes seen in patients with anti-IgLON5 disease and mimics pathological observations.",

    "abstract": "Until now, no approved effective vaccine and antiviral therapeutic are available for treatment or prevention of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SCoV-2) virus infection. In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 g/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2-SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Several facultative bacterial symbionts of insects protect their hosts against natural enemies. Spiroplasma poulsonii strain sMel, a male-killing heritable symbiont of Drosophila melanogaster, confers protection against some species of parasitic wasps. Several lines of evidence suggest that Spiroplasma-encoded ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are involved in the protection mechanism, but the potential contribution of the fly-encoded functions has not been deeply explored. Here we used RNA-seq to evaluate the response of D. melanogaster to infection by Spiroplasma and parasitism by the Spiroplasma-susceptible wasp Leptopilina heterotoma, and the Spiroplasma-resistant wasp Ganaspis hookeri. In the absence of Spiroplasma infection, we found evidence of Drosophila immune activation by G. hookeri, but not by L. heterotoma, which in turn negatively influenced functions associated with male gonad development. As expected for a symbiont that kills males, we detected extensive downregulation in the Spiroplasma-infected treatments of genes known to have male-biased expression. We detected very few genes whose expression was influenced by the Spiroplasma-L. heterotoma interaction, and they do not appear to be related to immune response. For most of them, parasitism by L. heterotoma (in the absence of Spiroplasma) caused an expression change that was at least partly reversed when Spiroplasma was also present. It is unclear whether such genes are involved in the Spiroplasma-mediated mechanism that leads to wasp death or fly rescue. Nonetheless, the expression pattern of some of these genes, which reportedly undergo expression shifts during the larva-to-pupa transition, is suggestive of an influence of Spiroplasma on the development time of L. heterotoma-parasitized flies. In addition, we used the RNAseq data and quantitative (q)PCR to evaluate the transcript levels of the Spiroplasma-encoded RIP genes. One of the five RIP genes (RIP2) was consistently highly expressed independently of wasp parasitism, in two substrains of sMel. Finally, the RNAseq data revealed evidence consistent with RIP-induced damage in the ribosomal (r)RNA of the Spiroplasma-susceptible, but not the Spiroplasma-resistant, wasp. We conclude that immune priming is unlikely to contribute to the Spiroplasma-mediated protection against wasps, and that the mechanism by which G. hookeri resists/tolerates Spiroplasma does not involve inhibition of RIP transcription.",

Quantifying these effects is critical for predicting the evolution of herbicide resistance and developing management strategies for herbicide-resistant weeds. This study reports the effects of the acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) Trp574Leu mutation throughout the life cycle of the weed feral radish (Raphanus sativus L.). Resistant and susceptible biotypes responded differently to light and water treatments in relation to germination and emergence. Under light exposure, the resistant biotype showed higher germination and emergence, but no differences were found in seed dormancy, germination in darkness and emergence from buried seeds or pods. The resistant biotype showed delayed and reduced seedling emergence relative to the susceptible biotype under rainfed conditions, but these differences between the biotypes were not detected in irrigated soil. The biotypes showed similar relative growth rates and vegetative biomass. However, under wheat interference, resistant plants had 36-46% less total above-ground biomass, 26-47% less seeds per plant, and 36-53% less plant yield than susceptible ones, and these differences were more evident at higher plant density. This study provides a better understanding of the ecological fitness cost associated with the AHAS Trp574Leu mutation in feral R. sativus. The fitness costs could reduce the frequency of the resistant allele in areas untreated with AHAS inhibiting herbicides.",

    "abstract": "If there is abundant mutational and standing genetic variation, most expect that the rate of evolution would be driven primarily by natural selection, and potentially be independent of current variability or variation. Contrary to this expectation, we (H17: Houle et al. 2017 Nature 548:447) found surprisingly strong scaling relationships with slopes near one between mutational variance, standing genetic variance and macro-evolutionary rate in Drosophilid wing traits. Jiang and Zhang (J&Z20: 2020 Evolution https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14076) have challenged these results and our interpretation of them. J&Z20 showed that the method used in H17 to estimate the scaling relationship between variation at different biological levels is uninformative. Using an alternative method, they estimated that the scaling relationship has a slope substantially less than one, and propose a variant of our neutral subset hypothesis to explain this. Here we use simulations to confirm J&Z20s finding that the H17 method for estimating scaling of variances is uninformative. The simulations also show their alternative method for estimating scaling is likely to be seriously biased towards lower scaling relationships. We propose and verify an alternative approach to calculating scaling relationships based on independently estimated variance matrices, which we call the Q method. Simulations and reanalyses of the Drosophilid data set using the Q method suggests that our original estimates of the scaling relationship were close to the true value. We propose an analytical version of the neutral subset model, and show that it can indeed explain any scaling slope by varying assumptions about the pattern of pleiotropy. We continue to regard neutral subset models as implausible for wing shape in Drosophilids due to the likelihood that wing shape is subject to direct selection. Hybrid models in which pleiotropy reduces the available genetic and mutational variation, and a combination of selection and drift controls the change in species means seem more biologically promising.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the patterns of gene expression is key to elucidating the differences between cell types and across disease conditions. The overwhelmingly large number of genes involved generally makes this problem intractable. Yet, we find that gene expression patterns in five different data datasets can all be described using a small number of variables. These variables describe differences between cells according to a hyperbolic metric. We reach this conclusion by developing methods that, starting with an initial assumption of a Euclidean geometry, can detect the presence of other geometries in the data. The Euclidean metric is used in most of current studies of gene expression, primarily because it is difficult to use other non-linear metrics in high dimensional spaces. The hyperbolic metric is much more suitable for describing data produced by a hierarchically organized network, which is relevant for many biological processes. We find that the hyperbolic effects, but not the space dimensionality, increase with the number of genes that are taken into account. The hyperbolic curvature was the smallest for mouse embryonic stem cells, stronger for mouse kidney, lung and brain cells, and reached the largest value in a set of human cells integrated from multiple sources. We show that taking into account hyperbolic geometry strongly improves the visualization of gene expression data compared to leading visualization methods. These results demonstrate the advantages of knowing the underlying geometry when analyzing high-dimensional data.",

While DNA polymerases have different rNMP incorporation rates, little is known whether these enzymes incorporate rNMPs following specific sequence patterns. In this study, we analyzed a series of rNMP incorporation datasets, generated from three rNMP mapping techniques, and obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing wild-type or mutant replicative DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H2 genes. We performed computational analyses of rNMP sites around early and late firing autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) of the yeast genome, from which bidirectional, leading and lagging DNA synthesis starts. We find the preference of rNMP incorporation on the leading strand in wild-type DNA polymerase yeast cells. The leading/lagging-strand ratio of rNMP incorporation changes dramatically within 500 nt from ARSs, highlighting the Pol {delta} - Pol {varepsilon} handoff during early leading-strand synthesis. Furthermore, the pattern of rNMP incorporation is markedly distinct between the leading the lagging strand. Overall, our results show the different counts and patterns of rNMP incorporation during DNA replication from ARS, which reflects the different labor of division and rNMP incorporation pattern of Pol {delta} and Pol {varepsilon}.",

Using isothermal titration calorimetry and gel filtration chromatography, we show that MglC binds MglB in 2:4 stoichiometry with submicromolar range dissociation constant. Using combination of small angle X-ray scattering and molecular docking studies, we show that MglBC complex is formed by MglC homodimer sandwiched between two homodimers of MglB.\n\nIn BriefKapoor et al. report the crystal structure of Myxococcus xanthus MglC, a Roadblock Light Chain 7 (RLC7) family protein, involved in polarity reversal. The structure reveals a distinct orientation of 2 helix compared to other RLC7 proteins. They also demonstrate that MglC binds a GTPase activating protein, MglB, with submicromolar range dissociation constant.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMglC adopts RLC7 fold and has distinct structural features.\nC_LIO_LIMglC interacts MglB to form a stable complex having submicromolar range dissociation constant.\nC_LIO_LIMglC homodimer is sandwiched between two MglB homodimers to form a 2:4 stoichiometric complex.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVancomycin induces exposure-related acute kidney injury. However, the pharmacokinetic-toxicodynamic (PK-TD) relationship remains unclear.\n\nMethodsSprague-Dawley rats received IV vancomycin doses of 300mg/kg/day and 400mg/kg/day, divided once, twice, thrice or 4xdaily (i.e., QD, BID, TID or QID) over 24-hours. Up to 8-samples were drawn during the 24-hour dosing period. Twenty-four-hour urine was collected and assayed for kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Vancomycin was quantified via LC-MS/MS. Following terminal sampling, nephrectomy and histopathologic analyses were conducted. PK analyses were conducted using Pmetrics. PK exposures (i.e. AUC0-24h, CMAX0-24h,) were calculated for each rat, and PK-TD relationships were discerned.\n\nResultsA total of 53-rats generated PK-TD data. A 2-compartment model fit the data well (Bayesian observed vs. predicted concentrations, R2=0.96). KIM-1 values were greater in QD and BID groups (P-values: QD vs TID:<0.002, QD vs QID:<0.004, BID vs TID:<0.002, and BID vs QID:<0.004). Exposure-response relationships were observed between KIM-1 vs CMAX0-24h and AUC0-24h (R2{square}={square} 0.7 and 0.68). Corrected Akaikes information criterion showed CMAX0-24h as most predictive PK-TD driver for vancomycin-induced kidney injury (VIKI) (-5.28 versus -1.95).\n\nConclusionsWhile PK-TD indices are often inter-correlated, maximal concentrations and fewer doses (for the same total daily amount) resulted in increased VIKI in our rat model.",

The role of de novo noncoding variation has been observable as a general increase in genetic burden but has yet to be resolved to individual functional elements. In this study, we assessed whole-genome sequencing data in 2,671 families with autism, with a specific focus on de novo variation in enhancers with previously characterized in vivo activity. We identified three independent de novo mutations limited to individuals with autism in the enhancer hs737. These mutations result in similar phenotypic characteristics, affect enhancer activity in vitro, and preferentially occur in AAT motifs in the enhancer with predicted disruptions of transcription factor binding. We also find that hs737 is enriched for copy number variation in individuals with NDDs, is dosage sensitive in the human population, is brain-specific, and targets the NDD gene EBF3 that is genome-wide significant for protein coding de novo variants, demonstrating the importance of understanding all forms of variation in the genome.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWhole-genome sequencing in thousands of families reveals variants relevant to simplex autism in a brain enhancer of the well-established neurodevelopmental disorder gene EBF3.",

Many analyses of birdsong require time-consuming manual annotation of the individual elements of song, known as syllables or notes. Here we describe the first automated algorithm for birdsong annotation that is applicable to complex song such as canary song. We developed a neural network architecture, \"TweetyNet\", that is trained with a small amount of hand-labeled data using supervised learning methods. We first show TweetyNet achieves significantly lower error on Bengalese finch song than a similar method, using less training data, and maintains low error rates across days. Applied to canary song, TweetyNet achieves fully automated annotation of canary song, accurately capturing the complex statistical structure previously discovered in a manually annotated dataset. We conclude that TweetyNet will make it possible to ask a wide range of new questions focused on complex songs where manual annotation was impractical.",

As part of two-component systems, they are activated by cognate histidine kinases that phosphorylate their Rec input domains. DgcR from Leptospira biflexa is a constitutively dimeric prototype of this class of DGCs. Full-length crystal structures revealed that BeF3- pseudo-phosphorylation induces a relative rotation of two rigid halves in the Rec domain. This is coupled to a reorganisation of the dimeric structure with concomitant switching of the coiled-coil linker to an alternative heptad register. Finally, the activated register allows the two substrate-loaded GGDEF domains, which are linked to the end of the coiled-coil via a localised hinge, to move into a catalytically competent dimeric arrangement. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that the binary register switch mechanism is utilised by many DGCs with N-terminal coiled-coil linkers.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit signals across the cell membrane, forming the largest family of membrane proteins in humans. Most GPCRs activate through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, which involves reorientation of helices and key residues, rearrangement of a hydrogen bonding network mediated by water molecules, and the expulsion of a sodium ion from a protonatable binding site. However, how these components interplay to engage the signal effector binding site remains elusive. Here, we applied information theory to molecular dynamics simulations of pharmaceutically important GPCRs to trace concerted conformational variations across the receptors. We discovered a conserved communication pathway that includes protein residues and cofactors and enables the exchange of information between the extracellular sodium binding site and the intracellular G-protein binding region, coupling the most highly conserved protonatable residues at long distance. Reorientation of internal water molecules was found to be essential for signal transmission along this pathway. By inhibiting protonation, sodium decoupled this connectivity, identifying the ion as a master switch that determines the receptors ability to move towards active conformations.",

Small in-frame insertions or missense mutations in the EGFR gene have recently been identified in a distinct subset of pediatric bithalamic gliomas with a unique DNA methylation pattern.\n\nMethodsHere, we investigated an epigenetically homogeneous cohort of malignant gliomas (n=58) distinct from other subtypes and enriched for pediatric cases and thalamic location, in order to elucidate the overlap with this recently identified subtype of pediatric bithalamic gliomas.\n\nResultsEGFR gene amplification was detected in 16/58 (27%) tumors, and missense mutations or small in-frame insertions in EGFR were found in 20/30 tumors with available sequencing data (67%; five of them co-occurring with EGFR amplification). Additionally, eight of the 30 tumors (27%) harbored an H3.1 or H3.3 K27M mutation (six of them with a concomitant EGFR alteration). All tumors tested showed loss of H3K27me3 staining, with evidence of EZHIP overexpression in the H3 wildtype cases. Although some tumors indeed showed a bithalamic growth pattern, a significant proportion of tumors occurred in the unilateral thalamus or in other (predominantly midline) locations.\n\nConclusionsOur findings present a distinct molecular class of pediatric malignant gliomas largely overlapping with the recently reported bithalamic gliomas characterized by EGFR alteration, but additionally showing a broader spectrum of EGFR alterations and tumor localization. Global H3K27me3 loss in this group appears to be mediated by either H3 K27 mutation or EZHIP overexpression.

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are key players in CNS neuroinflammation and neuroregeneration that may help or hinder recovery, depending on the context of the injury. Although pro-inflammatory factors that promote astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity have been shown to be secreted by reactive microglia, anti-inflammatory factors that suppress astrocyte activation are not well-characterized. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), glial cells that wrap axons of olfactory sensory neurons, have been shown to moderate astrocyte reactivity, creating an environment conducive to regeneration. Similarly, astrocytes cultured in medium conditioned by cultured OECs (OEC-CM) show reduced nuclear translocation of Nuclear Factor kappa-B (NF{kappa}B), a pro-inflammatory protein that induces neurotoxic reactivity in astrocytes. In this study, we screened primary and immortalized OEC lines to identify these factors and discovered that Alpha B-crystallin (CryAB), an antiinflammatory protein, is secreted by OECs via exosomes, coordinating an intercellular immune response. Our results showed: 1) OEC exosomes block nuclear NF{kappa}B translocation in astrocytes while exosomes from CryAB-null OECs could not; 2) OEC exosomes could be taken up by astrocytes and 3) CryAB treatment suppressed multiple neurotoxicity-associated astrocyte transcripts.

    "abstract": "Opioids are perhaps the most effective analgesics in medicine. However, from 1999 to 2018, they also killed more than 400,000 people in the United States by suppressing breathing, a common side-effect known as opioid induced respiratory depression. This doubled-edged sword has inspired the dream of developing novel therapeutics that provide opioid-like analgesia without respiratory depression. One such approach has been to develop so-called  biased agonists that activate some, but not all pathways downstream of the {micro}-opioid receptor (MOR), the target of morphine and other opioid analgesics. This hypothesis stems from a study suggesting that MOR-mediated activation of {beta}2-Arrestin is the downstream signaling pathway responsible for respiratory depression, whereas inhibition of adenylyl cyclase produces analgesia. To further verify this model, which represents the motivation for the biased agonist approach, we examined respiratory behavior in mice lacking the gene for {beta}2-Arrestin. Contrary to previous findings, we find no correlation between {beta}2-Arrestin function and opioid-induced respiratory depression, suggesting that any effect of biased agonists must be mediated through an as-yet to be identified signaling mechanism.",

However, vaccine candidates targeting the NHR have yielded only modest neutralization activities in animals; this inhibition has been largely restricted to tier-1 viruses, which are most sensitive to neutralization by sera from HIV-1-infected individuals. Here, we show that the neutralization activity of the well-characterized NHR-targeting antibody D5 is potentiated >5,000-fold in TZM-bl cells expressing Fc{gamma}RI compared to those without, resulting in neutralization of many tier-2 viruses (which are less susceptible to neutralization by sera from HIV-1-infected individuals and are the target of current antibody-based vaccine efforts). Further, antisera from guinea pigs immunized with the NHR-based vaccine candidate (ccIZN36)3 neutralized tier-2 viruses from multiple clades in an Fc{gamma}RI-dependent manner. As Fc{gamma}RI is expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells, which are present at mucosal surfaces and are implicated in the early establishment of HIV-1 infection following sexual transmission, these results may be important in the development of a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is altered in cancer and aging tissues. The effects of extrinsic factors on DNA methylation remain incompletely understood. Microbial dysbiosis is a hallmark of colorectal cancer, and infections have been linked to aberrant DNA methylation in cancers of the GI tract. To determine the microbiotas impact on DNA methylation, we studied the methylomes of colorectal mucosa in germ-free (no microbiota) and specific-pathogen-free (controlled microbiota) mice, as well as in Il-10 KO mice (Il10-/-) which are prone to inflammation and tumorigenesis in the presence of microbiota. The presence of microbiota was associated with changes in 5% of the methylome and Il10-/- mice showed alterations in 4.1% of the methylome. These changes were slightly more often hypo than hypermethylation and affected preferentially CpG sites located in gene bodies and intergenic regions. Mice with both Il-10 KO and microbiota showed much more pronounced alterations, affecting 18% of the methylome. When looking specifically at CpG island methylation alterations, a hallmark of aging and cancer, 0.4% were changed by the microbiota, 0.4% were changed by Il10-/-, while 4% were changed by both simultaneously. These effects are comparable to what is typically seen when comparing colon cancer to normal. We next compared these methylation changes to those seen in aging, and after exposure to the colon carcinogen Azoxymethane (AOM). Aging was associated with alterations in 18% of the methylome, and aging changes were accelerated in the Il10-/- /SPF mice. By contrast, AOM induced profound hypomethylation that was distinct from the effects of aging or of the microbiota. CpG sites modified by the microbiota were over-represented among DNA methylation changes in colorectal cancer. Thus, the microbiota affects the DNA methylome of colorectal mucosa in patterns reminiscent of what is observed in aging and in colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "How bacteria link their rate of growth to the external nutrient conditions is not known. To explore how Bacillus subtilis modulates the rate cells expand their encapsulating cell wall, we compared the single-cell growth rate to the density of moving MreB filaments under different conditions. MreB filament density scales with the growth rate, and is modulated by the mur genes that create the cell wall precursor lipid II. Lipid II is sensed by the serine/threonine kinase PrkC, which, among other proteins, phosphorylates RodZ. Phosphorylated RodZ then increases MreB filament density, increasing growth. Strikingly, increasing the activity of this pathway results in cells elongating far faster than wild type in nutrient-poor media, indicating slow-growing bacteria contain spare growth capacity. Overall, this work reveals that PrkC functions as a cellular rheostat, tuning the activities of cellular processes in response to lipid II, allowing cells to grow robustly across a broad range of nutrient conditions.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe serine/threonine kinase PrkC modulates both MreB filament density and cellular growth rate by sensing lipid II in Bacillus subtilis.",

    "abstract": "In spite of its medical importance, the genetic mechanisms of bacterial persistence, particularly spontaneous (type II) persistence, remain largely unknown. We use an integrative approach, combining mutant genome analysis, transcriptomics and lipid membrane composition analysis, to elucidate said mechanisms. In particular, we analyzed the genome of the high persistence mutant E. coli DS1 (hipQ), to identify candidate mutations responsible for the high persistence phenotype. Contrary to a recent study, we find no mutation in ydcI. We compared the expression of spontaneous persistent and growing cells using RNAseq, and find that the activation of stress response mechanisms is likely less important in spontaneous persistence than recent reports suggest. It also indicated that modifications in the cell membrane could play an important role. This hypothesis was then validated by the analysis of the fatty acid composition of persister cells of both types, which have markedly different saturation from growing cells and between each other. Taken together, our results indicate that changing membrane composition might be a key process in persistence.\n\nHighlightsRNAseq analysis of spontaneous persistence shows no evidence of stress response\nIdentification of candidate SNPs for hipQ phenotype, excludes ydcI\nMembrane fatty acid composition is involved in both types of bacterial persistence",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA Coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). It has affected the whole world including Odisha, a state in eastern India. Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As per the protocol laid by ICMR and Health & Family welfare of India, all the suspected cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human.\n\nWhole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed.\n\nExcept three isolates, spike region of 32 isolates showed one/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein was identified which depicted a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor compared to the wild type RBD. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates are capable of binding to ACE2 of human, bat, hamster and pangolin.\n\nAs mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The study shows that RBDs of all the studied isolates have binding affinity for all the five species, which suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "1.In contrast to mice or zebrafish, trout exhibits post-larval muscle growth through hypertrophy and formation of new myofibers (hyperplasia). The muscle fibers are formed by the fusion of mononucleated cells (myoblasts) regulated by several muscle-specific proteins such as myomaker or myomixer. In this work, we identified a unique gene encoding a myomixer protein of 77 amino acids (aa) in the trout genome. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree, showed moderate conservation of the overall protein sequence across teleost fish (61% of aa identity between trout and zebrafish myomixer sequences). Nevertheless, the functionally essential motif, AxLyCxL is perfectly conserved in all studied sequences of vertebrates. Using in situ hybridization, we observed that myomixer was highly expressed in the embryonic myotome, particularly in the hyperplasic area. Moreover, myomixer remained readily expressed in white muscle of juvenile (1 and 20 g) although its expression decreased in mature fish. We also showed that myomixer is up-regulated during muscle regeneration and in vitro myoblasts fusion. Together, these data indicate that myomixer expression is consistently associated with the formation of new myofibers during somitogenesis, post-larval growth and muscle regeneration in trout.",

    "abstract": "Pairings between heterologous chromosomes in meiosis can lead to nondisjunction and the production of aneuploid gametes. To minimize these aberrant outcomes, organisms have evolved mechanisms to disrupt such improper pairings prior to orientation and segregation. In the male fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, bivalents segregate to distinct nuclear domains in prophase I, and it has been proposed that the formation of these distinct territories may play a role in disrupting interactions between limited homologies on heterologous chromosomes. To test this, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization to examine pairing between the X chromosome and Dp(1;3) chromosomes in which a segment of the X had been transposed to chromosome 3. We found that 120kb of homology was sufficient to insure nearly complete pairing but was not sufficient to direct merotelic segregation of the paired elements, suggesting that such pairings were being disrupted. We compared the perdurance of X / Dp(1;3) pairings to that of X / Dp(1;Y) pairings (in which homologs are paired),and found that heterologous pairings were disrupted at a higher frequency at the S2b stage of prophase I, the stage at which territory formation is initiated. Our results support the model that movement of bivalents into distinct domains in prophase I provides a mechanism to disrupt pairings between limited regions of homology, and thus may be one means of preventing improper segregation of heterologs in this organism.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of aging in the human heart is challenging due to confounding factors, such as diet and medications, as well limited access to tissues. The laboratory mouse provides an ideal model to study aging in healthy individuals in a controlled environment. However, previous mouse studies have examined only a narrow range of the genetic variation that shapes individual differences during aging. Here, we analyzed transcriptome and proteome data from hearts of genetically diverse mice at ages 6, 12 and 18 months to characterize molecular changes that occur in the aging heart. Transcripts and proteins reveal distinct biological processes that are altered through the course of natural aging. Transcriptome analysis reveals a scenario of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and reemergence of fetal gene expression patterns. Proteome analysis reveals changes in energy metabolism and protein homeostasis. We found that for many protein complexes there is a decline in correlation between their component proteins with age, indicating age-related loss of stoichiometry. Some of the most affected complexes are themselves involved in protein homeostasis, which potentially contributes to a viscious cycle of progressive breakdown in protein quality control with age. In addition, we identified genetic loci that modulate age-related changes in a variety of cellular processes, including protein degradation and sorting, suggesting that genetic variation can alter the rate of molecular aging.",

    "abstract": "The identification and characterization of structural variants (SVs) in clinical genetics have remained historically challenging as routine genetic diagnostic techniques have limited ability to evaluate repetitive regions and SVs. Long-read whole-genome sequencing (LR-WGS) has emerged as a powerful approach to resolve SVs. Here, we used LR-WGS to study 19 unrelated cases with type I Antithrombin Deficiency (ATD), the most severe thrombophilia, where routine molecular tests were either negative, ambiguous, or not fully characterized. We developed an analysis workflow to identify disease-associated SVs and resolved 10 cases. For the first time, we identified a germline complex rearrangement involved in ATD previously misclassified as a deletion. Additionally, we provided molecular diagnoses for two unresolved individuals that harbored a novel SINE-VNTR-Alu retroelement insertion that we fully characterized by de novo assembly and confirmed by PCR amplification in all affected relatives. Finally, the nucleotide-level resolution achieved for all the SVs allowed breakpoint analysis, which revealed a replication-based mechanism for most of the cases. Our study underscores the utility of LR-WGS as a complementary diagnostic method to identify, characterize, and unveil the molecular mechanism of formation of disease-causing SVs, and facilitates decision making about long-term thromboprophylaxis in ATD patients.",

    "abstract": "Accurate molecular mechanics force fields for small molecules are essential for predicting protein-ligand binding affinities in drug discovery and understanding the biophysics of biomolecular systems. Torsion potentials derived from quantum chemical (QC) calculations are critical for determining the conformational distributions of small molecules, but are computationally expensive and scale poorly with molecular size. To reduce computational cost and avoid the complications of distal through-space intramolecular interactions, molecules are generally fragmented into smaller entities to carry out QC torsion scans. However, torsion potentials, particularly for conjugated bonds, can be strongly affected by through-bond chemistry distal to the torsion it-self. Poor fragmentation schemes have the potential to significantly disrupt electronic properties in the region around the torsion by removing important, distal chemistries, leading to poor representation of the parent molecules chemical environment and the resulting torsion energy profile. Here we show that a rapidly computable quantity, the fractional Wiberg bond order (WBO), is a sensitive reporter on whether the chemical environment around a torsion has been disrupted. We show that the WBO can be used as a surrogate to assess the robustness of fragmentation schemes and identify conjugated bond sets. We use this concept to construct a validation set by exhaustively fragmenting a set of druglike organic molecules and examine their corresponding WBO distributions derived from accessible conformations that can be used to evaluate fragmentation schemes. To illustrate the utility of the WBO in assessing fragmentation schemes that preserve the chemical environment, we propose a new fragmentation scheme that uses rapidly-computable AM1 WBOs, which are available essentially for free as part of standard AM1-BCC partial charge assignment. This approach can simultaneously maximize the chemical equivalency of the fragment and the substructure in the larger molecule while minimizing fragment size to accelerate QC torsion potential computation for small molecules and reducing undesired through-space steric interactions.",

The optical signals produced by such experiments can be analyzed by fitting a statistical model. Several software tools exist to fit such models in an unsupervised manner, but their operating system-dependent installation requirements and lack of flexibility impede wide-spread adoption. Here we propose to fit such models more efficiently and intuitively by adopting a semi-supervised approach, in which the user interactively guides the model to fit a given dataset, and introduce FRETboard, a web tool that allows users to provide such guidance. We show that our approach is able to closely reproduce ground truth FRET statistics in a wide range of simulated single-molecule scenarios, and correctly estimate parameters for up to eleven states.

Moreover, we designed FRETboard to be easily extendable to other models, allowing it to adapt to future developments in FRET measurement and analysis.\n\nAvailabilitysource code is available at https://github.com/cvdelannoy/FRETboard.

To better understand cellular heterogeneity in MB we use single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to profile neoplastic and immune populations in childhood MB samples. Neoplastic cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin which is in part due to the effect of chromosomal copy number gains and losses. Harmony alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes and are associated with clinical outcomes, including discrete photoreceptor-like cells in MB subgroups GP3 and GP4 and nodule-associated neuronally-differentiated cells in subgroup SHH.

    "abstract": "Drug sensitivity prediction models for human cancer cell lines constitute important tools in identifying potential driving factors of responsiveness in a pre-clinical setting. Integrating information derived from a range of heterogeneous data is crucial, but remains non-trivial, as differences in data structures may hinder fitting algorithms from assigning adequate weights to complementary information that is contained in distinct omics data. In order to counteract this effect that tends to lead to just one data type dominating supposedly multi-omics models, we developed a novel tool that enables users to train single-omics models separately in a first step and to integrate them into a multi-omics model in a second step. Extensive ablation studies are performed in order to facilitate an in-depth evaluation of the respective contributions of singular data types and of combinations thereof, effectively identifying redundancies and interdependencies between them. Moreover, the integration of the single-omics models is realized by a range of distinct classification algorithms, thus allowing for a performance comparison. Sets of molecular events and tissue types found to be related to significant shifts in drug sensitivity are returned to facilitate a comprehensive and straightforward analysis of potential drivers of drug responsiveness. Our two-step approach yields sets of actual multi-omics pan-cancer classification models that are highly predictive for a majority of drugs in the GDSC data base. In the context of targeted drugs with particular modes of action, its predictive performances compare favourably to those of classification models that incorporate multi-omics data in a simple one-step approach. Additionally, case studies demonstrate that it succeeds both in correctly identifying known key drivers of specific drug compounds as well as in providing sets of potential candidates for additional driving factors of drug sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Sounds like \"running water\" and \"buzzing bees\" are classes of sounds which are a collective result of many similar acoustic events and are known as \"sound textures\". Recent psychoacoustic study using sound textures by [1] reported that natural sounding textures can be synthesized from white noise by imposing statistical features such as marginals and correlations computed from the outputs of cochlear models responding to the textures. The outputs being the envelopes of bandpass filter responses, the  cochlear envelope. This suggests that the perceptual qualities of many natural sounds derive directly from such statistical features, and raises the question of how these statistical features are distributed in the acoustic environment. To address this question, we collected a corpus of 200 sound textures from public online sources and analyzed the distributions of the textures marginal statistics (mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis), cross-frequency correlations and modulation power statistics. A principal component analysis of these parameters revealed a great deal of redundancy in the texture parameters. For example, just two marginal principal components, which can be thought of as measuring the sparseness or burstiness of a texture, capture as much as 66% of the variance of the 128 dimensional marginal parameter space, while the first two principal components of cochlear correlations capture as much as 90% of the variance in over 1000 correlation parameters. Knowledge of the statistical distributions documented here may help guide the choice of acoustic stimuli with high ecological validity in future research.",

It was also reported to protect against ageing-dependent cognitive decline in wildtype and in Alzheimers disease mouse models suggesting a yet to be defined action on neurons of the central nervous system. Here, we purified and identified biologically active compounds from H. erinaceus, based on their ability to promote neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. N-de phenylethyl isohericerin (NDPIH), an isoindoline compound from this mushroom together with its hydrophobic derivative hericene A, were highly potent in inducing extensive axon outgrowth and neurite branching in the absence of serum demonstrating high neurotropic activity. NDPIH also induced enlarged growth cones suggestive of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-like activity. Pharmacological inhibition of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) by ANA12 prevented NDPIH-induced neurotrophic activity providing evidence that NDPIH acts via TrkB receptors to mediate its neurotrophic effect in central neurons. Finally, in vivo treatment with H. erinaceus crude extract and hericene A significantly increased BDNF and downstream pathway and enhanced learning and memory in the novel object recognition memory test. Our results suggest that hericene A can promote BDNF-like activity in neurons in vitro and in vivo thereby enhancing recognition memory.",

Consistent with this, a majority of light and dark zone GC B cells were DAFlo and susceptible to complement-dependent phagocytosis, as compared with DAFhi GC B cells. We could also show that the DAFhi GC B cell subset had increased expression of the plasma cell marker Blimp-1. DAF expression was also modulated during B cell hematopoiesis in the human bone marrow.

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapies (ART) durably suppress HIV replication to undetectable levels - however, infection persists in the form of long-lived reservoirs of infected cells with integrated proviruses, that re-seed systemic replication if ART is interrupted. A central tenet of our current understanding of this persistence is that infected cells are shielded from immune recognition and elimination through a lack of antigen expression from proviruses. Efforts to cure HIV infection have therefore focused on reactivating latent proviruses to enable immune-mediated clearance, but these have yet to succeed in driving reductions in viral reservoirs. Here, we revisited the question of whether HIV reservoirs are predominately immunologically silent from a new angle, by querying the dynamics of HIV-specific T-cell responses over long-term ART for evidence of ongoing recognition of HIV-infected cells. We show that T-cell responses to autologous reservoir viruses persist over years, and that the maintenance of HIV-Nef-specific responses was uniquely associated with residual frequencies of infected cells. These responses disproportionately exhibited a cytotoxic, effector functional profile, indicative of recent in vivo recognition of HIV-infected cells. These results indicate substantial visibility of the HIV reservoir to T-cells on stable ART, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the development of therapeutic approaches to curing HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) is a master regulator of carbon source utilization and contributes to the virulence of numerous medically important Gram-positive bacteria. Most functional assessments of CcpA, including interaction with its key co-factor HPr, have been performed in non-pathogenic bacteria. In this study we aimed to identify the in vivo DNA binding profile of CcpA and assess the extent to which HPr is required for CcpA-mediated regulation and DNA binding in the major human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS). Using a combination RNAseq/ChIPseq approach, we found that CcpA affects transcript levels of 514 of 1667 GAS genes (31%) whereas direct DNA binding was identified for 105 GAS genes. Three of the directly regulated genes encode the key GAS virulence factors Streptolysin S, PrtS (IL-8 degrading proteinase), and SpeB (cysteine protease). Mutating CcpA Val301 to Ala (strain 2221-CcpA-V301A) abolished interaction between CcpA and HPr and impacted the transcript levels of 205 genes (40%) in the total CcpA regulon. By ChIPseq analysis, CcpAV301A bound to DNA from 74% of genes bound by wild-type CcpA, but generally with lower affinity. These data delineate the direct CcpA regulon and clarify the HPr-dependent and independent activities of CcpA in a key pathogenic bacterium.\n\nData sharing and data availabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.",

As an exception, synthesis of the cell-cycle inhibitor Whi5  sub-scales with cell size so that its concentration is lower in larger cells to promote cell-cycle entry. Here, we find that a transcriptional control uncouples Whi5 synthesis from cell size and, screening for similar genes, identify histones as the major class of sub-scaling transcripts besides WHI5. Histone synthesis is thereby matched to genome content rather than cell size. Such sub-scaling proteins are challenged by asymmetric cell division because proteins are typically partitioned in proportion to new-born cell volume. To avoid this fate, Whi5 uses chromatin-binding to partition similar protein amounts to each new-born cell regardless of cell size. Finally, disrupting both Whi5 synthesis and chromatin-based partitioning compromises G1 size control. Thus, specific transcriptional and partitioning mechanisms determine protein sub-scaling to control cell size.",

Ceratopteris richardii is an emergent model for developmental processes in ferns, yet a complete scheme of the different growth stages is necessary. Here, we present a developmental analysis, at the tissue and cellular levels, of the first shoot-borne root of Ceratopteris. We followed early stages and emergence of the root meristem in sporelings. While assessing root growth, the first shoot-borne root ceases its elongation between the emergence of the fifth and sixth roots, suggesting Ceratopteris roots follow a determinate developmental program. We report cell division frequencies in the stem cell niche after detecting labeled nuclei in the root apical cell (RAC) and derivatives after 8 hours of exposure. These results demonstrate the RAC has a continuous mitotic activity during root development. Detection of cell cycle activity in the RAC at early times suggests this cell acts as a non-quiescent organizing center. Overall, our results provide a framework to study root function and development in ferns and to better understand the evolutionary history of this organ.\n\nSummary StatementIn the Ceratopteris root, the apical cell and its derivatives have a high division frequency, suggesting the apical cell acts as a non-quiescent organizing center in the stem cell niche.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic genomes encode multiple RecQ family helicases, including five such enzymes in humans. For many years, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was considered unusual in that it only contained a single RecQ helicase, named Sgs1. However, it has recently been discovered that a second RecQ helicase, called Hrq1, resides in yeast. Both Hrq1 and Sgs1 are involved in genome integrity, functioning in processes such as DNA inter-strand crosslink repair, double-strand break repair, and telomere maintenance. However, it is unknown if these enzymes interact at a genetic, physical, or functional level as demonstrated for their human homologs. Thus, we performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analyses of hrq1{Delta} and sgs1{Delta} mutants. As inactive alleles of helicases can demonstrate dominant phenotypes, we also performed SGA analyses on the hrq1-K318A and sgs1-K706A ATPase/helicase-null mutants, as well as all combinations of deletion and inactive double mutants. We crossed these eight query strains (hrq1{Delta}, sgs1{Delta}, hrq1-K318A, sgs1-K706A, hrq1{Delta} sgs1{Delta}, hrq1{Delta} sgs1-K706A, hrq1-K318A sgs1{Delta}, and hrq1-K318A sgsl-K706A) to the S. cerevisiae single gene deletion and temperature-sensitive allele collections to generate double and triple mutants and scored them for synthetic positive and negative genetic effects based on colony growth. These screens identified hundreds of synthetic interactions, supporting the known roles of Hrq1 and Sgs1 in DNA repair, as well as suggesting novel connections to rRNA processing, mitochondrial DNA maintenance, transcription, and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication.",

In this study, we examined the expression and functional properties of ABCA4 harboring disease-causing missense mutations in the two transmembrane domains (TMDs) of ABCA4. Our results indicate that these mutations lead to protein misfolding, loss in substrate binding, decreased ATPase activity or a combination of these properties. Additionally, we identified an arginine (R653) in transmembrane segment 2 of ABCA4 as a residue essential for substrate binding and substrate-stimulated ATPase activity.

    "abstract": "The periosteal and endosteal surfaces of mature bone are densely innervated by sensory nerves expressing TrkA, the high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). In previous work, we demonstrated that administration of exogenous NGF significantly increased load-induced bone formation through the activation of Wnt signaling. However, the translational potential of NGF is limited by the induction of substantial mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice and humans. Here, we tested the effect of gambogic amide (GA), a recently identified robust small molecule agonist for TrkA, on hyperalgesia and load-induced bone formation. Behavioral analysis was used to assess pain up to one week after axial forelimb compression. Contrary to our expectations, GA treatment was not associated with diminished use of the loaded forelimb or sensitivity to thermal stimulus. Furthermore, dynamic histomorphometry revealed a significant increase in relative periosteal bone formation rate as compared to vehicle treatment. Additionally, we found that GA treatment was associated with an increase in the number of osteoblasts per bone surface in loaded limbs as well as a significant upregulation of Wnt1, Wnt7b, and Ngf in loaded bones. To determine if these effects were exclusively mediated by NGF-TrkA signaling in sensory nerves, we cultured MC3T3-E1 cells for 7 or 14 days in osteogenic differentiation media containing NGF (50 ng/mL), GA (5, 50, or 500 nM), or vehicle (DMSO). After 7 days of culture, we observed increases in osteoblastic differentiation markers Runx2, Bglap2, and Sp7 in response to GA, whereas treatment with NGF was not different than vehicle. Only cells treated with the highest dose of GA (500 nM) had significantly impaired cell proliferation. In conclusion, our study indicates GA may be useful for augmenting skeletal adaptation to mechanical forces without inducing hyperalgesia through actions on both sensory nerves and osteoblasts.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome bisulfite sequencing is currently at the forefront of epigenetic analysis, facilitating the nucleotide-level resolution of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) on a genome-wide scale. Specialised software have been developed to accommodate the unique difficulties in aligning such sequencing reads to a given reference, building on the knowledge acquired from model organisms such as human, or Arabidopsis thaliana. As the field of epigenetics expands its purview to non-model plant species, new challenges arise which bring into question the suitability of previously established tools.\n\nHerein, nine short-read aligners are evaluated: Bismark, BS-Seeker2, BSMAP, BWA-meth, ERNE-BS5, GEM3, GSNAP, Last, and segemehl. Precision-recall of simulated alignments, in comparison to real sequencing data obtained from three natural accessions, reveals on-balance that BWA-meth and BSMAP are able to make the best use of the data during mapping. The influence of difficult-to-map regions, characterised by deviations in sequencing depth over repeat annotations, is evaluated in terms of the mean absolute deviation of the resulting methylation calls in comparison to a realistic methylome. Downstream methylation analysis is responsive to the handling of multi-mapping reads relative to mapping quality (MAPQ), and potentially susceptible to bias arising from the increased sequence complexity of densely-methylated reads.",

    "abstract": "Local unwinding of the collagen triple helix is a necessary step for initiating the collagen degradation cascade in extracellular matrices. A few matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to support this key process, but its energetic aspects remain unknown. Here, we captured the thermodynamics of the triple helix unwinding by monitoring interactions between a collagen peptide and MMP-1(E200A) - an active-site mutant of an archetypal vertebrate collagenase - at increasing temperatures, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Coupled binding and unwinding manifests as a curved relationship between the total enthalpy change and temperature of the reaction, producing increasingly negative heat capacity change ({Delta}{Delta}Cp {approx} -36.3 kcal/molK2). A specially designed solid-phase binding and cleavage assay (SPBCA) reported strain in the catalytically relevant unwound state, suggesting that this state is distinct from the horizon of sampled conformations of the collagenase-susceptible site. MMP-1 appears to blend selected fit with induced fit mechanisms to catalyse collagen unwinding prior to cleavage of individual collagen chains.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=164 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/272104v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e6c94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a9c8aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b3571org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@61c0c5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe unwinding of the collagen triple helix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is critical for collagen catabolism, but how MMPs harness bioavailable energy for this energetically expensive process is enigmatic\nC_LIO_LIRising temperature causes linear increases of the negative heat capacity change associated with the interaction of MMP-1 with a collagenase-susceptible triple-helical peptide, indicating enrichment of hydrophobic contacts during the triple helix unwinding\nC_LIO_LIThe complex of MMP-1 with locally unwound collagen holds considerable structural strain, which becomes relieved upon cleavage of the unwound collagen strand(s)\nC_LIO_LIMMP-1 consumes heat to drive specific (structurally distinct) collagen unwinding by increasing entropy associated with evolving hydrophobic anchor points between the enzyme and the substrate\nC_LIO_LIThe prototypic collagenase MMP-1 appears to blend conformational selection with induced fit, shedding light on the thermodynamic principles by which MMPs trigger collagen breakdown and supporting general mechanistic conclusions concerning conformational changes coupled to protein-protein binding\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Resistance to targeted therapies is an important clinical problem in HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. \"Drug-tolerant persisters\" (DTPs), a sub-population of cancer cells that survive via reversible, non-genetic mechanisms, are implicated in resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in other malignancies, but DTPs following HER2 TKI exposure have not been well characterized. We found that HER2 TKIs evoke DTPs with a luminal-like or a mesenchymal-like transcriptome. Lentiviral barcoding/single cell RNA-sequencing reveal that HER2+ breast cancer cells cycle stochastically through a \"pre-DTP\" state, characterized by a G0-like expression signature and enriched for diapause and/or senescence genes. Trajectory analysis/cell sorting show that pre-DTPs preferentially yield DTPs upon HER2 TKI exposure. Cells with similar transcriptomes are present in HER2+ breast tumors and are associated with poor TKI response. Finally, biochemical experiments indicate that luminal-like DTPs survive via estrogen receptor-dependent induction of SGK3,leading to rewiring of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway to enable AKT-independent mTORC1 activation.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEDTPs are implicated in resistance to TKIs, other targeted therapies, and chemotherapy, but their ontogeny and vulnerabilities remain unclear. We find that HER2 TKI-DTPs emerge from stochastically arising primed cells (\"pre-DTPs\") that preferentially engage either of two distinct transcriptional programs upon TKI exposure. Our results provide new insights into DTP ontogeny and identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "When a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell form an immunological synapse, rapid dynein-driven translocation of the centrosome towards the contact site leads to reorganization of microtubules and associated organelles. Currently, little is known about how the regulation of microtubule dynamics contributes to this process. Here, we show that the knockout of KIF21B, a kinesin-4 linked to autoimmune disorders, causes microtubule overgrowth and perturbs centrosome translocation. KIF21B restricts microtubule length by inducing microtubule pausing typically followed by catastrophe. Catastrophe induction with vinblastine prevented microtubule overgrowth and was sufficient to rescue centrosome polarization in KIF21B-knockout cells. Biophysical simulations showed that a relatively small number of KIF21B molecules can restrict microtubule length and promote an imbalance of dynein-mediated pulling forces that allows the centrosome to translocate past the nucleus. We conclude that proper control of microtubule length is important for allowing rapid remodeling of the cytoskeleton and efficient T cell polarization.",

    "abstract": "While non-coding G-quadruplexes (G4s) act as conserved regulatory elements when located in gene promoter and splice sites, the G4 evolutionary conservation in protein coding regions have been low explored. To address the evolutionary dynamics acting on coding G4, we mapped and characterized potential G4-forming sequences across twenty-four primates gene orthologous. We found that potentially more stable G4 motifs exist in coding regions following a species-specific trend. Moreover, these motifs depicted the least conserved sites across primates at both the DNA and amino acid levels and are characterized by an indel-rich mutational pattern. This trend was not observed for less stable G4 motifs. A deeper analysis revealed that [G>=3N1]4 motifs, depicting potentially most stable G4s, were associated with the lowest conservation and highest indel frequencies. This mutational pattern was more evident when G4-associated amino acid regions were analyzed. We discuss the possibility of an overall conservation of less/moderate stability G4, while more stable G4 may be preserved or arises in a species-specific manner, which may explain their low conservation. Since structure-prone motifs, including G4, have the potential to induce genomic instability, this evolutionary trend may contribute to avoid broad deleterious effects driven by stable G4 on protein function while promoting genetic diversity across close-related species.",

    "abstract": "The human genome encodes five RecQ helicases (RECQL1, BLM, WRN, RECQL4, and RECQL5) that participate in various processes underpinning genomic stability. Of these enzymes, the disease-associated RECQL4 is comparatively understudied due to a variety of technical challenges. However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a functional homolog of RECQL4 called Hrq1, which is more amenable to experimentation and has recently been shown to be involved in DNA inter-strand crosslink (ICL) repair and telomere maintenance. To expand our understanding of Hrq1 and the RecQ4 subfamily of helicases in general, we took a multi-omics approach to define the Hrq1 interactome in yeast. Using synthetic genetic array analysis, we found that mutations of genes involved in processes such as DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and transcription synthetically interact with deletion of HRQ1 and the catalytically inactive hrq1-K318A allele. Pull-down of tagged Hrq1 and mass spectrometry identification of interacting partners similarly underscored links to these processes and others. Focusing on transcription, we found that hrq1 mutant cells are sensitive to caffeine and that mutation of HRQ1 alters the expression levels of hundreds of genes. In the case of hrq1-K318A, several of the most highly upregulated genes encode proteins of unknown function whose expression levels are also increased by DNA ICL damage. Together, our results suggest a heretofore unrecognized role for Hrq1 in transcription, as well as novel members of the Hrq1 ICL repair pathway. These data expand our understanding of RecQ4 subfamily helicase biology and help to explain why mutations in human RECQL4 cause diseases of genomic instability.",

Currently available SHP2 inhibitors target the catalytic site or an allosteric pocket but lack specificity or are ineffective on disease-associated SHP2 mutants. Based on the consideration that pathogenic lesions cause signaling hyperactivation due to increased SHP2 association with cognate proteins, we developed peptide-based molecules with low nM affinity for the N-terminal Src homology domain of SHP2, good selectivity, stability to degradation and an affinity for pathogenic variants of SHP2 up to 20 times higher than for the wild-type protein. The best peptide reverted the effects of a pathogenic variant (D61G) in zebrafish embryos. Our results provide a novel route for SHP2-targeted therapies and a tool to investigate the role of protein-protein interactions in the function of SHP2.",
