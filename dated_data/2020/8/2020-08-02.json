    "abstract": "Background and aimsOncostatin M (OSM) signaling is implicated in atherosclerosis, however the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of common genetic variants in OSM and its receptors, OSMR and LIFR, on overall plaque vulnerability, plaque phenotype, intraplaque OSMR and LIFR expression, coronary artery calcification burden and cardiovascular disease susceptibility.\n\nMethods and resultsWe queried Genotype-Tissue Expression data and found that rs13168867 (C allele) was associated with decreased OSMR expression and that rs10491509 (A allele) was associated with increased LIFR expression in arterial tissues. No variant was significantly associated with OSM expression.\n\nWe associated these two variants with plaque characteristics from 1,443 genotyped carotid endarterectomy patients in the Athero-Express Biobank Study. After correction for multiple testing, rs13168867 was significantly associated with an increased overall plaque vulnerability ({beta}=0.118 {+/-} s.e.=0.040, p=3.00x10-3, C allele). Looking at individual plaque characteristics, rs13168867 showed strongest associations with intraplaque fat ({beta}=0.248 {+/-} s.e.=0.088, p=4.66 x 10-3, C allele) and collagen content ({beta}=-0.259 {+/-} s.e.=0.095, p=6.22 x 10-3, C allele), but these associations were not significant after correction for multiple testing. rs13168867 was not associated with intraplaque OSMR expression. Neither was intraplaque OSMR expression associated with plaque vulnerability and no known OSMR eQTLs were associated with coronary artery calcification burden, or cardiovascular disease susceptibility. No associations were found for rs10491509 in the LIFR locus.\n\nConclusionsOur study suggests that rs1316887 in the OSMR locus is associated with increased plaque vulnerability, but not with coronary calcification or cardiovascular disease risk. It remains unclear through which precise biological mechanisms OSM signaling exerts its effects on plaque morphology. However, the OSM-OSMR/LIFR pathway is unlikely to be causally involved in lifetime cardiovascular disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "The ribosomes common core, comprised of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and universal ribosomal proteins, connects all life back to a common ancestor and serves as a window to relationships among organisms. The rRNA of the common core is most similar to rRNA of extant bacteria. In eukaryotes, the rRNA of the common core is decorated by expansion segments (ESs) that vastly increase its size. Supersized ESs have not been observed previously in Archaea, and the origin of eukaryotic ESs remains enigmatic. We discovered that the large subunit (LSU) rRNA of two Asgard phyla, Lokiarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota, considered to be the closest modern archaeal cell lineages to Eukarya, bridge the gap in size between prokaryotic and eukaryotic LSU rRNA. The elongated LSU rRNAs in Lokiarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota stem from the presence of two supersized ESs, ES9 and ES39. We applied chemical footprinting experiments to study the structure of Lokiarchaeota ES39. Furthermore, we used covariation and sequence analysis to study the evolution of Asgard ES39s and ES9s. By defining the common eukaryotic ES39 signature fold, we found that Asgard ES39s have more and longer helices than eukaryotic ES39s. While Asgard ES39s have sequences and structures distinct from eukaryotic ES39s, we found overall conservation of a three-way junction across the Asgard species that matches eukaryotic ES39 topology, a result consistent with the accretion model of ribosomal evolution.\n\nSignificanceEukaryotes possess longer and more complex ribosomal RNA (rRNA) than Bacteria and Archaea, including eukaryotic-specific rRNA expansion segments (ESs). The origin and evolution of ESs has long remained a mystery. We show that two recently discovered Asgard archaeal phyla, Lokiarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota, contain large subunit rRNA with ESs are \"supersized\" (>100 nt) compared to all other prokaryotes studied to date. Asgard ESs have distinct structures from eukaryotic ESs, but share a common three-way junction out of which the ES grew. Our findings raise the possibility that supersized ESs existed on the ribosomal surface before the last eukaryotic common ancestor, opening the question of whether ribosomal complexity is more deeply rooted than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Aging-associated diseases, including cardiac dysfunction, are increasingly common in the population. However, the mechanisms of physiologic aging in general, and cardiac aging in particular, remain poorly understood. Age-related heart impairment, especially diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF is lacking a clinically effective treatment. Using the model of naturally aging mice and rats, we show direct evidence of increased proton leak in the aged heart mitochondria. Moreover, we identified ANT1 as mediating the increased proton permeability of old cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, the tetra-peptide drug SS-31 prevents age-related excess proton entry, decreases the mitochondrial flash activity and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, rejuvenates mitochondrial function by direct association with ANT1 and the mitochondrial ATP synthasome, and leads to substantial reversal of diastolic dysfunction. Our results uncover the excessive proton leak as a novel mechanism of age-related cardiac dysfunction and elucidate how SS-31 is able to reverse this clinically important complication of cardiac aging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReduced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity resulting in adverse succinate accumulation was previously thought to be relevant only in 0.05-0.5% of kidney cancers associated with germline SDH mutations (categorized  SDH-deficient Renal Cell Carcinoma in the 2016 WHO classification)\n\nResultsWe show that under-expression of SDH subunits resulting in accumulation of oncogenic succinate is a common feature in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors during pathogenesis and progression, with a marked adverse impact on survival in a large cohort (n=516) of ccRCC patients. From a mechanistic standpoint, we show that von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) loss induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) dependent upregulation of mir-210 in ccRCC causes direct inhibition of the SDHD transcript. We demonstrate that reduced expression of SDH subunits is associated with genome-wide increase in methylation and enhancement of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ccRCC tumors, consistent with succinate-induced inhibition of TET activity and increase in invasiveness/ migratory ability of ccRCC cells. TET-2 inhibition-induced global regulatory DNA hypermethylation drives SDH loss-induced enrichment of EMT. SDH subunits under-expression had a striking association with CDHI (E-cadherin) loss in ccRCC tumors, in keeping with succinate-induced CDH1 hypermethylation and under-expression in ccRCC cells. Next, in conformity with recombinant TET-2 fluorescence quenching dynamics with succinate and ascorbic acid (AA, a TET enzyme co-factor), AA treatment led to reversal of succinate-induced inhibition of TET activity, CDH1 hypermethylation and under-expression, as well as enhanced invasiveness in ccRCC cells. Furthermore, using immunohistochemical analysis and artificial intelligence quantitation, we report that ccRCC is characterized by a marked loss of ascorbic acid transporter SLC23A1 [median percent positive cells in ccRCC primary tumors (n=104) and normal kidney cortex (n=7) was 0.7 and 32.4 respectively; p=0.0012]. Lower SLC23A1 was associated with worse survival in ccRCC (TCGA). Lastly, intravenous AA significantly prolonged survival in a metastatic ccRCC xenograft model with increased succinate and reduced SLC23A1 expression.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, these findings strongly indicate that functional SDH deficiency is a pathognomonic adverse feature of ccRCC (which accounts for [~]80% of all kidney cancers), and that the WHO category  SDH-deficient RCC should be re-named  SDH germline mutation-associated RCC. Furthermore, oncogenic accumulation of succinate can be abrogated by TET modulation with AA.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEIn this study, we show that under-expression of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits resulting in the accumulation of oncogenic succinate is a common, adverse, epigenetic modulating feature occurring in a vast majority of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), during pathogenesis and progression. Functional SDH deficiency is therefore a pathognomonic feature of ccRCC (which accounts for [~]80% of all kidney cancers), and not just limited to the 0.05-0.5% of kidney cancer patients with germline SDH mutations. Based on the findings reported, we propose that the  SDH-deficient RCC category in the 2016 WHO classification of kidney tumors be renamed  SDH germline mutation-associated RCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that oncogenic accumulation of succinate in ccRCC can be countered by TET modulation with ascorbic acid, and that ccRCC is characterized by a marked loss of ascorbic acid transporter SLC23A1.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=172 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/188433v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@728d5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f2e24org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e7011org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15f8d33_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract depicting the consequential adverse downregulation of Succinate Dehydrogenase in ccRCC and its central role in oxidative phosphorylation\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Humans are highly attuned to patterns in the environment. This ability to detect environmental patterns, referred to as statistical learning, plays a key role in many diverse aspects of cognition. However, the spatiotemporal neural mechanisms underlying implicit statistical learning, and how these mechanisms may relate or give rise to explicit learning, remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated these different aspects of statistical learning by using an auditory nonlinguistic statistical learning paradigm combined with magnetoencephalography. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were exposed to structured and random tone sequences, and statistical learning was quantified by neural entrainment. Already early during exposure, participants showed strong entrainment to the embedded tone patterns. A significant increase in entrainment over exposure was detected only in the structured condition, reflecting the trajectory of learning. While source reconstruction revealed a wide range of brain areas involved in this process, entrainment in areas around the left pre-central gyrus as well as right temporo-frontal areas significantly predicted behavioral performance. Sensor level results confirmed this relationship between neural entrainment and subsequent explicit knowledge. These results give insights into the dynamic relation between neural entrainment and explicit learning of triplet structures, suggesting that these two aspects are systematically related yet dissociable. Neural entrainment reflects robust, implicit learning of underlying patterns, whereas the emergence of explicit knowledge, likely built on the implicit encoding of structure, varies across individuals and may depend on factors such as sufficient exposure time and attention.",

Yet how these competing signals are integrated is poorly understood mechanistically, raising questions about how to effectively titrate immune responses. Here we find that macrophage phagocytic decisions are regulated by the ratio of activating ligand to inhibitory ligand on targets over a broad range of absolute molecular densities. Using endogenous as well as chimeric receptors, we show that activating:inhibitory ligand ratios of at least 10:1 are required to promote phagocytosis of model antibody-opsonized CD47-inhibited targets and that lowering this ratio reduces Fc{gamma}R phosphorylation due to inhibitory phosphatases recruited to CD47-bound SIRP. We demonstrate that ratiometric signaling is critical for phagocytosis of tumor cells and can be modified by blocking SIRP in vitro, indicating that balancing targeting and blocking antibodies may be important for controlling macrophage phagocytosis in cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The theory of heterochrony provides us with a generalized quantitative perspective on the dynamics of developmental trajectories. While useful, these linear developmental trajectories merely characterize changes in the speed and extent of growth in developmental time. One open problem in the literature involves how to characterize developmental trajectories for rare and incongruous modes of development. By combining nonlinear mathematical representations of development with models of gene expression networks (GRNs), the dynamics of growth given the plasticity and complexity of developmental timing are revealed. The approach presented here characterizes heterochrony as a dynamical system, while also proposing a computational motif in GRNs called triangular state machines (TSMs). TSMs enable local computation of phenotypic enhancement by producing nonlinear and potentially unexpected outputs. With a focus on developmental timing and a focus on sequential patterns of growth, formal techniques are developed to characterize delays and bifurcations in the developmental trajectory. More generally, growth is demonstrated using two conceptual models: a Galton board representing axial symmetry and a radial tree depicting differential growth. These techniques take into consideration the existence of multiple developmental genotypes operating in parallel, which ultimately characterize the exquisite phenotypic diversity observed in animal development.",

    "abstract": "Shelterin is a six-proteins complex that coats chromosome ends to ensure their proper protection and maintenance. Similar to the human shelterin, fission yeast shelterin is composed of telomeric double- and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1, respectively, bridged by Rap1, Poz1, and Tpz1. The assembly of the proteinaceous Tpz1-Poz1-Rap1 complex occurs cooperatively and disruption of this shelterin bridge leads to unregulated telomere elongation. However, how this biophysical property of bridge assembly is integrated into shelterin function is not known. Here, utilizing synthetic bridges with a range of binding properties, we find that synthetic shelterin bridge lacking cooperativity requires a linker pair that matches the native bridge in complex lifespan but has dramatically higher affinity. We find that cooperative assembly confers kinetic properties on the shelterin bridge allowing disassembly to function as a molecular timer, regulating the duration of the telomere open state, and consequently telomere lengthening to achieve a defined species-specific length range.",

    "abstract": "Life prospers despite adverse conditions in many unpredictable dimensions. This requires that cellular processes work reliably, that is they are robust against many kinds of perturbations. For example, a cellular decision to differentiate should be stable despite changes in metabolic conditions and stochasticity due to thermal noise. For evolutionary stability, the same differentiation switch should function despite mutations or the evolution of further regulatory inputs. We asked how cellular decision making responds to these three forms of perturbation, expressed in chemical terms as rate parameters, stochasticity, and reaction topology. Remarkably, we found that there was no correlation between noise robustness and either of the others and only a weak correlation between robustness to parameters and topology. Thus, a given chemical switch could be robust to noise yet sensitive to parametric or topological changes. However, we found families of reaction topologies derived from a common core bistable with symmetric feedback loops, which retained bistability despite the removal of reactions or substantially changing parameters. We propose that evolution involving chemical switches must navigate a complex landscape involving multiple forms of robustness, and the only way for a given switch to have a systematic advantage in robustness is to come from a  good family of mirrorsymmetric topologies.\n\nSignificance StatementLife endures despite metabolic fluctuations and environmental assaults. For the thousands of cellular decisions to continue to work, they must be robust to these perturbations. Many cellular decisions are made and stored by chemical switches, which like light switches retain their state - on or off - even after the trigger is gone. We computationally explored what makes chemical switches robust. It turns out that some are robust to thermal noise, others to mutations that disable part of the switch, or to changes in chemical conditions. Surprisingly, these different forms of robustness are mostly independent. However, chemical switches come in families built around core reactions, and these families tend to score high or low on several measures of robustness.",

It is well known that osteogenic cells support osteoclastogenesis via synthesizing RANKL. Interestingly, our recently identified bone marrow mesenchymal cell population--marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs) that form a multi-dimensional cell network in bone--was computationally demonstrated to be the most interactive with monocyte-macrophage lineage cells through highly and specifically expressing several osteoclast regulatory factors, including RANKL. Using an adipocyte-specific Adipoq-Cre to label MALPs, we demonstrated that mice with RANKL deficiency in MALPs have a drastic increase of trabecular bone mass in long bones and vertebrae starting from 1 month of age but that their cortical bone is normal. This phenotype was accompanied by diminished osteoclast number and attenuated bone formation at the trabecular bone surface. Reduced RANKL signaling in calvarial MALPs also abolished osteolytic lesions after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections. Furthermore, in ovariectomized mice, elevated bone resorption was partially attenuated by RANKL deficiency in MALPs. In summary, our studies identified MALPs as a critical player in controlling bone remodeling during normal bone metabolism and pathological bone loss in a RANKL-dependent fashion.",

    "abstract": "Protein expression and degradation are fundamental to cell function and physiological status of organisms. Interfering with protein expression not only provides powerful strategies to analyze the function of proteins but also inspires effective treatment methods for diseases caused by protein dysfunction. Recently, harnessing the power of the ubiquitin-proteasome system for targeted protein degradation (TPD) has become the focus of researches. Over the past two decades, TPD technologies, such as E3 ligase modification, PROTACs, and the Trim-Away method, have successfully re-oriented the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and thus degraded many pathogenic proteins and even \"undruggable\" targets. However, A low-cost, convenient, and modularized TPD method is currently not available. Herein, we proposed a synthetic biology TPD method, termed Predator, by integrating the classic function of E3 ligase Trim21 and the expression of a bifunctional fusion protein that links Trim21 and the target protein, which leads to the formation of a ternary complex inside mammalian cells and therefore induce the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of the target protein. We first proved this concept by using nanobody and scFv as the targeting module for the Predator system to degrade free GFP and membrane protein ErbB3, respectively. Then, we give an example of how the engineered Predator system can be developed towards biomedical solutions in the context of diabetes mellitus. Ligands-receptor interaction and adenovirus-mediated gene delivery were introduced to the Predator system, and we found this bifunctional fusion protein, in which glucagon was selected to function as the targeting module, downregulated the endogenous glucagon receptor (GCGR) and attenuated glucagon-stimulated glucose production in primary hepatocytes. Although preliminarily, our results showed that this Predator system is a highly modularized and convenient TPD method with good potential for both fundamental researches and clinical usage.\n\nGraphic abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/231787v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21e152org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4ff069org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@309d74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b1653d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomes encode for organisms and thus genome synthesis implies the possibility of organismal synthesis, including the synthesis of organisms without constraint to lineage. Current genome-scale engineering projects are focused on minimization, refactoring, or recoding within the context of existing natural lineages. Minicells arise naturally as anucleate cells that are devoid of heritable genetic material but are capable of gene expression. Thus, minicells may serve as a useful starting point for developing lineage-agnostic organisms encoded by newly-designed synthetic genomes. However, the composition and expression capacity of minicells is fixed at the time of their formation. The possibility of reestablishing cellular growth and division starting from minicells and entirely heterologous synthetic genomes is unknown.\n\nResultsWe observed expression and segregation of functional proteins among mixed populations of reproducing cells and so-derived anucleate minicells via fluorescence microscopy. By adapting and integrating established methods of preparation and purification we were able to isolate minicells from a growing population of progenitor cells with a purity of at least 500 minicells per progenitor. We then used heterologous expression of plasmid-encoded green fluorescent protein to estimate the absolute expression capacity of minicells. We found that minicells can support the formation of 4.9 {+/-} 4.6 x 108 peptide bonds prior to exhausting their initial intrinsic expression capacity.\n\nConclusionsMinicells can be produced in large numbers with high purity and can also harbor and express engineered plasmids. The observed variation in minicell gene expression capacity suggests that about 13% of gene-expressing minicells can support the formation of more than one-billion peptide bonds, an amount sufficient to replicate known prokaryotic proteomes. Stated differently, while most minicells would require a sophisticated genetic  boot program to first increase minicell-specific expression capacity sufficient to instantiate newly reproducing lineages, a subset of minicells may be able to directly support whole genome, lineage-agnostic organism engineering.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphPlasmid persistence in bacterial populations is strongly influenced by the fitness effects associated with plasmid carriage. However, plasmid fitness effects in wild-type bacterial hosts remain largely unexplored. In this study, we determined the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) for the major antibiotic resistance plasmid pOXA-48 in wild-type, ecologically compatible enterobacterial isolates from the human gut microbiota. Our results show that although pOXA-48 produced an overall reduction in bacterial fitness, the DFE was dominated by quasi-neutral effects, and beneficial effects were observed in several isolates. Incorporating these data into a simple population dynamics model revealed a new set of conditions for plasmid stability in bacterial communities, with plasmid persistence increasing with bacterial diversity and becoming less dependent on conjugation. Moreover, genomic results showed a link between plasmid fitness effects and bacterial phylogeny, helping to explain pOXA-48 epidemiology. Our results provide a simple and general explanation for plasmid persistence in natural bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets and, likely, via smaller droplet nuclei light enough to remain suspended in the air for hours and contaminate surfaces particularly in indoor conditions. Thus, effective measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10 min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min. Thus, in spite of only a partial decrease of viral RNA, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was completely abolished by the WO3 photocatalysis system by 30 min. These results support the hypothesis that this system could be exploited to achieve SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in indoor environments.",

In many types of serology tests, the sensitivity and the specificity are directly influenced by the quality of the antigens manufactured. Protein purification of these recombinantly expressed viral antigens [e.g., spike and its receptor binding domain (RBD)] is an important step in the manufacturing process. Simple and high-capacity protein purification schemes for spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb, recombinantly expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, are reported in this article. The schemes consist of an affinity chromatography step and a desalting step. Purified proteins were validated in ELISA-based serological tests. Interestingly, extracellular matrix proteins [most notably heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] were co-purified from spike-expressing CHO culture with a long cultivation time.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus possesses the largest RNA genome among all the RNA viruses. Its genome encodes about 29 proteins. Most of the viral proteins are non-structural proteins (NSP) except envelop (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins that constitute the viral nucleocapsid, envelop and surface. We have recently cloned all the 29 SARS-CoV-2 genes into vectors for their expressions in mammalian cells except NSP11 that has only 14 amino acids (aa). We are able to express all the 28 cloned SARS-CoV-2 genes in human cells to characterize their subcellular distributions. The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly cytoplasmic but some are both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Those punctate staining proteins were further investigated by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using specific antibodies or by co-transfection with an organelle marker-expressing plasmid. As a result, we found that NSP15, ORF6, M and ORF7a are related to Golgi apparatus, and that ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, ORF3a distributes in cell membrane, early endosome, endosome, late endosome and lysosome, which suggests that ORF3a might help the infected virus to usurp endosome and lysosome for viral use. Furthermore, we revealed that NSP13 colocalized with SC35, a protein standing for splicing compartments in the nucleus. Our studies for the first time visualized the subcellular locations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and might provide novel insights into the viral proteins biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (H)CQ are well known anti-malarial drugs, while their use against COVID-19 is more controversial. (H)CQ activity was examined in tissue culture cells to determine if their anti-viral benefits or adverse effects might be due to altering host cell pathways. Metabolic analysis revealed (H)CQ inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, likely by sequestering protons needed to drive ATP synthase. This activity could cause cardiotoxicity because heart muscle relies on beta oxidation of fatty acids. However, it might also explain their therapeutic benefit against COVID-19. A new model of SARS-CoV-2 infection postulates virus enters host cell mitochondria and uses its protons for genome release. Oxidative phosphorylation is eventually compromised, so glycolysis is upregulated to maintain ATP levels. (H)CQ could prevent viral infection and/or slow its replication by sequestering these protons. In support of this model other potential COVID-19 therapeutics also targeted mitochondria, as did tobacco smoke, which may underlie smokers protection. The mitochondria of young people are naturally more adaptable and resilient, providing a rationale for their resistance to disease progression. Conversely, obesity and diabetes could exacerbate disease severity by providing extra glucose to infected cells dependent on glycolysis. The description of (H)CQ function presented here, together with its implications for understanding SARS-CO-V2 infection, makes testable predictions about disease progression and identifies new approaches for treating COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The poles of E. coli cells are emerging as hubs for major sensory systems, but the polar determinants that allocate their components to the pole are largely unknown. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel protein, TmaR, which localizes to the E. coli cell pole when phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue. TmaR is shown here to control the subcellular localization of the general PTS protein Enzyme I (EI) by preventing it from exerting its activity by binding and polar sequestration, thus regulating sugar uptake and metabolism. Depletion or overexpression of TmaR results in EI release from the pole or enhanced recruitment to the pole, which leads to increasing or decreasing the rate of sugar consumption, respectively. Notably phosphorylation of TmaR is required to release EI and enable its activity. Like TmaR, the ability of EI to be recruited to the pole depends on phosphorylation of one of its tyrosines. In addition to hyperactivity in sugar consumption, the absence of TmaR also leads to detrimental effects on the ability of cells to survive in mild acidic conditions. Our results argue that this survival defect, which is sugar- and EI-dependent, reflects the difficulty of cells lacking TmaR to enter stationary phase. Our study identifies TmaR as the first E. coli protein reported to localize in a tyrosine-dependent manner and to control the activity of other proteins by their polar sequestration and release.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEIn recent years, we have learnt that bacterial cells have intricate spatial organization despite the lack of membrane-bounded organelles. The endcaps of rod-shaped bacteria, termed poles, are emerging as hubs for sensing and responding, but the underlying mechanisms for positioning macromolecules there are largely unknown. We discovered a novel protein, TmaR, whose polar localization depends on a phospho-tyrosine modification. We show that TmaR controls the activity of EI, the major regulator of sugar metabolism in most bacteria, by polar sequestration and release. Notably, TmaR is essential for survival in conditions that E. coli often encounters in nature. Hence, TmaR is a key regulator that connects tyrosine phosphorylation, spatial regulation, sugar metabolism and survival in bacteria and the first protein reported to recruit proteins to the E. coli cell poles.",

We demonstrate up to 3x improvement in the prediction accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Beyond fluorescence prediction, we demonstrate that single-cell level structural phenotypes of cell cycles are correctly reproduced by the digital multiplexed images, including Golgi twins, Golgi haze during mitosis and DNA synthesis. We further show that the multiplexed readouts enable accurate multi-parametric single-cell profiling across a large cell population.

    "abstract": "The inhibition of antioxidant systems of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) or ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) causes iron-dependent peroxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids that leads to cell death, a process known as ferroptosis. The mechanisms underlying iron-dependent lipid peroxidation are under active debate. Here, we report that two endoplasmic reticulum-residing oxidoreductases, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R1), are responsible for the iron-dependent peroxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids and membrane disruption that executes ferroptosis. Genetic ablation of POR and CYB5R1 or mutations that eliminate PORs electron transfer activity blocked ferroptosis. In vitro enzymatic assays established that POR and CYB5R1 catalyze hydrogen peroxide production by transferring electrons from NADPH/NADH to oxygen, which is then used to carry out iron-dependent lipid peroxidation via a Fenton reaction. The lipid peroxidation reaction catalyzed by POR and CYB5R1 additively disrupts polyunsaturated phospholipid-containing liposomes. Finally, POR knockdown confers significant protective effects during concanavalin A-induced, ferroptosis-associated acute liver injury in vivo. Our study thus indicates that POR and CYB5R1 are the enzymes of the \"oxidant\" system that operates to contravene the antioxidant GPX4/FSP1 systems; the balance between these two systems determines cell commitment to ferroptosis.",

Both were reversed with adoptive mast cell transfer. Further investigation of the later stage immune response in male mice determined a greater sustained pro-inflammatory gene expression profile including the IL-1 cytokine family, IL-6, alarmins, and chemokines. These results highlight mast cells as another important cell type that influences the immune response to pro-regenerative biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a maximum likelihood framework called CellPhy for inferring phylogenetic trees from single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) data. CellPhy leverages a finite-site Markov genotype substitution model with 16 diploid states, akin to those typically used in statistical phylogenetics. It includes a dedicated error function for single cells that incorporates amplification/sequencing error and allelic dropout (ADO). Moreover, it can explicitly consider the uncertainty of the variant calling process by using genotype likelihoods as input. We implemented CellPhy in a widely used open-source phylogenetic inference package (RAxML-NG) that provides statistical confidence measurements on the estimated tree and scales particularly well on large scDNA-seq datasets with hundreds or thousands of cells. To benchmark CellPhy, we carried out 19,400 coalescent simulations of cell samples from exponentially-growing tumors for which the true phylogeny was known. We evolved single-cell diploid DNA genotypes along the simulated genealogies under different scenarios, including infinite- and finite-sites nucleotide mutation models, trinucleotide mutational signatures, sequencing, and amplification errors, allele dropouts, and cell doublets. Our simulations suggest that CellPhy is robust to amplification/sequencing errors and ADO and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under realistic scDNA-seq scenarios both in terms of accuracy and speed. Also, we sequenced 24 single-cell whole-genomes from a colorectal tumor. Together with three published scDNA-seq data sets, we analyzed these empirical data to illustrate how CellPhy can provide more reliable biological insights than most competing methods.

    "abstract": "BackgroundFecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently used to treat recurrent clostridial colitis and other diseases. However, neither the therapeutic mechanism of the FMT nor the mechanism that allows the donor bacteria to colonize the intestine of the recipient has yet been described. Moreover, FMT is a great model for studying the ecology of host-associated microbial communities. This creates the need for experimentation with approaches to metagenomic data analysis which may be useful to the interpretation of observed biological phenomena.\n\nMethodsHere the RECAST (Recipient intestinE Colonisation AnalysiS Tool) computational approach is presented, which is based on the shotgun reads sorting process in accordance with their origin in recipient metagenome. Using the RECAST algorithm, taxonomic/functional annotation, and machine learning, the shotgun metagenomic data from three FMT studies including healthy volunteers, patients with clostridial colitis and metabolic syndrome were analyzed.\n\nResultsAccording to the analysis results, the colonizing and remaining microbial diversity in the post-FMT recipient metagenomic samples is clearly separated from the non-colonizers and lost. It is well explained by higher relative abundance in donor/pre-FMT recipient, Human Microbiome project metagenomes, and taxonomy. Moreover, the colonizing and remaining microbes are associated with lantibiotic and tetracyclines resistance genes.\n\nConclusionBased on obtained results, the previously proposed \"core\" human gut microbiome concept may be elaborated. The top microbes of gut microbiota form \"cores\", which, moreover, are mutually integrable between humans. Also, we assume that redistribution of microbial diversity in post-FMT recipients metagenomes is due to competition of donor/recipient microbes and to host immunity. The associations of top gut microbes with lantibiotic/antibiotic resistance can be related to gut microbiota colonization resistance phenomena or anthropogenic impact.",

    "abstract": "Convergent phenotypic evolution provides some of the strongest evidence for adaptation. However, the extent to which recurrent phenotypic adaptation has arisen via parallelism at the molecular level remains unresolved, as does the evolutionary origin of alleles underlying such adaptation. Here, we investigate genetic mechanisms of convergent highland adaptation in maize landrace populations and evaluate the genetic sources of recurrently selected alleles. Population branch excess statistics reveal strong evidence of parallel adaptation at the level of individual SNPs, genes and pathways in four independent highland maize populations, even though most SNPs show unique patterns of local adaptation. The majority of selected SNPs originated via migration from a single population, most likely in the Mesoamerican highlands. Polygenic adaptation analyses of quantitative traits reveal that alleles affecting flowering time are significantly associated with elevation, indicating the flowering time pathway was targeted by highland adaptation. In addition, repeatedly selected genes were significantly enriched in the flowering time pathway, indicating their significance in adapting to highland conditions. Overall, our study system represents a promising model to study convergent evolution in plants with potential applications to crop adaptation across environmental gradients.",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic vessels have recently been shown to effectively deliver immune modulatory therapies to the lymph nodes, which enhances their therapeutic efficacy. Prior work has shown that lymphatics transport 10-250 nm nanoparticles from peripheral tissues to the lymph node. However, the surface chemistry required to maximize this transport is poorly understood. Here, we determined the effect of surface poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) density and size on nanoparticle transport across lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) by differentially PEGylated model polystyrene nanoparticles. Using an established in-vitro lymphatic transport model, we found PEGylation improved the transport of 100 and 40 nm nanoparticles across LECs 50-fold compared to the unmodified nanoparticles and that transport is maximized when the PEG is in a dense brush conformation or high grafting density (Rf/D = 4.9). We also determined that these trends are not size-dependent. PEGylating 40 nm nanoparticles improved transport efficiency across LECs 68-fold compared to unmodified nanoparticles. We also found that PEGylated 100 nm and 40 nm nanoparticles accumulate in lymph nodes within 4 hours after intradermal injection, while unmodified nanoparticles accumulated minimally. Dense PEGylation also led nanoparticles to travel the furthest distance from the injection site. Finally, we determined that nanoparticles are transported via both paracellular and transcellular mechanisms, and that PEG conformation modulates the cellular transport mechanisms. Our results suggest that PEG conformation is crucial to maximize nanoparticle transport across LECs and into lymphatic vessels, making PEG density a crucial design. Optimizing PEG density on nanoparticle formulations has the potential to enhance immunotherapeutic and vaccine outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in bacteria are often carried on plasmids and these plasmids can transfer AMR genes between bacteria. For molecular epidemiology purposes and risk assessment, it is important to know if the genes are located on highly transferable plasmids or in the more stable chromosomes. However, draft whole genome sequences are fragmented, making it difficult to discriminate plasmid and chromosomal contigs. Current methods that predict plasmid sequences from draft genome sequences rely on single features, like k-mer composition, circularity of the DNA molecule, copy number or sequence identity to plasmid replication genes, all of which have their drawbacks, especially when faced with large single copy plasmids, which often carry resistance genes. With our newly developed prediction tool RFPlasmid, we use a combination of multiple features, including k-mer composition and databases with plasmid and chromosomal marker proteins, to predict if the likely source of a contig is plasmid or chromosomal. The tool RFPlasmid supports models for 17 different bacterial species, including Campylobacter, E. coli, and Salmonella, and has a species agnostic model for metagenomic assemblies or unsupported organisms. RFPlasmid is available both as standalone tool and via web interface.",

The expansion of prokaryotic ribosomal RNAs is much less explored. In order to obtain more insight into the structural variability of these conserved molecules, we herein report the results of a comprehensive search for the expansion sequences in prokaryotic 5S rRNAs. Overall, 89 expanded 5S rRNAs of 15 structural types were identified in 15 archaeal and 36 bacterial genomes. Expansion segments ranging in length from 13 to 109 residues were found to be distributed among 17 insertion sites. The strains harboring the expanded 5S rRNAs belong to the bacterial orders Clostridiales, Halanaerobiales, Thermoanaerobacterales, and Alteromonadales as well as the archael order Halobacterales. When several copies of 5S rRNA gene are present in a genome, the expanded versions may co-exist with normal 5S rRNA genes. The insertion sequences are typically capable of forming extended helices, which do not seemingly interfere with folding of the conserved core. The expanded 5S rRNAs have largely been overlooked in 5S rRNA databases.",

    "abstract": "Erythropoiesis is the most powerful cellular differentiation and proliferation system, with a production of 1011 cells per day. In this fine-tuned process, the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) generate erythroid progenitors, which proliferate and mature into erythrocytes. During erythropoiesis, mitochondria are reprogrammed to drive the differentiation process before finally being eliminated by mitophagy. In erythropoiesis, mitochondrial dynamics (MtDy) is expected to be a regulatory key point that has not been described previously. We described that a specific MtDy pattern is occurring in human erythropoiesis from EPO-induced human CD34+ cells, characterized by a predominant mitochondrial fusion at early stages followed by predominant fission at late stages. The fusion protein MFN1 and the fission protein FIS1 are shown to play a key role in the accurate progression of erythropoiesis. Fragmentation of the mitochondrial web by the overexpression of FIS1 (gain of fission) resulted in both the inhibition of hemoglobin biosynthesis and the arrest of erythroid differentiation, keeping cells in immature differentiation stages. These cells showed specific mitochondrial features as compared with control cells, such as an increase in round and large mitochondria morphology, low mitochondrial membrane potential and a drop in the expression of the respiratory complexes II and IV. Interestingly, treatment with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibitor cyclosporin A, rescued mitochondrial morphology, hemoglobin biosynthesis and erythropoiesis. Studies presented in this work revealed MtDy as a hot spot in the regulation of erythroid differentiation which might be signaling downstream for metabolic reprogramming through the aperture/close of the mPTP.\n\nKey Points-. Excessive fission disrupts erythroid progression, heme biosynthesis and mitochondrial function, keeping cells mostly in progenitors and proerythroblast stage.\n-. Mitochondrial Dynamics signaling for erythroid differentiation involves FIS1 and the mPTP",

    "abstract": "Controlling vertical positioning is a key factor limiting the distance coral larvae can travel, as oceanic currents are faster closer to surface. Currently, the vertical position of coral larvae is assumed to be determined by buoyant, lipid-rich gametes. However, here we show that some, but not all, coral species can control vertical positioning by phototaxis. We first examined the effect of light on the vertical positioning of larvae from five different coral species in the laboratory. We found that larvae from P. verrucosa, but not from other coral species, show phototaxis towards light and accumulate near the surface. This behavior was consistent at any age and at any time during the day. In field experiments, using P. verrucosa larvae at three different depths (1, 7 and 15 m), the accumulation of larvae in the top half of transparent chambers was observed at all depths. However, such behavior failed to occur in dark chambers. We conclude that larvae from P. verrucosa, but not all coral species, accumulate close to the seawater surface as a result of actively swimming towards sunlight. This finding provides a new hypothesis that phototactic behavior is a key factor in regulating vertical positioning for the dispersal of coral larvae.",

We developed a recoded gene-drive rescue system for population modification in the malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi, that relieves the load in females caused by integration of the drive into the kynurenine hydroxylase gene by rescuing its function. Non-functional resistant alleles are eliminated via a dominantly-acting maternal effect combined with slower-acting standard negative selection, and a functional resistant allele does not prevent drive invasion.

In this study, we report the genome sequence of the Chinese plum  Sanyueli, which is known to have a low-chill requirement for flower bud break. The assembled genome size was 308.06 Mb, with a contig N50 of 815.7 kb. A total of 30,159 protein-coding genes were predicted from the genome and 56.4% (173.39 Mb) of the genome was annotated as repetitive sequence. Bud dormancy is influenced by chilling requirement in plum and partly controlled by DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM) genes. Six tandemly arrayed PsDAM genes were identified in the assembled genome. Sequence analysis of PsDAM6 in  Sanyuelirevealed the presence of large insertions in the intron and exon regions. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of PsDAM6 in the dormant flower buds of  Sanyueli was significantly lower than that in the dormant flower buds of the high chill requiring  Furongli plum. In addition, the expression of PsDAM6 was repressed by chilling treatment. The genome sequence of  Sanyueli plum provides a valuable resource for elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of chilling requirements, and is also useful for the identification of the genes involved in the control of other important agronomic traits and molecular breeding in plum.",

To facilitate chronic infection, GHV oncoproteins promote cellular proliferation and differentiation. Aberrant cell-cycle progression driven by viral oncogenes should trigger activation of tumor suppressor p53, unless p53 is functionally deactivated during GHV latency establishment. However, interactions of GHVs with the p53 pathway during the establishment and maintenance of latent infection are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate in vivo that p53 is induced specifically in infected cells during latency establishment by murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68). In the absence of p53, MHV68 latency establishment was significantly increased, especially in germinal center B cells, and correlated with enhanced cellular proliferation. However, enhanced latency was not sustainable, and MHV68 exhibited a defect in long-term latency maintenance in p53-deficient mice. Moreover, IgH/c-Myc translocations were readily detected in B cells from infected p53-null mice indicating virus-driven genomic instability. These data demonstrate that p53 intrinsically restricts MHV68 latency establishment and reveal a paradigm in which a host restriction factor provides a long-term benefit to a chronic pathogen by limiting infection-associated damage.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a global health problem that was estimated to be the 7th leading cause of death worldwide in 2016. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is classically associated with genetic and environmental factors, however recent studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiome, which is altered in T2DM patients, is also likely to play a significant role in disease development. Despite this, the identity of microbiome-derived metabolites that influence T2DM onset and/or progression remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that a serum biomarker for T2DM, previously of unknown structure and origin, is actually two microbiome-derived metabolites, 3-methyl-4-(trimethylammonio)butanoate (3M-4-TMAB) and 4-(trimethylammonio)pentanoate (4-TMAP). These metabolites are produced by the Lachnospiraceae family of bacteria, which are highly prevalent in the gut microbiome of T2DM patients and are associated with high dietary fat intake. Treatment of human liver cells with 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP results in a distinct change in the acylcarnitine profile in these cells and significantly reduced their insulin sensitivity; both indicators of T2DM. These results provide evidence of a mechanistic link between gut microbiome derived metabolites and T2DM.",

Through CRISPR and restriction enzyme-based in vivo and in vitro modeling, we identified that the main mechanism leading to the formation of non-canonical genome particles occurred through nonhomologous end joining of fragmented vector genomes caused by genome lesions or DNA breaks that were generated by the host cell/environment. The results of this study advance our understanding of AAV vectors and provide new clues on improving vector efficiency and safety profile for use in human gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have emerged as a new class of drugs to treat a wide range of diseases, including neurological indications. Spinraza, an ASO that modulates splicing of SMN2 RNA, has shown profound disease modifying effects in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients, energizing the field to develop ASOs for other neurological diseases. While SMA specifically affects spinal motor neurons, other neurological diseases affect different central nervous system (CNS) regions, neuronal, and non-neuronal cells. Therefore, it is critically important to characterize ASO distribution and activity in all major CNS structures and cell types to have a better understanding of which neurological diseases are amenable to ASO therapy. Here we present for the first time the atlas of ASO distribution and activity in the CNS of mice, rats, and non-human primates (NHP), species commonly used in preclinical therapeutic development. Following central administration of an ASO to rodents, we observe widespread distribution and robust activity throughout the CNS in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. This is also the case in NHP, despite a larger CNS volume and more complex neuroarchitecture. Our results demonstrate that ASO drugs are well suited for treating a wide range of neurological diseases for which no effective treatments are available.",

    "abstract": "A new family of Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs) has been developed based on inter-molecular Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). To test the hypothesis that the GEVI, ArcLight, functions via interactions between the fluorescent protein (FP) domain of neighboring probes, the FP of ArcLight was replaced with either a FRET donor or acceptor FP. We discovered relatively large FRET signals only when cells were co-transfected with both the FRET donor and acceptor GEVIs. Using a CFP donor and an RFP acceptor, we were able to observe a voltage dependent signal with a Stokes shift of over 200 nm. The intermolecular FRET strategy also works for rhodopsin-based probes potentially improving their flexibility as well. Separating the FRET pair into two distinct proteins has important advantages over intramolecular FRET constructs. First, the signals are larger. Apparently the voltage-induced conformational change moves the two FPs independently thereby increasing the dynamic range. Second, the expression of the FRET donor and acceptor can be restricted independently enabling greater cell type specificity as well as refined subcellular voltage reporting.",

    "abstract": "Palm trees are of immense economic, sociocultural, touristic and patrimonial significance all over the world, and date palm-related knowledge, traditions and practices are now included in UNESCOs list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Of all the pests that infest these trees, the red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) is its primary enemy. The RPW is a category-1 quarantine insect pest that causes enormous economic losses in the cultivation of palm trees worldwide. The RPW synchronizes mass gathering on the palm tree for feeding and mating, regulated by a male-produced pheromone composed of two methyl-branched compounds, (4RS,5RS)-4-methylnonan-5-ol (ferrugineol) and 4(RS)-methylnonan-5-one (ferrugineone). Despite the importance of odorant detection in long-range orientation towards palm trees, palm colonization and mating, nothing regarding the molecular mechanisms of pheromone detection in this species is known. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the first RPW pheromone receptor, RferOR1. Using gene silencing and functional expression in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons, we demonstrate that RferOR1 is tuned to both ferrugineol and ferrugineone and binds five other structurally related molecules. We reveal the lifetime expression of RferOR1, which correlates with adult mating success irrespective of age, a factor that could explain the wide distribution and spread of this pest. As palm weevils are challenging to control based on conventional methods, elucidation of the mechanisms of pheromone detection opens new routes for mating disruption and the early detection of this pest via the development of pheromone receptor-based biosensors.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged ([&ge;]60 s) passive muscle stretching acutely reduces maximal force production at least partly through a suppression of efferent neural drive. The origin of this neural suppression has not been determined, however some evidence suggests that reductions in the amplitude of persistent inward currents (PICs) in the motoneurons may be important. The aim of the present study was to determine whether acute passive (static) muscle stretching affects PIC strength in gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and soleus (SOL) motor units. We calculated the difference in instantaneous discharge rates at recruitment and derecruitment ({Delta}F) for pairs of motor units in GM and SOL during triangular isometric plantar flexor contractions (20% maximum) both before and immediately after a 5-min control period and immediately after five 1-min passive plantar flexor stretches. After stretching there was a significant reduction in SOL {Delta}F (-25.6%; 95%CI = -45.1 to -9.1 %, p=0.002) but not GM {Delta}F. These data suggest passive muscle stretching can reduce the intrinsic excitability, via PICs, of SOL motor units. These findings (1) suggest that PIC strength might be reduced after passive stretching, (2) are consistent with previously-established post-stretch decreases in SOL but not GM EMG amplitudes during contraction, and (3) indicate that reductions in PIC strength could underpin the stretch-induced force loss.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTMotoneurons require an amplification mechanism to operate within the firing frequencies observed during normal motor behaviour. Here we present evidence that this amplification mechanism is reduced after passive muscle stretching.",

    "abstract": "Inflorescence architecture in cereal crops directly impacts yield potential through regulation of seed number and harvesting ability. Extensive architectural diversity found in inflorescences of grass species is due to spatial and temporal activity and determinacy of meristems, which control the number and arrangement of branches and flowers, and underlie plasticity. Timing of the floral transition is also intimately associated with inflorescence development and architecture, yet little is known about the intersecting pathways and how they are rewired during development. Here, we show that a single mutation in a gene encoding an AP1 A-class MADS-box transcription factor significantly delays flowering time and disrupts multiple levels of meristem determinacy in panicles of the C4 model panicoid grass, Setaria viridis. Previous reports of A-class genes in cereals have revealed extensive functional redundancy, and in panicoid grasses, no associated inflorescence phenotypes have been described. In S. viridis, perturbation of SvFul2, both through chemical mutagenesis and CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, converted a normally determinate inflorescence habit to an indeterminate one, and also repressed determinacy in axillary branch and floral meristems. Our analysis of gene networks connected to disruption of SvFul2 identified regulatory hubs at the intersect of floral transition and inflorescence determinacy, providing insights into the optimization of cereal crop architecture.",

Personalized prediction of tumor radiosensitivity is not currently implemented clinically due to insufficient accuracy of existing machine learning classifiers. Despite the acknowledged role of tumor metabolism in radiation response, metabolomics data is rarely collected in large multi-omics initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and consequently omitted from algorithm development. In this study, we circumvent the paucity of personalized metabolomics information by characterizing 915 TCGA patient tumors with genome-scale metabolic Flux Balance Analysis models generated from transcriptomic and genomic datasets. Novel metabolic biomarkers differentiating radiation-sensitive and -resistant tumors were predicted and experimentally validated, enabling integration of metabolic features with other multi-omics datasets into ensemble-based machine learning classifiers for radiation response. These multi-omics classifiers showed improved classification accuracy, identified novel clinical patient subgroups, and demonstrated the utility of personalized blood-based metabolic biomarkers for radiation sensitivity. The integration of machine learning with genome-scale metabolic modeling represents a significant methodological advancement for identifying prognostic metabolite biomarkers and predicting radiosensitivity for individual patients.",

    "abstract": "Long-term storage of information into memory is supposed to rely on long-term synaptic plasticity processes. Detection of such synaptic changes after training in long-term or reference memory (RM) tasks has yet been scarce, variable and only studied on a short time scale. On the other hand, short-term or working memory (WM) is largely known to depend on persistent neuronal activity or short-term plasticity processes. However, processing information into WM could also involve long-term synaptic changes that could be responsible for the erasure/forgetting of items previously stored in WM playing the role of proactive interference. In order to study long-term synaptic changes associated with RM or WM, we trained chronically implanted rats in three different radial maze tasks: a classical RM task and two WM tasks involving different levels of proactive interference. Synaptic responses at the perforant path to dentate gyrus synapse were recorded on a long-time scale (24h) in freely-moving rats after training in one of these three tasks. We found that consolidation of long-term information leads to a delayed synaptic potentiation, occurring 9 hours after RM training and predicting good behavioral performance on the following day. In contrast, optimal information processing into WM triggers a synaptic depression immediately observed after training and lasting 3 hours, that could act as a mechanism for interference erasure/forgetting.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes promote cellular homeostasis through macromolecular hydrolysis within their lumen and metabolic signaling by the mTORC1 kinase on their limiting membranes. Both hydrolytic and signaling functions require precise regulation of lysosomal cholesterol content. In Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), loss of the cholesterol exporter, NPC1, causes cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, leading to mTORC1 hyperactivation, disrupted mitochondrial function and neurodegeneration. The compositional and functional alterations in NPC lysosomes, and how aberrant cholesterol-mTORC1 signaling contributes to organelle pathogenesis are not understood. Through proteomic profiling of NPC lysosomes, we find pronounced proteolytic impairment compounded with hydrolase depletion and enhanced membrane damage. Genetic and pharmacologic mTORC1 inhibition restores lysosomal proteolysis without correcting cholesterol storage, implicating aberrant mTORC1 as a pathogenic driver downstream of cholesterol accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inhibition ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction in a neuronal model of NPC. Thus, cholesterol-mTORC1 signaling controls organelle homeostasis and is a targetable pathway in NPC.",

Influx of Ca2+ occurs both at the stereocillia tips and through the basolateral membrane.

Using functional imaging in rodent OHCs, we report that these two Ca2+ entry sites are closely positioned, but present different regulation mechanisms. Ca2+ spread from MOC synapses is contained by cisternal Ca2+-ATPases. Considered a weak drive for transmitter release, we unexpectedly found that VGCC Ca2+ signals are comparable in size to those elicited by 910 and can be potentiated by ryanodine receptors. Finally, we showed that sorcin, a highly expressed gene product in OHCs with reported Ca2+ control function in cardiomy-ocytes, regulates basal Ca2+ levels and MOC synaptic activity in OHCs.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are typically activated by different cognitive tasks, and also by different stimuli and abstract variables within these tasks. A single neurons selectivity for a given stimulus dimension often changes depending on its context, a phenomenon known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS). It has previously been hypothesized that NMS emerges as a result of training to perform tasks in different contexts. We tested this hypothesis directly by examining the neuronal responses of different PFC areas before and after monkeys were trained to perform different working memory tasks involving visual stimulus locations and/or shapes. We found that training induces a modest increase in the proportion of PFC neurons with NMS exclusively for spatial working memory, but not shape working memory tasks, with area 9/46 undergoing the most significant increase in NMS cell proportion. We also found that increased working memory task complexity, in the form of simultaneously storing location and shape combinations, does not increase the degree of NMS for stimulus shape with other task variables. Lastly, in contrast to the previous studies, we did not find evidence that NMS is predictive of task performance. Our results thus provide critical insights on the representation of stimuli and task information in neuronal populations, which may pave the way to a greater understanding of neural selectivity in working memory.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHow multiple types of information are represented in working memory remains a complex computational problem. It has been hypothesized that nonlinear mixed selectivity allows neurons to efficiently encode multiple stimuli in different contexts, after subjects have been trained in complex tasks. Our analysis of prefrontal recordings obtained before and after training monkeys to perform working memory tasks only partially agreed with this prediction, in that nonlinear mixed selectivity emerged for spatial but not shape information, and mostly in mid-dorsal PFC. Nonlinear mixed selectivity also displayed little modulation across either task complexity or correct performance. These results point to other mechanisms, in addition to nonlinear mixed selectivity, to represent complex information about stimulus and context in neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "Information processing in the brain is controlled by quantal release of neurotransmitters, a tightly regulated process. From ultrastructural analysis, it is known that presynaptic boutons along single axons differ in the number of vesicles docked at the active zone. It is not clear whether the probability of these vesicles to get released (pves) is homogenous or also varies between individual boutons. Here, we optically measure evoked transmitter release at individual Schaffer collateral synapses at different calcium concentrations, using the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR. Fitting a binomial model to measured response amplitude distributions allowed us to extract the quantal parameters N, pves, and q. We find that Schaffer collateral boutons typically release single vesicles under low pves conditions and switch to multivesicular release in high calcium saline. Analyzing the variability of quantal parameters, we conclude that the vesicular release probability rather than the number of readily releasable vesicles or their transmitter content determines the potency of individual boutons.",

When subjects judged the duration of a vibration applied to the fingertip (human) or whiskers (rat), increasing stimulus mean speed led to increasing perceived duration. Symmetrically, increasing vibration duration led to increasing perceived intensity. We modeled spike trains from vibrissal somatosensory cortex as input to dual leaky integrators - an intensity integrator with short time constant and a duration integrator with long time constant - generating neurometric functions that replicated the actual psychophysical functions of rats. Returning to human psychophysics, we then confirmed specific predictions of the dual leaky integrator model.

    "abstract": "Adaptive introgression - the flow of adaptive genetic variation between species or populations - has attracted significant interest in recent years and it has been implicated in a number of cases of adaptation, from pesticide resistance and immunity, to local adaptation. Despite this, methods for identification of adaptive introgression from population genomic data are lacking. Here, we present Ancestry_HMM-S, a Hidden Markov Model based method for identifying genes undergoing adaptive introgression and quantifying the strength of selection acting on them. Through extensive validation, we show that this method performs well on moderately sized datasets for realistic population and selection parameters. We apply Ancestry_HMM-S to a dataset of an admixed Drosophila melanogaster population from South Africa and we identify 17 loci which show signatures of adaptive introgression, four of which have previously been shown to confer resistance to insecticides. Ancestry_HMM-S provides a powerful method for inferring adaptive introgression in datasets that are typically collected when studying admixed populations. This method will enable powerful insights into the genetic consequences of admixture across diverse populations. Ancestry_HMM-S can be downloaded from https://github.com/jesvedberg/Ancestry_HMM-S/.",
