    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings demonstrate that iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors from SCA7 patients express molecular and electrophysiological differences that are indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments.",

    "abstract": "The ability to comprehensively profile proteins in intact tissues in situ is crucial for our understanding of health and disease. However, the existing methods suffer from low sensitivity and limited sample throughput. To address these issues, here we present a highly sensitive and multiplexed in situ protein analysis approach using cleavable fluorescent tyramide and off-the-shelf antibodies. Compared with the current methods, this approach enhances the detection sensitivity and reduces the imaging time by 1-2 orders of magnitude, and can potentially detect hundreds of proteins in intact tissues at the optical resolution. Applying this approach, we studied protein expression heterogeneity in genetically identical cells, and performed expression correlation analysis to identify coregulated proteins. We also profiled >6000 neurons in human formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) hippocampus. By partitioning these neurons into varied cell clusters based on their protein expression profiles, we observed different subregions of the hippocampus consist of neurons from distinct clusters.",

    "abstract": "Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone), a nutraceutical flavonoid present in diverse plants, has a backbone structure shared with the flavone backbone, with additional hydroxyl groups that confers its antioxidant properties and effects at the GABAA receptor complex. However, whether these effects are due to the hydroxyl groups is unknown. Here we report the effects of chrysin or the flavone backbone (1 mg/kg) in rats subjected to the elevated plus-maze and the locomotor activity test, as well as in the zebrafish evaluated in light/dark model. Chrysin, but not flavone, increased entries and time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, as well as time on white compartment of the light/dark model in zebrafish. These effects were comparable to diazepam, and were devoid of motor effects in both tests, as well as in the locomotor activity test. On the other hand, flavone decreased risk assessment in the light/dark test but increased rearing in the locomotor activity test in rats, suggesting effects threat information gathering; important species differences suggest new avenues of research. It is suggested that the specific effects of chrysin in relation to flavone include more of a mechanism of action in which in addition to its action at the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex also could be involved its free radical scavenging abilities, which require specific research.\n\nPreprinthttps://doi.org/10.1101/575514;\n\nData and scriptshttps://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/chrysin",

    "abstract": "Dormancy is colloquially considered as extending lifespan by being still. Starved yeasts form dormant spores that wake-up (germinate) when nutrients reappear but cannot germinate (die) after some time. What sets their lifespans and how they age are open questions because what processes occur - and by how much - within each dormant spore remains unclear. With single-cell-level measurements, we discovered how dormant yeast spores age and die: spores have a quantifiable gene-expressing ability during dormancy that decreases over days to months until it vanishes, causing death. Specifically, each spore has a different probability of germinating that decreases because its ability to - without nutrients - express genes decreases, as revealed by a synthetic circuit that forces GFP expression during dormancy. Decreasing amounts of molecules required for gene expression - including RNA polymerases - decreases gene-expressing ability which then decreases chances of germinating. Spores gradually lose these molecules because they are produced too slowly compared to their degradations, causing gene-expressing ability to eventually vanish and, thus, death. Our work provides a systems-level view of dormancy-to-death transition.\n\nShort summaryThis study identifies systems-level quantities that decay during dormancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae spores and thereby reveals the meaning of ageing for dormant yeast spores and shows that they die when their gene-expressing ability is irreversibly lost.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFor a given glucose concentration, a dormant yeast spore has a well-defined probability of germinating (\"germination ability\").\nC_LIO_LIA spores germination ability positively correlates with its RNAP I-III levels and the gene-expression (GFP) level it can realize when the expression is forced without nutrients.\nC_LIO_LIAgeing during dormancy means gradual decreases in germination ability, RNAP levels, and GFP-level realizable when expression is forced.\nC_LIO_LISpores die after sufficiently losing gene-expressing ability and drugs that inhibit gene expression during dormancy shorten spores lifespans (e.g., from months to a day).\nC_LI",

Cortical high frequency events have also been described that co-occur with ripples. Focusing on NonREM sleep after different behaviors, both hippocampal ripples and parietal high frequency oscillations were detected. A bimodal frequency distribution was observed in the parietal high frequency events, faster and slower, with increases in prefrontal directionality measured by Granger causality analysis specifically seen during the fast parietal oscillations. Furthermore, fast events activated prefrontal-parietal cortex whereas slow events activated hippocampal-parietal areas. Finally, there was a learning-induced increase in both number and size of fast high frequency events. These patterns were not seen after novelty exposure or foraging, but occurred after the learning of a new goal location in a maze. Disruption of either sleep or hippocampal ripples impaired long-term memory consistent with these having a role in memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk models have led to significant advances in understanding complex diseases and their clinical presentation. While models like polygenic risk scores (PRS) can effectively predict outcomes, they do not generally account for disease subtypes or pathways which underlie within-trait diversity. Here, we introduce a latent factor model of genetic risk based on components from Decomposition of Genetic Associations (DeGAs), which we call the DeGAs polygenic risk score (dPRS). We compute DeGAs using genetic associations for 977 traits in the UK Biobank and find that dPRS performs comparably to standard PRS while offering greater interpretability. We show how to decompose an individuals genetic risk for a trait across DeGAs components, highlighting specific results for body mass index (BMI), myocardial infarction (heart attack), and gout in 337,151 white British individuals, with replication in a further set of 25,486 non-British white individuals from the Biobank. We find that BMI polygenic risk factorizes into components relating to fat-free mass, fat mass, and overall health indicators like physical activity measures. Most individuals with high dPRS for BMI have strong contributions from both a fat mass component and a fat-free mass component, whereas a few  outlier individuals have strong contributions from only one of the two components. Overall, our method enables fine-scale interpretation of the drivers of genetic risk for complex traits.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale patterns of movement for the Sharp-shinned Hawk (Accipiter striatus), a small forest hawk found throughout western North America, are largely unknown. However, based on field observations we set out to test the hypothesis that juvenile migratory A. striatus caught along two distinct migration routes on opposite sides of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of North America (Pacific Coast and Intermountain Migratory Flyways) come from geographically different natal populations. We applied stable isotope analysis of hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) of feathers, and large scale models of spatial isotopic variation (isoscapes) to formulate spatially explicit predictions of the origin of the migrant birds. Novel relationships were assessed between the measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of feathers from A. striatus museum specimens of known origin and the isoscape modeled hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of precipitation at those known locations. We used these relationships to predict the origin regions for birds migrating along the two flyways from the measured isotope values of migrants feathers and the associated hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation where these feathers were formed. The birds from the two migration routes had overlap in their natal/breeding origins and did not differentiate into fully separate migratory populations, with birds from the Pacific Coast Migratory Flyway showing broader natal geographic origins then those from the Intermountain Flyway. The methodology based on oxygen isotopes had, in general, less predictive power than the one based on hydrogen. There was broad agreement between the two isotope approaches in the geographic assignment of the origins of birds migrating along the Pacific Coast Flyway, but not for those migrating along the Intermountain Migratory Flyway. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for conservation efforts of A. striatus in western North America, and the use of combined hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analysis to track the movement of birds of prey on continental scales.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the genetic basis of genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE) is crucial to understand environmental adaptation in mammals and improve the sustainability of agricultural production. In addition, GxE information could also be useful to predict the vulnerability of populations to climate change.\n\nResultsHere, we present an extensive study investigating the interaction of genome-wide SNP markers with a vast assortment of environmental variables and searching for SNPs controlling phenotypic variance (vQTL) using a large beef cattle dataset. We showed that GxE contribute 10%, 4%, and 3% of the phenotypic variance of birth weight, weaning weight, and yearling weight, respectively. GxE genome-wide association analysis (GWAA) detected a large number of GxE loci affecting growth traits, which the traditional GWAA did not detect, showing that functional loci may have non-additive genetic effects between genotype classes regardless of differences in genotypic means. We also showed that variance-heterogeneity GWAA can detect loci enriched with GxE effects without requiring prior knowledge of the interacting environmental factors. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of GxE genes revealed biological mechanisms by which cattle respond to changes in their environment, such as neural signaling, metabolic, hypoxia-induced, and immune system pathways. Knowledge of these pathways will be important as climate change becomes a burden on animal health and productivity. In addition, ecoregion-specific GxE SNPs detected in this study may play a crucial role in identifying resilient and adapted beef cattle across divergent environments.\n\nConclusionsWe detected novel trait associations with large GxE effects for birth weight, weaning weight, and yearling weight. Functional annotation and pathway analysis uncovered genomic regions involved in response to environmental stimuli. We unraveled the relevance and complexity of the genetic basis of GxE underlying growth traits, providing new insights into how different environmental conditions interact with specific genes influencing adaptation and productivity in beef cattle and potentially across mammals",

    "abstract": "Interruption to gestation through preterm birth can significantly impact cortical development and have long-lasting adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcome. We compared cortical morphology captured by high-resolution, multimodal MRI in n=292 healthy newborn infants (mean age at birth=39.9 weeks) with regional patterns of gene expression in the fetal cortex across gestation (n=156 samples from 16 brains, aged 12 to 37 post-conceptional weeks). We tested the hypothesis that noninvasive measures of cortical structure at birth mirror areal differences in cortical gene expression across gestation, and in a cohort of n=64 preterm infants (mean age at birth = 32.0 weeks), we tested whether cortical alterations observed after preterm birth were associated with altered gene expression in specific developmental cell populations.\n\nNeonatal cortical structure was aligned to differential patterns of cell-specific gene expression in the fetal cortex. Principal component analysis of six measures of cortical morphology and microstructure showed that cortical regions were ordered along a principal axis, with primary cortex clearly separated from heteromodal cortex. This axis was correlated to estimated tissue maturity, indexed by differential expression of genes expressed by progenitor cells and neurons; and engaged in stem cell differentiation, neuron migration and forebrain development. Preterm birth was associated with altered regional MRI metrics and patterns of differential gene expression in glial cell populations.\n\nThe spatial patterning of gene expression in the developing cortex was thus mirrored by regional variation in cortical morphology and microstructure at term, and this was disrupted by preterm birth. This work provides a framework to link molecular mechanisms to noninvasive measures of cortical development in early life and highlights novel pathways to injury in neonatal populations at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorder.",

We identified a potent repression domain in Helix 8 located within the CRA domain, which directly interacted with the Mediator middle domain subunits Med21 and Med10.

However, these aged rats demonstrated different patterns of expression of neural activity markers in brain regions associated with spatial learning, perhaps suggesting neural mechanisms that compensate for age-related brain changes. These prior studies did not investigate the head scanning properties of aged rats that had spatial learning impairments. The present study analyzed head scanning behavior in young, aged-unimpaired, and aged-impaired Long Evans rats. Aged-impaired rats performed the head scan behavior at a lower rate than the young rats.

This flexibility in methodology has led to the publication of several Electroencephalography (EEG) studies recording brain responses in real-world scenarios such as cycling and walking outside. In the present study, we tested the classic auditory oddball task while participants moved around an indoor running track using an electric skateboard. This novel approach allows for the study of attention in motion while virtually removing body movement. Using the skateboard auditory oddball paradigm, we found reliable and expected standard-target differences in the P3 and MMN/N2b event-related potentials (ERPs). We also recorded baseline EEG activity and found that, compared to this baseline, alpha power is attenuated in frontal and parietal regions during skateboarding. In order to explore the influence of motor interference in cognitive resources during skateboarding, we compared participants preferred riding stance (baseline level of riding difficulty) vs their non-preferred stance (increased level of riding difficulty). We found that an increase in riding difficulty did not modulate the P3 and tonic alpha amplitude during skateboard motion. These results suggest that increases in motor demands might not lead to reductions in cognitive resources as shown in previous literature.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative repair of craniomaxillofacial bone injuries is challenging due to both the large size and irregular shape of many defects. Mineralized collagen scaffolds have previously been shown to be a promising biomaterial implant to accelerate craniofacial bone regeneration in vivo. Here we describe inclusion of a 3D-printed polymer or ceramic-based mesh into a mineralized collagen scaffold to improve mechanical and biological activity. Mineralized collagen scaffolds were reinforced with 3D-printed Fluffy-PLG (ultraporous polylactide-co-glycolide co-polymer) or Hyperelastic Bone (90wt% calcium phosphate in PLG) meshes. We show degradation byproducts and acidic release from the printed structures have limited negative impact on the viability of mesenchymal stem cells. Further, inclusion of a mesh formed from Hyperelastic Bone generates a reinforced composite with significantly improved mechanical performance (elastic modulus, push-out strength). Composites formed from the mineralized collagen scaffold and either Hyperelastic Bone or Fluffy-PLG reinforcement both supported human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis and new bone formation. Strikingly, composites reinforced with Hyperelastic Bone mesh elicited significantly increased secretion of osteoprotegerin, a soluble glycoprotein and endogenous inhibitor of osteoclast activity. These results suggest that architectured meshes can be integrated into collagen scaffolds to boost mechanical performance and actively instruct cell processes that aid osteogenicity; specifically, secretion of a factor crucial to inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Future work will focus on further adapting the polymer mesh architecture to confer improved shape-fitting capacity as well as to investigate the role of polymer reinforcement on MSC-osteoclast interactions as a means to increase regenerative potential.",

In India, more than 3 million confirmed cases have been reported although with relatively low death rate of 1.8%. In this study, we sequenced 47 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients of 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), the largest state of India using third-generation sequencing technique. The phylogenetic clustering revealed that no UP sample was aligned with the previously defined USA clade, where the mortality was high. We identified 56 distinct SNP variations in the genomes of UP resulting in a unique mutation rate of 1.19% per sequence, which is greater than the value 0.88% obtained for the rest of India. The relatively less death rate in UP indicates that the mutation in the virus is deleterious. Further investigation is required with larger sample size to determine the degree of virulence vis-a-vis SNP variation.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 and its causative pathogen SARS-CoV-2 have rushed the world into a staggering pandemic in a few months and a global fight against both is still going on. Here, we describe an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the genetic code, to molecular mechanisms based on understanding of RNA replication and its feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information and identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluation of sequence variation patterns as mutation spectrum and its 12 permutations among organized clades tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our findings include: (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation whose abundant second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight and lower hydrophobicity albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance group includes: three negative-strand mutations U-to-C, A-to-G, G-to-A and a positive-strand mutation G-to-U generated through an identical mechanism as C-to-U. (3) A clade-associated and biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of the negative-sense strand synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a bioinformatics platform where emerging mutations are mapped on to mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral proteomes and transcriptomes to provide biological and clinical information after logical convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such thoughts and actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "EEG microstates refer to quasi-stable spatial patterns of scalp potentials, and their dynamics have been linked to cognitive and behavioral states. Neural activity at single and multiunit levels also exhibit spatiotemporal coordination, but this spatial scale is difficult to relate to EEG. Here, we translated EEG microstate analysis to triple-area local field potential (LFP) recordings from up to 192 electrodes in rats to investigate the mesoscopic dynamics of neural microstates within and across brain regions.\n\nWe performed simultaneous recordings from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) during awake behavior (object novelty and exploration). We found that the LFP data can be accounted for by multiple, recurring, quasi-stable spatial activity patterns with an average period of stability of ~60-100 ms. The top four maps accounted for 60-80% of the total variance, compared to ~25% for shuffled data. Cross-correlation of the microstate time-series across brain regions revealed rhythmic patterns of microstate activations, which we interpret as a novel indicator of inter-regional, mesoscale synchronization. Furthermore, microstate features, and patterns of temporal correlations across microstates, were modulated by behavioural states such as movement and novel object exploration. These results support the existence of a functional mesoscopic organization across multiple brain areas, and open up the opportunity to investigate their relation to EEG microstates, of particular interest to the human research community.\n\nSignificance StatementThe coordination of neural activity across the entire brain has remained elusive. Here we combine large-scale neural recordings at fine spatial resolution with the analysis of microstates, i.e. short-lived, recurring spatial patterns of neural activity. We demonstrate that the local activity in different brain areas can be accounted for by only a few microstates per region. These microstates exhibited temporal dynamics that were correlated across regions in rhythmic patterns. We demonstrate that these microstates are linked to behavior and exhibit different properties in the frequency domain during different behavioural states. In summary, LFP microstates provide an insightful approach to studying both mesoscopic and large-scale brain activation within and across regions.",

Genetic deletion or selective inhibition of TRPC5 channels with small-molecule inhibitors protects podocytes in rodent models of disease, but less is known about the human relevance and translatability of TRPC5 inhibition. Here, we investigate the effect of TRPC5 inhibition in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-treated human iPSC-derived podocytes and kidney organoids. We first established that systemic administration of the TRPC5-specific blocker AC1903 was sufficient to protect podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and suppress proteinuria in PAN-induced nephrosis in rats, an established model of podocyte injury and progressive kidney disease. PAN treatment also triggered the Rac1-TRPC5 injury pathway in human iPSC-derived podocytes and kidney organoids. TRPC5 current was recorded in human iPSC-derived podocytes, and was blocked by AC1903. The TRPC5 blocker also reversed the effects of PAN-induced injury in human podocytes in both 2D and 3D culture systems. Taken together, these results revealed the relevance of the TRPC5-Rac1 pathway in human kidney tissue highlighting the potential of this therapeutic strategy for patients.",

Detailed genetic analyses of HIV-1 env gene from 12 in utero transmission pairs show that most infections (67%) occur within two months from childbirth. In addition, env sequences from long-term infected fetuses were highly divergent and formed separate phylogenetic lineages from their cognate maternal viruses. Host selection sites unique to infant viruses were identified in regions frequently targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies and T cell immune responses. The identification of unique selection sites in the env gene of fetal viruses indicates that the immune system in fetuses is capable of exerting selection pressure on viral evolution. Studying selection and evolution of HIV-1 or other viruses in fetuses can be an alternative approach to investigate adaptive immunity in fetuses.",

Manipulation of endoderm NO signaling demonstrate a role of NO signaling in the differentiation and proliferation of cardiac progenitors for heart tube formation and cardiac heart field development.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes compartmentalize metabolic pathways into sub-cellular domains, but the role of inter-organelle contacts in organizing metabolic reactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in response to acute glucose restriction (AGR) yeast undergo metabolic remodeling of their mevalonate pathway that is spatially coordinated at nucleus-vacuole junctions (NVJs). The NVJ serves as a metabolic platform by selectively retaining HMG-CoA Reductases (HMGCRs), driving mevalonate pathway flux in an Upc2-dependent manner. AGR-induced HMGCR compartmentalization enhances mevalonate metabolism and sterol-ester biosynthesis that generates lipid droplets (LDs) with liquid-crystalline sub-architecture. Loss of NVJ-dependent HMGCR partitioning affects yeast growth, but can be bypassed by artificially multimerizing HMGCRs, indicating NVJ compartmentalization enhances mevalonate pathway flux by promoting HMGCR inter-enzyme associations. We propose a non-canonical mechanism regulating mevalonate metabolism via the spatial compartmentalization of rate-limiting HMGCR enzymes, and reveal that AGR creates LDs with remarkable phase transition properties.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySpatial compartmentalization of HMG-CoA Reductases at ER-lysosome contacts modulates mevalonate pathway flux",

    "abstract": "Mitotic exit in budding yeast is dependent on correct orientation of the mitotic spindle along the cell polarity axis. When accurate positioning of the spindle fails, a surveillance mechanism named the Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPOC) prevents cells from exiting mitosis. Mutants with a defective SPOC become multinucleated and lose their genomic integrity. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the SPOC mechanism is missing. In this study, we identified the type 1 protein phosphatase, Glc7, in association with its regulatory protein Bud14 as a novel checkpoint component. We further showed that Glc7-Bud14 promotes dephosphorylation of the SPOC effector protein Bfa1. Our results suggest a model in which two mechanisms act in parallel for a robust checkpoint response: first, the SPOC kinase Kin4 isolates Bfa1 away from the inhibitory kinase Cdc5 and second, Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 to fully activate the checkpoint effector.",

Among them, Magnets are small modules engineered from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid by orthogonalizing the homodimerization interface into complementary heterodimers. Both Magnets components, which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners, are photoreceptors requiring simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single-excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28{degrees}C to be functional. Here we overcome these limitations by engineering an optimized Magnets pair requiring neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. We validated these \"enhanced\" Magnets (eMags) by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. eMags represent a very effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.",

    "abstract": "Movement of the cell nucleus typically involves the cytoskeleton and either polymerization-based pushing forces or motor-based pulling forces. In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, nuclear movement and positioning are thought to depend on microtubule polymerization-based pushing forces. Here we describe a novel, microtubule-independent, form of nuclear movement in fission yeast. Microtubule-independent nuclear movement is directed towards growing cell tips, and it is strongest when the nucleus is close to a growing cell tip, and weakest when the nucleus is far from that tip. Microtubule-independent nuclear movement requires actin cables but does not depend on actin polymerization-based pushing or myosin V-based pulling forces. Vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated proteins (VAPs) Scs2 and Scs22, which are critical for endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact sites in fission yeast, are also required for microtubule-independent nuclear movement. We also find that in cells in which microtubule-based pushing forces are present, disruption of actin cables leads to increased fluctuations in interphase nuclear positioning and subsequent altered septation. Our results suggest two non-exclusive mechanisms for microtubule-independent nuclear movement, which may help illuminate aspects of nuclear positioning in other cells.",

MCCs exhibit a characteristic BB orientation and microtubule gradient along the tissue axis, and these intracellular polarities were maintained in the cells lacking Celsr1, although the intercellular coordination of the polarities was partly disrupted. On the other hand, CAMSAP3 regulated the assembly of microtubules interconnecting BBs by localizing at the BBs, and its mutation led to disruption of intracellular coordination of BB orientation, but not affecting PCP factor localization. Thus, both Celsr1 and CAMSAP3 are responsible for BB orientation but in distinct ways; and therefore, their cooperation should be critical for generating functional multiciliated tissues.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid rate of Covid-19 infections and deaths, treatments and cures besides hand washing, social distancing, masks, isolation, and quarantines are urgently needed. The treatments and vaccines rely on the basic biophysics of the complex viral apparatus. While proteins are serving as main drug and vaccine targets, therapeutic approaches targeting the 30,000 nucleotide RNA viral genome form important complementary approaches. Indeed, the high conservation of the viral genome, its close evolutionary relationship to other viruses, and the rise of gene editing and RNA-based vaccines all argue for a focus on the RNA agent itself. One of the key steps in the viral replication cycle inside host cells is the ribosomal frameshifting required for translation of overlapping open reading frames. The frameshifting element (FSE), one of three highly conserved regions of coronaviruses, includes an RNA pseudoknot considered essential for this ribosomal switching. In this work, we apply our graph-theory-based framework for representing RNA secondary structures, \"RAG\" (RNA-As Graphs), to alter key structural features of the FSE of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, using RAG machinery of genetic algorithms for inverse folding adapted for RNA structures with pseudoknots, we computationally predict minimal mutations that destroy a structurally-important stem and/or the pseudoknot of the FSE, potentially dismantling the virus against translation of the polyproteins. Additionally, our microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of mutant structures indicate relatively stable secondary structures. These findings not only advance our computational design of RNAs containing pseudoknots; they pinpoint to key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing approaches.\n\nSIGNIFICANCESince the outbreak of Covid-19, numerous projects were launched to discover drugs and vaccines. Compared to protein-focused approaches, targeting the RNA genome, especially highly conserved crucial regions, can destruct the virus life cycle more fundamentally and avoid problems of viral mutations. We choose to target the small frame-shifting element (FSE) embedded in the Open Reading Frame 1a,b of SARS-CoV-2. This FSE is essential for translating overlapping reading frames and thus controlling the viral protein synthesis pathway. By applying graph-theory-based computational algorithms, we identify structurally crucial residues in the FSE as potential targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing.",

    "abstract": "In bacterial cells, protein expression is a highly stochastic process. At the same time, physiological variables such as the cellular growth rate also fluctuate significantly. A common intuition is that, due to their relatively high noise amplitudes, proteins with a low mean expression level are the most important causes of these fluctuations on a larger, physiological scale. Noise in highly expressed proteins, whose stochastic fluctuations are relatively small, is often ignored. In this work, we challenge this intuition by developing a theory that predicts the contribution of a proteins expression noise to the noise in the instantaneous, cellular growth rate. Using mathematical analysis, we decomposed the contribution of each protein into two factors: the noise amplitude of the protein, and the sensitivity of the growth rate to fluctuations in that proteins concentration. Next, we incorporated evolution, which has shaped the mean abundances of growth-related proteins to optimise the growth rate, causing protein abundances, but also cellular sensitivities to be non-random. We show that in cells that grow optimally fast, the growth rate is most sensitive to fluctuations in highly abundant proteins. This causes such proteins to overall contribute strongly to the noise in the growth-rate, despite their low noise levels. The results are confirmed in a stochastic toy model of cellular growth.",

Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1-5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6-8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to \"up\" RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both \"up\" and \"down\" RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize \"up\" and \"down\" RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only \"up\" RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent \"down\" RBDs, thereby locking spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.",

Although considered primarily a respiratory infection, many COVID-19 patients also suffer severe cardiovascular disease2-4. Improving patient care critically relies on understanding if cardiovascular pathology is caused directly by viral infection of cardiac cells or indirectly via systemic inflammation and/or coagulation abnormalities3,5-9. Here we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We observe that hPSC-CMs express the viral receptor ACE2 and other viral processing factors, and that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects and replicates within hPSC-CMs, resulting in rapid cell death. Moreover, infected hPSC-CMs show a progressive impairment in both electrophysiological and contractile properties. Thus, COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms likely result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2.

    "abstract": "Sensing of pathogens by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces an inflammatory response; controlled responses confer immunity but uncontrolled responses cause harm. Here we define how a multi-modular scaffold, GIV (a.k.a Girdin) titrates such inflammatory response in macrophages. Upon challenge with either live microbes or microbe-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS, a ligand for TLR4), macrophages with GIV mount a more tolerant (hypo-reactive) transcriptional response and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways (i.e., NFkB and CREB) downstream of TLR4 compared to their GIV-depleted counterparts. Myeloid-specific gene depletion studies confirmed that the presence of GIV ameliorates DSS-induced colitis and sepsis-induced death. The anti-inflammatory actions of GIV are mediated via its C-terminally located TIR-like BB-loop (TILL)-motif which binds the cytoplasmic TIR-modules of TLR4 in a manner that precludes receptor dimerization; the latter is a pre-requisite for pro-inflammatory signaling. Binding of GIVs TILL motif to other TIR modules inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling via other TLRs, suggesting a convergent paradigm for fine-tuning macrophage inflammatory responses.\n\nSignificanceTo ensure immunity, and yet limit pathology, inflammatory responses must be confined within the proverbial  Goldilocks zone. TLR4 is the prototypical sensor that orchestrates inflammatory responses through a series of well characterized downstream cascades. How TLR4 signals are confined remain incompletely understood. Using trans-scale approaches ranging from disease modeling in live animals, through cell-based interventional studies, to structure-guided biochemical studies that offer an atomic-level resolution, this study unravels the existence of a  brake within the TLR4 signaling cascade, i.e., GIV; the latter is a prototypical member of an emerging class of scaffold proteins. By showing that GIV uses conserved mechanisms to impact multi-TLR signaling, this work unravels a multi-scale point of convergence of immune signaling of broader impact beyond TLR4.",

Little is known about why manganese is required for virulence or how it impacts the metabolome of streptococci.\n\nObjectivesWe applied untargeted metabolomics to cells and media to understand temporal changes resulting from manganese depletion.\n\nMethodsEDTA was added to a S. sanguinis manganese-transporter mutant in aerobic fermentor conditions. Cell and media samples were collected pre- and post-EDTA treatment. Metabolomics data were generated using positive and negative modes of data acquisition on an LC-MS/MS system. Data were subjected to statistical processing using MetaboAnalyst and time-course analysis using Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM).\n\nResultsWe observed quantitative changes in 534 and 422 metabolites in cells and media, respectively, after EDTA addition. The 173 cellular metabolites identified as significantly different indicated enrichment of purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Further multivariate analysis revealed that the top 15 cellular metabolites belonged primarily to lipids and redox metabolites. The STEM analysis revealed global changes in cells and media in comparable metabolic pathways. Products of glycolysis such as pyruvate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate increased, suggesting that enzymes that act on them may require manganese for activity or expression. Nucleosides accumulated, possibly due to a blockage in conversion to nucleobases. Simultaneous accumulation of ortho-tyrosine and reduced glutathione suggests that cells were unable to utilize glutathione as a reductant.\n\nConclusionDifferential analysis of metabolites revealed the activation of a number of metabolic pathways in response to manganese depletion, many of which may be connected to carbon catabolite repression.",

We found many genes having UCNE, the degree of which are associated with increased oncogenic signaling, proliferation and immune-suppression. The occurrence of UCNE appears to be orchestrated by complex epigenetic and regulatory changes, with transcription factors (TFs) playing a prominent role. To further dissect the regulatory mechanisms, we developed a systems-biological approach to identify candidate TFs, which upon perturbation can offset UCNE and reduce tumor fitness. Applying our approach on TCGA data, we identified 20 putative targets, 45% of which were validated by independent sources. Among them are IRF1, which plays a prominent role in anti-tumor immunity and response to immune checkpoint therapy, ETS1, TRIM21 and GATA3, which are associated with anti-tumor immunity, tumor proliferation and metastasis. Together, our study indicates that UCNE is likely an important mechanism in cancer development that can be exploited therapeutically.",

How this can be organized at enhancers that activate gene expression necessary for differentiation is not well understood. One such example is the patterning of the Arabidopsis thaliana sepal epidermis where giant cell fate specification is associated with the endoreduplication cell cycle. Previously, we identified an enhancer region capable of driving giant cell-specific expression. In this study, we use the giant cell enhancer as a model to understand the regulatory logic that promotes cell-type specific expression. Our dissection of the enhancer revealed that giant cell specificity is achieved primarily through the combination of two elements: an activator and a repressor. TCP transcription factors are involved in activation of non-specific expression throughout the epidermis with higher expression in endoreduplicated giant cells than small cells. Dof transcription factors act via the second element to repress activity of the enhancer and limit expression to giant cells. Thus, we find that cell-type specific expression emerges from the combined activities of two broadly acting enhancer elements.",

The deregulated network is more robust to environmental conditions improving process robustness, which in turn leads to predictable scalability from high throughput small scale screens to fully instrumented bioreactors as well as to pilot scale production.

    "abstract": "Maladaptive operant conditioning contributes to development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Candidate genes have been identified that contribute to this maladaptive plasticity, but the neural basis of operant conditioning in genetic model organisms remains poorly understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a versatile genetic model organism that readily forms operant associations with punishment stimuli. However, operant conditioning with a food reward has not been demonstrated in flies, limiting the types of neural circuits that can be studied. Here we present the first sucrose-reinforced operant conditioning paradigm for flies. In the paradigm, flies walk along a Y-shaped track with reward locations at the terminus of each hallway. When flies turn in the reinforced direction at the center of the track, sucrose is presented at the end of the hallway. Only flies that rest early in training learn the reward contingency normally. Flies rewarded independently of their behavior do not form a learned association but have the same amount of rest as trained flies, showing that rest is not driven by learning. Optogenetically-induced sleep does not promote learning, indicating that sleep itself is not sufficient for learning the operant task. We validated the sensitivity of this assay to detect the effect of genetic manipulations by testing the classic learning mutant dunce. Dunce flies are learning impaired in the Y-Track task, indicating a likely role for cAMP in the operant coincidence detector. This novel training paradigm will provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease and the link between sleep and learning.",

Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting functional diversity is also present along the anterior-posterior axis of the rodent OFC. However, the patterns of anatomical connections that underlie these differences have not been well characterised. Here, we use the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B to simultaneously label the projections into the anterior lateral (ALO), posterior lateral (PLO), and posterior ventral (PVO) portions of the rat OFC. Our methodological approach allowed us to simultaneously compare the density and input patterns into these OFC subdivisions. We observed distinct and topographically organised projection patterns into ALO, PLO, and PVO from the mediodorsal and the submedius nuclei of the thalamus. We also observed different levels of connectivity strength into these OFC subdivisions from the amygdala, motor cortex, sensory cortices and medial prefrontal cortical structures, including medial OFC, infralimbic and prelimbic cortices. Interestingly, while labelling in some of these input regions revealed only a gradient in connectivity strength, other regions seem to project almost exclusively to specific OFC subdivisions. Moreover, differences in input patterns between ALO and PLO were as pronounced as those between PLO and PVO. Together, our results support the existence of distinct anatomical circuits within lateral OFC along its anterior-posterior axis.",

    "abstract": "For most metazoans, oxygen deprivation leads to cell dysfunction and if severe, death. Sublethal stress prior to a hypoxic or anoxic insult (\"preconditioning\") can protect cells from subsequent oxygen deprivation. The molecular mechanisms by which sublethal stress can buffer against a subsequent toxic insult and the role of the nervous system in the response are not well understood. We studied the role of neuronal activity preconditioning to oxygen deprivation in C. elegans. Animals expressing the histamine gated chloride channels (HisCl1) in select cell populations were used to temporally and spatially inactivate the nervous system or tissue prior to an anoxic insult. We find that inactivation of the nervous system for 3 hours prior to the insult confers resistance to a 48-hour anoxic insult in 4th-stage larval animals. Experiments show that this resistance can be attributed to loss of activity in cholinergic and GABAergic neurons as well as in body wall muscles. These observations indicate that the nervous system activity can mediate the organisms response to anoxia.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic transmission relies on presynaptic neurotransmitter (NT) release from synaptic vesicles (SVs) and on NT detection by postsynaptic receptors. Transmission exists in two principal modes: action-potential (AP) evoked and AP-independent, \"spontaneous\" transmission. AP-evoked neurotransmission is considered the primary mode of inter-neural communication, whereas spontaneous transmission is required for neuronal development, homeostasis, and plasticity. While some synapses appear dedicated to spontaneous transmission only, all AP-responsive synapses also engage spontaneously, but whether this encodes functional information regarding their excitability is unknown. Here we report on functional interdependence of both transmission modes at individual synaptic contacts of Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) which were identified by the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bruchpilot (BRP). Consistent with its role in organizing the AP-dependent release machinery (voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and SV fusion machinery), most active BRP-positive synapses (>85%) responded to APs. At these synapses, the level of spontaneous activity was a precise predictor for their responsiveness to AP-stimulation. Both transmission modes engaged an overlapping pool of SVs and NT-receptors, and both were affected by the non-specific Ca2+ channel blocker cadmium. Thus, by using overlapping machinery, spontaneous transmission is a continuous, stimulus independent predictor for the AP-responsiveness of individual synapses.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmunity is energetically costly, but the impact of a metabolically active state on immunity and immune-mediated diseases is unclear. Ly6Chi monocytes are key effectors in CNS autoimmunity with elusive role in priming naive autoreactive T cells. Here we provide unbiased analysis of the immune changes in various compartments during cold exposure, and show that this energetically costly stimulus markedly ameliorates active experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Cold exposure decreases MHCII on monocytes at steady-state and in various inflammatory mouse models, and suppresses T cell priming and pathogenicity through the modulation of monocytes. Genetic, or antibody-mediated monocyte depletion, or adoptive transfer of Th1- or Th17-polarized cells for EAE abolish the cold-induced effects on T cells or EAE, respectively. These findings provide a mechanistic link between environmental temperature and neuroinflammation, and suggest competition between cold-induced metabolic adaptations and autoimmunity as energetic trade-off beneficial for the immune-mediated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Once considered unusual, nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation is now recognized as a conserved feature of eukaryotes. While in animals O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modifies thousands of intracellular proteins, the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii transfers a different sugar, fucose, to proteins involved in transcription, mRNA processing and signaling. Knockout experiments showed that TgSPY, an ortholog of plant SPINDLY and paralog of host OGT, is required for nuclear O-fucosylation. Here we verify that TgSPY is the nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) by 1) complementation with TgSPY-MYC3, 2) its functional dependence on amino acids critical for OGT activity, and 3) its ability to O-fucosylate itself and a model substrate and to specifically hydrolyze GDP-Fuc. While many of the endogenous proteins modified by O-Fuc are important for tachyzoite fitness, O-fucosylation by TgSPY is not essential. Growth of {Delta}spy tachyzoites in fibroblasts is modestly affected, despite marked reductions in the levels of ectopically-expressed proteins normally modified with O-fucose. Intact TgSPY-MYC3 localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas catalytic mutants often displayed reduced abundance. {Delta}spy tachyzoites of a luciferase-expressing type II strain exhibited infection kinetics in mice similar to wild type but increased persistence in the chronic brain phase, potentially due to an imbalance of regulatory protein levels. The modest changes in parasite fitness in vitro and in mice, despite profound effects on reporter protein accumulation, and the characteristic punctate localization of O-fucosylated proteins, suggest that TgSPY controls the levels of proteins to be held in reserve for response to novel stresses.",

    "abstract": "Despite intensive research on the biochemical and regulatory features of the archetypal catabolic TOL system borne by pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida mt-2, the physical arrangement and tridimensional logic of the xyl gene expression flow remains unknown. In this work, the spatial distribution of specific xyl mRNAs with respect to the host nucleoid, the TOL plasmid and the ribosomal pool has been investigated. In situ hybridization of target transcripts with fluorescent oligonucleotide probes revealed that xyl mRNAs cluster in discrete foci, adjacent but clearly separated from the TOL plasmid and the cell nucleoid. Also, they co-localize with ribosome-rich domains of the intracellular milieu. This arrangement was kept even when the xyl genes were artificially relocated at different chromosomal locations. The same happened when genes were expressed through a heterologous T7 polymerase-based system, which originated mRNA foci outside the DNA. In contrast, rifampicin treatment, known to ease crowding, blurred the confinement of xyl transcripts. This suggested that xyl mRNAs intrinsically run away from their initiation sites to ribosome-rich points for translation--rather than being translated coupled to transcription. Moreover, the results suggest that the distinct subcellular motion of xyl mRNAs results both from innate properties of the sequence at stake and the physical forces that keep the ribosomal pool away from the nucleoid in P. putida. This scenario is discussed on the background of current knowledge on the 3D organization of the gene expression flow in other bacteria and the environmental lifestyle of this soil microorganism.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe transfer of information between DNA, RNA and proteins in a bacterium is often compared to the decoding of a piece of software in a computer. However, the tridimensional layout and the relational logic of the cognate biological hardware i.e. the nucleoid, the RNA polymerase and the ribosomes, are habitually taken for granted. In this work we inspected the localization and fate of the transcripts that stem from the archetypal biodegradative plasmid pWW0 of soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 through the non-homogenous milieu of the bacterial cytoplasm. The results expose that-- similarly to computers also--the material components that enable the expression flow are well separated physically and they decipher the sequences through a distinct tridimensional arrangement with no indication of transcription/translation coupling. We argue that the resulting subcellular architecture enters an extra regulatory layer that obeys a species-specific positional code that accompanies the environmental lifestyle of this bacterium.",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were shown to be involved in development of CKD and renal fibrosis. In this study, we induced renal fibrosis in mice model through unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and extracted EVs from the kidney with induced fibrosis. Proximity barcoding assay (PBA) was performed to detect the expression of 112 proteins at individual EVs level for renal fibrosis of Grade I to IV and sham control group as well. The single EVs are classified into subpopulations according to the surface proteomic characteristics. We discovered several EV subpopulations, with presence of ITGAM, ITGA6, CD73, CD13 and ALDH1, increase significantly with development of renal fibrosis. These findings indicate that besides protein expression, proteomic fingerprints of single EVs can be potential biomarkers for surveillance of CKD and renal fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Expression of one out of >1000 olfactory receptor (OR) genes is stochastic but, yet, spatially organized in stereotypic anatomical segments, or \"zones\", along the dorsoventral axis of the mouse olfactory epithelium. We discovered that zonal OR expression is specified by OR chromatin structure and genome architecture during olfactory neuron differentiation. Specifically, across every zone dorsally expressed ORs have higher levels of heterochromatic marks and long-range contacts than ORs expressed ventrally. However, OR heterochromatin levels and frequency of genomic contacts between ORs gradually increase towards ventral zones. Consequently, ORs from dorsal indexes accumulate high H3K9me3/H3K79me3 enrichment and become silenced in ventral zones, while ORs from ventral indexes lack activating long-range genomic interactions and, thus, cannot be chosen in dorsal segments. This process is regulated by NFIA, B, and X gradients along the dorsoventral axis, triple deletion of which causes homeotic transformations on zonal OR expression, heterochromatin formation, and genomic compartmentalization.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, Puumala virus (PUUV) is responsible for nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFSR). Despite the presence of its reservoir, the bank vole, on most of French territory, the geographic distribution of NE cases is heterogeneous and NE endemic and non-endemic areas have been reported. In this study we analyzed whether bank vole-PUUV interactions could partly shape these epidemiological differences. We performed crossed-experimental infections using wild bank voles from French endemic (Ardennes) and non-endemic (Loiret) areas, and two French PUUV strains isolated from these areas. The serological response and dynamics of PUUV infection were compared between the four cross-infection combinations. We showed that the serological response and the presence of PUUV in excretory organs were more important in bank voles infected with the PUUV endemic strain. Moreover, the within-host viral diversity in excretory organs was higher than in other non-excretory organs for the NE endemic cross-infection, but not for the NE non-endemic cross-infection. Altogether, our results showed that genetically different PUUV strains, and in a lesser extent their interaction with sympatric bank voles, could affect virus replication and diversity. This could impact PUUV excretion/transmission between rodents and to humans, and in turn at least partly shape NE epidemiology in France.",

We identified heterosis in four out of five life-history traits in the inter-specific F1 hybrids. The observation of heterosis in these life-history traits suggests that there are no major genetic incompatibilities between these two species affecting these traits. This also suggests that D. pulex and D. pulicaria are at the early stage of speciation where heterosis can still occur.",

Here, we construed high-density haplotype map by whole-genome resequencing of 67 Prunus accessions with a depth of ~20x to evaluate the genome-level diversity and population structure. The phylogenetic analysis, the principal component analysis, and the population structure profiling, indicated that the 67 plum accessions could be classified into four groups corresponding to their origin location, the southern cultivar group (SCG), the northern cultivar group (NCG), the foreign cultivar group (FG), and the mixed cultivar group (MG). Some cultivars from South China were clustered with the other three groups. The genetic diversity indices including the private allele number, the observed heterozygosity, the expected heterozygosity, and the nucleotide diversity of the SCG were higher than those of the NCG. The gene flow from the SCG to the FG was detected as well. We concluded that the origin center of Chinese plum was at the Yangtze River Basin in South China.

This large integrated study was based on an experimental time course that successfully sampled the period when Atlantic salmon commence their trajectory towards sexual maturation. Co-analysis of DNA methylome and gene expression changes revealed chromatin remodelling genes arid1b and smarca2 were both significantly hypermethylated and upregulated in the ovary during the onset of maturation. We also observed changes in chromatin state landscape occurred early in the transition and were strongly correlated with fundamental remodelling of gene expression. Finally, we integrated our multiomics datasets to identify trim25 and znf423 as key regulators in the pituitary that underwent 60 fold change in connectivity during the transition to sexual maturation. The study provides a comprehensive view of the spatiotemporal changes involved in a complex trait and opens the door to future efforts aiming to manipulate puberty in an economically important aquaculture species.",

    "abstract": "Advances in microscopy instruments and image processing algorithms have led to an increasing number of cryo-EM maps. However, building accurate models for the EM maps at 3-5 [A] resolution remains a challenging and time-consuming process. With the rapid growth of deposited EM maps, there is an increasing gap between the maps and reconstructed/modeled 3-dimensional (3D) structures. Therefore, automatic reconstruction of atomic-accuracy full-atom structures from EM maps is pressingly needed. Here, we present a semi-automatic de novo structure determination method using a deep learning-based framework, named as DeepMM, which builds atomic-accuracy all-atom models from cryo-EM maps at near-atomic resolution. In our method, the main-chain and C positions as well as their amino acid and secondary structure types are predicted in the EM map using Densely Connected Convolutional Networks. DeepMM was extensively validated on 40 simulated maps at 5 [A] resolution and 30 experimental maps at 2.6-4.8 [A] resolution as well as an EMDB-wide data set of 2931 experimental maps at 2.6-4.9 [A] resolution, and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms including RosettaES, MAINMAST, and Phenix. Overall, our DeepMM algorithm obtained a significant improvement over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and coverage in building full-length protein structures on all test sets, demonstrating the efficacy and general applicability of DeepMM.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/JiahuaHe/DeepMM\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available.",

As a natural example of active matter, swarming is also an essential biological phenotype associated with virulence, chemotaxis, and host pathogenesis. Physical changes like cell elongation and hyper flagellation have been shown to accompany the swarming phenotype. However, less noticeable, are the contrasts of collective motion between the swarming cells and the planktonic cells of comparable cell density. Here, we show that confining bacterial movement in designed dimensions allows distinguishing bacterial swarming from collective swimming. We found that on a soft agar plate, a novel bacterial strain Enterobacter sp. SM3 exhibited different motion patterns in swarming and planktonic states when confined to circular microwells of a specific range of sizes. When the confinement diameter was between 40 m and 90 m, swarming SM3 formed a single swirl motion pattern in the microwells whereas planktonic SM3 showed multiple swirls. Similar differential behavior is observed across a range of randomly selected gram-negative bacteria. We hypothesize that the \"rafting behavior\" of the swarming bacteria upon dilution might account for the motion pattern difference. We verified our conjectures via numerical simulations where swarming cells are modeled with lower repulsion and more substantial alignment force. The novel technical approach enabled us to observe swarming on a non-agar tissue surface for the first time. Our work provides the basis for characterizing bacterial swarming under more sophisticated environments, such as polymicrobial swarmer detection, and in vivo swarming exploration.",

    "abstract": "Nanog exhibits a robust heterogeneous expression pattern within a population of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) under varied culture conditions. However, an efficient way to fine-tune the Nanog expression heterogeneity remains elusive. Herein, by employing a stochastic modeling approach, we demonstrate that Nanog expression heterogeneity can be controlled by modulating the regulatory features of a Nanog transcript specific microRNA. We demonstrate how and why the extent of origin dependent fluctuations in Nanog expression level can be altered by varying either the binding efficiency of the microRNA-mRNA complex or the expression level of the respective microRNA. Moreover, our model makes experimentally feasible and insightful predictions to maneuver the Nanog expression heterogeneity explicitly to achieve cell-type specific differentiation of ESCs.",

    "abstract": "Our senses are continuously bombarded with more information than our brain can process up to the level of awareness. The present study aimed to enhance understanding on how attentional selection shapes conscious access under conditions of rapidly changing input. Using an attention task, EEG, and multivariate decoding of individual target- and distractor-defining features, we specifically examined dynamic changes in the representation of targets and distractors as a function of conscious access and the task-relevance (target or distractor) of the preceding item in the RSVP stream. At the behavioral level, replicating previous work and suggestive of a flexible gating mechanism, we found a significant impairment in conscious access to targets (T2) that were preceded by a target (T1) followed by one or two distractors (i.e., the attentional blink), but striking facilitation of conscious access to targets shown directly after another target (i.e., lag-1 sparing and blink reversal). At the neural level, conscious access to T2 was associated with enhanced early- and late-stage T1 representations and enhanced late-stage D1 representations, and interestingly, could be predicted based on the pattern of EEG activation well before T1 was presented. Yet, across task conditions, we did not find convincing evidence for the notion that conscious access is affected by rapid top-down selection-related modulations of the strength of early sensory representations induced by the preceding visual event. These results cannot easily be explained by existing accounts of how attentional selection shapes conscious access under rapidly changing input conditions, and have important implications for theories of the attentional blink and consciousness more generally.",

    "abstract": "Beta oscillations are readily observed in motor cortex and the basal ganglia, but to which extent they are functionally relevant is unclear. To understand how activity transfer between different nodes of the cortico-basal ganglia network is affected by cortical beta oscillations in different behavioural conditions, we recorded local field potentials and electroencephalography (EEG) activity in a low-force motor control task and during rest in Parkinsons patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The patients received DBS of either the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal globus pallidus (GPi), which allowed us to investigate if STN and GPi broad-band high-frequency activity (HFA; >150 Hz) is co-modulated with the phase of motor cortical beta activity. We found significant modulation patterns in the STN and the GPi, which were inverted while patients performed the task, showing that GPi activity fluctuations likely are crafted by other inputs than the direct excitatory STN afferents. We also found that consistent STN modulation disappeared during rest, showing disengagement in this condition, while GPi modulation was maintained, again evidencing that beta-band activity fluctuations in the GPi can be relatively independent of those in the STN. The difference between HFA modulation patterns in the task and rest recordings suggests a potential functional role of beta phase-locked HFA modulation in controlling sustained contractions. Examination of HFA co-modulation patterns at different sites of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network under different behavioural conditions may provide a tool with which to define the impact of beta synchronization on network communication.",

State-of-the-art modeling frameworks, however, reproduce working memory representations that are either transient but non-active or active but non-transient. Here, we analyze a biologically motivated working memory model which shows that synaptic short-term plasticity and noise emerging from spiking networks can jointly produce a working memory representation that is both active and transient. We investigate the effect of a synaptic signaling mechanism whose dysregulation is related to schizophrenia and show how it controls transient working memory duration through presynaptic, astrocytic and postsynaptic elements. Our findings shed light on the computational capabilities of healthy working memory function and offer a possible mechanistic explanation for how molecular alterations observed in psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia can lead to working memory impairments.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies constitute a key line of defense against the diverse pathogens we encounter in our lives. While the interactions between a single antibody and a single virus are routinely characterized in exquisite detail, the inherent tradeoffs between attributes such as potency and breadth remain unclear. In addition, there is a wide gap between the discrete interactions of single antibodies and how antibody mixtures collectively repel multiple viruses. Here, we develop a new form of antigenic cartography called a Neutralization Landscape that enumerates the full space of antibody-virus interactions for antibodies targeting the influenza hemagglutinin stem. This reference set of antibody behaviors transforms the potency-breadth tradeoff into a readily solvable geometry problem. Using the Neutralization Landscape, we decompose the collective neutralization from multiple antibodies to characterize the composition and functional properties of the stem antibodies within. Looking forward, this framework can leverage the serological assays routinely performed for influenza surveillance to analyze how an individuals antibody repertoire evolves over time in response to vaccination or infection.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe describe the full range of behaviors for antibodies targeting the stem of influenza hemagglutinin, enabling us to decompose the collective behavior of antibody mixtures and characterize the individual antibodies within.",

    "abstract": "Corals of the family Acroporidae are key structural components of reefs that support the most diverse marine ecosystems. Due to increasing anthropogenic stresses, coral reefs are in decline. Along the coast of Okinawa, Japan, three different color morphs of Acropora tenuis have been recognized for decades. These include brown (N morph), yellow-green (G) and purple (P) forms. The tips of axial coral polyps exhibit specific fluorescence spectra. This attribute is inherited asexually, and color morphs do not change seasonally. In Okinawa Prefecture, during the summer of 2017, the N and P morphs experienced bleaching, in which some N morphs died while P morphs recovered. In contrast, G morphs successfully withstood the stress. Symbiotic dinoflagellates are essential symbiotic partners of scleractinian corals. Photosynthetic activity of symbionts was reduced in July in N and P morphs; however, the three color-morphs host similar sets of Clade-C zoothanthellae, suggesting that beaching of N and P morphs cannot be attributed to differences in symbiont clades. The decoded Acropora tenuis genome includes five genes for green fluorescent proteins (GFP), two for cyan fluorescent proteins (CFP), three for red fluorescent proteins (RFP), and seven genes for chromoprotein (ChrP). A summer survey of gene expression profiles demonstrated that (a) expression of CFP and REP was quite low in all three morphs, (b) P morphs expressed higher levels of ChrP, (c) both N and G morphs expressed GFP highly, and (d) GFP expression was reduced in N morphs, compared to G morphs, which maintained higher levels of GFP expression throughout the summer. Although further studies are required to understand the biological significance of these color morphs of Acropora tenuis, our results suggest that thermal stress resistance is modified by genetic mechanisms that coincidentally lead to diversification of color morphs.",

    "abstract": "Charting a biological atlas of an organ, such as the brain, requires us to spatially-resolve whole transcriptomes of single cells, and to relate such cellular features to the histological and anatomical scales. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq (sc/snRNA-seq) can map cells comprehensively5,6, but relating those to their histological and anatomical positions in the context of an organs common coordinate framework remains a major challenge and barrier to the construction of a cell atlas7-10. Conversely, Spatial Transcriptomics allows for in-situ measurements11-13 at the histological level, but at lower spatial resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies1-3 solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput which impedes profiling of the entire transcriptome. Finally, as samples are collected for profiling, their registration to anatomical atlases often require human supervision, which is a major obstacle to build pipelines at scale. Here, we demonstrate spatial mapping of cells, histology, and anatomy in the somatomotor area and the visual area of the healthy adult mouse brain. We devise Tangram, a method that aligns snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same brain region, including MERFISH1, STARmap2, smFISH3, and Spatial Transcriptomics4 (Visium), as well as histological images and public atlases. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multi-modal data such as SHARE-seq data5, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We equipped Tangram with a deep learning computer vision pipeline, which allows for automatic identification of anatomical annotations on histological images of mouse brain. By doing so, Tangram reconstructs a genome-wide, anatomically-integrated, spatial map of the visual and somatomotor area with [~]30,000 genes at single-cell resolution, revealing spatial gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterning beyond current limitation of in-situ technologies.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal epithelial barrier supports the symbiotic relationship between the microbiota colonizing the intestinal epithelium and the host immune system to maintain homeostasis. Leaky barrier is increasingly recognized as part of the pathogenesis of a number of chronic conditions in addition to inflammatory and infectious diseases. As our understanding on the regulation of the barrier remains limited, effective therapeutic targeting for the compromised barrier is still an unmet need. Here we combined advancements on the organoids and Organ-on-Chip technologies to establish a micro-engineered Colon Intestine-Chip for studying development and regulation of the human intestinal barrier. Our data demonstrate the significance of the endothelium in co-culture with the epithelial cells within a tissue-relevant microenvironment for the establishment of a tight epithelial barrier of polarized cells. Pathway analysis of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), revealed significant upregulation of mechanisms relevant to the maturation of the intestinal epithelium in organoid-derived epithelial cells in co-culture with endothelium as compared to organoids maintained in suspension. We provide evidence that the Colon Intestine-Chip platform responds to interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}), a prototype cytokine utilized to model inflammation-induced barrier disruption, by induction of apoptosis and reorganization of the apical junctional complexes as shown with other systems. We also describe the mechanism of action of interleukin 22 (IL-22) on mature, organoid-derived intestinal epithelial cells that is consistent with barrier disruption. Overall we propose the Colon Intestine-Chip as a promising human organoid-derived platform to decipher mechanisms driving the development of leaky gut in patients and enable their translation for this unmet medical need.",

Intriguingly, it is now clear that each cell type has a unique and characteristic 3D genome organization that functions in determining cell identity during development. A currently challenging basic question is how cell-type specific 3D genome structures are established during development. Herein, we analyzed 3D genome structures in primary myoblasts and myocytes from MyoD knockout (MKO) and wild type (WT) mice and discovered that MyoD, a pioneer transcription factor (TF), can function as a \"genome organizer\" that specifies the proper 3D genome architecture unique to muscle cell development. Importantly, we genetically demonstrate that H3K27ac is insufficient for establishing MyoD-induced chromatin loops in muscle cells. The establishment of MyoDs \"architectural role\" should have profound impacts on advancing understanding of other pioneer transcription factors in orchestrating lineage specific 3D genome organization during development in a potentially very large number of cell types in diverse organisms.",
