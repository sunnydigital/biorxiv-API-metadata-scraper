    "abstract": "The activity of many antibiotics depends on the initial density of cells used in bacteria growth inhibition assays. This phenomenon, termed the inoculum effect, can have important consequences for the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs, since bacterial loads vary by several orders of magnitude in clinically relevant infections. Antimicrobial peptides are a promising class of molecules to fight drug-resistant bacteria, since they act mainly by perturbing the cell membranes rather than by inhibiting intracellular targets. Here we report the first systematic characterization of the inoculum effect for this class of antibacterial compounds. Thirteen peptides (including all-D enantiomers) and peptidomimetics were analyzed by measuring minimum inhibitory concentration values, covering more than 7 orders of magnitude in inoculated cell density. In all cases, we observed a significant inoculum effect for cell densities above 5 x 104 cells/mL, while the active concentrations remained constant (within the micromolar range) for lower densities. In the case of membrane-active peptides, these data can be rationalized by considering a simple model, taking into account peptide-cell association and hypothesizing that a threshold number of cell-bound peptide molecules is required in order to cause a killing effect. The observed effects question the clinical utility of activity and selectivity determinations performed at a fixed, standardized cell density. A routine evaluation of the inoculum dependence of the activity of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics should be considered.\n\nSignificance statementBacterial drug resistance is a crucial threat to global health and antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action are severely needed. Antimicrobial peptides are natural molecules that kill bacteria mostly by perturbing their membranes and represent promising compounds to fight resistant microbes. Their activity is normally tested under standardized conditions of bacterial density. However, the bacterial load in clinically relevant infections varies by many orders of magnitude. Here we showed that the minimum peptide concentration needed for bacterial killing can vary by more than 100 times with an increase in the density of cells in the initial inoculum of the assay (inoculum effect) These findings question utility of the presently used activity screening assays and our current understanding of antimicrobial peptides.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experienced game-changing hardware and software advances about a decade ago. Since then, there have been gradual and steady improvements in experimental and data analysis methods. Nonetheless, structural analysis of nonsymmetric membrane proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), remains challenging. Their relatively low molecular weight and obstruction by the micelle/nanodisc result in marginal signal levels, which combined with the intrinsic flexibility of such complexes creates difficult structural study scenarios. Pushing the performance limits of cryo-EM requires careful optimization of all experimental aspects. To this end, it is necessary to build quantitative knowledge of the effect each parameter has on the outcome. Here, we present in-depth analysis of the influence of the main cryo-EM experimental factors on the performance for GPCR structure determination. We used a tandem experiment approach that combined real-world structural studies with parameter testing. We quantified the effects of using a Volta phase plate, zero-loss energy filtering, objective lens aperture, defocus magnitude, total exposure, and grid type. Through such systematic optimization of the experimental conditions, it has been possible to routinely determine class B1 GPCR structures at resolutions better than 2.5 [A]. The improved fidelity of such maps helps to build higher confidence atomic models and will be crucial for the future expansion of cryo-EM into the structure-based drug design domain. The optimization guidelines drafted here are not limited to GPCRs and can be applied directly for the study of other challenging membrane protein targets.",

    "abstract": "The high sensitivity and effective frequency discrimination of sound detection performed by the auditory system rely on the dynamics of a system of hair cells. In the inner ear, these acoustic receptors are primarily attached to an overlying structure which provides mechanical coupling between the hair bundles. While the dynamics of individual hair bundles have been extensively investigated, the influence of mechanical coupling on the motility of the system of bundles remains underdetermined. We developed a technique of mechanically coupling two active hair bundles, enabling us to probe the dynamics of the coupled system experimentally. We demonstrated that the coupling could enhance the coherence of hair bundles spontaneous oscillation as well as their phase-locked response to sinusoidal stimuli, at the calcium concentration in the surrounding fluid near the physiological level. The empirical data were consistent with numerical results from a model of two coupled nonisochronous oscillators, each displaying a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The model revealed that weak coupling can poise the system of unstable oscillators closer to the bifurcation by a shift in the critical point. In addition, the dynamics of strongly coupled oscillators far from criticality suggested that individual hair bundles may be regarded as nonisochronous oscillators. An optimal degree of nonisochronicity was required for the observed tuning behavior in the coherence of autonomous motion of the coupled system.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEHair cells of the inner ear transduce acoustic energy into electrical signals via a deflection of hair bundles. Unlike a passive mechanical antenna, a free-standing hair bundle behaves as an active oscillator that can sustain autonomous oscillations, as well as amplify a low-level stimulus. Hair bundles under physiological conditions are elastically coupled to each other via an extracellular matrix. Therefore, the dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillators underlie the performance of the peripheral auditory system. Despite extensive theoretical investigations, there are limited experimental evidence that support the significance of coupling on hair bundle motility. We develop a technique to mechanically couple hair bundles and demonstrate the benefits of coupling on hair bundle spontaneous motility.",

    "abstract": "Pine wilt disease (PWD) caused by the nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is a serious problem on pines, and there is currently no effective control strategy for this disease. Although the endoparasitic fungus Esteya vermicola showed great effectiveness in controlling pine wilt disease, the colonization patterns of the host pine tree xylem by this fungus are unknown. To investigate the colonization patterns of pine xylem by this fungus, the species Pinus koraiensis grown in a greenhouse was used as an experimental host tree. The fungal colonization of healthy and wilting pine trees by E. vermicola was quantified using PCR with a TaqMan probe, and a green fluorescence protein (GFP) transformant was used for visualization. The results reported a specific infection approach used by E. vermicola to infect B. xylophilus and specialized fungal parasitic cells in PWN infection. In addition, the inoculated blastospores of E. vermicola germinated and grew inside of healthy pine xylem, although the growth rate was slow. Moreover, E. vermicola extended into the pine xylem following spray inoculation of wounded pine seedling stems, and a significant increase in fungal quantity was observed in response to B. xylophilus invasion. An accelerated extension of E. vermicola colonization was shown in PWN-infected wilting pine trees, due to the immigration of fungal-infected PWNs. Our results provide helpful knowledge about the extension rate of this fungus in healthy and wilting PWN-susceptible pine trees in the biological control of PWD and will contribute to the development of a management method for PWD control in the field.\n\nAuthor summaryPine wilt disease, caused by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, has infected most pine forests in Asian and European forests and led to enormous losses of forest ecosystem and economy. Esteya vermicola is a bio-control fungus against pinewood nematode, showed excellent control efficient to pine wilt disease in both of greenhouse experiments and field tests. Although this bio-control agent was well known for the management of pine wilt disease, the infection mechanism of fungal infection and colonization of host pine tree are less understand. Here, we use GFP-tagged mutant to investigate the fungal infection to pinewood nematode; additionally, the temporal and spatial dynamics of E. vermicola colonize to pine tree were determined by the TaqMan real-time PCR quantification, as well as the response to pinewood nematode invasion. We found a specific infection approach used by E. vermicola to infect B. xylophilus and specialized fungal parasitic cells in PWN infection. In addition, the fungal germination and extension inside of pine tree xylem after inoculation were revealed. In addition, the quantity of E. vermicola increased as response to pinewood nematode invasion was reported. Our study provides two novel technologies for the visualization and detection of E. vermicola for the future investigations of fungal colonization and its parasitism against pinewood nematode, and the mechanisms of the bio-control process.",

    "abstract": "Mutation signature of aristolochic acid (AA) found in urothelial or hepatocellular carcinoma causes public concern about the cancer risk of AA. In contrast, direct evidence based on the reliable bioanalytical method for the exposure of AA is still lacking and not universal. Here, we strictly complied with the qualitative and quantitative guidance for forensic toxicological analysis: In the sample preprocessing, DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues was digested to single nucleotide by a series of enzymes with 70% enzymatic digestion efficiency. After protein precipitation, the samples were submitted to an ABI6500+ mass spectrometer for LC-MS/MS analysis. Ion pairs 543.2/427.2 and 543.2/395.2 of dA-AAI were selected from 5 ion pairs due to their higher LC-MS/MS response. Both these ion pairs have excellent selectivity and specificity in rat liver DNA matrix, and a linear regression range from 5 pg/mL to 200 pg/mL with the best fit and determination coefficient (r) greater than 0.99. The intra and inter batch accuracy and precision of these two ion pairs are also acceptable with less than 15% variation. The total recovery for ion pair 543.2/427.2 and 543.2/395.2 of dA-AAI was 90.06% and 90.76%, respectively. Our method has a minor matrix effect and good stability under different temperature and time conditions. With signal to noise ratio [&ge;] 3, 2 ion pairs (< 50 % relative abundance variation), the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of our method is set to 5 pg/mL([~]3.6 AAI-DNA adducts per 108 DNA bases). By using this validated bioanalytical method of dA-AAI, 165 human HCC FFPE tissues were analyzed, the total ratio of samples with peak543.2/427.2 is 17.0% (28/165), with peak543.2/395.2 is 9.09% (15/165) which yields the total ratio of samples combined peak543.2/427.2 and peak543.2/395.2 is 7.27% (12/165). Two samples are higher than 5 pg/mL under the qualitative requirements. In conclusion, we first reported a fully validated methods to analyze the DNA adducts level of aristolochic acid, which could be qualitatively and quantitatively applied to the investigation of AA exposure in the human and other species.",

    "abstract": "Theta and alpha frequency neural oscillations are important for learning and cognitive control, but their exact role has remained obscure. In particular, it is unknown whether they operate at similar timescales, and whether they support different cognitive processes. We recorded EEG in 30 healthy human participants while they performed a learning task containing both novel (block-unique) and repeating stimuli. We investigated behavior and electrophysiology at both fast (i.e., within blocks) and slow (i.e., between blocks) time scales. Behaviorally, both response time and accuracy improved (resp. decrease and increase) over both fast and slow timescales. However, on the spectral level, theta power significantly decreased along the slow timescale, whereas alpha power instead significantly increased along the fast timescale. We thus demonstrate that theta and alpha both play a role during learning, but operate at different timescales. This result poses important empirical constraints for theories on learning, cognitive control, and neural oscillations.",

Here, we investigate functional and structural correlates of long-term potentiation at large hippocampal mossy fiber boutons induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We performed two-photon imaging of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluu that revealed an increase in the surface area used for glutamate release at potentiated terminals. Moreover, time-gated stimulated emission depletion microscopy revealed no change in the coupling distance between immunofluorescence signals from calcium channels and release sites. Finally, by high-pressure freezing and transmission electron microscopy analysis, we found a fast remodeling of synaptic ultrastructure at potentiated boutons: synaptic vesicles dispersed in the terminal and accumulated at the active zones, while active zone density and synaptic complexity increased. We suggest that these rapid and early structural rearrangements likely enable long-term increase in synaptic strength.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity can influence the generation of new oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogenesis) and myelination. In health, this is an adaptive process that can increase synchrony within distributed neuronal networks and contribute to cognitive function. We hypothesized that in seizure disorders, aberrant neuronal activity may promote maladaptive myelination that contributes to pathogenesis. Absence epilepsy is a disease defined by increasingly frequent behavioral arrest seizures over time, thought to be due to thalamocortical network hypersynchrony. We tested the hypothesis that activity-dependent myelination resulting from absence seizures promotes epileptogenesis. Using two distinct models of absence epilepsy, Wag/Rij rats and Scn8a+/mut mice, we found increased oligodendrogenesis and myelination specifically within the absence seizure network. These changes are evident only after seizure onset in both models and are prevented with pharmacological inhibition of seizures. Genetic blockade of activity-dependent myelination during epileptogenesis markedly decreased seizure frequency in the Scn8a+/mut mouse model of absence epilepsy. Taken together, these findings indicate that activity-dependent myelination driven by absence seizures contributes to seizure kindling during epileptogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetics, the genetic incorporation of light-sensitive proteins such as Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into target mammalian neurons, has enabled activation, silencing, and receptor subtype specific neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, the essential components of the ontogenetic system require invasive procedures with very few non-invasive alternatives preventing its use as a translational tool. The implantation of light emitting fibers deep within brain structures is both technically demanding and causes tissue scarring in target brain regions. To overcome these limitations, while maintaining the highly-tuned components of optogenetics we have developed a novel noninvasive alternative. Our approach replaces fibers with light-emitting radioluminescent particles (RLPs) that can be activated non-invasively with X-ray exposure. Here, we report successful noninvasive delivery of RLPs to target brain regions using MRI-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) blood brain barrier opening. In addition, FUS BBBO can be used to deliver viral vectors for light sensitive channel expression. Combined, these components can provide a completely non-invasive optogenetic system.",

Therefore, we developed an ELISA to identify JEV specific, DENV non cross-reactive antibody responses by identifying JEV specific, highly conserved regions of the virus and proceeded to investigate if the presence of JEV specific antibodies associate with dengue disease severity.\n\nMethodology/Principal findings20 JEV specific peptides were identified from highly conserved regions of the virus and the immunogenicity and specificity of these peptides were assessed in individuals who were non-immune to JEV and DENV (JEV-DENV-, N=30), those who were only immune to the JEV and not DENV (JEV+DENV-, N=30), those who were only immune to DENV(JEV-DENV+, N=30) and in those who were immune to both viruses (JEV+DENV+, N=30). 7/20 peptides were found to be highly immunogenic and specific and these 7 peptides were used as a pool to further evaluate JEV-specific responses. All 30/30 JEV+DENV-and 30/30 JEV+DENV+individuals, and only 3/30 (10%) JEV-DENV+individuals responded to this pool. We further evaluated this pool of 7 peptides in patients following primary and secondary dengue infection during the convalescent period and found that the JEV-specific peptides, were unlikely to cross react with DENV IgG antibodies. We further compared this in-house ELISA developed with the peptide pool with an existing commercial JEV IgG assay to identify JEV-specific IgG following vaccination, and our in-house ELISA was found to be more sensitive. We then proceeded to investigate if the presence of JEV-specific antibodies were associated with dengue disease severity, and we found that those who had past severe dengue (n=175) were significantly more likely (p<0.0001) to have JEV-specific antibodies than those with past non-severe dengue (n=175) (OR 5.3, 95% CI 3.3 to 8.3).\n\nConclusions/SignificanceAs our data show that this assay is highly sensitive and specific for detection of JEV-specific antibody responses, it would be an important tool to determine how JEV seropositivity modulate dengue immunity and disease severity when undertaking dengue vaccine trials.\n\nAuthor summaryBoth Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV), and the dengue viruses (DENV) co-circulate in the same geographical region and have a potential to modulate the immune responses to each other. However, due to the difficulty in identifying antibody responses specific to either virus due to the highly cross-reactive nature of virus-specific antibodies, this has been poorly investigated. Therefore, we developed an ELISA to identify JEV-specific, DENV non cross-reactive antibody responses by identifying JEV-specific, highly conserved regions of the virus and proceeded to investigate if the presence of JEV-specific antibodies associates with dengue disease severity. 20 JEV-specific peptides were identified from highly conserved regions of the virus and the immunogenicity and specificity of these peptides were assessed. We found that seven peptides were highly immunogenic and specific to the JEV and we further evaluated the usefulness of an ELISA developed using these pools of peptides. We found that our in-house ELISA was found to be significantly more sensitive some of the existing commercial assays. As this assay appears to be highly sensitive and specific for detection of JEV-specific antibody responses, it would be an important tool to determine how JEV seropositivity modulate dengue immunity and disease severity when undertaking dengue vaccine trials.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) from components of the live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) presents a major challenge to global polio eradication. This process has largely been characterized by consensus sequencing of isolates collected from routine surveillance, and little is known about the early evolution of OPV within vaccinated hosts. These early events are critical steps in the progression of OPV to cVDPV. Here, we use whole genome, high depth of coverage sequencing to define the evolutionary trajectories of monovalent type 2 OPV in a cluster-randomized trial of polio vaccines in Matlab, Bangladesh. By sequencing 416 longitudinal samples from 219 mOPV2 recipients and 81 samples from 52 household contacts, we were able to examine the extent of convergent evolution in vaccine recipients and track the amount of viral diversity transmitted to new hosts. Using time-series data from a synchronized point of vaccine administration, we identify strong positive selection of reversion mutations at three known attenuating sites within two months post-vaccination. Beyond these three recognized \"gate-keeper\" mutations, we identify 19 mutations that exhibit significant parallelism across vaccine recipients, providing evidence for early positive selection not previously detected by phylogenetic inference. An analysis of shared genetic variants in samples from vaccinated individuals and their household contacts suggests a tight effective bottleneck during transmission. The absence of positively selected variants among household contacts across the cohort suggests that this tight bottleneck limits the transmission of these early adaptive mutations. Together, our results highlight the distinct evolutionary dynamics of live attenuated virus vaccines and have important implications for the success of novel OPV2 and other next generation approaches.\n\nSignificanceThe emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) through evolution of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) poses a significant obstacle to global eradication. Understanding the genetic changes in OPV that occur as it evolves and transmits in populations is important for preventing future cVDPV outbreaks. Little is known about the early events in VDPV evolution and the selective forces that drive them. We used high depth-of-coverage genome sequencing to assess the within-host evolutionary dynamics of monovalent type 2 OPV in a vaccine trial in Matlab, Bangladesh. We leverage longitudinal sampling from vaccine recipients and household contacts to identify mutations that arise in parallel across individuals and estimate the size of the transmission bottleneck. We find evidence for strong positive selection on key sites in the capsid and the 5 noncoding region, many of which have not been previously identified. Our results also suggest that narrow transmission bottlenecks can constrain the spread of mutations selected within individuals. These results provide important insights into how OPV variants spread in populations and are highly relevant for ongoing poliovirus surveillance and the design of improved polio vaccines.",

The oviduct (also known as the fallopian tube in humans) is the distal-most portion of the female reproductive tract.

In mammals, the oviduct is morphologically segmented along the ovary-uterus axis into four evolutionally conserved regions. It is unknown however if there is a diversification of epithelial cell characteristics between these regions. In this study, we identified transcriptionally distinct populations of secretory and multiciliated cells restricted to the distal and proximal regions of the oviduct. We demonstrated that these distal and proximal populations are distinct lineages specified early in Mullerian duct development and are maintained separately.

    "abstract": "Lymphangiogenesis, the formation of lymphatic vessels is tightly linked to the development of the venous vasculature, both at the cellular and molecular levels. Here, we identify a novel role for Sorbs1, the founding member of the SoHo family of cytoskeleton adaptor proteins, in vascular and lymphatic development in zebrafish. We show that Sorbs1 is required for secondary sprouting and emergence of several vascular structures specifically derived from the axial vein. Most notably, formation of the precursor parachordal lymphatic structures is affected in sorbs1 mutant embryos, severely impacting the establishment of a proper trunk lymphatic network and leading to edema development. We show that Sorbs1 is probably not part of the Vegfc signaling, but instead might interacts with the BMP pathways. Mechanistically, we show that Sorbs1 controls FAK/Src signaling to impact on Rac1 and RhoA GTPases-regulated cytoskeleton processes. Inactivation of Sorbs1 altered cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) contact rearrangement and cytoskeleton dynamics, leading to specific defects in endothelial cell migratory and adhesive properties. Our data thus establish Sorbs1 as an important regulator of lymphangiogenesis distinct from the Vegfc signaling axis, increasing our understanding of context-specific vascular and lymphatic development.",

    "abstract": "Transmission foci of autochthonous malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax-like parasites have frequently been reported in the Atlantic Forest in Southeastern and Southern Brazil. Evidence suggests that malaria is a zoonosis in these areas as human infections by simian Plasmodium species have been detected, and the main vector of malaria in the Atlantic Forest, Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii, can blood feed on human and simian hosts. In view of the lack of models that seek to predict the dynamics of zoonotic transmission in this part of the Atlantic Forest, the present study proposes a new deterministic mathematical model that includes a transmission compartment for non-human primates and parameters that take into account vector displacement between the upper and lower forest strata. The effects of variations in the abundance and acrodendrophily of An. cruzii on the prevalence of infected humans in the study area and the basic reproduction number (R0) for malaria were analyzed. The model parameters are based on the literature and fitting of the empirical data. Simulations performed with the model indicate that (1) an increase in the abundance of the vector in relation to the total number of blood-seeking mosquitoes leads to an asymptotic increase in both the proportion of infected individuals at steady state and R0; (2) the proportion of infected humans at steady state is higher when displacement of the vector mosquito between the forest strata increases; and (3) in most scenarios, Plasmodium transmission cannot be sustained only between mosquitoes and humans, which implies that non-human primates play an important role in maintaining the transmission cycle. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of malaria transmission in the Atlantic Forest.\n\nAuthor summaryThe etiological agents of malaria are protozoa of the genus Plasmodium that are transmitted to humans and other vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes. In the Atlantic Forest in Southeastern and Southern Brazil, human infections by simian Plasmodium species have been detected, showing that in certain situations malaria can be transmitted zoonotically in this region. Anopheles cruzii, a sylvatic mosquito, is considered the main vector of malaria parasites in the Atlantic Forest. The fact that this species can feed on humans and monkeys reinforces the hypothesis of zoonotic transmission. Here we present a new mathematical model to explain the dynamics of zoonotic transmission of malaria in the Atlantic Forest. Simulations performed with the model showed that the prevalence of human cases and the basic reproduction number for malaria can be strongly influenced by variations in the abundance of An. cruzii and the frequency with which these mosquitoes move between the ground and the forest canopy to feed on humans and monkeys, respectively. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of malaria transmission in the Atlantic Forest.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcal disease is estimated to affect nearly a quarter of a million people annually. Environmental isolates of Cryptococcus deneoformans, which make up 15 to 30% of clinical infections in temperate climates such as Europe, vary in their pathogenicity, ranging from benign to hyper-virulent. Key traits that contribute to virulence, such as the production of the pigment melanin, an extracellular polysaccharide capsule, and the ability to grow at human body temperature have been identified, yet little is known about the genetic basis of variation in such traits. Here we investigate the genetic basis of melanization, capsule size, thermal tolerance, oxidative stress resistance, and antifungal drug sensitivity using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in progeny derived from a cross between two divergent C. deneoformans strains. Using a \"function-valued\" QTL analysis framework that exploits both time-series information and growth differences across multiple environments, we identified QTL for each of these virulence traits and drug susceptibility. For three QTL we identified the underlying genes and nucleotide differences that govern variation in virulence traits. One of these genes, RIC8, which encodes a regulator of cAMP-PKA signaling, contributes to variation in four virulence traits: melanization, capsule size, thermal tolerance, and resistance to oxidative stress. Two major effect QTL for amphotericin B resistance map to the genes SSK1 and SSK2, which encode key components of the HOG pathway, a fungal-specific signal transduction network that orchestrates cellular responses to osmotic and other stresses. We also discovered complex epistatic interactions within and between genes in the HOG and cAMP-PKA pathways that regulate antifungal drug resistance and resistance to oxidative stress. Our findings advance the understanding of virulence traits among diverse lineages of Cryptococcus, and highlight the role of genetic variation in key stress-responsive signaling pathways as a major contributor to phenotypic variation.\n\nAuthor summaryDifferent environmental isolates (strains) of the same microbial species can vary greatly in their ability to cause disease, ranging from avirulent to hypervirulent. What makes some strains deadly pathogens, while others are relatively benign? This study describes the characterization of key genetic differences that underlie variation in traits thought to promote virulence in Cryptococcus deneoformans, a wide-spread opportunistic fungal pathogen. Using a combination of quantitative genetic and molecular genetic approaches we dissected the genetic architecture of virulence-related cellular traits (melanin production and the production of a polysaccharide capsule), physiological responses to stress (tolerance of thermal, oxidative, and osmotic stress), and sensitivity to multiple antifungal drugs. Strikingly we find that variation in most of these traits is governed by a small number of genetic differences that modify the function of two major cell signaling networks, cyclic AMP-Protein Kinase A (cAMP-PKA) signaling and a fungal specific MAP-kinase cascade called the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. Similar to recent studies in a number of other fungal species, our findings point to an outsize role for a small number of highly pleiotropic signaling pathways in potentiating phenotypic variation both within and between fungal species.",

    "abstract": "More virulent and aggressive races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the pathogen causing wheat stripe rust, have been spreading around the world since 2000 causing large grain yield losses. A better understanding of the genome and genetic diversity of these new Pst races will be useful to develop new strategies to ameliorate production losses. In this study, we generated an improved genome assembly of a very virulent race from the Western USA designated as PST-130. We implemented a haplotype phasing strategy using the diploid-aware assembler, Falcon-Unzip and new long-read technology from PacBio to phase the two genomes of this dikaryotic organism. The combination of these new technologies resulted in an improved PST-130 assembly with only 151 contigs (85.4 Mb, N50 of 1.44 Mb), and a complementary assembly (haplotigs) with 458 contigs (65.9 Mb, N50 of 0.235 Mb, PRJNA650506). This new assembly improved gene predictions resulting in 228 more predicted complete genes than in the initial Illumina assembly (29,178 contigs, N50 of 5 kb). The alignment of the non-repetitive primary and haplotig contigs revealed and average of 5.22 SNP/kb, with 39.1% showing <2 SNP/kb and 15.9% >10 SNP/kb. This large divergent regions may represent introgressions of chromosome segments from more divergent Pst races in regions where Pst can complete its sexual cycle and where recombination is possible. We hypothesize that some of the divergent regions in PST-130 may be related to the European \"Warrior\" race PST-DK0911 because this latter genome is more similar to PST-130 (3.18 SNP/kb) than to the older European race PST-104E (3.75 SNP/kb). Phasing of additional Pst genomes or sequencing individual nuclei will facilitate the tracing of nuclei introduced by the new Pst races into local populations.",

We identified SOX11 as a strong lineage dependency transcription factor in adrenergic NB based on recurrent chromosome 2p focal gains and amplifications, its specific expression in the normal sympatho-adrenal lineage and adrenergic NBs and its regulation by multiple adrenergic specific cis-interacting (super-)enhancers. Adrenergic NBs are strongly dependent on high SOX11 expression levels for growth and proliferation. Through genome-wide DNA-binding and transcriptome analysis, we identified and validated functional SOX11 target genes, several of which implicated in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modification. SOX11 controls chromatin accessibility predominantly affecting distal adrenergic lineage-specific enhancers marked by binding sites of the adrenergic core regulatory circuitry. During normal sympathoblast differentiation we find expression of SOX11 prior to members of the adrenergic core regulatory circuitry. Given the broad control of SOX11 of multiple epigenetic regulatory complexes and its presumed pioneer factor function, we propose that adrenergic NB cells have co-opted the normal role of SOX11 as a crucial regulator of chromatin accessibility and cell identity.",

Thymic lymphomas from irradiated wild-type (WT), p53+/- and KrasLA1 mice were not observed to harbor significantly higher numbers of non-synonymous somatic mutations compared to thymic lymphomas from unirradiated p53-/- mice. However, we observed distinct patterns of recurrent mutations in genes that control the Notch1 signaling pathway based on the mutational status of p53. Preferential activation of Notch1 signaling in p53 WT lymphomas was also observed at the RNA and protein level. Using reporter mice for activation of the Notch1 signaling we observed that TBI enriched Notch1hi CD44+ thymocytes, which are capable of self-renewal in vivo. Mechanistically, genetic inhibition of Notch1 signaling in thymocytes prevented the formation of radiation-induced thymic lymphoma in p53 WT mice.

    "abstract": "Introductory biology lessons around the world typically teach that plants absorb water through their roots, but, unfortunately, absorption of water through leaves and subsequent transport and use of this water for biomass formation remains a field limited mostly to specialists. Recent studies have identified foliar water uptake as a significant but still unquantified net water source for terrestrial plants. The growing interest in the development of a new model that includes foliar uptake of liquid water to explain hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in leaf water and tree rings requires a method for distinguishing between these two water sources. I therefore devised a method utilizing two different heavy waters (HDO and H218O) to simultaneously label both foliar-uptake water and root-uptake water and quantify their relative contributions to plant biomass. Using this new method, I here present evidence that, in the case of well-watered Cryptomeria japonica, hydrogen and oxygen incorporated into new leaf cellulose in the rainy season derives mostly from foliar-uptake water, while that of new root cellulose derives mostly from root-uptake water, and new branch xylem is somewhere in between. Abandoning the assumption that these elements are supplied from soil water alone may have vast implications in fields ranging from isotope dendroclimatology, silviculture, to biogeochemistry.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive cognition is fostered by knowledge about the structure and value of our environment. Here, we hypothesize that these two kinds of information are inherently intertwined as value-weighted schemas in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Schemas (e.g., of a social network) emerge by extracting commonalities across experiences and can be understood as graphs comprising nodes (e.g., people) and edges (e.g., their relationships). We sampled information about unique real-life environments (i.e., about personally familiar people and places) and probed the neural representations of their schemas with fMRI. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that the mPFC encodes indeed both, the nodes and edges of the schemas. Critically, as hypothesized, the strength of the edges is not only determined by experience and centrality of a node but also by value. We thus account for the involvement of the mPFC in disparate functions and suggest that valuation emerges naturally from encoded memory representations.",

    "abstract": "At tripartite synapses, astrocytes enmesh synaptic contacts, but how astrocytes contribute to the formation, maturation and plasticity of synapses remains elusive. Here we show that both astrocytes and neurons abundantly express neurexin-1, a presynaptic adhesion molecule that controls synaptic properties. Using super-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that presynaptic neuronal and astrocytic neurexin-1 form discrete nanoclusters at excitatory synapses. We find that distinct patterns of heparan sulfate modification and alternative splicing confer onto astrocytic and neuronal neurexin-1 different ligand specificities, thereby enabling compartment-specific signaling by neurexin-1. At hippocampal Schaffer-collateral synapses, deletion of neurexin-1 from either astrocytes or neurons did not alter synapse numbers, but differentially impaired synapse function. Neuronal neurexin-1 was essential for NMDA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses, whereas astrocytic neurexin-1 was required for maturation of silent synapses, AMPA-receptor recruitment, and long-term potentiation. Thus, astrocytes and neurons surprisingly use the same synaptic adhesion molecule to control distinct synapse properties.",

    "abstract": "How does the brain change during learning? In functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, both multivariate pattern analysis and repetition suppression (RS) have been used to detect changes in neuronal representations. In the context of motor sequence learning, the two techniques have provided discrepant findings: pattern analysis showed that only premotor and parietal regions, but not primary motor cortex (M1), develop a representation of trained sequences. In contrast, RS suggested trained sequence representations in all these regions. Here we applied both analysis techniques to a 5-week finger sequence training study, in which participants executed each sequence twice before switching to a different sequence. Both RS and pattern analysis indicated learning-related changes for parietal areas, but only RS showed a difference between trained and untrained sequences in M1. A more fine-grained analysis, however, revealed that the RS effect in M1 reflects a fundamentally different process than in parietal areas. On the first execution, M1 represents especially the first finger of each sequence, likely reflecting preparatory processes. This effect dramatically reduces during the second execution. In contrast, parietal areas represent the identity of a sequence, and this representation stays relatively stable on the second execution. These results suggest that the RS effect does not reflect a trained sequence representation in M1, but rather a preparatory signal for movement initiation. More generally, our study demonstrates that across regions RS can reflect different representational changes in the neuronal population code, emphasizing the importance of combining pattern analysis and RS techniques.\n\nSignificance statementPrevious studies using pattern analysis have suggested that primary motor cortex (M1) does not represent learnt sequential actions. However, a study using repetition suppression (RS) has reported M1 changes during motor sequence learning. Combining both techniques, we first replicate the discrepancy between them - with learning-related changes in M1 in RS, but not pattern dissimilarities. We further analysed the representational changes with repetition, and found that the RS effects differ across regions. M1s activity represents the starting finger of the sequence, an effect that vanishes with repetition. In contrast, activity patterns in parietal areas exhibit sequence dependency, which persists with repetition. These results demonstrate the importance of combining RS and pattern analysis to understand the function of brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Type I lissencephaly is a neuronal migration disorder caused by haploinsuffiency of the LIS1 gene and is characterized in humans by agyria, mislamination of brain structures, developmental delays, and epilepsy. Here, we investigate the impact of LIS1 mutation on the cellular migration, morphophysiology, microcircuitry and genomics of mouse hippocampal CA1 parvalbumin-containing inhibitory interneurons (PV+INTs). We find that WT PV+INTs consist of two physiological subtypes (80% fast-spiking (FS), 20% non-fast-spiking (NFS)) and four morphological subtypes (basket, axo-axonic, bistratified, radiatum-targeting). We also discover that cell-autonomous mutations within interneurons disrupts morphological development of PV+INTs and results in the emergence of a non-canonical \"intermediate spiking (IS)\" subset of PV+INTs. In the GlobalLis mutant, IS/NFS cells become the dominant PV+INT subtypes (56%) and the percentage of FS cells shrinks to 44%. We also find that IS/NFS cells are prone to entering depolarizing block, causing them to temporarily lose the ability to initiate action potentials and control network excitation, potentially promoting seizures. Finally, single-cell nuclear RNAsequencing of PV+INTs revealed several misregulated genes related to morphogenesis, cellular excitability, and synapse formation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveHyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are co-existing characteristics of type 2 diabetes, whereas the molecular mechanism underlying this deleterious cycle remains elusive. The temporal transcriptomic landscape of core organs responsible for insulin secretion (islets) and insulin action (liver) could provide new insights.\n\nMethodsThe longitudinal profiling of glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, islet architecture and secretion were conducted in C57BL/6N mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or chow diet for 24 weeks. RNA-sequencing of islets and liver were performed once every 4 weeks. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis were applied to construct networks and evaluate co-ordinated molecular interactions between islets and liver.\n\nResultsMice exhibited progressively deteriorated glucose homeostasis with hyperinsulinemia but impaired first-phase insulin secretion after 4 weeks on HFD. Insulin, glucagon and somatostatin secretion in response to glucose with or without palmitate gradually deteriorated from dysregulation to failure. Systemic insulin resistance developed over 24 weeks with variable time course in tissue-specific insulin action. Our transcriptomic datasets outlined the impact of HFD on dynamics of islet and liver molecular network at different stages. Correlation analyses revealed that both organs jointly programmed {beta}-cell compensatory adaption via cell proliferation at early phase and irreversible islet dysfunction by inappropriate immune response at later stage. Alternations of T cell subpopulations validated the participation of adaptive immune response through priming and amplification phases in diabetic progression.\n\nConclusionOur data provide a comprehensive landscape of crosstalk between islets and liver in diet-induced diabetes, elucidating the development of islet dysfunction and insulin resistance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDiet-induced diabetes is featured by transition from islet dysfunction to failure\nC_LIO_LIInsulin resistance develops with variable time course in different tissues\nC_LIO_LIDynamics of islet and liver molecular network interplay at different stages\nC_LIO_LICell proliferation and improper immune reaction mediated interorgan crosstalk\nC_LIO_LIAdaptive immune response participated via priming and amplification phases\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Previously, genetic lineage tracing based on the mesothelial marker Wt1, appeared to show that peritoneal mesothelial cells have a range of differentiative capacities and are the direct progenitors of vascular smooth muscle in the intestine. However, it was not clear whether this was a temporally limited process or continued throughout postnatal life. Here, using a conditional Wt1-based genetic lineage tracing approach, we demonstrate that the postnatal and adult peritoneum covering intestine, mesentery and body wall only maintained itself and failed to contribute to other visceral tissues. Pulse-chase experiments of up to 6 months revealed that Wt1-expressing cells remained confined to the peritoneum and failed to differentiate into cellular components of blood vessels or other tissues underlying the peritoneum. Ablation of Wt1 in adult mice did not result in changes to the intestinal wall architecture. In the heart, we observed that Wt1-expressing cells maintained the epicardium and contributed to coronary vessels in newborn and adult mice. Our results demonstrate that Wt1-expressing cells in the peritoneum have limited differentiation capacities, and that contribution of Wt1-expressing cells to cardiac vasculature is based on organ-specific mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Thioamitides are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translational modified peptides with potent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. Their biosynthesis remains largely unknown, especially for the characteristic C-terminal 2-aminovinyl-Cysteine (AviCys) motifs. Herein, we report the discovery that homologs of class III lanthipeptide synthetases (LanKCts)encoded outside putative thioamitide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) fully dehydrate the precursor peptides. Remarkably, LanKCt enzymes bind tightly to cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside thioamitide BGCs, and the resulting complex complete the macrocyclization of AviCys rings. Furthermore, LanKCt enzymes are present in the genomes of many thioamitide-producing strains and are functional when in complex with cysteine decarboxylases to produce AviCys macrocycles. Thus, our study reveals the participation of lanthipeptide synthetases as a general strategy for dehydration and AviCys formation during thioamitides biosynthesis and thus paves the way for the bioengineering of this class of bioactive natural products.",
