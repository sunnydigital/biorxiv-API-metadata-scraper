    "abstract": "The human brain differs from that of other primates, but the genetic basis of these differences remains unclear. We investigated the evolutionary pressures acting on almost all human protein-coding genes (N=11,667; 1:1 orthologs in primates) based on their divergence from those of early hominins, such as Neanderthals, and non-human primates. We confirm that genes encoding brain-related proteins are among the most strongly conserved protein-coding genes in the human genome. Combining our evolutionary pressure metrics for the protein-coding genome with recent datasets, we found that this conservation applied to genes functionally associated with the synapse and expressed in brain structures such as the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Conversely, several genes presenting signatures commonly associated with positive selection appear as causing brain diseases or conditions, such as micro/macrocephaly, Joubert syndrome, dyslexia, and autism. Among those, a number of DNA damage response genes associated with microcephaly in humans such as BRCA1, NHEJ1, TOP3A, and RNF168 show strong signs of positive selection and might have played a role in human brain size expansion during primate evolution. We also showed that cerebellum granule neurons express a set of genes also presenting signatures of positive selection and that may have contributed to the emergence of fine motor skills and social cognition in humans. This resource is available online and can be used to estimate evolutionary constraints acting on a set of genes and to explore their relative contributions to human traits.",

    "abstract": "Heavy alcohol consumption can have significant deleterious neural consequences, including brain atrophy, neuronal loss, poorer white matter fiber integrity, and cognitive decline. However, the effects of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption on brain structure remain unclear. Here, we examine the associations between alcohol intake and brain structure using multimodal imaging data from 36,678 generally healthy middle-aged and older adults from the UK Biobank, controlling for numerous potential confounds. We find negative associations between alcohol intake and global gray matter volume (GMV) and white matter volume (WMV), which become stronger as intake increases. An examination of the associations between alcohol intake and 139 regional GMV imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and 375 WM microstructure IDPs yielded 304 (59.1%) significant findings, including 125 GMV IDPs that are spread across the brain and 179 WM microstructure IDPs across multiple tract regions. In general, findings comport with the existing literature. However, a daily alcohol intake of as little as one to two units - 250 to 500 ml of a 4% beer or 76 to 146 ml of a 13% wine - is already associated with GMV deficits and altered WMV microstructure, placing moderate drinkers at risk.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryModerate alcohol intake, consuming one or more daily alcohol units, has adverse effects on brain health.",

    "abstract": "Despite the important role of fungi for ecosystems, relatively little is known about the factors underlying the dynamics of their diversity. Moreover, studies do not typically consider their dark diversity: the species absent from an otherwise suitable site. Here, we examined potential drivers of local fungal dark diversity in temperate woodland and open habitats using LiDAR and in-situ field measurements, combined with a systematically collected and geographically comprehensive macro-fungi and plant data set. For the first time, we also estimated species pools of fungi by considering both plant and fungi co-occurrences. The most important LiDAR variables for modelling fungal dark diversity were amplitude and echo ratio, which are both thought to represent vegetation structure. These results suggest that the local fungal dark diversity is highest in production forests like plantations and lowest in more open forests and in open habitats with little woody vegetation. Plant species richness was the strongest explanatory factor overall and negatively correlated with local fungal dark diversity. Soil fertility showed a positive relationship with dark diversity in open habitats. These findings may indicate that the local dark diversity of macro-fungi is highest in areas with a relatively high human impact (typically areas with low plant species richness and high soil fertility). Overall, this study brings novel insights into local macro-fungi dark diversity patterns, suggesting that a multitude of drivers related to both soil and vegetation act in concert to determine fungal dark diversity.",

    "abstract": "During the essential and conserved process of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), chromatin accessibility must increase to promote transcription. Drosophila is a well-established model for defining mechanisms that drive ZGA. Zelda (ZLD) is a key pioneer transcription factor (TF) that promotes ZGA in the Drosophila embryo. However, many genomic loci that contain GA-rich motifs become accessible during ZGA independent of ZLD. Therefore, we hypothesized that other early TFs that function with ZLD have not yet been identified, especially those that are capable of binding to GA-rich motifs such as CLAMP. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila embryonic development requires maternal CLAMP to: 1) activate zygotic transcription; 2) increase chromatin accessibility at promoters of specific genes that often encode other essential TFs; 3) enhance chromatin accessibility to facilitate ZLD occupancy at a subset of key embryonic promoters. Thus, maternal CLAMP functions with ZLD in a pioneer-like role to drive zygotic genome activation.",

    "abstract": "Methods to repair bone defects arising from trauma, resection, or disease, continue to be sought after. Cyclic mechanical loading is well established to influence bone (re)modelling activity, in which bone formation and resorption are correlated to micro-scale strain. Based on this, the application of mechanical stimulation across a bone defect could improve healing. However, if ignoring the mechanical integrity of defected bone, loading regimes have a high potential to either cause damage or be ineffective. This study explores real-time finite element (rtFE) methods that use three-dimensional structural analyses from micro-computed tomography images to estimate effective peak cyclic loads in a subject-specific and time-dependent manner. It demonstrates the concept in a cyclically loaded mouse caudal vertebral bone defect model. Using rtFE analysis combined with adaptive mechanical loading, mouse bone healing was significantly improved over non-loaded controls, with no incidence of vertebral fractures. Such rtFE-driven adaptive loading regimes demonstrated here could be relevant to clinical bone defect healing scenarios, where mechanical loading can become patient-specific and more efficacious. This is achieved by accounting for initial bone defect conditions and spatio-temporal healing, both being factors that are always unique to the patient.",

    "abstract": "The combination of phase separation and disorder-to-order transitions can give rise to ordered, semi-crystalline fibrillar assemblies that underlie prion phenomena namely, the non-Mendelian transfer of information across cells. Recently, a method known as Distributed Amphifluoric Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (DAmFRET) was developed to study the convolution of phase separation and disorder-to-order transitions in live cells. In this assay, a protein of interest is expressed to a broad range of concentrations and the acquisition of local density and order, measured by changes in FRET, is used to map phase transitions for different proteins. The high-throughput nature of this assay affords the promise of uncovering sequence-to-phase behavior relationships in live cells. Here, we report the development of a supervised method to obtain automated and accurate classifications of phase transitions quantified using the DAmFRET assay. Systems that we classify as undergoing two-state discontinuous transitions are consistent with prion-like behaviors, although the converse is not always true. We uncover well-established and surprising new sequence features that contribute to two-state phase behavior of prion-like domains. Additionally, our method enables quantitative, comparative assessments of sequence-specific driving forces for phase transitions in live cells. Finally, we demonstrate that a modest augmentation of DAmFRET measurements, specifically time-dependent protein expression profiles, can allow one to apply classical nucleation theory to extract sequence-specific lower bounds on the probability of nucleating ordered assemblies. Taken together, our approaches lead to a useful analysis pipeline that enables the extraction of mechanistic inferences regarding phase transitions in live cells.",

These animals are assumed to be functionally blind under red light, an assumption that might originate in the fact that they are dichromats who possess ultraviolet and green but not red cones. But the inability to see red as a color does not necessarily rule out form vision based on red light absorption. We measured Long-Evans rats capacity for visual form discrimination under red light of various wavelength bands. Upon viewing a black and white grating, they had to distinguish between two categories of orientation, horizontal and vertical. Psychometric curves plotting judged orientation versus angle demonstrate the conserved visual capacity of rats under red light. Investigations aiming to explore rodent physiological and behavioral functions in the absence of visual input should not assume red-light blindness.",

Several brain areas underlie the temporal information, such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum, but evidence of how they cooperate to process temporal information is scarce. Notably, the analysis of neural activity during learning are rare, mainly because timing tasks usually take a long time to train. Here we investigated how the time encoding evolves when animals learn to time a 1.5 s interval. We designed a novel training protocol where rats go from naive- to proficient-level timing performance within a single session, allowing us to investigate neuronal activity from very early learning stages. We used pharmacological experiments and machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the level of time encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum. Our results show a double dissociation between the roles of the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum during temporal learning, where the former commits to early learning stages while the latter become more engaged as animals become more proficient in the task.",

    "abstract": "IgA is the second most abundant antibody present in circulation and is enriched at mucosal surfaces. As such, IgA plays a key role in protection against a variety of mucosal pathogens, including viruses. In addition to neutralizing viruses directly, IgA can also stimulate Fc-dependent effector functions via engagement of Fc alpha receptors (FcRI) expressed on the surface of certain immune effector cells. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte, express FcRI, and are often the first to respond to sites of injury and infection. Here, we describe a novel function for IgA:virus immune complexes (ICs) during viral infections. We show that IgA:virus ICs potentiate NETosis - the programmed cell death pathway through which neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Mechanistically, IgA:virus ICs potentiated a suicidal NETosis pathway via engagement of FcRI on neutrophils through a toll-like receptor (TLR)-independent, NADPH oxidase complex-dependent pathway. NETs also were capable of trapping and inactivating viruses, consistent with an antiviral function.",

    "abstract": "When multiple individuals are exposed to the same sensory event, some are bound to have less typical experiences than others. These atypical experiences are underpinned by atypical stimulus-evoked brain activity, the extent of which is often indexed by intersubject correlation (ISC). Previous research has attributed individual differences in ISC to variation in trait-like behavioral phenotypes. Here, we extend this line of work by showing that an individuals degree and spatial distribution of ISC are closely related to their brains intrinsic functional architecture. Using resting state and movie watching fMRI data from 176 Human Connectome Project participants, we reveal that resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) profiles can be used to predict cortex-wide ISC with considerable accuracy. Similar region-level analyses demonstrate that the amount of ISC a brain region exhibits during movie watching is associated with its connectivity to others at rest, and that the nature of these connectivity-activity relationships varies as a function of the regions role in sensory information processing. Finally, we show that an individuals unique spatial distribution of ISC, independent of its magnitude, is also related to their RSFC profile. These findings suggest that the brains ability to process complex sensory information is tightly linked to its baseline functional organization and motivate a more comprehensive understanding of individual responses to naturalistic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "RationaleSchizophrenia patients consistently show deficits in sensory-evoked broadband gamma oscillations and click-evoked entrainment at 40 Hz, called the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Since such evoked oscillations depend on cortical N-methyl D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-mediated network activity, they can serve as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the preclinical development of drug candidates engaging these circuits. However, there is little test-retest reliability data in preclinical species, a prerequisite for within-subject testing paradigms.\n\nObjectivesWe investigated the long-term stability of these measures in a rodent model.\n\nMethodsFemale rats with chronic epidural implants were used to record tone- and 40 Hz click-evoked responses at multiple time points and across six sessions, spread over 3 weeks. We assessed reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Separately, we used mixed-effects ANOVA to examine time and session effects. Individual subject variability was determined using the coefficient of variation (CV). Lastly, to illustrate the importance of long-term measure stability for within-subject testing design, we used low to moderate doses of an NMDA antagonist MK801 (0.025-0.15 mg/kg) to disrupt the evoked responses.\n\nResultsWe found that 40 Hz ASSR showed good reliability (ICC=0.60-0.75) while the reliability of tone-evoked gamma ranged from fair to good (0.33-0.67). We noted time but no session effects. Subjects showed a lower variance for ASSR over tone-evoked gamma. Both measures were dose-dependently attenuated by NMDA antagonism.\n\nConclusionOverall, while both measures use NMDA transmission, 40 Hz ASSR showed superior psychometric properties of higher ICC and lower CV, relative to tone-evoked gamma.",

    "abstract": "Multiparametric phenotypic screening of cells, for example assessing their responses to small molecules or knockdown/knockout of specific genes, is a powerful approach to understanding cellular systems and identifying potential new therapeutic strategies. However, automated tools for analyzing similarities and differences between a large number of tested conditions have not been readily available. Methods designed for clustering cells cannot identify differences between samples effectively. We introduce O_SCPLOWCOMPAC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEC_SCPLOW for ultra-fast and robust analysis of multiparametric high-throughput screening. Applying a mass-aware gridding algorithm using hypercubes, O_SCPLOWCOMPAC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEC_SCPLOW performs automatic and effective similarity comparison for hundreds to thousands of tests and provides information about the treatment effect. Particularly for screening data, O_SCPLOWCOMPAC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEC_SCPLOW is equipped with modules to remove various sources of bias.\n\nBenchmarking tests show that O_SCPLOWCOMPAC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEC_SCPLOW can circumvent batch effects and perform a similarity analysis substantially faster than conventional analysis tools. Applying O_SCPLOWCOMPAC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEC_SCPLOW to high-throughput flow cytometry screening data, we were able to distinguish subtle phenotypic drug responses in a human sample and a genetically engineered mouse model with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). O_SCPLOWCOMPAC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEC_SCPLOW revealed groups of drugs with similar responses even though their mechanisms are distinct from each other. In another screening, O_SCPLOWCOMPAC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEC_SCPLOW effectively circumvented batch effects and grouped samples from AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients using clinical flow cytometry data.",

    "abstract": "PurposeGrowing evidence suggests, in glaucoma, the dendritic degeneration of subpopulation of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) may precede RGCs soma death. Since different RGCs synapse in different IPL sublayers, visualization of the lamellar structure of the IPL could enable both clinical and fundamental advances in glaucoma understanding and management. In this pilot study, we investigated whether visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) could detect the difference in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) sublayers thicknesses between small cohorts of healthy and glaucomatous subjects.\n\nMethodWe investigated vis-OCT retinal images from nine healthy and five glaucomatous subjects. Four of the healthy subjects were scanned three times each in two separate visits, and five healthy and five glaucoma subjects were scanned three times during a single visit. Raster speckle-reduction scans (3 by 3 by 1.2 mm^3: horizontal; vertical; axial directions with 8192x8x1024 samplings, respectively) of the superior macular were acquired. IPL sublayers were then manually segmented using averaged A-line profiles.\n\nResultsThe mean ages of glaucoma and healthy subjects are 59.6 +/- 13.4 and 45.4 +/- 14.4 years (p =0.02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), respectively. The visual field mean deviation (MD) are -26.4 to -7.7 dB in glaucoma patient and -1.6 to 1.1 dB in healthy subjects (p =0.002). The mean circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses are 59.6 +/- 9.1 m in glaucoma and 99.2 +/- 16.2 m in healthy subjects (p=0.004). Median coefficients of variation (CVs) of intra-session repeatability for the entire IPL and three sublayers are 3.1%, 5.6%, 6.9%, and 5.6% in healthy subjects and 1.8%, 6.0%, 7.7%, and 6.2% in glaucoma patients, respectively. The mean entire IPL thicknesses are 36.2 +/- 1.5 m in glaucomatous and 40.1 +/- 1.7 micrometer in healthy eyes (p=0.003, Mixed-effects model). We found that the middle sublayer thickness was responsible for the majority of the difference (14.2 +/- 1.8 m in glaucomatous and 17.5 +/- 1.4 in healthy eyes, p<0.01).\n\nConclusionsIPL sublayer analysis revealed that the middle sublayer could be responsible for the majority of IPL thinning in glaucoma. Vis-OCT quantified IPL sublayers with good repeatability in both glaucoma and healthy subjects. Visualization of the IPL sublayers may enable the investigation of lamella-specific changes in the IPL in glaucoma and may help elucidate the response of different types of RGCs to the disease.",

Here, we investigated the contribution of early thalamic inputs onto L1 interneurons for the establishment of top-down inputs in the primary visual cortex. We find that bottom-up thalamic inputs predominate during early L1 development and preferentially target neurogliaform cells. We find that these projections are critical for the subsequent strengthening of feedback inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex. Enucleation or selective removal of thalamic afferents blocked this phenomenon. Notably, while early activation of anterior cingulate afferents resulted in a premature strengthening of these top-down inputs to neurogliaform cells, this was also dependent on thalamic inputs. Our results demonstrate that the proper establishment of top-down feedback inputs critically depends on bottom-up inputs from the thalamus during early postnatal development.",

    "abstract": "Proteins involved in interactions throughout the course of evolution tend to co-evolve and compensatory or coordinated changes may occur in interacting proteins to maintain or refine interactions between them. However, certain residue pair alterations may prove to be detrimental for functional interactions. Hence, determining co-evolutionary pairings that could be structurally or functionally relevant for maintaining the conservation of an inter-protein interaction is important. Inter-protein co-evolution analysis in a number of complexes with the help of multiple existing methodologies suggested that co-evolutionary pairings can occur in spatially proximal as well as distant regions of inter-protein interaction complexes. Subsequently, the Co-Var (Correlated Variation) method based on mutual information and Bhattacharyya coefficient was developed, validated and found to perform relatively better than CAPS and EV-complex. Interestingly, while applying the Co-Var measure on a set of protein-protein interaction complexes, co-evolutionary pairings were obtained in spatially proximal and distant regions in inter-protein complexes. Our approach involves determining high degree co-evolutionary pairings which include multiple co-evolutionary connections between particular co-evolved residue positions in one protein and particular residue positions in the binding partner. Detailed analyses of high degree co-evolutionary pairings in protein-protein complexes involved in inter-cellular communication during cancer metastasis were performed. These analyses suggested that most of the residue positions involved in such co-evolutionary pairings mainly occurred within functional domains of constituent proteins and substitution mutations were also common among these co-evolved positions. The physiological relevance of these predictions suggests that Co-Var can predict residues that could be crucial for preserving functional protein-protein interactions. Finally, Co-Var web server that implements this methodology was developed. This web server available at http://www.hpppi.iicb.res.in/ishi/covar/index.html identifies co-evolutionary pairings in intra-protein and inter-protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial microcompartments are organelle-like structures composed entirely of proteins. They have evolved to carry out several distinct and specialized metabolic functions in a wide variety of bacteria. Their outer shell is constructed from thousands of tessellating protein subunits, encapsulating enzymes that carry out the internal metabolic reactions. The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, current resources present challenges for understanding the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database (https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphazise the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives. The current database includes 134 structures and is available to the public with the anticipation that it will serve as a growing resource for scientists interested in understanding protein-based metabolic organelles in bacteria.",

While WM is associated with individual differences in a variety of learning tasks, successful acquisition of speech categories is argued to be contingent on WM-independent procedural-learning mechanisms. Thus, the role of WM in speech category learning is unclear. In Experiment 1, we show that individuals with higher WM acquire non-native speech categories faster and to a greater extent than those with lower WM. In Experiment 2, we replicate these results and show that individuals with higher WM use more optimal, procedural-based learning strategies and demonstrate more distinct speech-evoked pupillary responses for correct relative to incorrect trials. We propose that higher WM may allow for greater stimulus-related attention, resulting in more robust representations and optimal learning strategies. We discuss implications for neurobiological models of speech category learning.",

We performed a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 14,313 cells from liver tissues collected from pre-procurement, at the end of preservation and 2 h post-reperfusion. We made detailed annotations of mononuclear phagocyte, endothelial cell, NK/T, B and plasma cell clusters, and we described the dynamic changes of the transcriptome of these clusters during IRI and the interaction between mononuclear phagocyte clusters and other cell clusters. In addition, we found that TNFAIP3 interacting protein 3 (TNIP3), specifically and highly expressed in Kupffer cell clusters post-reperfusion, may have a protective effect on IRI. In summary, our study provides the first dynamic transcriptome map of intrahepatic cell clusters during liver transplantation at single-cell resolution.",

Hemocytes are key players of the immune system in shrimps; however, their classification, maturation, and differentiation are still under debate. To date, only discrete and inconsistent information on the classification of shrimp hemocytes has been reported, showing that the morphological characteristics are not sufficient to resolve their actual roles. Our present study using single-cell RNA sequencing, revealed nine types of hemocytes of Marsupenaeus japonicus based on their transcriptional profiles. We identified markers of each subpopulation and the differentiation pathways involved in their maturation. We also discovered cell growth factors that might play crucial roles in hemocyte differentiation. Different immune roles among these subpopulations were suggested from the analysis of differentially expressed immune-related genes. These results provide a unified classification of shrimp hemocytes, which improves the understanding of its immune system.",

    "abstract": "The difficulty of studying post-implantation development in mammals has sparked a flurry of activity to develop in vitro models, termed embryoids, based on self-organizing pluripotent stem cells. Previous approaches to derive embryoids either lack the physiological morphology and signaling interactions, or are not yet optimal for modeling post-gastrulation development. Here, we report a bioengineering-inspired approach aimed at addressing this gap. A high-throughput cell aggregation approach was employed to simultaneously coax mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into hundreds of uniform epiblast-like (EPI) aggregates in a solid matrix-free manner. When co-cultured with mouse trophoblast stem cell (TSC) aggregates, the resulting hybrid structures initiate gastrulation-like events and undergo axial morphogenesis to yield structures, termed EpiTS embryoids, with a pronounced anterior development, including brain-like regions. We identify the presence of an epithelium in EPI aggregates as the major determinant for the axial morphogenesis and anterior development seen in EpiTS embryoids. Our results demonstrate the potential of EpiTS embryoids to study peri-gastrulation development in vitro.",

The vasculature is a prominent component of multiple stem cell niches. However, its role in adult intestinal homeostasis remains largely understudied. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognised crosstalk between adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in Drosophila and the vasculature-like tracheal system, which is essential for intestinal regeneration. Following damage to the intestinal epithelium, gut-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate tracheal HIF-1 and bidirectional FGF/FGFR signaling, leading to reversible remodelling of gut-associated terminal tracheal cells and ISC proliferation following damage. Unexpectedly, ROS-induced adult tracheal plasticity involves downregulation of the tracheal specification factor trachealess (trh) and upregulation of IGF2 mRNA-binding protein (IGF2BP2/Imp). Our results reveal a novel intestine/vasculature interorgan communication program, which is essential to adapt stem cells response to the proliferative demands of the intestinal epithelium.",

    "abstract": "With wide ranging diversity in their geometries, binding strengths and chemical properties, noncanonical base pairs are equipped to intricately regulate and control the structural dynamics of RNA molecules. Protonation of nucleobases adds to the diversity. Compared to the unprotonated scenario, on one hand they open up new alternatives for base pairing interactions (Class I) while on the other, they modulate the geometry and stability of existing base pairing interactions (Class II). In both cases, compensation of the energetic cost associated with nucleobase protonation at physiological pH, can be understood in terms of protonation induced restructuring of charge distribution. This not only leads to modifications in existing base-base interactions but often also leads to additional stabilizing interactions, resulting in the formation of protonated base triples. Here we report our detailed quantum chemical studies, in conjunction with structural bioinformatics based analysis of RNA crystal and NMR structure datasets, probing into the contribution of such protonated triples in the structural dynamics of RNA. Our studies revealed more than 55 varieties of protonated triples in RNA, some of which occur recurrently within conserved structural motifs present in rRNAs, tRNAs and in other synthetic RNAs. Our studies suggest that high occurrence frequencies are associated with protonated triples which satisfy the specific structural requirements of conserved motifs where they occur. For example, protonated triples with flexible geometries are involved in the formation of tertiary contacts between different distant motifs. Stabilization of protonated base pairs, through the induction of additional energetically cooperative interactions, appears to be another factor. These results provide significant insights into the sequence-structure-function relationships in RNA.",

An example for how effort affects preferences is the  contrast effect were items that follow effort production gain value. In the current study we examined whether the association of grip effort with snack food items would change preferences. In four experiments, we first identified each participants individual preferences of snack food items and subjective maximal grip force. We then associated different effort levels with items of similar preference. Finally, we tested for changes in preferences following the effort association. Across the four studies, effort association had no effect on preferences. Using Bayesian analyses, we conclude that simultaneous association of effort does not change preferences in our studies and call for a replication effort of previous findings.",

Here, using both immunofluorescence and multi-parameter flow cytometry we focus on the pancreatic islet morphology and immune infiltrate observed in naturally-protected NOD mice. We show that naturally-protected NOD mice are characterised by an increased frequency of insulin-containing, smaller sized, pancreatic islets. Although mice remain diabetes free, florid immune infiltrate remains. However, this immune infiltrate is skewed towards a regulatory phenotype in both T and B-cell compartments. Pancreatic islets have an increased frequency of IL-10 producing B cells and associated cell surface markers. Resident memory CD69+CD8+ T cells show a significant shift towards reduced CD103 expression, while CD4+ T cells have increased FoxP3+CTLA4+ expression. These data indicate that naturally-protected NOD mice have a unique islet signature and provide new insight into regulatory mechanisms within pancreatic islets.",

In the recent past, though novel drugs have been added to the current TB regimen [1], research on new vaccine candidates needs a greater thrust. Secretory proteins of H37Rv are frequently studied for their antigenicity and their scope as protein subunit vaccines decrees further analysis. In this study, Rv3899c of H37Rv emerges as a potential vaccine candidate on its evaluation by several bioinformatics tools. It is a non-toxin, secretory protein with an  immunoglobulin-like fold which does not show similarity with a human protein. We found Rv3899c homologs in several mycobacterial species and its antigenic score (0.54) to compare well with the known immunogens such as ESAT-6 (0.56) and Rv1860 (0.52). Structural examination of Rv3899c predicted ten antigenic peptides, an accessibility profile of the antigenic determinants constituting B-cell epitope rich regions and a low Abundance of Antigenic Regions (AAR) value. Significantly, our study shows ESX-2 secretion system proteins and antigenic PE/PPE proteins of H37Rv as the interacting partners of Rv3899c. Further, molecular docking predicted Rv3899c to interact with human leukocyte antigen HLA-DRB1*04:01 through its antigenically conserved motif (RAAEQQRLQRIVDAVARQEPRISWAAGLRDDGTT). Interestingly, the binding affinity was observed to increase on citrullation of its Arg1 residue. Taken together, the computational characterization and predictive information suggest Rv3899c to be a promising TB vaccine candidate, which should be examined and validated experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Smal) is a typical example of an environmental originated opportunistic human pathogen, which can thrive at different habitats including the human body and can cause a wide range of infections. It must cope with heat stress during transition from the environment to the human body as the physiological temperature of the human body (37 {square}) is higher than environmental niches (22-30 {square}). Interestingly, S. rhizophila a phylogenetic neighbour of Smal within genus Stenotrophomonas is unable to grow at 37 {square}. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Smal is adapted to human body temperature, which could suggest its evolution as an opportunistic human pathogen. In this study, we have performed comparative transcriptome analysis of S. maltophilia grown at 28 {square} and 37 {square} as temperature representative for environmental niches and human body respectively. RNA-Seq analysis revealed several interesting findings showing alterations in gene expression levels at 28 {square} and 37 {square}, which can play an important role during infection. We have observed downregulation of genes involved in cellular motility, energy production and metabolism, replication and repair whereas upregulation of VirB/D4 Type IV secretion system, aerotaxis, cation diffusion facilitator family transporter and LacI family transcriptional regulators at 37 {square}. Microscopy and plate assays corroborated altered expression of genes involved in motility. The results obtained enhance our understanding of the strategies employed by S. maltophilia during adaptation towards the human body.\n\nImpact statementStenotrophomonas maltophilia (Smal) is a WHO listed multidrug resistant nosocomial pathogen. Interestingly, S. maltophilia species can grow both at 28 {square} and 37 {square} unlike its closest taxonomic relative, i.e., S. rhizophila and also majority species belonging this genus. Hence this ability to grow at 37 {square}, i.e., human body temperature might have played key role in the unique success and emergence of this species as opportunistic human pathogen. Using transcriptome sequencing, we have identified set of genes which are differentially regulated at 37 {square} and investigated their evolutionary history. This study has revealed regulation of genes involved in motility, metabolism, energy, replication, transcription, aerotaxis and a type IV secretion system might have a role in successful adaption to a distinct lifestyle. The findings will be helpful in further systematic studies on understanding and management of an emerging human pathogen such as Smal.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage organelles; their rapid synthesis, expansion, and degradation, as well as their varied interactions with other organelles allow cells to maintain lipid homeostasis. While the molecular details of lipid droplet dynamics are currently a very active area of investigation, this work has been primarily performed in cultured cells and in vitro systems. By taking advantage of the powerful transgenic and in vivo imaging opportunities afforded by the zebrafish model system, we have built a suite of tools to allow lipid droplets to be studied in real-time from the subcellular to the whole organism level. Fluorescently-tagging the lipid droplet associated proteins, perilipin 2 and perilipin 3, in the endogenous loci, permits visualization of lipid droplets in the intestine, liver, lateral line and adipose tissue. Using these transgenic lines we have found that perilipin 3 is rapidly loaded on intestinal lipid droplets following a high fat meal and then largely replaced by perilipin 2 a few hours later. These powerful new tools will facilitate studies on the role of lipid droplets in different tissues and under different genetic and physiological manipulations.",

This approach has been assisted by the development of metabarcoding PCR primers that are suited for detection of a wide range of taxa. However, little effort has gone into exploring the value of the non-target DNA sequences that are generated in every survey, but subsequently discarded. Here we demonstrate that fish-targeted markers widely employed in aquatic biomonitoring can also detect birds and mammals present in the surrounding habitats. We showcase this feature in three temperate estuaries over multiple seasons, where dozens of bird and mammal species offer valuable insights into spatial and temporal faunal variation. Our results indicate that existing metabarcode sequence data sets are suitable for mining and exploration of this  molecular by-catch, and that any future eDNA-based surveys can be designed to accommodate this enhanced property of this widely applicable tool.",

Three female-sterile alleles at Sxl in Drosophila melanogaster were previously shown to genetically interact to varying degrees with the maternally inherited endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis. Given this genetic interaction and W. pipientis ability to manipulate reproduction in Drosophila, we carried out a careful study of both the population genetics (within four Drosophila species) and molecular evolutionary analysis (across 20 Drosophila species) of Sxl. Consistent with earlier studies, we find that selective constraint has played a prominent role in Sxls molecular evolution within Drosophila, but we also observe patterns that suggest both episodic bursts of protein evolution and recent positive selection at Sxl. The episodic nature of Sxls protein evolution is discussed in light of its genetic interaction with W. pipientis.",

Identifying the mechanisms that shape communities is not simple, as they can vary spatially. Here, we investigated how the phylogenetic structure of Canidae across the globe is affected by the environment and competition. We first identified phylogenetically clustered and overdispersed assemblages of canids over the planet taking into account regional pools of species in South and North America, Eurasia, and Africa. Then, we applied Structural Equation Models in these communities in order to identify the effect of temperature, vegetation cover, human impact, and body size dissimilarity on the spatial distribution of the phylogenetic information of canids. Only southern South America and the Middle East had strong phylogenetic clustered patterns, while the rest of the planet predominantly showed overdispersed assemblages. Body size dissimilarity and vegetation cover were the most important variables to explain the spatial patterns of phylogenetic structure in clustered and overdispersed communities, respectively. Canidae community composition across the world presents significant patterns of clustering and overdispersion, which vary following mainly the environmental gradient, suggesting habitat filtering as the main force acting on Canidae assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Which variables determine the rate of gene and protein sequence evolution is a central question in evolutionary genomics. In the model organism fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), the determinants of the rate of sequence evolution have yet to be determined. Previous studies in other organisms have typically found gene expression levels to be most significant, with numerous other variables identified as having a smaller impact. Here, partial least squares regression (PLS) and partial correlation analysis are used to model sequence evolution rates in the fission yeast genome by a range of variables. Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores as well as partial correlation coefficients are calculated for each variable, and used as estimates of the influence of each independent variable on sequence evolution rate. Unlike many previous studies in other organisms, centrality in the PPI network is shown to be the most important variable, and gene expression found to be less influential. Considerable heterogeneity is found in the influence of different gene ontology terms as well as amino acid composition. However, the majority of variance in constraint in fission yeast remains unexplained by this study, indicating that variables not yet considered and stochastics probably have considerable impact on the rate of molecular evolution.",

Newly emerged adults were exposed for 24h to either honey, sucrose solution 20%, sucrose solution 10%, or no food, before being conditioned in an olfactory associative learning task in which an odor (orange) was associated to a reward (host larvae). Wasps fed honey showed 3.5 times higher learning performances and 1.5 times longer memory retention times than wasps fed sucrose solutions and starved wasps. Poor diets also reduced longevity and fecundity. Our results demonstrate the importance of early adult nutrition for optimal cognitive function in these parasitoid wasps that must quickly develop olfactory memories for choosing high quality hosts for their progeny.",

    "abstract": "KdpFABC is an oligomeric K+ transport complex in prokaryotes that maintains ionic homeostasis under stress conditions. The complex comprises a channel-like subunit (KdpA) from the Superfamily of K+ Transporters and a pump-like subunit (KdpB) from the superfamily of P-type ATPases. Recent structural work has defined the architecture and generated contradictory hypotheses for the transport mechanism. Here, we use substrate analogs to stabilize four key intermediates in the reaction cycle and determine the corresponding structures by cryo-EM. We find that KdpB undergoes conformational changes consistent with other representatives from the P-type superfamily, whereas KdpA, KdpC and KdpF remain static. We observe a series of spherical densities that we assign as K+ or water and which define a pathway for K+ transport. This pathway runs through an intramembrane tunnel in KdpA and delivers ions to sites in the membrane domain of KdpB. Our structures suggest a mechanism where ATP hydrolysis is coupled to K+ transfer between alternative sites in the membrane domain of KdpB, ultimately reaching a low-affinity site where a water-filled pathway allows release of K+ to the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "I.Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a chronic, progressive, and heterogeneous disease, which exhibits irregular and chaotic atrial electrical activity. The exact mechanisms of AF have remained elusive. The complexity of the atrial signals, irregular period, and the non-local nature of AF make it very difficult to characterize its spatiotemporal organization. This paper presents a set of data-processing tools to find and evaluate the intracardiac signals in AF based on synchronization theory. Specifically, a graph-theoretical algorithm is developed to prune spurious detections of atrial complexes (spikes). The processing pipeline was applied to 10 intracardiac recordings obtained during ablation procedures in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. The AF cases were classified into three main types. Type I (n=3) is defined as the presence of a single driver that dominates both atria and is consistent with the mother rotor hypothesis. The majority of the cases had more than one driver and were classified as types II (n=4) and III (n=3). The drivers, i.e., the interacting organized areas, in type II have significantly different peak frequencies and are only weakly coupled. The drivers in type III have close frequencies, are moderately interacting, and show evidence of transient intermittent phase-locking (intermittency). In addition, a long-distance correlation between channels from the left and right atria was observed. The theory of synchronization is a useful conceptual framework to process and analyze AF and can provide mechanistic insight into AF and the effect of various interventions.",

    "abstract": "MotivationBacterial genomes are being deposited into online databases at an increasing rate. Genome annotation represents one of the first efforts to understand organisms and their diseases. Some evolutionary relationships that are capable of being annotated only from genomes are conserved gene neighbourhoods (CNs), phylogenetic profiles (PPs), and gene fusions. At present, there is no standalone software that enables networks of interactions among proteins to be created using these three evolutionary characteristics with efficient and effective results.\n\nResultsWe developed GENPPI software for the ab initio prediction of interaction networks using predicted proteins from a genome. In our case study, we employed 50 genomes of the genus Corynebacterium. Based on the PP relationship, GENPPI differentiated genomes between the ovis and equi biovars of the species Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and created groups among the other species analysed. If we inspected only the CN relationship, we could not entirely separate biovars, only species. Our software GENPPI was determined to be efficient because, for example, it creates interaction networks from the central genomes of 50 species/lineages with an average size of 2200 genes in less than 40 minutes on a conventional computer. Our software is compelling because the interaction networks that it creates reflect evolutionary relationships among species and were obtained in average nucleotide identity (ANI) analyses. Additionally, this software enables the user to define how he or she intends to explore the PP and CN characteristics through various parameters, enabling the creation of customized interaction networks. For instance, users can set parameters regarding the genus, metagenome, or pangenome. In addition to the parameterization of GENPPI, it is also the users choice regarding which set of genomes he or she is going to study.\n\nAvailabilityThe source code in the Common Lisp language, binary files for different operating systems, and GENPPI software tutorials are available at {{github.com/santosardr/genppi}}.\n\nContactsantosardr@ufu.br\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify detailed changes in behavior, and in salivary serum amyloid A (SAA), associated with subclinical mastitis. This included standard sickness behaviors (which form part of an adaptive response to conserve energy, minimize heat loss and facilitate recovery following infection and inflammation) and lesser-studied behaviors, that are biologically predicted to change at low-level infection, and therefore particularly relevant for detecting subclinical mastitis (here labelled  luxury behaviors). SAA is a physiological marker of systemic inflammation, with levels in milk and serum already known to increase during subclinical mastitis. We investigated whether the same was true for SAA in cow saliva. Data were collected for n = 34 commercial barn-housed dairy cows, tested in 17 matched-pairs. Each pair comprised a cow with subclinical mastitis (SCM) and a healthy control (CTRL), identified using somatic cell count (SCC) (SCM: SCC >200 x1000 cells/ml; CTRL: SCC <100 x1000 cells/ml). SCM cows were selected for study ad-hoc, at which point they were paired with a CTRL cow, based upon parity and calving date; consequently, the full data set was accrued over several months. Data were collected for each pair over 3 days: SCC (l4:00-l5:00h) Day 1; behavior (24h from 00:00h) Day 2; salivary serum amyloid-A (SAA) Day 3. We report, for the first time, that an increase in salivary SAA occurs during subclinical mastitis; SAA was higher in SCM cows and demonstrated a positive (weak) correlation with SCC. The behavioral comparisons revealed that SCM cows had reductions in activity (behavioral transitions and distance moved), social exploration, social reactivity (here: likelihood to move away/be displaced following receipt of agonism), performance of social grooming and head butts, and the receipt of agonistic non-contact challenges. In addition, SCM cows received more head swipes, and spent a greater proportion of time lying with their head on their flank than CTRL cows. SCM cows also displayed an altered feeding pattern; they spent a greater proportion of feeding time in direct contact with two conspecifics, and a lower proportion of feeding time at self-locking feed barriers, than CTRL cows. Behavioral measures were found to correlate, albeit loosely, with serum SAA in a direction consistent with predictions for sickness behavior. These included positive correlations with both lying duration and the receipt of all agonistic behavior, and negative correlations with feeding, drinking, the performance of all social and all agonistic behavior, and social reactivity. We conclude that changes in salivary SAA, social behavior, and activity offer potential in the detection of subclinical mastitis and recommend further investigation to substantiate and refine our findings.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroscience make the extraction of full neuronal morphology at whole brain dataset available. To produce quality morphometry at large scale, it is highly desirable but extremely challenging to efficiently handle petabyte-scale high-resolution whole brain imaging database. Here, we developed a multi-level method to produce high quality somatic, dendritic, axonal, and potential synaptic morphometry, which was made possible by utilizing necessary petabyte hardware and software platform to optimize both the data and workflow management. Our method also boosts data sharing and remote collaborative validation. We highlight a petabyte application dataset involving 62 whole mouse brains, from which we identified 50,233 somata of individual neurons, profiled the dendrites of 11,322 neurons, reconstructed the full 3-D morphology of more than one thousand neurons including their dendrites and full axons, and detected million scale putative synaptic sites derived from axonal boutons. Analysis and simulation of these data indicate the promise of this approach for modern large-scale morphology applications.",

    "abstract": "Learning to execute precise, yet complex, motor actions through practice is a trait shared by most organisms. Here we develop a novel experimental approach for the comprehensive investigation and characterization of the learning dynamics of practiced motion. Following the dynamical systems framework, we consider a high-dimensional behavioral space in which a trial-by-trial sequence of motor outputs defines a trajectory that converges to a fixed point - the desired motor output. In this scenario, details of the internal dynamics and the trial-by-trial learning mechanism cannot be disentangled from behavioral noise for nonlinear systems or even well estimated for linear systems with many parameters. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel approach: the sporadic application of systematic target perturbations that span the behavioral space and allow us to estimate the linearized dynamics in the vicinity of the fixed point. The steady-state Lyapunov equation then allows us to identify the noise covariance. We illustrate the method by analyzing sequence-generating neural networks with either intrinsic or extrinsic noise, at time resolutions that span from spike timing to spiking rates. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in experimentally plausible and realizable settings and show that this method can fully characterize the linearized between-trials learning dynamics as well as extract meaningful internal properties of the unknown mechanism that drives the motor output within each trial. We then illustrate how the approach can be extended to nonlinear learning dynamics through a flexible choice of the basis and magnitude of perturbations.\n\nSignificance statementMovement control ties brain activity to measurable external actions in real time, providing a useful tool for both neuroscientists interested in the emergence of stable behavior and biomedical engineers interested in the design of neural prosthesis and brain-machine interfaces. We approach the question of motor skill learning by introducing artificial errors through a novel perturbative scheme amenable to analytic examination in the linearized regime close to the desired behavior. Numerical simulations then demonstrate how to probe the learning dynamics in both linear and nonlinear systems. These findings stress the usefulness of analyzing responses to deliberately induced errors and the importance of properly designing such perturbation experiments. Our approach provides a novel generic tool for monitoring the acquisition of motor skills.",

    "abstract": "From an animal production and health perspective, our understanding of the metabolites in ruminant biofluids, particularly rumen fluid across different host species is poorly understood. Metabolomics is a powerful and sensitive approach for investigating low molecular weight metabolite profiles present in rumen biofluids. It can be used to identify potential roles of metabolites in the rumen microbiome and provide and understanding of host-level regulatory mechanisms associated with animal production. The rumen is a strictly anaerobic environment enriched with a complex community of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea and bacteriophages. Here, we present a metabolomic dataset generated using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and semi-polar (C18) chromatography methods coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), collected in both positive and negative ionization modes, of ovine rumen samples that were fractionated based on molecular weight (20 kDa, 8-10 kDa and 100 Da). This study highlights the potential of HILIC and C18 chromatography combined with non-targeted mass spectrometric methods to detect the polar and semi-polar metabolite species of the ruminal fluid metabolome.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus ST239 has been one of the most successful epidemic MRSA strains, and one of the leading causes of healthcare-associated MRSA infections. Here we investigate the evolution of ST239 using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. ST239 is thought to have emerged by a large scale chromosomal replacement event in which an ST8 clone acquired approximately 600 kb of DNA from an ST30 clone. Analysis of large-scale genomic data sets allowed us to confirm and refine the model of the origin of ST239. Importantly, we found that ST239 originated between the 1920s and 1945, implying that this MRSA lineage evolved at least 14 years before the clinical introduction of methicillin. Molecular evolution within ST239 has been dominated by purifying selection, although we found some evidence that the acquired region of the genome has evolved rapidly as a result of relaxed selective constraints. Crucially, we found that ST239 isolates have low competitive ability relative to both ST30 and ST8, demonstrating that this hybrid lineage is characterized by low fitness. We also found evidence of positive selection in a small number of genes involved in antibiotic resistance and virulence, suggesting that ST239 has evolved towards an increasingly pathogenic lifestyle. Collectively, these results support the view that low fitness has driven the recent decline of ST239, and highlight the challenge of using evolutionary approaches to understand the dynamics of pathogenic bacteria.",

However, the identity of the neurons that undergo change, the nature of the changes, and the consequences of these changes for other visual behaviors remain unclear. Using chronic in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to monitor the responses of neurons in V1 of tree shrews learning a Go/No-Go fine orientation discrimination task, we find increases in neural population measures of discriminability for task-relevant stimuli that correlate with performance and depend on a select subset of neurons with preferred orientations that include the rewarded stimulus and nearby orientations biased away from the non-rewarded stimulus. Learning is accompanied by selective enhancement in the response of these neurons to the rewarded stimulus that further increases their ability to discriminate the task stimuli. These changes persist outside of the trained task and predict observed enhancement and impairment in performance of other discriminations, providing evidence for selective persistent learning-induced plasticity in V1 with significant consequences for perception.",

    "abstract": "Parieto-occipital alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) underlie cortical excitability and influence visual performance. Whether the synchrony of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the occipital cortex can be entrained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an open question. We applied 4-pulse, 10-Hz rhythmic TMS to entrain intrinsic alpha oscillators targeting right V1/V2, and tested four predictions with concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG): (1) progressive enhancement of entrainment across time windows, (2) output frequency specificity, (3) dependence on the intrinsic oscillation phase, and (4) input frequency specificity to individual alpha frequency (IAF) in the neural signatures. Two control conditions with an equal number of pulses and duration were arrhythmic-active and rhythmic-sham stimulation. The results confirmed the first three predictions. Rhythmic TMS bursts significantly entrained local neural activity. Near the stimulation site, evoked oscillation amplitude and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) were increased for 2 and 3 cycles, respectively, after the last TMS pulse. Critically, ITPC following entrainment positively correlated with IAF rather than with the degree of similarity between IAF and the input frequency (10 Hz). Thus, we entrained alpha-band activity in occipital cortex for ~3 cycles (~300 ms), and IAF predicts the strength of entrained occipital alpha phase synchrony indexed by ITPC.",

    "abstract": "Skin inflammation is an evolutionary-honed protective mechanism that serves to clear noxious cues and irritants and initiate regeneration. Calcium-permeable transient-receptor-potential (TRP) ion channels have critical functions in sensory transduction which is sensitized in skin inflammation. Skin sensory transduction relies on skin-innervating sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), but also on innervated keratinocytes (KC). The multimodally-activated TRPV4 is robustly expressed in KC, where it can readily be activated by Ultraviolet-B (UVB). Our goal was to deconstruct keratinocyte TRPV4-mediated signaling, specifically how TRPV4 can facilitate inflammatory injury, thus lowering pain thresholds and rendering KC into pain-generator cells. We wanted to uncover the effect of TRPV4-mediated signaling on UVB-induced inflammasome activation in KC given the powerful impact of the activated inflammasome on pro-inflammatory/pro-algesic secretory signaling, using mouse models and cultured human KC. In mice, our evidence suggests that TRPV4 functions as calcium-permeable channel upstream of the KC inflammasome. Furthermore, we found that UVB induced activation of TRPV4 caused rapid - within minutes - Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, caspase-1 activation and Interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) secretion. In human primary KC we demonstrated that UVB induced secretion of IL-1{beta} was dependent on the NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome. Direct chemical TRPV4 activation could also activate NLRP1 and to lesser extent NLPR3. Building on our previous work, we now define at increased resolution TPRV4-dependent forefront signaling mechanisms in KC in response to UVB, showing TRPV4 upstream of the NLRP1 inflammasome, subsequent rapid ERK activation and pro-inflammatory/pro-algesic secretory function.",

    "abstract": "Enhancer demethylation in leukemia and lymphoma was shown to lead to overexpression of genes which promote cancer characteristics. The vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) enhancer, located 157 Kb downstream of its promoter, is demethylated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). VEGFA has several alternative splicing isoforms with different roles in vascularization and cancer progression. Since transcription and splicing are coupled in space and time, we hypothesized that the VEGFA enhancer can also regulate the genes alternative splicing to contribute to the pathology of CML. Our results show that mutating the VEGFA +157 enhancer promotes exclusion of exons 6b and 7 and activating the enhancer by tethering a chromatin activator has the opposite effect. In line with these results, CML patients display high enhancer activity and inclusion of VEGFA exons 6b and 7. To search for a key protein connecting transcription with alternative splicing, we analyzed 161 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq experiments for DNA binding proteins and found that PML and CCNT2 bind VEGFAs promoter and enhancer. CCNT2 is a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription elongation and indeed its silencing promotes exclusion of exons 6b and 7. Slowing down RNAPII elongation promotes exclusion of exons 6b and 7. Thus our results suggest that VEGFAs +157 enhancer regulates its alternative splicing by increasing RNAPII elongation rate via CCNT2. Our work demonstrates the importance of the interplay between transcription and alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is a key element for prokaryotes in the oceans and often limits phytoplankton primary production. An untested option to reduce prokaryotic N-demand under N-limitation is to reduce gene length. Here we show that in the sunlit Atlantic Ocean genes of the prokaryotic microbial communities in the permanently stratified N-limited (sub)tropics are up to 20% shorter than in N-replete regions further south and north. Average gene length (AGL) of major pelagic prokaryotic genera and two virus families correlated positively with nitrate concentrations. Further, the genomic G+C content of 60% of the taxa was lower and the gene repertoire to acquire inorganic and organic N-species higher in N-limited than in N-replete regions. A comparison of the N-demand by reducing gene length or G+C content showed that the former is much more efficient to save N. Our findings introduce a novel and most effective mode of evolutionary adaptation of prokaryotes to save resources including N and energy. They further show an enhanced diversification of genes acquiring N-species and -compounds in N-deplete relative to N-replete regions and thus add important information for a better understanding of the evolutionary adaptation of prokaryotes to N-availability in oceanic systems.",

    "abstract": "The reactivity of the S3 and S2 states towards NO and NH2OH was studied and compared using the period-4 oscillations in the F0-value induced by a train of single turnover Xenon flashes spaced 100 ms apart to monitor the reaction kinetics. The flash frequency also determined the time resolution of the assay, i.e. 100 ms. The S2 and S3-states were created by one and two single turnover pre-flashes, respectively. The NO-concentration-dependence of the S3-decay indicated that at low NO-concentrations an S2-state was formed as an intermediate, whereas at higher concentrations a seemingly monophasic decay to the S1-state was observed. The sigmoidal concentration dependence indicated that a fast interaction of the S3-state with (at least) two NO-molecules is necessary for the fast S3 to S1 decay ({tau} ~0.4 s at 1.2 mM NO). The pH-dependence of the S3-decay suggests that a protonation-reaction (pK ~6.9) is involved in the S3 to S1 decay. At intermediate NO-concentrations the protonation is only partially rate limiting, since the pH effect is more pronounced at high compared to intermediate NO-concentrations. A comparison of the reactivity of NO and hydroxylamine suggests that hydroxylamine reacts more efficiently with the S1 and S2 states, whereas NO reacts more efficiently with the S3-state. Based on our present knowledge of the oxygen evolving complex a possible reaction mechanism is proposed for the interaction between NO and the S3 state.",
