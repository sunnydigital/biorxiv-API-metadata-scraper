    "abstract": "Healthy plants are colonized by microorganisms from the surrounding environment, which form stable communities and provide beneficial services to the host. Culture-independent profiling of the bacterial root microbiota shows that different plant species are colonized by distinct bacterial communities, even if they share the same habitat. It is, however, not known to what extent the host actively selects these communities and whether commensal bacteria are adapted to a specific plant species. Here, we report a sequence-indexed culture collection from roots and nodules of the model legume Lotus japonicus that contains representatives from the majority of species found in culture-independent profiles. Using taxonomically paired synthetic communities from L. japonicus and the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana in a multi-species gnotobiotic system, we detect clear signatures of host preference among commensal bacteria in a community context, but not in mono-associations. Sequential inoculation of either host reveals strong priority effects during the assembly of the root microbiota, where established communities are resilient to invasion by late-comers. However, we found that host preference by commensal bacteria confers a competitive advantage in their native host. We reveal that host preference is prevalent in commensal bacteria from diverse taxonomic groups and that this trait is directly linked to their invasiveness into standing root-associated communities.",

    "abstract": "Photoperiod strictly controlled vegetative and reproductive growth stages in soybean. A soybean GmRAV transcription factor containing both AP2 and B3 domains was shown to be a key component of this process. We identified six polymorphisms in GmRAV promoter that showed significant association with flowering time and maturity of soybean in one or multiple environments. Soybean varieties with minor polymorphism exhibited longer growth period contributing to soybean adaptation to lower latitudes. The cis-acting element GT1CONSENSUS motif of GmRAV promoter controlled the growth period and shortened R5-R7 by reducing the expression level of GmRAV in soybean. Three GmRAV-overexpressing (GmRAV-ox) transgenic lines displayed later flowering time and maturity, shorter height and fewer numbers of leaves compared with control plants, and transgenic inhibition of GmRAV (GmRAV-i) soybean displayed earlier flowering time and maturity, and increased plant heights. 163 GmRAV-target genes were determined to be putatively directly bound and transcriptionally regulated by GmRAV by combining the results from the DAP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. Two GmRAV binding motifs [C(A/G/T)A(C)ACAA(G/T)A(C/T)A(G/T)] and [C(T/A)A(C/T) C(T/G)CTG] were identified. GmRAV acting downstream of E3E4 delayed soybean growth period by repressing GmFT5a transcriptional activity to guaranteed both vegetative and reproductive phase long enough to allow necessary energy reserved to be accumulated.",

    "abstract": "Coprinopsis cinerea lectin 2 (CCL2) is a fucoside-binding lectin from the basidiomycete C. cinerea that is toxic to the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as well as animal-parasitic and fungivorous nematodes. We expressed CCL2 in Arabidopsis to assess its protective potential towards plant-parasitic nematodes. Our results demonstrate that expression of CCL2 enhances host resistance against the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. Surprisingly, CCL2-expressing plants were also more resistant to fungal pathogens including Botrytis cinerea, and the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. In addition, CCL2 expression positively affected plant growth indicating that CCL2 has the potential to improve two important agricultural parameters namely biomass production and general disease resistance. The mechanism of the CCL2-mediated enhancement of plant disease resistance depended on fucoside-binding by CCL2 as transgenic plants expressing a mutant version of CCL2 (Y92A), compromised in fucoside-binding, exhibited wild type disease susceptibility. The protective effect of CCL2 did not seem to be direct as the lectin showed no growth-inhibition towards B. cinerea in in vitro assays. We detected, however, a significantly enhanced transcriptional induction of plant defense genes in CCL2- but not CCL2-Y92A-expressing lines in response to infection with B. cinerea compared to wild type plants. This study demonstrates a potential of fungal defense lectins in plant protection beyond their use as toxins.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression programmes controlled by lineage-determining transcription factors are often conserved between species. However, infectious diseases have exerted profound evolutionary pressure, and therefore the genes regulated by immune-specific transcription factors might be expected to exhibit greater divergence due to exposure to species-specific pathogens. T-bet (Tbx21) is the immune-specific lineage-defining transcription factor for T helper type I (Th1) immunity, which is fundamental for the immune response to intracellular pathogens but also underlies inflammatory diseases. We therefore compared T-bet genomic targets between mouse and human CD4+ T cells and correlated T-bet binding patterns with species-specific gene expression. Remarkably, we show that the vast majority of T-bet regulated genes are conserved between mouse and human, either via preservation of a binding site or via an alternative binding site associated with transposon-linked insertion. We also identified genes that are specifically targeted by T-bet in humans or mice and which exhibited species-specific expression. These results provide a genome-wide cross-species comparison of T-bet target gene regulation that will enable more accurate translation of genetic targets and therapeutics from pre-clinical models of inflammatory disease into human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The atrophic form of age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD) affects nearly 200 million people worldwide. There is no FDA-approved therapy for this disease, which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among people over 50 years of age. Vision loss in dry AMD results from degeneration of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). RPE cell death is driven in part by accumulation of Alu RNAs, which are noncoding transcripts of a human retrotransposon. Alu RNA induces RPE degeneration by activating the NLRP3-ASC inflammasome. We report that fluoxetine, an FDA-approved drug for treating clinical depression, binds NLRP3 in silico, in vitro, and in vivo, and that it inhibits activation of the NLRP3-ASC inflammasome in RPE cells and macrophages, two critical cell types in dry AMD. We also demonstrate that fluoxetine, unlike several other anti-depressant drugs, reduces Alu RNA-induced RPE degeneration in mice. Finally, by analyzing two health insurance databases comprising more than 100 million Americans, we report a reduced hazard of developing dry AMD among patients with depression who were treated with fluoxetine. Collectively, these studies triangulate to link fluoxetine as a potential drug repurposing candidate for a major unmet medical need that causes blindness in millions of people in the United States and across the world.\n\nSignificance StatementDry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects the vision of millions of people worldwide. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment for dry AMD. The inflammasome components NLRP3 and ASC have been implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. We report that fluoxetine, which is approved for the treatment of clinical depression, directly binds the NLRP3 protein and prevents the assembly and activation of the NLRP3-ASC inflammasome. As a result, it also blocks the degeneration of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells in an animal model of dry AMD. Furthermore, we demonstrate through an analysis of health insurance databases that use of this FDA-approved anti-depressant drug is associated with reduced incidence of dry AMD. These studies identify that fluoxetine is a potential repurposing candidate for AMD, a prevalent cause of blindness.",

    "abstract": "Transcription termination is one of the least understood processes of gene expression. As the prototype model for transcription studies, the single-subunit T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) was known to response to two types of termination signals, while the mechanism underlying such termination especially the specific elements of the polymerase involved in is still unclear, due to the lack of a termination complex structure. Here we applied phage-assisted continuous evolution to obtain variants of T7 RNAP that can bypass the typical class I T7 terminator with stem-loop structure. Through in vivo selection and in vitro characterization, we discovered a single mutation S43Y that significantly decreased the termination efficiency of T7 RNAP at all transcription terminators tested. Coincidently, the S43Y mutation almost eliminates the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of T7 RNAP without affecting the major DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRp) activity of the enzyme, indicating the relationship between transcription termination and RdRp activity, and suggesting a model in which the stem-loop terminator induces the RdRp activity which competes with the ongoing DdRp activity to cause transcription termination. The T7 RNAP S43Y mutant as an enzymatic reagent for in vitro transcription reduces the undesired termination in run-off RNA synthesis and produces RNA with higher terminal homogeneity.",

We sought to estimate forested headwater stream metabolism across two dominant flow regimes (Runoff and Groundwater) in northern Arkansas and evaluate potential differences in, and drivers of, gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem metabolism. Flow regimes differed in intermittency, substrate heterogeneity, hyporheic connectivity, and dominant water source (subsurface runoff vs. groundwater), which we expected to result in differences in primary production and respiration. Average daily gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) estimated from field data collected from May 2015-June 2016 tended to be greater in Groundwater streams. Respiration was positively related to discharge (R2= 0.98 p< 0.0001) and net metabolism became more heterotrophic with increasing average annual discharge across sites (R2= 0.94, p= 0.0008). Characterizing ecosystem-level responses to differences in flow can reveal mechanisms governing stream metabolism and, in turn, provide information regarding trophic state and energy inputs as efforts continue to determine global trends in aquatic carbon sources and fates.",

    "abstract": "Non-human primates respond to the death of a conspecific in diverse ways, some which may present phylogenetic continuity with human thanatological behaviours. Of these responses, infant corpse carrying by mothers (ICC) is the most-frequently reported. Despite its prevalence, quantitative analyses of this behaviour are scarce and inconclusive. We compiled a database of 409 published cases across 50 different primate species of mothers responses to their infants deaths to test hypotheses proposed to explain between- and within-species variation in corpse carrying. Using Bayesian phylogenetic regressions, we preliminarily identified three factors as possible predictors of ICC occurrence. However, using an information-theoretic approach, no combination of these predictors performed better than the null model, offering no support for any of the hypotheses we tested. In contrast, for those cases where infants corpses were carried, infant age affected ICC duration, with longer ICC observed for younger infants. This result may provide support for hypotheses that suggest that ICC is a by-product of a strong mother-infant bond. The results are discussed in the context of the evolution of emotion and their implications for evolutionary thanatology are considered.",

    "abstract": "Ureterorenoscopy (URS) is believed to be a safe and effective procedure to treat ureteral stone or ureteral stricture. Rapidly increased intrarenal pressure during URS may have a negative impact on the kidney, but the effect on renal functions is not well known. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether URS balloon dilation or lithotripsy would cause acute kidney injury (AKI), which was evaluated by urine neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) and renal tubular damage, which was evaluated by urine  glutathione S-transferase (GST) and {pi}GST. This prospective study consisted of 207 patients with mean age 53.8 years old between September 2012 and June 2013. Four groups were included: the ureteral stricture group (group 1), the ureteral stone group (group 2), and two control groups. URS induced increased uNGAL on both Days 1 and 14 in both groups, and only elevated u-{pi}GST levels were noted on Day 14 after URSL. On Day 14, the difference between low-grade and high-grade hydronephrosis was significant in group 1 (p < 0.001) rather than group 2 (p = 0.150). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, baseline eGFR, and stone size > 1.0 cm were associated with complete recovery of hydronephrosis after URS on Day 14. Ureteral stone patients with preserved renal function suffered more AKI (uNGAL) than those with impaired renal function. However, URS-related AKI had no significant difference between stone [&le;] 1 cm and > 1 cm subgroups. Besides, urine GST and {pi}GST were both significantly higher in stone > 1 cm subgroup when compared to [&le;] 1 cm subgroup. In conclusion, URS laser lithotripsy and balloon dilatation all resulted in AKI and renal tubular damage on Day 14 though post-URS double-J (DBJ) stenting was performed in every patient.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is considered an interface between motivation and action, with NAc neurons playing an important role in promoting reward approach. However, the encoding by NAc neurons that contribute to this role remains unknown. Here, we trained male rats to find rewards in an 8-arm radial maze. The activity of 62 neurons, mostly in the shell of the NAc, were recorded while rats ran towards each reward place. General linear model (GLM) analysis showed that variables related to the vigor of the locomotor approach, like speed and acceleration, and the fraction of the approach run completed were the best predictors of the firing rate for most NAc neurons. Nearly 23% of the recorded neurons, here named locomotion-off cells, were inhibited during the entire approach run, suggesting that reduction in firing of these neurons promotes initiation of locomotor approach. Another 24% of the neurons presented a peak of activity during acceleration followed by a valley during deceleration (peak-valley cells). Together, these neurons accounted for most of the speed and acceleration encoding identified in the GLM analysis. Cross-correlations between firing and speed indicated that the spikes of peak-valley cells were followed by increases in speed, suggesting that the activity of these neurons drives acceleration. In contrast, a further 19% of neurons presented a valley during acceleration followed by a peak just prior to or after reaching reward (valley-peak cells). These findings suggest that these three classes of NAc neurons control the initiation and vigor of the locomotor approach to reward.\n\nSignificance StatementDeciphering the mechanisms by which the NAc controls the vigor of motivated behavior is critical to better understand and treat psychiatric conditions in which motivation is dysregulated. Manipulations of the NAc profoundly impair subjects ability to spontaneously approach reward-associated locations, preventing them from exerting effort to obtain reward. Here, we identify for the first time specific activity of NAc neurons in relation to spontaneous approach behavior. We discover three classes of neurons that could control initiation of movement and the speed vs. time trajectory during locomotor approach. These results suggest a prominent but heretofore unknown role for the NAc in regulating the kinematics of reward approach locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Long-term synaptic plasticity is believed to be the cellular substrate of learning and memory. Synaptic plasticity rules are defined by the specific complement of receptors at the synapse and the associated downstream signaling mechanisms. In young rodents, at the cerebellar synapse between granule cells (GC) and Purkinje cells (PC), bidirectional plasticity is shaped by the balance between transcellular nitric oxide (NO) driven by presynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation and postsynaptic calcium dynamics. However, the role and the location of NMDAR activation in these pathways is still debated in mature animals. Here, we show in adult rodents that NMDARs are present and functional in presynaptic terminals where their activation triggers nitric oxide signaling. In addition, we find that selective genetic deletion of presynaptic, but not postsynaptic, NMDARs prevents synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapses. Consistent with this finding, the selective deletion of GCs NMDARs affects adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Thus, NMDARs presynaptic to PCs are required for bidirectional synaptic plasticity and cerebellar motor learning.\n\nSignificance StatementLearning depends on synaptic plasticity. The signaling mechanisms that control induction of plasticity determine the learning rules at the specific synapse involved. Moreover, the relationship between the activity patterns of synaptic inputs and the type, direction, and level of plasticity induced may evolve during development. Here, we establish a key link between NMDA receptor activation presynaptic to cerebellar Purkinje cells, downstream signaling mechanisms, and the ability of adult animals to learn a cerebellar motor task.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies suggest that intranasal oxytocin (IN-OXT) may modulate emotional and social processes by altering neural activity patterns. The extent of brain penetration after IN-OXT is unclear, and it is currently under debate whether IN-OXT can directly bind central oxytocin receptors (OXTRs). We investigated oxytocin pathway gene expression in regions affected by IN-OXT on task-based fMRI. We found that OXTR is more highly expressed in affected than unaffected subcortical regions; this effect did not vary by task-type or sex. Cortical results revealed higher OXTR expression in regions affected by IN-OXT in emotional processing tasks and in male-only data. No significant differences were found in expression of the closely related vasopressin receptors. Our findings suggest that the mechanism by which IN-OXT may alter brain functionality involves direct activation of central OXTRs.",

    "abstract": "Pathological repetitive behaviors are a common feature of different neuropsychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The Sapap3 knockout mouse (Sapap3-KO) is the current reference model used in translational psychiatry to study co-morbid repetitive behaviors, presenting both compulsive-like as well as tic-like behaviors. Consistent with clinical and fundamental research literature relating compulsive-like symptoms to associative cortico-striatal dysfunctions and tic-like symptoms to sensorimotor cortico-striatal dysfunctions, abnormalities comprising both circuits have been described in this mouse model. Findings reported on these mice point towards not only macro-, but also micro-circuitry deficits, both of which can be affected by neuronal structural changes. As such, in the present study, we aimed to investigate structural changes in associative and sensorimotor striatal areas that could affect information conduction. We used AxonDeepSeg, an open-source software to automatically segment and measure myelin thickness and axon caliber, and found that axon caliber, the main contributor for changes in conduction speed, is specifically reduced in the associative but not the sensorimotor striatum of the Sapap3-KO mouse. This smaller axon caliber in Sapap3-KO mice is not a general neuronal feature of this region, but specific to a subpopulation of axons with large caliber. These results point to a primary structural deficit in the associative striatum, affecting signal conduction and consequent connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Relaxometry is a quantitative MRI-based technique able to estimate tissue relaxation times T1 and T2. This approach allows increasing the MRI diagnostic accuracy mostly in case of brain neoplasia or neurodegenerative disorders in human medicine. However, few reports are available on the application of this technique in the clinical field of veterinary medicine. For this reason, in this work, we developed a relaxometry based approach on experimentally induced brain hemorrhages on rabbits. Specifically, the methodology is based on a hierarchical clustering procedure driven by the T1 relaxometry signals from a set of regions of interest selected on the T2 map. The approach is multivariate since it combines both T1 and T2 information and allows the diagnosis at the subject level by comparing \"suspected\" pathological regions with healthy homologous ones within the same brain.\n\nTo validate the proposed technique, the scanned brains underwent histopathological analyses to estimate the performance of the proposed classifier in terms of Receiver Operator Curve analyses. The results showed that, in terms of identification of the lesion and its contours, the proposed approach resulted accurate and outperformed the standard techniques based on T1w and T2w images. Finally, since the proposed protocol in terms of the adopted scanner, sequences, and analysis tools, is suitable for the clinical practice, it can be potentially validated through large-scale multi-center clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of human antibiotic-associated diarrhoeal disease globally. Zoonotic reservoirs of infection are increasingly suspected to play a role in the emergence of this disease in the community and dogs are considered as one potential source. Here we use a canine case-control study at a referral veterinary hospital in Scotland to assess: i) the risk factors associated with carriage of C. difficile by dogs, ii) whether carriage of C. difficile is associated with clinical disease in dogs and iii) the similarity of strains isolated from dogs with local human clinical surveillance. The overall prevalence of C. difficile carriage in dogs was 18.7% (95% CI 14.8-23.2%, n=61/327) of which 36% (n=22/61) were toxigenic strains. We found risk factors related to prior antibiotic treatment were significantly associated with C. difficile carriage by dogs. However, the presence of toxigenic strains of C. difficile in a canine faecal sample was not associated with diarrhoeal disease in dogs. Active toxin was infrequently detected in canine faecal samples carrying toxigenic strains (2/11 samples). Both dogs in which active toxin was detected had no clinical evidence of gastrointestinal disease. Among the ten toxigenic ribotypes of C. difficile detected in dogs in this study, six of these (012, 014, 020, 026, 078, 106) were ribotypes commonly associated with human clinical disease in Scotland, while atoxigenic isolates largely belonged to 010 and 039 ribotypes. Whilst C. difficile does not appear commonly associated with diarrhoeal disease in dogs, antibiotic treatment increases carriage of this bacteria including toxigenic strains commonly found in human clinical disease.",

    "abstract": "A field experiment was showed to decide the influence of phosphorus level and transplanting date on quality parameters of onion at Adami Tulu Jedo Kombolcha Woreda, during 2017/18 season. The treatments consisted of four phosphorus levels (0, 20, 40 and 60 kg P ha-1) and three transplanting date (42, 49 and 56 days). The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with four replications. The result showed that phosphorus level and transplanting date significantly influenced bulb dry matter content, marketable bulb yield, medium size bulb yield. Among these parameters, marketable bulb yield was also significantly influenced by the interaction of phosphorus level and transplanting date. On the other hand, small size bulb yield, large size bulb yield, over size bulb yield and under size bulb yield were only influenced by the effect of phosphorus levels. In this study, fertilized 60 kg P ha-1 with transplanting at 56 days of transplanting date recorded the highest marketable bulb yield, but no significant difference was showed with that obtained at 40 kg P ha-1 with the same transplanting date. Treatment combinations of no P (control) and transplanting date at 42 days produced the lowest amounts of marketable bulb yield. The economic analysis revealed that the highest net benefit with low cost of production was obtained in response to the application of 40 kg P ha-1 and the transplanting age of 56 days. The marginal rate of return for this treatment was 11983% which is found to be economically feasible for producing bulb in the districts.",

    "abstract": "Adrenergic stimulation of brown adipocytes alters mitochondrial dynamics, including proteolytic processing of the mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). However, direct mechanisms linking OPA1 to brown adipose tissue (BAT) physiology are incompletely understood. By deleting OPA1 selectively in BAT (OPA1 BAT KO), we demonstrate that OPA1 is required for cold-induced thermogenesis. Unexpectedly, OPA1 deficiency induced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a BATokine in an activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)- dependent manner. BAT-derived FGF21 mediates an adaptive response in OPA1 BAT KO mice, by inducing browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), increasing resting metabolic rates, and improving thermoregulation. However, FGF21 does not mediate the resistance to diet-induced obesity observed in these animals. These findings reveal a requirement for OPA1 in BAT thermogenesis, and uncovers a homeostatic mechanism of BAT-mediated metabolic protection governed by an ATF4-FGF21 axis, that is activated independently of BAT thermogenic function.",

    "abstract": "Male moths are capable of orienting towards conspecific females using sex pheromones. Since pheromones are distributed as discontinuous plumes owing to air turbulence, tracking intermittent stimuli with high temporal resolution is suggested to be important for efficient localisation. Here, using a pheromone binding protein (BmPBP1) knockout silkmoth, we revealed that the loss of functional pheromone binding protein altered antennal response kinetics resulting in reduced temporal resolution to intermittent pheromone stimuli on the antennae. Behavioural analysis revealed that BmPBP1-knockout males exhibited significantly less straight walking, which occurs when detecting pheromone stimuli, especially to high frequency stimuli. Accordingly, BmPBP1-knockout males took a significantly longer time to locate pheromone sources and females than did wild-type males. Together, BmPBP1 plays a critical role in determining temporal antennal response kinetics and that an appropriate range of temporal sensory and behavioural resolutions is essential for tracking pheromone plumes for efficient pheromone source localisation in the silkmoth.",

    "abstract": "DPANN are small-celled archaea that are generally predicted to be symbionts, and in some cases are known episymbionts of other archaea. As the monophyly of the DPANN remains uncertain, we hypothesized that proteome content could reveal relationships among DPANN lineages, constrain genetic overlap with bacteria, and illustrate how organisms with hybrid bacterial and archaeal protein sets might function. We tested this hypothesis using protein family content that was defined in part using 569 newly reconstructed genomes. Protein family content clearly separates DPANN from other archaea, paralleling the separation of Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria from all other bacteria. This separation is partly driven by hypothetical proteins, some of which may be symbiosis-related. Pacearchaeota with the most limited predicted metabolic capacities have Form II/III and III-like Rubisco, suggesting metabolisms based on scavenged nucleotides. Intriguingly, the Pacearchaeota and Woesearchaeota with the smallest genomes also tend to encode large extracellular murein-like lytic transglycosylase domain proteins that may bind and degrade components of bacterial cell walls, indicating that some might be episymbionts of bacteria. The pathway for biosynthesis of bacterial isoprenoids is widespread in Woesearchaeota genomes and is encoded in proximity to genes involved in bacterial fatty acids synthesis. Surprisingly, in some DPANN genomes we identified a pathway for synthesis of queuosine, an unusual nucleotide in tRNAs of bacteria. Other bacterial systems are predicted to be involved in protein refolding. For example, many DPANN have the complete bacterial DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system and many Woesearchaeota and Pacearchaeota possess bacterial group I chaperones. Thus, many DPANN appear to have mechanisms to ensure efficient protein folding of both archaeal and laterally acquired bacterial proteins.",

Hypothesis testing models, which enables to compare phyllochron between genetic groups or conditions, are usually based on regression of thermal time on the number of leaves, most of the time assuming a constant leaf appearance rate. However these models are both statistically biased and inappropriate in terms of modelling. We propose a stochastic process model in which the emergence of new leaves is considered as successive time-to-events, which provides a flexible and more accurate modelling as well as unbiased testing procedures. The model was applied on an original maize dataset collected in fields for three years on plants originating from two divergent selection experiments for flowering time conducted in two maize inbred lines. We showed that the main differences in phyllochron were not observed between selection populations (Early or Late), but rather between ancestral lines, years of experimentation, and leaf ranks. Our results highlight a strong departure from the assumption of a constant leaf appearance rate in one year that could be related to climate variations, even if the impact of each climatic variables individually was not clearly elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Allelic diversity of HLA class II genes may help maintain humoral immunity against infectious diseases. We investigated the relative contribution of specific HLA class II alleles, haplotypes and genotypes on the variation of antibody responses to a variety of common pathogens in a cohort of 800 adults representing the general Arab population. We found that classical HLA class II gene heterozygosity confers a selective advantage. Moreover, we demonstrated that multiple HLA class II alleles play a synergistic role in shaping the antibody repertoire. Interestingly, associations of HLA-DRB1 genotypes with specific antigens were identified. Our findings suggest that HLA class II gene polymorphisms confer specific humoral immunity against common pathogens, which may have contributed to the genetic diversity of HLA class II loci during hominine evolution.",

    "abstract": "Food fraud in several value chains including meat, fish, and vegetables has gained global interest in recent years. In the meat value chain, substitution of high commercial-value meats with similar cheaper or undesirable species is a common form of food fraud that raises ethical, religious, and dietary concerns. The presence of undeclared species could also pose public health risks caused by allergic reactions and the transmission of food-borne or zoonotic pathogens. Measures to monitor meat substitution are being put in place in many developed countries. However, information about similar efforts in sub-Saharan Africa is sparse. In this study, we used PCR coupled with high-resolution melting (PCR-HRM) analysis targeting the three mitochondrial genes, cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1), cytochrome b (cyt b), and 16S rRNA, to detect species substitution in meat sold to consumers in Nairobi, Kenyas capital city. Out of 107 meat samples from seven common livestock animals (cattle, goat, sheep, pig, chicken, rabbit, and camel), 11 (10.3%) had been substituted. Of 61 samples sold as beef, two were goat and one was camel. Of 30 samples sold as goat meat, four were mutton (sheep) and three were beef. One of nine samples purchased as pork was beef. Our results indicate that PCR-HRM analysis is a cost and time effective technique that can be employed to detect species substitution. The combined use of the three markers produced PCR-HRM profiles that successfully allowed the distinction of species. We demonstrate its utility not only in analysis of raw meat samples, but also of cooked, dried, and rotten samples, meat mixtures, and with the use of different DNA extraction protocols. We propose that this approach has broad applications in authentication of meat products and protection of consumers from food fraud in the meat industry in low- and middle-income countries such as Kenya, as well as in the developed world.",

    "abstract": "It is now well appreciated that members of pathogenic bacterial populations exhibit heterogeneity in growth rates and metabolic activity, and it is known this can impact the ability to eliminate all members of the bacterial population during antibiotic treatment. It remains unclear which pathways promote slowed bacterial growth within host tissues, primarily because it has been difficult to identify and isolate slow growing bacteria from host tissues for downstream analyses. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a novel variant of TIMER, a slow-folding fluorescent protein, to identify subsets of slowly dividing bacteria within host tissues. The original TIMER folds too slowly for fluorescence accumulation in quickly replicating bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis), however this TIMER42 variant accumulates signal in late stationary phase cultures of E. coli and Y. pseudotuberculosis. We show TIMER42 signal also accumulates during exposure to sources of nitric oxide (NO), suggesting TIMER42 signal detects growth-arrested bacterial cells. In a mouse model of Y. pseudotuberculosis deep tissue infection, TIMER42 signal is clearly detected, and primarily accumulates in bacteria expressing markers of stationary phase growth. There was not significant overlap between TIMER42 signal and NO-exposed subpopulations of bacteria within host tissues, suggesting NO stress was transient, allowing bacteria to recover from this stress and resume replication. This novel TIMER42 variant represents a new faster folding TIMER that will enable additional studies of slow-growing subpopulations of bacteria, specifically within bacterial species that quickly divide.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe have generated a variant of TIMER that can be used to mark slow-growing subsets of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which has a relatively short division time, similar to E. coli. We used a combination of site-directed and random mutagenesis to generate the TIMER42 variant, which has red fluorescent signal accumulation in post-exponential or stationary phase cells. We found that nitric oxide (NO) stress is sufficient to promote TIMER42 signal accumulation in culture, however within host tissues, TIMER42 signal correlates with a stationary phase reporter (dps). These results suggest NO may cause an immediate arrest in bacterial cell division, but during growth in host tissues exposure to NO is transient, allowing bacteria to recover from this stress and resume cell division. Thus instead of indicating a response to host stressors, TIMER42 signal accumulation within host tissues appears to identify slow-growing cells that are experiencing nutrient limitation.",
