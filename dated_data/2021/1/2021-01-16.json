    "abstract": "Research on stomata, i.e., morphological structures of plants, has increased in popularity in the last years. These structures (pores) are in charge of the interaction between the internal plant system and the environment, working on different processes such as photosynthesis and transpiration stream. Besides, a better understanding of the pore mechanism plays a significant role when exploring the evolution process, as well as the behavior of plants. Although the study of stomata in dicots species of plants has advanced considerably in the past years, there is little information about stomata of cereal grasses. Also, automated detection of these structures have been considered in the literature, but some gaps are still uncovered. This fact is motivated by high morphological variation of stomata and the presence of noise from the image acquisition step. In this work, we propose a new methodology for automatic stomata classification and a new detection system in microscope images for maize cultivars. We have achieved an approximated accuracy of 97.1% in the identification of stomata regions using classifiers based on deep learning features, which figures out as a nearly perfect classification system.",

    "abstract": "Our organs and tissues are in constant motion, exposing epithelial cells to mechanical stretch. However, how these external forces impact cellular morphology, organization and dynamics in healthy and diseased tissues is still being elucidated. In several studies, we and others have shown how mechanical stresses and strains in the epithelium can modulate the dynamics and invasiveness of transformed cells. Carcinoma, the most common type of cancer, develops in the sheets of cells forming the epithelium and lining our organs and cavities. It usually begins with the transformation of a single cell via the activation of oncogenes such as Ras. Here, we show in a model system how mechanical stretch in epithelial sheets results in a more invasive phenotype in transformed cells.\n\nCyclic strain prevents the formation of strong circumferential belts of actin in RasV12 cells and greatly promoting the formation of RasV12 protrusions, typical of a more invasive phenotype. We also show that RasV12 and wild type MDCK cells possess distinct sensitivity to strain. External forces remodel their actin cytoskeletons and adhesion complexes differently, resulting in a more invasive system dynamic. Our work demonstrates that the Rho-ROCK mechanotransduction pathway is involved in regulating a mechanically-induced switch to a more invasive phenotype. In a mechanically dynamic microenvironment, transformed cells exhibit drastically different cellular dynamics and movements when compared to static conditions. They grow larger invasive protrusions, potentially making them harder to be eliminated from healthy tissues. The insights gained in this study reveal the complex dynamics at play in healthy and transformed epithelial cells which are found in a mechanically active microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial runoff can negatively impact marine ecosystems through stressors including excess nutrients, freshwater, sediments, and contaminants. Severe storms, which are increasing with global climate change, generate massive inputs of runoff over short timescales (hours to days); such runoff impacted offshore reefs in the northwest Gulf of Mexico (NW GoM) following severe storms in 2016 and 2017. Several weeks after coastal flooding from these events, NW GoM reef corals, sponges, and other benthic invertebrates -185 km offshore experienced mortality (2016 only) and/or sub-lethal stress (both years). To assess the impact of storm-derived runoff on reef filter feeders, we characterized the bacterial communities of two sponges, Agelas clathrodes and Xestospongia muta, from offshore reefs during periods of sub-lethal stress and no stress over a three-year period (2016-2018). Sponge-associated bacterial communities were altered during both flood years. Additionally, we found evidence of wastewater contamination (based on 16S rRNA gene libraries and quantitative PCR) in offshore sponges following these flood years, but not during the no-flood year. We show that flood events from severe storms have the capacity to reach offshore reef ecosystems and impact resident benthic organisms. Such impacts are most readily detected if baseline data on organismal physiology and associated microbiome composition are available. This highlights the need for molecular and microbial time series of benthic organisms in near- and offshore reef ecosystems, and the continued mitigation of stormwater runoff and climate change impacts.",

    "abstract": "Observation of object lifting allows updating of internal object representations for object weight, in turn enabling accurate scaling of fingertip forces when lifting the same object. Here, we investigated whether lift observation also enables updating of internal representations for an objects weight distribution. We asked participants to lift an inverted T-shaped manipulandum, of which the weight distribution could be changed, in turns with an actor. Participants were required to minimize object roll (i.e.,  lift performance) during lifting and were allowed to place their fingertips at self-chosen locations. The center of mass changed unpredictably every third to sixth trial performed by the actor and participants were informed that they would always lift the same weight distribution as the actor. Participants observed either erroneous (i.e., object rolling towards its heavy side) or skilled (i.e., minimized object roll) lifts. Lifting performance after observation was compared to lifts without prior observation and to lifts after active lifting, which provided haptic feedback about the weight distribution. Our results show that observing both skilled and erroneous lifts convey an objects weight distribution similar to active lifting, resulting in altered digit positioning strategies. However, minimizing object roll on novel weight distributions was only improved after observing error lifts and not after observing skilled lifts. In sum, these findings suggest that although observing motor errors and skilled motor performance enables updating of digit positioning strategy, only observing error lifts enables changes in predictive motor control when lifting objects with unexpected weight distributions.\n\nNew and noteworthyIndividuals are able to extract an objects size and weight by observing interactions with objects and subsequently integrate this information in their own motor repertoire. Here, we show that this ability extrapolates to weight distributions. Specifically, we highlighted that individuals can perceive an objects weight distribution during lift observation but can only partially embody this information when planning their own actions.",

    "abstract": "Plant long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of chromatin dynamics, impacting on transcriptional programs leading to different developmental outputs. The lncRNA AUXIN REGULATED PROMOTER LOOP (APOLO) directly recognizes multiple independent loci across the Arabidopsis genome and modulates their three-dimensional chromatin conformation, leading to transcriptional shifts. Here, we show that APOLO recognizes the locus encoding the root hair (RH) master regulator ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6) and controls RHD6 transcriptional activity leading to cold-enhanced RH elongation through the consequent activation of the transcription factor gene RHD6-like RSL4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that APOLO interacts with the transcription factor WRKY42 and modulates its binding to the RHD6 promoter. WRKY42 is required for the activation of RHD6 by low temperatures and WRKY42 deregulation impairs cold-induced RH expansion. Collectively, our results indicate that a novel ribonucleoprotein complex involving APOLO and WRKY42 forms a regulatory hub which activates RHD6 by shaping its epigenetic environment and integrates signals governing RH growth and development.\n\nSUMMARYThe lncRNA APOLO directly regulates the transcription of the root hair-master gene RHD6. In response to cold, APOLO is induced and it decoys the H3K27me3-binding protein LHP1 away from RHD6. In addition, APOLO modulates the binding of the transcription factor WRKY42 to the RHD6 promoter at low temperatures.",

In situ, CAR T cell exhibited a heterogenous effector gene expression and this was related to the distance from tumor cells, allowing a quantitative assessment of the potential in vivo effectiveness.

Cell staining and proximity-based methods have limited selectivity and/or sensitivity for endogenous multimeric protein-complex quantification from single cells. We introduce micro-arrayed, differential detergent fractionation to simultaneously detect protein complexes in 100s of individual cells. Fractionation occurs by 60 s size-exclusion electrophoresis with protein complex-stabilizing buffer that minimizes depolymerization. Co-detection of cytoskeletal protein complexes in U2OS cells treated with filamentous actin (F-actin) destabilizing LatA detects a subpopulation (~11%) exhibiting downregulated F-actin, but upregulated microtubule and intermediate filament protein complexes. Thus, some cells upregulate other cytoskeletal complexes to counteract the stress of LatA treatment. We also sought to understand the effect of non-chemical stress on cellular heterogeneity of F-actin. We find heat shock dysregulates F- and G-actin correlation. The assay overcomes selectivity limitations to biochemically quantify single-cell protein complexes perturbed with diverse stimuli.",

Motivated by promising results in prostate cancer there is growing interest in extending this approach to other cancers. Here we present a theoretical study of intra-tumoral competition during adaptive therapy, to identify under which circumstances it will be superior to aggressive treatment; (2) Methods: We use a 2-D, on-lattice, agent-based tumour model to examine the impact of different microenvironmental factors on the comparison between continuous drug administration and adaptive therapy. (3) Results: We show that the degree of crowding, the initial resistance fraction, the presence of resistance costs, and the rate of tumour cell turnover are key determinants of the benefit of adaptive therapy, and we study in detail how these factors alter competition between cells. We find that intra-specific competition between resistant cells plays an unexpectedly important role in the ability to control resistance. To conclude we show how differences in resistance cost and turnover change the tumours spatial organisation and may explain differences in cycling speed observed in a cohort of 67 prostate cancer patients undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy; (4) Conclusion: Our work provides insights into how adaptive therapy leverages inter- and intra-specific competition to control resistance, and shows that the tumours spatial architecture will likely be an important factor in determining the quantitative benefit of adaptive therapy in patients.",

    "abstract": "The Scar/WAVE complex is the major driver of actin nucleation at the plasma membrane, resulting in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles. While lamellipodia aid migration, membrane ruffles can generate macropinosomes - cup-like structures - important for nutrient uptake and regulation of cell surface receptor levels. How macropinosomes are formed and the role of the actin machinery in their formation and resolution is still not well understood. Mammalian CYRI-B is a recently described negative regulator of the Scar/WAVE complex by RAC1 sequestration, but its other paralogue, CYRI-A has not been characterised. Here we implicate CYRI-A as a key regulator of macropinosome maturation and integrin internalisation from the cell surface. We find that CYRI-A is recruited to nascent macropinosomes in a transient but distinct burst, downstream of PIP3-mediated RAC1 activation and the initial burst of actin assembly driving cup formation, but upstream of internalisation and RAB5 recruitment to the macropinosome. Together, our data place CYRI-A as a local suppressor of actin dynamics, enabling the resolution of the macropinocytic cup. The failure of CYRI-depleted cells to resolve their macropinocytic cups results in reduced integrin a5b1 internalisation, leading to enhanced spreading, invasive behaviour and anchorage-independent 3D growth. We thus describe a new role for CYRI-A as a highly dynamic regulator of RAC1 activity at macropinosomes, modulating homeostasis of integrin surface presentation, with important functional consequences.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has created an environment where heat stress conditions are becoming more frequent as temperatures continue to rise in crop production areas around the world. This situation leads to decreased crop production due to plant sensitivity to heat stress. Reproductive success is critically dependent on plants ability to produce functional pollen grains, which are the most thermo-sensitive tissue. Flavonols are plant secondary metabolites known for their potent antioxidative activity, essential for male fertility in several species including tomato, and implicated in heat stress tolerance. Since flavonols are highly abundant in fruits of the tomato high pigment-2 (hp2) mutant, we tested the level of flavonols in pollen of this mutant, under the hypothesis that increased accumulation of flavonols would render pollen more tolerant to heat stress. Indeed, pollen from three alleles of the hp2 mutant were found to have flavonols levels increased by 40% on average compared with wild-type under moderate chronic heat stress conditions. This mutant produced on average 7.8-fold higher levels of viable pollen and displayed better germination competence under heat stress conditions. The percentage of fully seeded fruits and the number of seeds per fruit were maintained in the mutant under heat stress conditions while decreased in wild-type plants. Our results strongly suggest that increased pollen flavonols content enhances pollen thermotolerance and reproductive success under heat stress conditions. Thus, the high flavonols trait may help frame the model for improving crop resilience to heat stress.",

    "abstract": "The steady-state localisation of proteins provides vital insight into their function. These localisations are context specific with proteins translocating between different sub-cellular niches upon perturbation of the subcellular environment. Differential localisation, that is a change in the steady-state subcellular location of a protein, provides a step towards mechanistic insight of subcellular protein dynamics. Aberrant localisation has been implicated in a number of pathologies, thus differential localisation may help characterise disease states and facilitate rational drug discovery by suggesting novel targets. High-accuracy high-throughput mass spectrometry-based methods now exist to map the steady-state localisation and re-localisation of proteins. Here, we propose a principled Bayesian approach, BANDLE, that uses these data to compute the probability that a protein differentially localises upon cellular perturbation, as well quantifying the uncertainty in these estimates. Furthermore, BANDLE allows information to be shared across spatial proteomics datasets to improve statistical power. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that BANDLE reduces the number of both type I and type II errors compared to existing approaches. Application of BANDLE to datasets studying EGF stimulation and AP-4 dependent localisation recovers well studied translocations, using only two-thirds of the provided data. Moreover, we potentially implicate TMEM199 with AP-4 dependent localisation. In an application to cytomegalovirus infection, we obtain novel insights into the rewiring of the host proteome. Integration of high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic data, along with degradation assays, acetylation experiments and a cytomegalovirus intcractome allows us to provide the functional context of these data.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is mutated or amplified in a majority of glioblastoma (GBM), and its mutation and focal amplification correlate with a more aggressive disease course. However, EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) tested to date have yielded minimal clinical benefit. Here, we report a novel covalent-binding EGFR-TKI, CM93, as a potential drug to target adult GBMs with aberrant EGFR. CM93 has extraordinary brain exposure, with a brain-to-plasma ratio greater than 20-fold at estimated steady state. While all approved EGFR-TKIs are subject to extensive efflux transporter activity, CM93 does not inhibit the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) efflux transporters in Caco-2 cells at expected clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Equally, CM93 demonstrates moderate absorption and permeation in Caco-2 cell monolayers with efflux ratios < 2, suggesting that it is not likely a substrate of an efflux transporter. Collectively, these in vitro data may account for the dramatic increase in brain exposure over plasma as noted above. Pre-clinical efficacy studies showed that CM93 is more effective than other EGFR-TKIs in blocking the proliferation of GBM tumor cells from both patient-derived and cultured human GBM cell lines with EGFR amplification and/or EGFRvIII mutation. In addition, CM93 administered as a single agent was able to attenuate the growth of orthotopic U251-EGFRvIII xenografts and extend the survival of tumor-bearing mice in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CM93 inhibited EGFR phosphorylation in GBM tumors derived from a novel genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model of GBM with EGFRvIII expression both in vitro and in vivo. CM93 also extended the survival of mice bearing orthotopic allografts of GBM. Notably, mice maintained stable body weight during treatments with increasing doses of CM93 up to 75 mg/kg per day. Together, these data suggest that CM93 is a potential EGFR-TKI well suited for the treatment of adult GBM with mutant EGFR.",

Given that many bat species are threatened or have declining populations in parts of their range, non-invasive tools for monitoring colony health and identifying cryptic stressors are needed to efficiently direct conservation efforts. Here we describe intra- and interspecific sources of variation in hair cortisol levels in 18 Neotropical bat species from Mexico and Belize. We found that fecundity is an important ecological trait explaining interspecific variation in bat hair cortisol. Other ecological variables such as colony size, roost durability, and basal metabolic rate did not explain hair cortisol variation among species. At the individual level, females exhibited higher hair cortisol levels than males, and the effect of body mass varied among species. Overall, our findings help validate and accurately apply hair cortisol as a monitoring tool in free-ranging bats.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic is reportedly a biphasic inorganic compound for its toxicity and anticancer effects in humans [1, 2]. Recent studies have shown that certain arsenic compounds including arsenic hexoxide (AS4O6; hereafter, AS6) induce programmed cell death and cell cycle arrest in human cancer cells and murine cancer models [3, 4]. However, the mechanisms by which AS6 suppresses cancer cells are incompletely understood. In this study, we report the mechanisms of AS6 through transcriptome analyses. In particular, the cytotoxicity and global gene expression regulation by AS6 were compared in human normal and cancer breast epithelial cells. Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, differentially expressed genes in significantly affected biological pathways in these cell types were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting assays. Our data show markedly differential effects of AS6 on cytotoxicity and gene expression in human mammary epithelial normal cells (HUMEC) and Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 (MCF7), a human mammary epithelial cancer cell line. AS6 selectively arrests cell growth and induces cell death in MCF7 cells without affecting the growth of HUMEC in a dose-dependent manner. AS6 alters the transcription of a large number of genes in MCF7 cells, but much fewer genes in HUMEC. Importantly, we found that the cell proliferation, cell cycle, and DNA repair pathways are significantly suppressed whereas cellular stress response and apoptotic pathways increase in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. Together, we provide the first evidence of differential effects of AS6 on normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells, suggesting that AS6 at moderate concentrations induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through modulating genome-wide gene expression, leading to compromised DNA repair and increased genome instability selectively in human breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular properties (e.g., physical, chemical or physiological characteristics and biological activities) of small molecules plays essential roles in biomedical researches. The accumulating amount of datasets has enabled the development of data-driven computational methods, especially the machine learning based methods, to address the molecular property prediction tasks. Due to the high cost of obtaining experimental labels, the datasets of individual tasks generally contain limited amount of data, which inspired the application of transfer learning to boost the performance of the molecular property prediction tasks. Our analyses revealed that simultaneously considering similar tasks, rather than randomly chosen ones, can significantly improve the performance of transfer learning in this field. To provide accurate estimation of task similarity, we proposed an effective and interpretable computational tool, named Molecular Tasks Similarity Estimator (MoTSE). By extracting task-related local and global knowledge from pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs), MoTSE projects individual tasks into a latent space and measures the distance between the embedded vectors to derive the task similarity estimation and thus enhance the molecular prediction results. We have validated that the task similarity estimated by MoTSE can serve as a useful guidance to design a more accurate transfer learning strategy for molecular property prediction. Experimental results showed that such a strategy greatly outperformed baseline methods including training from scratch and multitask learning. Moreover, MoTSE can provide interpretability for the estimated task similarity, through visualizing the important loci in the molecules attributed by the attribution method employed in MoTSE. In summary, MoTSE can provide an accurate method for estimating the molecular property task similarity for effective transfer learning, with good interpretability for the learned chemical or biological insights underlying the intrinsic principles of the task similarity.",

    "abstract": "Between August and December 2013, the offshore cages of a commercial marine farm culturing red drum Sciaenops ocellatus in Campeche Bay were affected by an outbreak of an ulcerative granulomatous disease, reaching 70% cumulative mortality. Thirty-one adults displaying open ulcers on the skin were submitted to our laboratory for diagnosis. Multiple white-yellowish nodules (0.1-0.5 cm in diameter) were present in all internal organs, where the kidney and the spleen were the most severely affected. Histopathological observations of these organs evinced typical granulomatous formations. Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen stains on tissue imprints, bacterial swabs and tissue sections revealed Gram-positive, acid-fast, branching beaded long rod filamentous bacteria. Tissue samples resulted positive for nocardiosis when a Nocardia genus specific nested PCR was used. Definite identification at the species level and taxonomic positioning of the fastidious pathogen was achieved through a specific Nocardia seriolae PCR and by sequencing the gyrB gene of pure isolates. After application of antibiotics during fry production, a posterior follow-up monitoring (from 2014 to 2017) detected mild but recurrent outbreaks of the bacteria with no seasonality pattern. To the extent of our current knowledge, this is the first report of piscine nocardiosis (in a new host -red drum) in Mexico.",

Here, we report on the antiviral potency of novel compound FC-10696, which emerged from extensive structure activity relationship (SAR) of a previously described series of PPxY inhibitors. We show that FC-10696 inhibits egress of both mVP40 VLPs and egress and spread of authentic MARV from HeLa cells and primary human macrophages. Moreover, FC-10696 treated mice displayed delayed onset of weight loss, clinical signs, and significantly lower viral loads compared to controls, with 14% of animals surviving 21 days following a lethal MARV challenge. Thus, FC-10696 represents a first-in-class, host-oriented inhibitor effectively targeting late stages of the MARV lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "Members of the marine Roseobacter group are key players in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. While over 300 species have been described, only 2% possess reduced genomes (mostly 3-3.5 Mbp) compared to an average roseobacter (>4 Mbp). These taxonomic minorities are phylogenetically diverse but form a Pelagic Roseobacter Cluster (PRC) at the genome content level. Here, we cultivated eight isolates constituting a novel Roseobacter lineage which we named  CHUG. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic read recruitment analyses showed that CHUG members were globally distributed and active in marine environments. CHUG members possess some of the smallest genomes (~2.52 Mb) among all known roseobacters, but they do not exhibit canonical features of genome streamlining like higher coding density or fewer paralogues and pseudogenes compared to their sister lineages. While CHUG members are clustered with traditional PRC members at the genome content level, they show important differences. Unlike other PRC members, neither the relative abundances of CHUG members nor their gene expression levels are correlated with chlorophyll a concentration across the global samples. Moreover, CHUG members cannot synthesize vitamin B12, a key metabolite made by most roseobacters but not by many phytoplankton species and thus thought to mediate the roseobacter-phytoplankton interactions. This combination of features is evidence for the hypothesis that CHUG members may have evolved a free-living lifestyle decoupled from phytoplankton. This ecological transition was accompanied by the loss of signature genes involved in roseobacter-phytoplankton symbiosis, suggesting that relaxation of purifying selection is likely an important driver of genome reduction in CHUG.",

    "abstract": "Genetically diverse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) display varied, heritable responses to differentiation cues in the culture environment. By harnessing these disparities through derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the BXD mouse genetic reference panel, along with C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) parental strains, we demonstrate genetically determined biases in lineage commitment and identify major regulators of the pluripotency epigenome. Upon transition to formative pluripotency using epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), B6 quickly dissolves naive networks adopting gene expression modules indicative of neuroectoderm lineages; whereas D2 retains aspects of naive pluripotency with little bias in differentiation. Genetic mapping identifies 6 major trans-acting loci co-regulating chromatin accessibility and gene expression in ESCs and EpiLCs, indicating a common regulatory system impacting cell state transition. These loci distally modulate occupancy of pluripotency factors, including TRIM28, P300, and POU5F1, at hundreds of regulatory elements. One trans-acting locus on Chr 12 primarily impacts chromatin accessibility in ESCs; while in EpiLCs the same locus subsequently influences gene expression, suggesting early chromatin priming. Consequently, the distal gene targets of this locus are enriched for neurogenesis genes and were more highly expressed when cells carried B6 haplotypes at this Chr 12 locus, supporting genetic regulation of biases in cell fate. Spontaneous formation of embryoid bodies validated this with B6 showing a propensity towards neuroectoderm differentiation and D2 towards definitive endoderm, confirming the fundamental importance of genetic variation influencing cell fate decisions.",

Here, we developed a human myotube-based in vitro culture model of functionally mature tissue cysts that are orally infectious to mice and tolerate exposure to a range of antibiotics and temperature stresses. Metabolomic characterization of purified cysts reveals global changes that comprise increased levels of amino acids and decreased abundance of nucleobase- and tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated metabolites. In contrast to fast replicating tachyzoite forms of T. gondii these tissue cysts tolerate exposure to the aconitase inhibitor sodium fluoroacetate. Direct access to persistent stages of T. gondii under defined cell culture conditions will be essential for the dissection of functionally important host-parasite interactions and drug evasion mechanisms. It will also facilitate the identification of new strategies for therapeutic intervention.",

Our results indicate that hotspots identified through the EIR and PR partly overlapped during high transmission seasons but not during low transmission seasons. The estimated relationship showed a one-month delayed effect of EIR on PR such that at low transmission levels increases in EIR are associated with rapid rise in PR, but at high transmission levels, decreases in EIR do not translate into notable reductions in PR.

Aiming to explore how stakeholder groups perceive reviewing burden and what they believe to be the causes of a potential overburdening of reviewers, we conducted focus groups with early-, mid-, and senior career scholars, editors, and publishers. By means of a thematic analysis, we aimed to identify the causes of overburdening of reviewers. First, we show that, across disciplines and roles, stakeholders believed that the reviewing workload has become so enormous that the academic community is no longer able to supply the reviewing resources necessary to address its demand for peer review. Second, the reviewing workload is distributed unequally across the academic community, thereby overwhelming small groups of scholars. Third, stakeholders believed the overburdening of reviewers to be caused by (i) an increase in manuscript submissions; (ii) insufficient editorial triage; (iii) a lack of reviewing instructions; (iv) difficulties in recruiting reviewers; (v) inefficiencies in manuscript handling and (vi) a lack of institutionalisation of peer review. These themes were assumed to mutually reinforce each other and to relate to an inadequate incentive structure in academia that favours publications over peer review. In order to alleviate reviewing burden, a holistic approach is required that addresses both the increased demand for and the insufficient supply of reviewing resources.",

Our approach was guided by analyses of the effects of lateral orbitofrontal lesions in macaque monkeys, as this part of the brain shows clear developmental maturation in humans during adolescence. Using matched tasks and analyses in humans (n=388, 11-35yrs), we observe developmental changes in two key learning mechanisms as predicted from the monkey data. First, choice-reward credit assignment - the ability to link a specific outcome to a specific choice - is reduced in adolescents. Second, the effects of the global reward state - how good the environment is overall recently - exerts a distinctive pattern of influence on learning in humans compared to other primates and across adolescence this pattern becomes more pronounced. Both mechanisms were correlated across participants suggesting that associative learning of correct reward assignments and GRS based learning constitute two complementary mechanisms of reward-learning that co-mature during adolescence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOpioid withdrawal is a key driver of opioid addiction and an obstacle to recovery. However, withdrawal effects on opioid reinforcement and mesolimbic neuroadaptation are understudied and the role of sex is largely unknown.\n\nMethodsMale (n=10) and female (n=9) rats responded under a fentanyl-vs.-food \"choice\" procedure during daily 2h sessions. In addition to the daily choice sessions, rats were provided extended access to fentanyl during 12h sessions. After two weeks of this self-administration regimen, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) of a subset of rats were subjected to RNA sequencing. In the remaining rats, a third week of this self-administration regimen was conducted, during which methadone effects on fentanyl-vs.-food choice were determined.\n\nResultsPrior to opioid dependence, male and female rats similarly allocated responding between fentanyl and food. Abstinence from extended fentanyl access elicited a similar increase in somatic withdrawal signs in both sexes. Despite similar withdrawal signs and extended access fentanyl intake, opioid withdrawal was accompanied by a maladaptive increase in fentanyl choice in males, but not females. Behavioral sex differences corresponded with transcriptional hyperfunction in the NAc and VTA of opioid-withdrawn females relative to males. Methadone blocked withdrawal-associated increases in fentanyl choice in males, but failed to further decrease fentanyl choice in females.\n\nConclusionsThese results provide foundational evidence of sex-specific neuroadaptations to opioid withdrawal, which may be relevant to the female-specific resilience to withdrawal-associated increases in opioid choice and aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The function of mitochondrial respiration during B cell fate decisions and differentiation remains equivocal. This study reveals that selection for mitochondrial fitness occurs during B cell activation and is essential for subsequent plasma cell differentiation. By expressing a mutated mitochondrial helicase in transitional B cells, we depleted mitochondrial DNA during B cell maturation, resulting in reduced oxidative phosphorylation. Although no changes in follicular B cell development were evident, germinal centers, class switch recombination to IgG, plasma cell generation and humoral immunity were diminished. Defective oxidative phosphorylation led to aberrant flux of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and lowered the amount of saturated phosphatidic acid. Consequently, MTOR activity and BLIMP-1 induction were curtailed whereas HIF1, glycolysis and AMPK activity were amplified. Exogenous phosphatidic acid increased mTOR activity in activated B cells. Hence, mitochondrial function is required and selected for in activated B cells for the successful generation of functional plasma cells.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression in eukaryotes does not follow a linear process from transcription to translation and mRNA degradation. Instead it follows a circular process in which cytoplasmic mRNA decay crosstalks with nuclear transcription. In many instances this crosstalk contributes to buffer mRNA at a roughly constant concentration. Whether the mRNA buffering concept operates on the total mRNA concentration or at the gene-specific level, and if the mechanism to do so is a global or a specific one, remain unknown. Here we assessed changes in mRNA concentrations and their synthesis rates along the transcriptome of aneuploid strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also assessed mRNA concentrations and their synthesis rates in non sense-mediated decay (NMD) targets in euploid strains. We found that the altered synthesis rates in the genes from the aneuploid chromosome and the changes in their mRNA stabilities were not counterbalanced. In addition, the stability of NMD targets was not specifically compensated by the changes in synthesis rate. We conclude that there is no genetic compensation of NMD mRNA targets in yeast, and total mRNA buffering uses mostly a global system rather than a gene-specific one.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant expression of the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene in skeletal muscle causes muscle deterioration and weakness in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD). Since the presence of a permissive pLAM1 polyadenylation signal is essential for stabilization of DUX4 mRNA and translation of DUX4 protein, disrupting the function of this structure can prevent expression of DUX4. We and others have shown promising results using antisense approaches to reduce DUX4 expression in vitro and in vivo following local intramuscular administration. Our group has developed further the antisense chemistries, and demonstrate here enhanced in vitro antisense efficacy. The optimal chemistry was conjugated to a cell-penetrating moiety, and for the first time in FSHD research has been systemically administered into a double-transgenic mouse model of FSHD. After four weekly treatments, mRNA quantities of DUX4 and target genes were reduced by 50% that led to a 5% increase in muscle mass, a 52% improvement in in situ muscle strength, and reduction of muscle fibrosis by 17%. Systemic DUX4 inhibition also improved the locomotor activity significantly and reduced the fatigue level by 22%. Our data overall demonstrate that the optimized antisense approach can contribute to future development of a therapeutic strategy for FSHD.",

    "abstract": "Microclimate information is often crucial for understanding ecological patterns and processes, including under climate change, but is typically absent from ecological and biogeographic studies owing to difficulties in obtaining microclimate data. Recent advances in microclimate modelling, however, suggest that microclimate conditions can now be predicted anywhere at any time using hybrid physically- and empirically-based models. Here, for the first time, we test the utility of this approach across a remote, inaccessible, and climate change threatened polar island ecosystem at ecologically relevant scales. Microclimate predictions were generated at a 100 x 100 m grain (at a height of 4 cm) across the island, with models parameterised using either meteorological observations from the islands weather station (AWS) or climate reanalysis data (CRA). AWS models had low error rates and were highly correlated with observed seasonal and daily temperatures (root mean squared error of predicted seasonal average Tmean [&le;] 0.6 {degrees}C; Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) for the daily Tmean [&ge;] 0.86). By comparison, CRA models had a slight warm bias in all seasons and a smaller diurnal range in the late summer period than in situ observations. Despite these differences, the modelled relationship between the percentage cover of the threatened endemic cushion plant Azorella macquariensis and microclimate varied little with the source of microclimate data (r = 0.97), suggesting that both model parameterisations capture similar patterns of spatial variation in microclimate conditions across the island ecosystem. Here, we have shown that the accurate prediction of microclimate conditions at ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales is now possible using hybrid physically- and empirically-based models across even the most remote and climatically extreme environments. These advances will help add the microclimate dimension to ecological and biogeographic studies, which could be critical for delivering climate change-resilient conservation planning in climate-change exposed ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The fields of viral ecology and evolution have rapidly expanded in the last two decades, driven by technological improvements, and motivated by efforts to discover potentially zoonotic wildlife viruses under the rubric of pandemic prevention. One consequence has been a massive proliferation of host-virus association data, which comprise the backbone of research in viral macroecology and zoonotic risk prediction. These data remain fragmented across numerous data portals and projects, each with their own scope, structure, and reporting standards. Here, we propose that synthesis of host-virus association data is a central challenge to improve our understanding of the global virome and develop foundational theory in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open reconciled mammal-virus database from four key published datasets, applying a standardized taxonomy and metadata. We show that reconciling these datasets provides a substantially richer view of the mammal virome than that offered by any one individual database. We argue for a shift in best practice towards the incremental development and use of synthetic datasets in viral ecology research, both to improve comparability and replicability across studies, and to facilitate future efforts to use machine learning to predict the structure and dynamics of the global virome.",

    "abstract": "While nuclear transcription and RNA processing and localization are well established for protein coding genes (PCGs), these processes are poorly understood for lncRNAs. Here, we characterize global patterns of transcript expression, maturation and localization for mouse liver RNA, including more than 15,000 lncRNAs. PolyA-selected liver RNA was isolated and sequenced from four subcellular fractions (chromatin, nucleoplasm, total nucleus, and cytoplasm), and from the chromatin-bound fraction without polyA selection. Transcript processing, determined from normalized intronic to exonic sequence read density ratios, progressively increased for PCG transcripts in going from the chromatin-bound fraction to the nucleoplasm and then on to the cytoplasm. Transcript maturation was similar for lncRNAs in the chromatin fraction, but was significantly lower in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. LncRNAs were 11-fold more likely to be significantly enriched in the nucleus than cytoplasm, and 100-fold more likely to be significantly chromatin-bound than nucleoplasmic. Sequencing chromatin-bound RNA greatly increased the sensitivity for detecting lowly expressed lncRNAs and enabled us to discover and localize hundreds of novel regulated liver lncRNAs, including lncRNAs showing sex-biased expression or responsiveness to a xenobiotic agonist ligand of constitutive androstane receptor (Nr1i3). Integration of our findings with prior studies and lncRNA annotations identified candidate regulatory lncRNAs for a variety of hepatic functions based on gene co-localization within topologically associating domains or transcription divergent or antisense to PCGs associated with pathways linked to hepatic physiology and diseases.",

We estimated Gaussian models both at the group level and for each subject. Moreover, we used the estimated subject-specific models to simulate virtual human-in-the-loop optimization (HIL) experiments based on Bayesian optimization to establish their convergence under multiple combinations of acquisition functions and seed point selection methods.\n\nResults of the group-level model are in agreement with those obtained with linear mixed effect model, thus establishing the feasibility of Gaussian process modeling. The estimated subject-specific optimal conditions have large between-subject variability in the metric of propulsive impulse, with only 31% of subjects featuring a subject-specific optimal point in the surrounding of the group-level optimal point. Virtual HIL experiments indicate that expected improvement is the most effective acquisition method, while no significant effect of seed point selection method was observed.

    "abstract": "Extant fold-switching proteins remodel their secondary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli, regulating biological processes and affecting human health. In spite of their biological importance, these proteins remain understudied. Few representative examples of fold switchers are available in the Protein Data Bank, and they are difficult to predict. In fact, all 96 experimentally validated examples of extant fold switchers were stumbled upon by chance. Thus, predictive methods are needed to expedite the process of discovering and characterizing more of these shapeshifting proteins. Previous approaches require a solved structure or all-atom simulations, greatly constraining their use. Here, we propose a high-throughput sequence-based method for predicting extant fold switchers that transition from -helix in one conformation to {beta}-strand in the other. This method leverages two previous observations: (1) -helix <-> {beta}-strand prediction discrepancies from JPred4 are a robust predictor of fold switching, and (2) the fold-switching regions (FSRs) of some extant fold switchers have different secondary structure propensities when expressed in isolation (isolated FSRs) than when expressed within the context of their parent protein (contextualized FSRs). Combining these two observations, we ran JPred4 on the sequences of isolated and contextualized FSRs from 14 known extant fold switchers and found -helix <->{beta}-strand prediction discrepancies in every case. To test the overall robustness of this finding, we randomly selected regions of proteins not expected to switch folds (single-fold proteins) and found significantly fewer -helix <-> {beta}-strand prediction discrepancies (p < 4.2*10-20, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Combining these discrepancies with the overall percentage of predicted secondary structure, we developed a classifier that often robustly identifies extant fold switchers (Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.70). Although this classifier had a high false negative rate (6/14), its false positive rate was very low (1/211), suggesting that it can be used to predict a subset of extant fold switchers from billions of available genomic sequences.",

    "abstract": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare but highly aggressive malignancy and nearly half of ACC tumors have been shown to overproduce and secrete adrenal steroids. Excess cortisol secretion, in particular, has been associated with poor prognosis among ACC patients. Furthermore, recent immunotherapy clinical trials demonstrated significant immunoresistance among cortisol-secreting ACC (CS-ACC) patients when compared to their non-Cortisol-secreting (nonCS-ACC) counterparts. The immunosuppressive role of excess glucocorticoid therapies and secretion is well established, however, the impact of the cortisol hypersecretion on ACC tumor microenvironment (TME), immune expression profiles, and immune cell responses remain largely undefined. In this study, we characterized the TME of ACC patients and compared the immunogenomic profiles of nonCS-ACC and CS-ACC tumors to assess the impact of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to immune processes on patient prognosis. Comprehensive multiplatform immunogenomic computational analyses of ACC tumors deciphered an immunosuppressive expression profile with a direct impact on patient survival. We identified several primary immunogenomic prognostic indicators and potential targets within the tumor immune landscape of CS-ACC that define a distinct TME and provide additional insight into the understanding of potential contributory mechanisms underlying failure of initial immunotherapeutic trials and poor prognosis of patients with CS-ACC.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAlthough plant diseases generally cause more severe symptoms under conditions of high temperature and high humidity(HTHH), how plant respond to pathogen attack under this condition remains elusive.\nC_LIO_LIAs an example, we herein comparatively studied pepper(Capsicum annuum) immunity against Ralstonia solanacearum under HTHH and ambient temperature by approaches of reverse genetics. We found that pepper respond to R.solanacearum infection by activating salicylic-acid- and jasmonic-acid-mediated immunity at ambient temperature. Under HTHH, However, it no longer activates JA-mediated immunity and activates only transient SA signaling at the early stage of R.solanacearum infection, but instead induces cytokinin mediated immunity.\nC_LIO_LIThese two immune systems are positively regulated by CaWRKY40 via binding the WT-box and a novel W-box like (WL) box, respectively, in an environment-dependent manner: CaWRKY40 is activated upon R. solanacearum infection under HTHH, thereby upregulating ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE5(IPT5). The resulting cytokinin then works synergistically with CaWRKY40 in activating a subset of glutathione S-transferase genes via chromatin activation and WL-box binding, but prevent CaWRKY40 from activating ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) or SA-/JA-dependent pathogenesis-related genes by chromatin inactivation or by blocking WT-box binding.\nC_LIO_LIThese results highlight the specific pepper immune response to R. solanacearum infection under HTHH and its synergistic activation by CaWRKY40 and cytokinins.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The scrutiny over the carbon footprint of academics has increased rapidly in the last few years. This has resulted in a series of publications providing various estimates of the carbon footprint of one or several research activities, principally at the scale of a university or a research center or, more recently, a field of research. The variety of tools or methodologies - on which these estimates rely - unfortunately prevents from any direct comparison because of the sensitivity of carbon footprint assessments to variations in the scope and to key parameters such as emission factors. In an effort to enabling a robust comparison of research carbon footprints across institutions, contexts or disciplines, we present an open-source web application, GES 1point5 designed to estimate the carbon footprint of a department, research lab or team in any country of the world with a transparent and common methodology. The current version of GES 1point5, open-source and freely available, takes into account the most common and often predominant emission sources in research labs: buildings, digital devices, commuting, and professional travel. GES 1point5 is developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists from several public research institutions in France as part of the Labos 1point5 project. GES 1point5 is therefore presently tailored for the French context but can be adjusted to any national contexts by adjusting the values of emission factors. The versatility and usability of the software have been empirically validated by its adoption by several hundred research labs in France over the last 18 months. In addition to enabling the estimation and monitoring of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the scale of a research lab, GES 1point5 is designed to aggregate the data entered by the labs and the corresponding GHG emissions estimates into a comprehensive database. GES 1point5 can therefore allow to (i) identify robust determinants of the carbon footprint of research activities across a network of research labs (ii) estimate the carbon footprint of research at the national scale. A preliminary analysis of the carbon footprint of more than one hundred laboratories is presented to illustrate the potential of the approach. While assessments of carbon footprints are often externalized onto extension services and proprietary softwares, GES 1point5 is designed as a hands-on, pedagogic and transparent tool for research labs to monitor and reduce their own carbon footprint. This internalization has strong positive co-benefits for academics in terms of awareness and empowerment. We further expect that international dissemination of GES 1point5 will contribute to establishing a global understanding of the drivers of the research carbon footprint worldwide and an identification of the levers to decrease it.\n\nAvailability and implementationGES 1point5 is available online at http://labos1point5.org/ges-1point5 and its source code can be downloaded from the GitLab platform at https://framagit.org/labos1point5/l1p5-vuejs.",

    "abstract": "The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by spasticity and weakness in the lower body. Despite the identification of causative mutations in over 70 genes, the molecular aetiology remains unclear. Due to the combination of genetic diversity and variable clinical presentation, the Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias are a strong candidate for protein-protein interaction network analysis as a tool to understand disease mechanism(s) and to aid functional stratification of phenotypes. In this study, experimentally validated human protein-protein interactions were used to create a protein-protein interaction network based on the causative Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia genes. Network evaluation as a combination of both topological analysis and functional annotation led to the identification of core proteins in putative shared biological processes such as intracellular transport and vesicle trafficking. The application of machine learning techniques suggested a functional dichotomy linked with distinct sets of clinical presentations, suggesting there is scope to further classify conditions currently described under the same umbrella term of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias based on specific molecular mechanisms of disease.",

Atopic responses following certain pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis is currently an area of interest for further research.\n\nPurposeThe aim of this study is to measure the level of IgE, IgG4, and IgG4/IgE ratio periodically after exposure of periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\n\nMethodsWe used 16 wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) randomly subdivided into 4 groups, group 1 were injected by placebo, group 2 by LPS Pg 0.3 g/mL,group 3 by LPS Pg 1 g/mL, and group 4 by LPS Pg 3 g/mL. Sera from both groups were taken from retro-orbital plexus before and after exposure.\n\nResultsLevel of IgE and IgG4 increased significantly following exposure of LPS Pg at day-4 and day-11. Greater increase of IgE rather than IgG4 contributes to rapid decline of IgG4/IgE ratio, detected in the peripheral blood at day-4 and day-11.\n\nConclusionModulation of atopic responses following exposure to LPS Pg is reflected by decrease in IgG4/IgE ratio that accompanies an increase of IgE.\n\nClinical significancePorphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone pathogen during periodontal disease, may have a tendency to disrupt atopic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The relative abundance patterns of tropical trees have been of interest since the expeditions of Alfred Russel Wallace, but little is known about how differences in relative abundance relate to reproductive patterns. Flowering is resource-dependent and fitness differences as well as differences in the quality of the abiotic and biotic neighborhood may contribute to the variation in reproductive status responsible for population-level flowering patterns. This variation determines the density and distance between flowering conspecifics and may alter relative abundance extremes among species during reproduction, factors known to influence pollination success. We collected flowering status data for a guild of twenty-three co-occurring tree species that flower in the understory of the Korup Forest Dynamics Plot in Cameroon. We examined how the occurrence and location of reproductive events were related to spatial patterns of adult abundance, focal tree size, neighborhood crowding, and habitat, while accounting for the influence of shared ancestry. Across species, the probability of flowering was higher for individuals of rarer species and for larger individuals but was unrelated to neighborhood crowding or habitat differences. Relative abundance extremes were reduced when only flowering individuals were considered, leading to a negative relationship between plot abundance and flowering probability at the species level that was not structured by shared ancestry. Spatially, flowering conspecifics tended to be overdispersed relative to all adult conspecifics. Rare species are predicted to suffer Allee effects or reduced fitness due to the difficulty of finding mates at low densities and frequencies. Here, however, rare species appear to maximize the size of their mate pool, compared to abundant species. If this partial  leveling of the playing field during reproduction is typical, it has consequences for our understanding of biodiversity maintenance and species coexistence in tropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Crocodilians and their allies have survived several mass extinction events. However, the impact of the K-Pg mass extinction event on crocodylomorphs is considered as minor or non-existent although other clades of archosaurs, e.g., non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs, went extinct completely. Previous approaches using fossil occurrence data alone have proven inconclusive. In this paper, we take a phylogenetic approach using extant and extinct species. The time-calibrated phylogeny of extant crocodilians provides insights into the pattern of recent biodiversity changes whereas fossil occurrence data provide insights about the more ancient past. The two data sources combined into a single phylogeny with extinct and extant taxa provide a holistic view of the historical biodiversity. To utilize this combined data and to infer the impact of the K-Pg mass extinction event, we derive the likelihood function for a time-varying (episodic) serially sampled birth-death model that additionally incorporates mass extinctions and bursts of births. We implemented the likelihood function in a Bayesian framework with recently developed smoothing priors to accommodate for both abrupt and gradual changes in speciation, extinction and fossilization rates. Contrary to previous research, we find strong evidence for the K-Pg extinction event in crocodiles and their allies. This signal is robust to uncertainty in the phylogeny and the prior on the mass extinctions. Through simulated data analyses, we show that there is high power to detect this mass extinction and little risk of false positives.",

Here, we identified a population of adipocytes that exhibit persistent activity of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, as revealed by the Tcf/Lef-Gfp reporter allele, in embryonic and adult mouse fat depots, named as Wnt+ adipocytes. We showed that the {beta}-catenin-mediated signaling activation in these cells is Wnt ligand- and receptor-independent but relies on AKT/mTOR pathway and is essential for cell survival. Such adipocytes are distinct from classical ones in transcriptomic and genomic signatures and can be induced from various sources of mesenchymal stromal cells including human cells. Genetic lineage-tracing and targeted cell ablation studies revealed that these adipocytes convert into beige adipocytes directly and are also required for beige fat recruitment under thermal challenge, demonstrating both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles in adaptive thermogenesis. Furthermore, mice bearing targeted ablation of these adipocytes exhibited glucose intolerance, while mice receiving exogenously supplied such cells manifested enhanced glucose utilization. Our studies uncover a unique adipocyte population in regulating beiging in adipose tissues and systemic glucose homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Covalent modification cycles (CMCs) are basic units of signaling systems and their properties are well understood. However, the behavior of such systems has been mostly characterized in situations where the substrate is in excess over the modifying enzymes. Experimental data on protein abundance suggest that the enzymes and their target proteins are present in comparable concentrations, leading to a different scenario in which the substrate is mostly sequestered by the enzymes. In this enzyme-in-excess regime, CMCs have been shown to exhibit signal termination, the ability of the product to return to a stationary value lower than the its peak in response to constant stimulation, while this stimulation is still active, with possible implications for the ability of systems to adapt to environmental inputs. We characterize the conditions leading to signal termination in CMCs in the enzyme-in-excess regime. We also demonstrate that this behavior leads to a preferred frequency response (band-pass filters) when the cycle is subjected to periodic stimulation, while the literature reports that CMCs investigated so far behave as low pass filters. We characterize the relationship between signal termination and the preferred frequency response to periodic inputs and we explore the dynamic mechanism underlying these phenomena. Finally, we describe how the behavior of CMCs is reflected in similar types of responses in the cascades of which they are part. Evidence of protein abundance in vivo shows that enzymes and substrates are present in comparable concentrations, thus suggesting that signal termination and frequency preference response to periodic inputs are also important dynamic features of cell signaling systems, which have been overlooked.",

    "abstract": "Local Ecological Knowledge has the potential to improve fishery management by providing new data on the fishing efforts, behavior, and abundance trends of fish and other aquatic animals. Here, we relied on local knowledge of fishers to investigate ecological factors that affect elasmobranch fishers\" operations and the changes in stock status of sharks and rays from 1980 to 2020 in five coastal communities in Ghana. Data were gathered from fishers using participant observation, interviews, focus group discussions, and participatory rural appraisal techniques. The results revealed fisher\"s understanding of six main ecological variables, which are mostly applied to enhance their fishing operations: season and weather conditions, lunar phase, bait type, presence of seabirds and fish movement, color of seawater, and sea current. These ecological features have been applied over the years to enhance fishing operations as well as maximize fisher catch. Fishers reported a profound decline in shark and ray catch from 1980 to 2020 and attributed the decline in size, number, and composition of their catch to overfishing and Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing operations. In general, most shark and ray species were abundant in 1980 but have been severely depleted as of 2020, with the exception of Blue Shark (Prionace glauca) and Devil rays (Mobula spp), which were reported to be common by the interviewed fishers. The first species depleted were the Thresher sharks (Alopiidae), Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), Blackchin Guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus), and Lemon Shark (Negaprion brevirostris), which were depleted early in the 2000s. The next depletions of Hammerhead sharks (Sphyrnidae), Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas), Sand Tiger Shark (Carcharias taurus), Stingrays (Fontitrygon spp), and Spineback Guitarfish (Rhinobatos irvinei) occurred in the 2010s. We found Local Ecological Knowledge of fishers to be surprisingly consistent with scholarly knowledge and call for their inclusion in research, decision-making and management interventions by biologists and policy makers.",

    "abstract": "Semantic binding refers to constructing complex meaning based on elementary building blocks. Using EEG, we investigated the age-related changes in modulations of oscillatory brain activity supporting lexical retrieval and semantic binding. Young and older adult participants were visually presented two-word phrases, which for the first word revealed a lexical retrieval signature (e.g. swift vs. swrfeq) and for the second word revealed a semantic binding signature (e.g. horse in a semantic binding \"swift horse\" vs. no binding \"swrfeq horse\" context). The oscillatory brain activity associated with lexical retrieval as well as semantic binding significantly differed between healthy older and young adults. Specifically for lexical retrieval, we found that different age groups exhibited opposite patterns of theta and alpha modulation, which as a combined picture suggest that lexical retrieval is associated with different and delayed signatures in older compared to young adults. For semantic binding, in young adults we found a signature in the low-beta range centred around the target word onset (i.e. a smaller low-beta increase for binding relative to no binding), while in healthy older adults we found an opposite binding signature about ~500ms later in the low- and high-beta range (i.e. a smaller low- and high-beta decrease for binding relative to no binding). The novel finding of a different and delayed oscillatory signature for semantic binding in healthy older adults reflects that the integration of word meaning into the semantic context takes longer and relies on different mechanisms in healthy older compared to young adults.",

To specify segment identity we show that Ubx both increases and decreases chromatin accessibility, coinciding with its role as both an activator and repressor of transcription. Surprisingly, whether Ubx functions as an activator or repressor differs depending on the proximal-distal position in the segment and the availability of Hox cofactors. Ubx-mediated changes to chromatin accessibility positively and negatively impact the binding of Scalloped (Sd), a transcription factor that is required for appendage development in both segments. These findings reveal how a single Hox protein can modify complex gene regulatory networks to transform the identity of an entire tissue.",

    "abstract": "Scientists have long conjectured that the neocortex learns the structure of the environment in a predictive, hierarchical manner. According to this conjecture, expected, predictable features are differentiated from unexpected ones by comparing bottom-up and top-down streams of information. It is theorized that the neocortex then changes the representation of incoming stimuli, guided by differences in the responses to expected and unexpected events. In line with this conjecture, different responses to expected and unexpected sensory features have been observed in spiking and somatic calcium events. However, it remains unknown whether these unexpected event signals occur in the distal apical dendrites where many top-down signals are received, and whether these signals govern subsequent changes in the brains stimulus representations. Here, we show that both somata and distal apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit distinct unexpected event signals that systematically change over days. These findings were obtained by tracking the responses of individual somata and dendritic branches of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons over multiple days in primary visual cortex of awake, behaving mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Many neurons in both layers 2/3 and 5 showed large differences between their responses to expected and unexpected events. Interestingly, these responses evolved in opposite directions in the somata and distal apical dendrites. These differences between the somata and distal apical dendrites may be important for hierarchical computation, given that these two compartments tend to receive bottom-up and top-down information, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Within populations, some individuals tend to exhibit a bold or shy social behavior phenotype relative to the mean. The neural underpinnings of these differing phenotypes - also described as syndromes, personalities, and coping styles - is an area of ongoing investigation. Although a social decision-making network has been described across vertebrate taxa, most studies examining activity within this network do so in relation to exhibited differences in behavioral expression. Our study instead focuses on constitutive gene expression in bold and shy individuals by isolating baseline gene expression profiles that influence social boldness predisposition, rather than those reflecting the results of social interaction and behavioral execution. We performed this study on male green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), an established model organism for behavioral research, which provides a crucial comparison group to investigations of birds and mammals. After identifying subjects as bold or shy through repeated reproductive and agonistic behavior testing, we used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression profiles between these groups within various forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions. The ventromedial hypothalamus had the largest group differences in gene expression, with bold males having increased expression of neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter receptor and calcium channel genes compared to shy males. Conversely, shy males express more integrin alpha-10 in the majority of examined regions. There were no significant group differences in physiology or hormone levels. Our results highlight the ventromedial hypothalamus as an important center of behavioral differences across individuals and provide novel candidates for investigations into the regulation of individual variation in social behavior phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Survival requires both the ability to persistently pursue goals and the ability to determine when it is time to stop, an adaptive balance of perseverance and disengagement. Neural activity in the lateral habenula (LHb) has been linked to aversion and negative valence, but its role in regulating the balance between reward-seeking and disengaged behavioral states remains unclear. Here, we show that LHb neural activity is tonically elevated during minutes-long disengagements from reward-seeking behavior, whether due to repeated reward omission or following sufficient consumption of reward. Further, we show that LHb inhibition extends ongoing reward-seeking behavioral states but does not prompt re-engagement. We find no evidence for similar tonic activity fluctuations in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons. Our findings implicate the LHb as a key mediator of disengagement from reward-seeking behavior in multiple contexts and argue against the idea that the LHb contributes to decisions solely by signaling aversion.",

    "abstract": "Primates and rodents are able to continually acquire, adapt, and transfer knowledge and skill, and lead to goal-directed behavior during their lifespan. For the case when context switches slowly, animals learn via slow processes. For the case when context switches rapidly, animals learn via fast processes. We build a biologically realistic model with modules similar to a distributed computing system. Specifically, we are emphasizing the role of thalamocortical learning on a slow time scale between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial dorsal thalamus (MD). Previous work [1] has already shown experimental evidence supporting classification of cell ensembles in the medial dorsal thalamus, where each class encodes a different context. However, the mechanism by which such classification is learned is not clear. In this work, we show that such learning can be self-organizing in the manner of an automaton (a distributed computing system), via a combination of Hebbian learning and homeostatic synaptic scaling. We show that in the simple case of two contexts, the network with hierarchical structure can do context-based decision making and smooth switching between different contexts. Our learning rule creates synaptic competition [2] between the thalamic cells to create winner-take-all activity. Our theory shows that the capacity of such a learning process depends on the total number of task-related hidden variables, and such a capacity is limited by system size N. We also theoretically derived the effective functional connectivity as a function of an order parameter dependent on the thalamo-cortical coupling structure.\n\nSignificance StatementAnimals need to adapt to dynamically changing environments and make decisions based on changing contexts. Here we propose a combination of neural circuit structure with learning mechanisms to account for such behaviors. Specifically, we built a reservoir computing network improved by a Hebbian learning rule together with a synaptic scaling learning mechanism between the prefrontal cortex and the medial-dorsal (MD) thalamus. This model shows that MD thalamus is crucial in such context-based decision making. I also make use of dynamical mean field theory to predict the effective neural circuit. Furthermore, theoretical analysis provides a prediction that the capacity of such a network increases with the network size and the total number of tasks-related latent variables.",

Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the PIK3CD gene lead to the development of activated PI3K{delta} syndrome (APDS), a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder. A subset of APDS patients also displays neurodevelopmental delay symptoms, suggesting a potential role of PIK3CD in cognitive and behavioural function. However, the extent and nature of the neurodevelopmental deficits has not been previously quantified. Here, we assessed the cognitive functions of two APDS patients, and investigated the causal role of the PIK3CD GOF mutation in neurological deficits using a murine model of this disease. We used E1020K knock-in mice, harbouring the most common APDS mutation in patients. We found that APDS patients present with visuomotor deficits, exacerbated by autism spectrum disorder comorbidity, whereas p110{delta}E1020K mice exhibited impairments in motor behaviour, learning and repetitive behaviour patterning. Our data indicate that PIK3CD GOF mutations increase the risk for neurodevelopmental deficits, supporting previous findings on the interplay between the nervous and the immune system. Further, our results validate the knock-in mouse model, and offer an objective assessment tool for patients that could be incorporated in diagnosis and in the evaluation of treatments.",

    "abstract": "While experience unfolds continuously, memories are organized as a set of discrete events that bind together the \"where\", \"when\", and \"what\" of episodic memory. This segmentation of continuous experience is thought to be facilitated by the detection of salient environmental or cognitive events. However, the underlying neural mechanisms and how such segmentation shapes episodic memory representations remain unclear. We recorded from single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe while subjects watched videos with different types of embedded boundaries and were subsequently evaluated for memories of the video contents. Here we show neurons that signal the presence of cognitive boundaries between subevents from the same episode and neurons that detect the abstract separation between different episodes. The firing rate and spike timing of these boundary-responsive neurons were predictive of later memory retrieval accuracy. At the population level, abrupt neural state changes following boundaries predicted enhanced memory strength but impaired order memory, capturing the behavioral tradeoff subjects exhibited when recalling episodic content versus temporal order. Successful retrieval was associated with reinstatement of the neural state present following boundaries, indicating that boundaries structure memory search. These findings reveal a neuronal substrate for detecting cognitive boundaries and show that cognitive boundary signals facilitate the mnemonic organization of continuous experience as a set of discrete episodic events.",

    "abstract": "Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) is an endemic fungal pneumonia of the North and South American deserts. The causative agents of Valley fever are the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, which grow as mycelia in the environment and spherules within the lungs of vulnerable hosts. The current diagnostics for Valley fever are severely lacking due to poor sensitivity and invasiveness, contributing to a 23-day median time-to-diagnosis, and therefore new diagnostic tools are needed. We are working toward the development of a breath-based diagnostic for coccidioidomycosis, and in this initial study we characterized the volatile metabolomes (or volatilomes) of in vitro cultures of Coccidioides. Using solid-phase microextraction and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), we characterized the VOCs produced by six strains of each species during mycelial or spherule growth. We detected a total of 353 VOCs that were at least two-fold more abundant in a Coccidioides culture versus medium controls and found the volatile metabolome of Coccidioides is more dependent on growth phase (spherule versus mycelia) than on the species. The volatile profiles of C. immitis and C. posadasii have strong similarities, indicating that a single suite of Valley fever breath biomarkers can be developed to detect both species.\n\nIMPORTANCECoccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, causes up to 30% of community-acquired pneumonias in endemic and highly populated areas of the US desert southwest. The infection is difficult to diagnose by standard serological and histopathological methods, which delays an appropriate treatment. Therefore, we are working toward the development of breath-based diagnostics for Valley fever. In this study, we characterized the volatile metabolomes of six strains each of Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, the dimorphic fungal species that cause Valley fever. By analyzing the volatilomes during the two modes of growth for the fungus--mycelia and spherules--we observed that the lifecycle plays a significant role in the volatiles produced by Coccidioides. In contrast, we observed no significant differences in the C. immitis versus C. posadasii volatilomes. These data suggest that lifecycle, rather than species, should guide the selection of putative biomarkers for a Valley fever breath test.",

    "abstract": "The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF-1) has been shown to ameliorate different bacterial infections through enhancement of microbial killing. While the impact of HIF-1 on inflammatory diseases of the gut has been studied intensively, its function in bacterial infections of the intestine remains largely elusive. With the help of a publicly available gene expression data set, we could infer significant activation of the HIF-1 transcription factor after oral infection of mice with Salmonella Typhimurium. This prompted us to apply lineage-restricted deletion of the Hif1a locus in mice to examine cell type-specific functions of HIF-1 in this model. We show hypoxia-independent induction of HIF-1 activity upon Salmonella infection in the intestinal epithelium as well as in macrophages. Surprisingly, Hif1a deletion in intestinal epithelial cells impacted neither disease outcome nor inflammatory activity. The conditional knockout of Hif1a in myeloid cells enhanced the mRNA expression of the largely pro-inflammatory chemokine Cxcl2, revealing a potentially inflammatory effect of HIF-1 deficiency in myeloid cells in the gut in vivo. Again, the disease outcome was not affected. In vitro HIF-1-deficient macrophages showed an overall impaired transcription of pro-inflammatory factors, however, Salmonella bypassed direct intracellular, bactericidal HIF-1-dependent mechanisms in a Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-2 independent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that HIF-1 in intestinal epithelial and myeloid cells is either dispensable or compensable in the immune defense against Salmonella Typhimurium.",

    "abstract": "Modern light microscopy, including super-resolution techniques, brought about a demand for small labeling tags that bring the fluorophore closer to the target. This challenge can be addressed by labeling unnatural amino acids (UAAs) with click chemistry. UAAs are site-specifically incorporated into a protein of interest by genetic code expansion. If the UAA carries a strained alkene or alkyne moiety it can be conjugated to a tetrazine-bearing fluorophore via a strain-promoted inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition (SPIEDAC), a variant of bioorthogonal click chemistry. The minimal size of the incorporated tag and the possibility to couple the fluorophores directly to the protein of interest with single-residue precision make SPIEDAC live-cell labeling unique. However, until now, this type of labeling has not been used in complex, non-dividing cells, such as neurons. Using neurofilament light chain as a target protein, we established SPIEDAC labeling in living primary neurons and applied it for fixed-cell, live-cell, dual-color pulse--chase and super-resolution microscopy. We also show that SPIEDAC labeling can be combined with CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering for tagging endogenous NFL. Due to its versatile nature and compatibility with advanced microscopy techniques, we anticipate that SPIEDAC labeling will contribute to novel discoveries in neurobiology.",

Previous reports have established a decisive role for IFN{gamma} producing CD4+ T cells to control murine CMV (MCMV) infection in the SGs; however, micro-anatomical information regarding their mode of action is largely missing. Here, we provide a spatiotemporal analysis of defined antiviral immune actions that eventually culminate in control of lytic MCMV replication in this preferred mucosal niche. CXCR3-mediated guidance of CD4+ T cells towards CXCL9 and CXCL10 expressing cells resulted in discrete clusters close to infection foci where they reported TCR engagement and produced IFN{gamma}. Of note, these clusters occasionally contained CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells with engulfed virus-associated remnants, most likely apoptotic bodies derived from previously infected cells, enabling antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. The induced IFN{gamma} production within these CD4+ T cell accumulations triggered IFN{gamma}R signaling in a confined perimeter, thereby inducing local, but not organ-wide protection, and allowing MCMV replication to continue at not yet protected sites. Combining experimental data with a mathematical model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of infection and CD4+ T cell dynamics revealed a scenario, in which ultimate MCMV control is achieved through accumulating sites of regionally-confined tissue protection.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that increasing the number of characters has the potential to resolving radiations. We studied photosynthetic stramenopiles (Ochrophyta) using alignments of heterogeneous size and origin (6,762 sites for mitochondrion, 21,692 sites for plastid and 209,105 sites for nucleus). While statistical support for the relationships between the six major Ochrophyta lineages increases when comparing the mitochondrion and plastid trees, it decreases in the nuclear tree. Statistical support is not simply related to the dataset size but also to the quantity of phylogenetic signal available at each position and our ability to extract it. Here, we show that proper signal extraction is difficult to attain, as demonstrated by conflicting results obtained when varying taxon sampling. Even though the use of a better fitting model improved signal extraction and reduced the observed conflicts, the plastid dataset provided higher statistical support for the ochrophyte radiation than the larger nucleus dataset. We propose that the higher support observed in the plastid tree is due to an acceleration of the evolutionary rate in one short deep internal branch, implying that more phylogenetic signal per position is available to resolve the Ochrophyta radiation in the plastid than in the nuclear dataset. Our work therefore suggests that, in order to resolve radiations, beyond the obvious use of datasets with more positions, we need to continue developing models of sequence evolution that better extract the phylogenetic signal and design methods to search for genes/characters that contain more signal specifically for short internal branches.",
