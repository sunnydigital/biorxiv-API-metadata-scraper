    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder that is underpinned by numerous dysregulated biological pathways, including canonical mitochondrial pathways. Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to this dysregulation and DNA methylation is an important factor in the aetiology of ASD. We examined the relationship between DNA methylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1), an essential transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in an ASD cohort of South African children.\n\nResultsUsing targeted Next Generation bisulfite sequencing, we found 12 highly variable CpG sites in PGC-1 that were significantly differentially methylated (p<0.05) between ASD (n = 55) and controls (n = 44). In ASD, eight CpG sites were hypermethylated in the PGC-1 promotor with a putative binding site for CAMP response binding element 1 (CREB1) spanning one of these CpG sites (p = 1 x 10-6). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, a marker of mitochondrial function, was elevated (p = 0.002) in ASD compared to controls and correlated significantly with DNA methylation at the PGC-1 promoter. There was a positive correlation between methylation at PGC-1 at CpG#1 and mtDNA copy number (Spearmans r = 0.2, n = 49, p = 0.04) in ASD, but a negative correlation between methylation at PGC-1 at CpG#4 promoter and mtDNA copy number in controls (Spearmans r = -0.4, n = 42, p = 0.045). While there was no relationship between mtDNA deletions and PGC-1 methylation in ASD, mtDNA deletions correlated negatively with methylation at PGC-1 at CpG#4 (Spearmans r = -0.4, n = 42, p = 0.032) in controls. Furthermore, levels of urinary organic acids associated with mitochondrial dysfunction correlated significantly (p<0.05) with DNA methylation at PGC-1 CpG#1 and mtDNA copy number in ASD (n= 20) and controls (n= 13) with many of these metabolites involved in altered redox homeostasis and neuroendocrinology.\n\nConclusionsThese data show an association between PGC-1 promoter methylation, elevated mtDNA copy number and metabolomic evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. This highlights an unexplored link between DNA methylation and mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD.",

We describe a panel of human mAbs binding to diverse epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors and found a minority of these possessed neutralizing activity. Two mAbs (COV2-2676 and COV2-2489) inhibited infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and recombinant VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We mapped their binding epitopes by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and selection of functional SARS-CoV-2 S neutralization escape variants. Mechanistic studies showed that these antibodies neutralize in part by inhibiting a post-attachment step in the infection cycle. COV2-2676 and COV2-2489 offered protection either as prophylaxis or therapy, and Fc effector functions were required for optimal protection. Thus, natural infection induces a subset of potent NTD-specific mAbs that leverage neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple functional attributes.",

Using computational tools, we found that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants may acquire an increased transmissibility by increasing the propensity of its spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain.

Training lasted two weeks before starting the validation protocol. Sequential five and seven-cone line-ups were used with axillary sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive) and from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative). A total of 1368 trials were performed during validation, including 151 positive and 110 negative samples. Each line-up had one positive sample and at least one negative sample. The dog had to mark the positive sample, randomly positioned behind one of the cones. The dog, handler and data recorder were blinded to the positive sample location.\n\nThe calculated overall sensitivities were between 71% and 79% for three dogs, between83% and 87% for three other dogs, and equal to or higher than 90% for the remaining 15 dogs (more than two thirds of the 21 dogs).\n\nAfter calculating the overall sensitivity for each dog using all line-ups, \"matched\" sensitivities were calculated only including line-ups containing COVID-19 positive and negative samples strictly comparable on confounding factors such as diabetes, anosmia, asthma, fever, body pain, diarrhoea, sex, hospital, method of sweat collection and sampling duration. Most of the time, the sensitivities increased after matching.\n\nPandemic conditions in the U.A.E., associated with the desire to use dogs as an efficient mass-pretesting tool has already led to the operational deployment of the study dogs.\n\nFuture studies will focus on comparatives fields-test results including the impact of the main COVID-19 comorbidities and other respiratory tract infections.",

    "abstract": "Homozygotic mutations in the GBA gene cause Gauchers disease, moreover, both patients and heterozygotic carriers have been associated with 20- to 30-fold increased risk of developing Parkinsons disease. In homozygosis, these mutations impair the activity of {beta}-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme encoded by GBA, and generate a lysosomal disorder in macrophages, which changes morphology towards an engorged phenotype, considered the hallmark of Gauchers disease. In the brain, most of the pathological effects caused by GBA mutations have been attributed to the {beta}-glucocerebrosidase deficit in neurons, while a microglial phenotype for these mutations has never been reported. Here, we applied the bioluminescence imaging technology, immunohistochemical and gene expression analysis to investigate the consequences of microglial {beta}-glucocerebrosidase inhibition in the brain of reporter mice, in primary neuron/microglia co-cultures and in cell lines. Our data demonstrate the existence of a novel mechanism by which microglia sustain the antioxidant/detoxifying response mediated by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in neurons. The central role played by microglia in this neuronal response in vivo was proven by pharmacological depletion of the lineage in the brain, while co-cultures experiments provided insight on the nature of this cell-to-cell communication showing that this mechanism requires a direct microglia-to-neuron contact supported by functional actin structures. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial {beta}-glucocerebrosidase was proven to induce morphological changes, turn on an anti-inflammatory/repairing pathway and hinder the microglia ability to activate the anti-oxidant/detoxifying response, thus increasing the neuronal susceptibility to neurotoxins.\n\nAltogether, our data suggest that microglial {beta}-glucocerebrosidase inhibition impairs microglia-to-neuron communication increasing the sensitivity of neurons to oxidative or toxic insults, thus providing a possible mechanism for the increased risk of neurodegeneration observed in carriers of GBA mutations.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=154 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/427380v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c2c3corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c4e34org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12718dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dcfeca_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In BriefMicroglia, through actin-dependent structures, contact neurons and induce a detoxification response by increasing the NFE2L2 signalling pathway.

    "abstract": "Interest in the studying of functional connections in the brain has grown considerably in the last decades, as many studies have pointed out that these interactions can play a role as markers of neurological diseases. Most studies in this field treat the brain network as a system of connections stationary in time, but dynamic features of brain connectivity can provide useful information, both on physiology and pathological conditions of the brain. In this paper, we propose the application of a computational methodology, named Particle Filter (PF), to study non-stationarities in brain connectivity in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The PF algorithm estimates time-varying hidden parameters of a first-order linear time-varying Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) through a Sequential Monte Carlo strategy. On simulated time series, the PF approach effectively detected and enabled to follow time-varying hidden parameters and it captured causal relationships among signals. The method was also applied to real fMRI data, acquired in presence of periodic tactile or visual stimulations, in different sessions. On these data, the PF estimates were consistent with current knowledge on brain functioning. Most importantly, the approach enabled to detect statistically significant modulations in the cause-effect relationship between brain areas, which correlated with the underlying visual stimulation pattern presented during the acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Injection of effector proteins to block host innate immune signalling is a common strategy used by many pathogenic organisms to establish an infection. Pathogenic Yersinia species for example inject the acetyltransferase YopJ into target cells to inhibit NF-{kappa}B and MAPK signalling. To counteract this, detection of YopJ activity in myeloid cells promotes the assembly of a RIPK1-caspase-8 death-inducing platform that confers antibacterial defence. While recent studies revealed that caspase-8 cleaves the pore-forming protein, gasdermin D (GSDMD) to trigger pyroptosis in macrophages, whether RIPK1 activates additional substrates downstream of caspase-8 to promote host defence is unclear. Here, we report that the related gasdermin family member gasdermin E (GSDME) is activated upon detection of YopJ activity in a RIPK1 kinase-dependent manner. Specifically, GSDME promotes neutrophil pyroptosis and IL-1{beta} release, which is critical for anti-Yersinia defence. During in vivo infection, IL-1{beta} neutralisation increases bacterial burden in wild type but not Gsdme-deficient mice. Thus, our study establishes GSDME as an important mediator that counteracts pathogen blockade of innate immune signalling.",

Arboviruses are able to coexist with its arthropod vectors by coordinating the PCD immunity, but the regulatory mechanism involved is largely unknown. We found that the coat protein (CP) of an insect-borne plant virus TYLCV directly interacted with a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) of its insect vector whitefly to negatively influence the MAPK signaling cascade. As a result, the apoptosis was activated in whitefly which increased viral loading. Simultaneously, the PEBP4-CP interaction liberated ATG8, the hallmark of autophagy initiation, and eliminates arbovirus. Furthermore, apoptosis-promoted virus loading was compromised by agonist-induced autophagy, but autophagy-associated suppression on virus loading was unaffected by apoptosis agonist or inhibitor, suggesting that virus loading was predominantly determined by autophagy rather than by apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that maintaining a mild immune response by coordinating apoptosis and autophagy processes presumably could facilitate coexistence of the arbovirus and its insect vector. Taken together, immune homeostasis shaped by two types of PCD may facilitate the arbovirus preservation within the insect vector.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/427364v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a1e3baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6ddc26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@906b04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@161db14_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIInteraction between whitefly PEBP4 and TYLCV CP suppresses phosphorylation of MAPK cascade, activating apoptosis\nC_LIO_LITYLCV CP liberates PEBP4-bound ATG8, resulting in lipidation of ATG8 and initiation of autophagy.\nC_LIO_LIPEBP4 balances apoptosis and autophagy in viruliferous whitefly to optimize virus loading without obvious fitness cost.\nC_LI",

Here, we showed that sporozoite circumsporozoite protein (CSP) translocated from the parasitophorous vacuole into the hepatocyte cytoplasm significantly inhibited the killing of exo-erythrocytic forms (EEFs) by interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}). Attenuation of IFN-{gamma}-mediated killing of EEFs by CSP was dependent on its ability to reduce the levels of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) in hepatocytes. The ATGs downregulation occurred through its enhanced ubiquitination mediated by E3 ligase NEDD4, an enzyme that was upregulated by CSP when it translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of hepatocytes via its nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain. Thus, we have revealed an unrecognized role of CSP in subverting host innate immunity and shed new light for a prophylaxis strategy against liver-stage infection.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative pathogen that has emerged as one of the most troublesome pathogens for health care institutions globally. Bacterial quorum sensing (QS) is a process of cell-to-cell communication that relies on the production, secretion and detection of autoinducer (AI) signals to share information about cell density and regulate gene expression accordingly. In this study, we performed a comprehensive set of experiments show that deletion of quorum sensing genes showed differences in growth characteristics, morphology, biofilm formation and virulence, and increased susceptibility to some antimicrobials and exhibited motility defects. RNA-seq analysis indicated that genes involved in various aspects of energy production and conversion, Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation and lipid transport and metabolism showed different expression.\n\nIMPORTANCEPrevious studies on bacterial quorum sensing mainly focused on biofilm formation and motility and antibiotic resistance. In this study, we focused on detecting the role of the abaI/abaR QS system in the virulence of A. baumannii. Our work provides a new insight into abaI/abaR quorum sensing system effects pathogenicity in A. baumannii. We propose that targeting the AHL synthase enzyme abaI could provide an effective strategy for attenuating virulence. On the contrary, interdicting the autoinducer synthase-receptor abaR elicits unpredictable consequences, which may lead to enhanced bacterial virulence.",

    "abstract": "Methylation of cytosine in DNA at position C5 increases the rate of C[-&gt;]T mutations in bacteria and eukaryotes. Methylation at the N4 position, employed by some restriction-modification systems, is not known to increase the mutation rate. Here I report that a Salmonella enterica Type III restriction-modification system that includes a cytosine-N4 methyltransferase causes an enormous increase in the rate of mutation of the methylated cytosines, which occur at the overlined C in the motif [Formula]. Mutations consist mainly of C[-&gt;]A transversions, the rate of which is increased ~500-fold by the restriction-modification system. The rate of C[-&gt;]T transitions is also increased, and somewhat exceeds that at C5-methylated cytosines in Dcm sites. Two other Salmonella N4 methyltransferases investigated do not have such dramatic effects, although in one case there is a modest increase in C[-&gt;]A mutations along with an increase in C[-&gt;]T mutations. Sensitivity of the C[-&gt;]A rate to orientation with respect to both DNA replication and transcription is higher at hypermutable sites than at other cytosines, suggesting a fundamental mechanistic difference between hypermutation and ordinary mutation.\n\nIMPORTANCEMutation produces the raw material for adaptive evolution, but also imposes a burden because most mutations are deleterious. The rate of mutation at a particular site is affected by a variety of factors. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, methylation of C at the C5 position, a naturally-occurring DNA modification, greatly increases the rate of C[-&gt;]T mutation. A distinct C modification that occurs in prokaryotes, methylation at N4, is not known to increase mutation rate. Here I report that a bacterial restriction-modification system, found in some Salmonella, increases the rate of C[-&gt;]A mutation by a factor of 500 at sites that it methylates at N4. This rate increase is much greater than that caused by C5 methylation. Although fewer than one in 1600 positions analyzed are methylation sites, over 10% of all mutations occur at these sites. Like other examples of extremely high mutation rate, whether naturally-occurring or the result of laboratory mutation, this phenomenon may shed light on the mechanism of mutation in general.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination is expected to increase natural selection efficacy by decoupling the fate of beneficial and deleterious mutations and by readily creating new combinations of beneficial alleles. Here, we investigate how the proportion of amino acid substitutions fixed by adaptive evolution () depends on the recombination rate in bacteria. We analyze 3086 core protein-coding sequences from 196 genomes belonging to five closely-related species of the genus Rhizobium. These genes are found in all species and do not display any signs of introgression between species. We estimate  using the site frequency spectrum (SFS) and divergence data for all pairs of species. We evaluate the impact of recombination within each species by dividing genes into three equally sized recombination classes based on their average level of intragenic linkage disequilibrium. We find that  varies from 0.07 to 0.39 across species and is positively correlated with the level of recombination. This is both due to a higher estimated rate of adaptive evolution and a lower estimated rate of non-adaptive evolution, suggesting that recombination both increases the fixation probability of advantageous variants and decreases the probability of fixation of deleterious variants. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination facilitates adaptive evolution measured by  in the core genome of prokaryote species in agreement with studies in eukaryotes.\n\nSignificance statementWhether intraspecific homologous recombination has a net beneficial or detrimental effect on adaptive evolution is largely unexplored in natural bacterial populations. We address this question by evaluating polymorphism and divergence data across the core genomes of 196 bacterial sequences--belonging to five closely related species of the genus Rhizobium. We show that the proportion of amino acid changes fixed due to adaptive evolution () increases with an increased recombination rate. This correlation is observed both in the interspecies and intraspecific comparisons. By using a population genetics approach our results demonstrate that homologous recombination directly impacts the efficacy of natural selection in the core genome of prokaryotes, as previously reported in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, as sea surface temperature increases, many coral species that used to harbor symbionts of the genus Cladocopium have become colonized with the thermally tolerant genus, Durusdinium. Here, we asked how the symbionts of one genus react to the presence of another symbiont genus within the same coral host, and what effect this interaction has on the host. We used previously published transcriptomic data from Acropora hyacinthus corals hosting Cladocopium and/or Durusdinium symbionts and looked at gene expression in all three symbiotic partners depending on the relative proportion of the two symbiont genera within the same host. We find that both Cladocopium and Durusdinium change their expression the most when their proportions within the host are nearly equal (the state that we call \"codominance\"): both genera elevate expression of photosynthesis and ribosomal genes, suggesting increase in photosynthesis and growth (i.e. higher productivity). At the same time, the coral host also elevates production of ribosomes suggesting faster cellular growth, and, when heated, shows less pronounced stress response. These results can be explained in two alternative ways. One explanation is that increased competition between codominant symbionts switches them to the higher productivity mode, which benefits the host, making it more resilient to stress. Alternatively, the symbionts elevated productivity might be not the cause but the consequence of the host being particularly healthy. Under this explanation, rapid growth of the healthy host creates new space, lowering the symbioints competition and thus promoting their growth, which allows for codominance to happen where one genus would otherwise outcompete another. The latter explanation is supported by the fact that codominance is associated with lower symbiont densities, assessed as relative proportions of symbiont reads in the data. Irrespective of the causation direction, the presence of mixed symbiont communities could potentially be used as an instant indicator of coral well-being, which would be a useful tool for coral conservation and restoration.",

    "abstract": "Epoxide hydrolases catalyze the conversion of epoxides to vicinal diols in a range of cellular processes such as signaling, detoxification, and virulence. These enzymes typically utilize a pair of tyrosine residues to orient the substrate epoxide ring in the active site and stabilize the hydrolysis intermediate. A new subclass of epoxide hydrolases that utilize a histidine in place of one of the tyrosines was established with the discovery of the CFTR Inhibitory Factor (Cif) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although the presence of such Cif-like epoxide hydrolases was predicted in other opportunistic pathogens based on sequence analyses, only Cif and its homologue aCif from Acinetobacter nosocomialis have been characterized. Here we report the biochemical and structural characteristics of Cfl1 and Cfl2, two Cif-like epoxide hydrolases from Burkholderia cenocepacia. Cfl1 is able to hydrolyze xenobiotic as well as biological epoxides that might be encountered in the environment or during infection. In contrast, Cfl2 shows very low activity against a diverse set of epoxides. The crystal structures of the two proteins reveal quaternary structures that build on the well-known dimeric assembly of the /{beta} hydrolase domain, but broaden our understanding of the structural diversity encoded in novel oligomer interfaces. Analysis of the interfaces reveals both similarities and key differences in sequence conservation between the two assemblies, and between the canonical dimer and the novel oligomer interfaces of each assembly. Finally, we discuss the effects of these higher-order assemblies on the intra-monomer flexibility of Cfl1 and Cfl2 and their possible roles in regulating enzymatic activity.",

    "abstract": "Z domains are a subfamily of winged Helix-Turn-Helix (wHTH) domains found exclusively in proteins involved in the nucleic acids sensory pathway of vertebrate innate immune system and host evasion by viral pathogens. Interestingly, they are the only known protein domains that recognise the left-handed helical conformation of both dsDNA and dsRNA, known as Z-DNA and Z-RNA. Previously, it has been demonstrated that ADAR1 and ZBP1, two proteins possessing the Z domains, localize to cytosolic stress granules. It was further speculated that such localization is principally mediated by Z domains. To characterize and better understand such distinct and specific localization, we characterised the in vivo interactions and localization pattern for the amino terminal region of human DAI harbouring two Z domains (Z{beta}DAI). Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified several interacting partners that were components of the complex formed by Z domains and RNAs. Differential interacting partners to wild-type Z, relative to mutant proteins, demonstrated that most of the physiologically relevant interactions are mediated by the nucleic acid binding ability of the Z{beta}. Further, we also show enrichment of selected complex components in cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of stress. This ability is mostly lost in the mutants of Z{beta}DAI (Z{beta}DAI 4xmut) that lack nucleic-acid binding ability. Thus, we posit that the mechanism for the translocation of Z domain-containing proteins to stress granules is mainly mediated by the nucleic acid binding ability of their Z domains. Finally, we demonstrate that FUS and PSF/p54nrb, two RNA binding proteins with established roles in stress granules, interact with Z, which provides strong evidence for a role of these proteins in the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "SUMOylation is critical for a plethora of cellular signalling pathways including the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). If misrepaired, DSBs can lead to cancer, neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency and premature ageing. Based on systematic proteome microarray screening combined with widely applicable carbene footprinting and high-resolution structural profiling, we define two non-conventional SUMO2-binding modules on XRCC4, a DNA repair protein important for DSB repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Mechanistically, interaction of SUMO2 with XRCC4 is incompatible with XRCC4 binding to at least two other NHEJ proteins - XLF and DNA ligase 4 (LIG4). These findings are consistent with SUMO2 interactions of XRCC4 acting as backup pathways at different stages of NHEJ, in the absence of these factors or their dysfunctioning. Such scenarios are not only relevant for carcinogenesis, but also for the design of precision anti-cancer medicines and the optimisation of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing. This work reveals insights into topology-specific SUMO recognition and its potential for modulating DSB repair by NHEJ. Moreover, it provides a rich resource on binary SUMO receptors that can be exploited for uncovering regulatory layers in a wide array of cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "Background & ObjectivesCA27.29 is a breast cancer-associated glycoprotein. Many genetic variations caused by non-synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are known to affect the functionality of the CA27.29 protein.\n\nMethodsIn the present manuscript, an in silico analysis of the genetic variations in CA27.29 was done to observe functional nsSNPs that possibly alter its stability. Among 2205 SNPs identified from the publically available SNP database (dbSNP), 213 (9.66%) synonymous SNPs, 24 (1.09%) non-synonymous SNPs, and 1351 (61.27%) noncoding intronic SNPs were observed. The function predictability tools SIFT, Provean and Polyphen2 were used to uncover variations in the analyzed nsSNPs and their functionality.\n\nResultsA total of 16, 20 and 10 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) were predicted to be damaging or deleterious by SIFT, Polyphen, and Provean tools respectively. Intriguingly, 9 nsSNPs were predicted to be damaging by all the three tools used while 4 nsSNPs were predicted to be damaging by SIFT and Polyphen tools. The substitutions C/G->T and G->A/T were observed to be dominant in the analyzed nsSNPs that probably have damaging role to CA27.29 glycoprotein. Moreover, the validation of results using ClinVar tool revealed that all the analyzed possibly, probably and highly damaging nsSNPs are yet to be reported and studied. Besides this, we found Global minor allele frequency (Global MAF) for only 11 nsSNPs, the values of which were observed to be <0.1% that further confirmed the novelty of the analyzed variants.\n\nInterpretation & ConclusionsAmong the analyzed nsSNPs, 3 nsSNPs rs145691584, rs148332231 and rs191544901 were found to be located in 3UTR region of CA27.29 gene that were assumed to have the possible functional roles in altering the protein stability. The present study is useful to gain useful insights into the genetic variations in nsSNPs that may playing a critical role in determining the susceptibility to breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Increasing attention is being paid to the operation of biomedical data repositories in light of efforts to improve how scientific data is handled and made available for the long term. Multiple groups have produced recommendations for functions that biomedical repositories should support, with many using requirements of the FAIR data principles as guidelines. However, FAIR is but one set of principles that has arisen out of the open science community. They are joined by principles governing open science, data citation and trustworthiness, all of which are important aspects for biomedical data repositories to support. Together, these define a framework for data repositories that we call OFCT: Open, FAIR, Citable and Trustworthy. Here we developed an instrument using the open source PolicyModels toolkit that attempts to operationalize key aspects of OFCT principles and piloted the instrument by evaluating eight biomedical community repositories listed by the NIDDK Information Network (dkNET.org). Repositories included both specialist repositories that focused on a particular data type or domain, in this case diabetes and metabolomics, and generalist repositories that accept all data types and domains. The goal of this work was both to obtain a sense of how much the design of current biomedical data repositories align with these principles and to augment the dkNET listing with additional information that may be important to investigators trying to choose a repository, e.g., does the repository fully support data citation? The evaluation was performed from March to November 2020 through inspection of documentation and interaction with the sites by the authors. Overall, although there was little explicit acknowledgement of any of the OFCT principles in our sample, the majority of repositories provided at least some support for their tenets.",

We addressed whether there are specific enteric pathways dedicated to detecting different luminal nutrients. Calcium imaging was performed on intact jejunal preparations from Wnt1-cre;R26R-GCaMP3 and Villin-cre;R26R-GCaMP3 mice which express a fluorescent calcium indicator in their ENS or intestinal epithelium, respectively. Glucose, acetate, and L-phenylalanine were perfused onto the mucosa whilst imaging underlying enteric neurons. Nutrient transport or diffusion across the mucosa was mimicked by applying nutrients onto sensory nerve endings in a villus, or onto myenteric ganglia. The nutrients perfused onto the mucosa each elicited Ca2+ transients in submucosal neurons and in distinct patterns of myenteric neurons. Notably, the neurochemical subtypes of myenteric neurons that responded differed between the nutrients, while submucosal responders were predominantly cholinergic. Nutrients applied into villi or onto ganglia did not elicit specific neuronal responses but did stimulate Ca2+ signaling in the mucosal epithelium. These data suggest that nutrients are first detected at the level of the epithelium and that the ENS is capable of discriminating between different compositions of luminal content. Furthermore, our data show that responses to mucosal stimulation are primarily in the myenteric plexus and submucosal neurons respond secondarily.",

We evaluated effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous itaconate, dimethyl-, and 4-octyl-itaconate on host responses to influenza A virus infection.

Pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1-/- than wild-type mice, and ectopic synthesis of itaconate in human epithelial cells reduced infection-induced inflammation. The compounds induced different recruitment programs in infected human macrophages, and transcriptome profiling revealed that they reversed infection-triggered interferon responses and modulated inflammation in cell lines, PBMC, and lung tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMC revealed that infection induced ACOD1 exclusively in monocytes, whereas treatment silenced IFN-responses in monocytes, lymphocytes, and NK cells. Viral replication did not increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses, but 4-octyl itaconate inhibited viral transcription in PBMC. The results reveal dramatic reprogramming of host responses by itaconate and derivatives and their potential as adjunct treatments for hyperinflammation in viral infection.",

The seven different competition experiments utilized three serial passages (three cycles of adaptation-selection of 15 days each) of a weak antibiotic-producing Streptomyces strain (wild-type) against one (biculture) or two (triculture) or three (quadriculture) target pathogens. This resulted in the evolution of a weak antibiotic-producing strain into the seven unique mutant phenotypes that acquired the ability to constitutively exhibit increased antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens. The mutant not only effectively inhibited the growth of the tested pathogens but also observed to produce antimicrobial against multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. Intriguingly, the highest antimicrobial activity was registered with the Streptomyces mutants that were adaptively evolved against the three pathogens (quadriculture competition). In contrast to the adaptively evolved mutants, a weak antimicrobial activity was detected in the un-evolved, wild-type Streptomyces. To get molecular evidence of evolution, RAPD profiles of the wild-type Streptomyces and its evolved mutants were compared that revealed significant polymorphism among them. These results demonstrated that competition-based adaptive laboratory evolution method can constitute a platform for evolutionary engineering to select improved phenotypes (mutants) with increased production of antibiotics against targeted pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Deep sediments host many archaeal lineages, including those of the Asgard superphylum that may depend on/require syntrophic partnerships. Our knowledge about sedimentary archaeal diversity and their metabolic pathways and syntrophic partners is still very limited. We present here new genomes of Helarchaeota and co-occurring sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) recovered from organic-rich sediments off Costa Rica Margin. Our molecular analyses revealed three new metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliating with Helarchaeota, each of which has three variants of the methyl-CoM reductase-like (MCR-like) complex that may enable them to oxidize short-chain alkanes anaerobically. These Helarchaeota have no multi-heme cytochromes (MHCs) but have Group 3b and Group 3c [NiFe] hydrogenases, and formate dehydrogenase, and therefore could transfer the reducing equivalents generated from alkane oxidation to external partners via the transfer of these substances. We also recovered five MAGs of SRB affiliated with the class of Desulfobacteria, two of which showed relative abundances (represented by genome coverages) positively correlated with those of the three Helarchaeota. Genome analysis suggested that these SRB bacteria have the capacity of H2 and formate utilizations and may facilitate electron transfers from other organisms by means of these reduced substances. Our findings suggest that Helarchaeota may metabolize synergistically with SRB in marine anoxic sediments, and exert an important influence on the carbon cycle by mitigating the hydrocarbon emission from sediments to the overlying ocean.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the current COVID-19 global pandemic, utilizes the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry. However, other host factors may also play major roles in viral infection. Here we report that the stress-inducible molecular chaperone GRP78 can form a complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2 intracellularly and on the cell surface, and that the substrate binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this function. Knock-down of GRP78 by siRNA dramatically reduced cell surface ACE2 expression. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159), selected for its ability to cause GRP78 endocytosis and its safe clinical profile in preclinical models, reduces cell surface ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV-2 Spike-driven viral entry, and significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Our data suggest that GRP78 is an important host auxiliary factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection and a potential target to combat this novel pathogen and other viruses that utilize GRP78.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial antibiotic resistance sets a great challenge to human health. It seems that the bacteria can spontaneously evolve resistance against any antibiotic within short time without the horizontal transfer of heterologous genes and before accumulating drug-resistant mutations. We have shown that the tRNA-mediated translational regulation counteracts the reactive oxygen species in bacteria. In this study, we demonstrated that isolated and subcultured Escherichia coli elevated its tRNAs under antibiotic stress to rapidly provide antibiotic resistance, especially at the early stage, before upregulating the efflux pump and evolving resistance mutations. The DNA recombination system repaired the antibiotic-induced DNA breakage in the genome, causing numerous structural variations. These structural variations are overrepresented near the tRNA genes, which indicated the cause of tRNA up-regulation. The strains knocking out the recombination system could not up-regulate tRNAs, and coincidently, they could hardly evolve antibiotic resistance in multiple antibiotics, respectively. With these results, we proposed a multi-stage model of bacterial antibiotic resistance in an isolated scenario: the early stage (recombination - tRNA up-regulation - translational regulation); the medium stage (up-regulation of efflux pump); the late stage (resistance mutations). These results also indicated that the bacterial DNA recombination system and tRNA could be targeted to retard the bacterial spontaneous drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Persistence is a state of bacterial dormancy where cells with low metabolic activity and growth rates are phenotypically tolerant to antibiotics and other cytotoxic substances. Given its obvious advantage to bacteria, several researchers have been looking for the genetic mechanism behind persistence. However, other authors argue that there is no such mechanism and that persistence results from inadvertent cell errors. In this case, the persistent population should decay according to a power-law with a particular exponent of -2. Studying persisters decay is, therefore, a valuable way to understand persistence. Here we simulated the fate of susceptible cells in laboratory experiments in the context of indirect resistance. Eventually, under indirect resistance, detoxifying drug-resistant cells save the persister cells that leave the dormant state and resume growth. The simulations presented here show that, by assuming a power-law decline, the exponent is close to -2, which is the expected value if persistence results from unintentional errors. Whether persisters are cells in a moribund state or, on the contrary, result from a genetic program, should impact the research of anti-persistent drugs.\n\nAuthor SummaryPersistence, a form of bacterial dormancy, was discovered in the early days of the antibiotic era. Thanks to dormancy, these cells often evade antibiotic therapy and the immune system. However, despite its clinical importance, this phenotypes nature is still under debate. Arguably, the prevailing view is that persistence is an evolved (selected for) bet-hedging mechanism to survive in the presence of cytotoxic agents such as antibiotics. In that case, the persister population should decay exponentially, although at a much slower pace than the non-persister population. A few authors recently advanced an alternative hypothesis: bacterial persistence results from many malfunctions and cell division errors. In this case, persistent populations should decay according to a power-law with exponent of -2, that is, according to 1/t2. Here we simulated the fate of susceptible bacterial cells in the presence of bactericidal antibiotics in the context of indirect resistance based on laboratory experiments performed earlier. By showing that the dynamics of persister cells is consistent with 1/t2, our results corroborate the hypothesis that the phenomenon of bacterial persistence is an accidental consequence of inadvertent cell problems and errors. If confirmed, this conclusion should impact the research strategies of anti-persistent drugs.\n\nO_QD\"The following day, no one died. This fact, being absolutely contrary to lifes rules, provoked enormous and, in the circumstances, perfectly justifiable anxiety in peoples minds, for we have only to consider that in the entire forty volumes of universal history there is no mention, not even one exemplary case, of such a phenomenon ever having occurred...\"\n\nDeath with interruptions\n\nJose Saramago (2005)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1998\n\nC_QD",

    "abstract": "An important goal for many nutrition-based microbiome studies is to identify the metabolic function of microbes in complex microbial communities and its impact on host physiology. This research can be confounded by poorly-understood effects of community composition and host diet on the metabolic traits of individual taxa. Here, we investigated these multi-way interactions by constructing and analyzing metabolic models comprising every combination of five bacterial members of the Drosophila gut microbiome (from single taxa to the five-member community of Acetobacter and Lactobacillus species) under three nutrient regimes. We show that the metabolic function of Drosophila gut bacteria is dynamic, influenced by community composition and responsive to dietary modulation. Furthermore, we show that ecological interactions such as competition and mutualism identified from the growth patterns of gut bacteria are underlain by a diversity of metabolic interactions, and show that the bacteria tend to compete for amino acids and B vitamins more frequently than for carbon sources. Our results reveal that in addition to fermentation products such as acetate, intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle including 2-oxoglutarate and succinate are produced at high flux and cross-fed between bacterial taxa suggesting important roles for TCA cycle intermediates in modulating Drosophila gut microbe interactions and the potential to influence host traits. These metabolic models provide specific predictions of the patterns of ecological and metabolic interactions among gut bacteria under different nutrient regimes, with potentially important consequences for overall community metabolic function and nutritional interactions with the host.\n\nIMPORTANCEDrosophila is an important model for microbiome research partly because of the low complexity of its mostly culturable gut microbiota. Our current understanding of how Drosophila interacts with its gut microbes and how these interactions influence host traits derives almost entirely from empirical studies that focus on individual microbial taxa or classes of metabolites. These studies have failed to capture fully the complexity of metabolic interactions that occur between host and microbe. To overcome this limitation, we reconstructed and analyzed 31 metabolic models for every combination of the five principal bacterial taxa in the gut microbiome of Drosophila. This revealed that metabolic interactions between between Drosophila gut bacterial taxa are highly dynamic and influenced by co-occurring bacteria and nutrient availability. Our results generate testable hypothesis about among-microbe ecological interactions in the Drosophila gut and the diversity of metabolites available to influence host traits.",

    "abstract": "The rational design of linear peptides that assemble controllably and predictably in water is challenging. Sequences must encode unique target structures and avoid alternative states. However, the stabilizing and discriminating non-covalent forces available are weak in water. Nonetheless, for -helical coiled-coil assemblies considerable progress has been made in rational de novo design. In these, sequence repeats of nominally hydrophobic (h) and polar (p) residues, hpphppp, direct the assembly of amphipathic helices into dimeric to tetrameric bundles. Expanding this pattern to hpphhph can produce larger -helical barrels. Here, we show that pentamers to nonamers are achieved simply by varying the residue at one of these h sites. In L/I-K-E-I-A-x-Z repeats, decreasing the size of Z from threonine to serine to alanine to glycine gives progressively larger oligomers. X-ray crystal structures of the resulting -helical barrels rationalize this: side chains at Z point directly into the helical interfaces, and smaller residues allow closer helix contacts and larger assemblies.",

    "abstract": "People with Alzheimers disease (AD) are 6-10 times more likely to develop seizures than the healthy aging population. Leading hypotheses largely consider increased excitability of local cortical tissue as primarily responsible for increased seizure prevalence in AD. However, both local dynamics and large-scale brain network structure are believed to be crucial for determining seizure likelihood and phenotype. In this study, we combine computational modelling with electrophysiological data to demonstrate a potential large-scale brain network mechanism for increased seizure propensity in people with AD. EEG was recorded from 21 people with probable AD and 26 healthy controls. At the time of EEG acquisition, all participants were free from seizures. Whole brain functional connectivity derived from source-reconstructed EEG recordings was used to build subject-specific brain network models of seizure transitions using an approach previously validated on participants with epilepsy vs controls. As cortical tissue excitability was increased in the simulations, network models of AD simulations were more likely to transition into seizures than simulations from healthy controls. Our results suggest an increased group-level probability of developing seizures at a future time for AD participants. We subsequently used the model to assess seizure propensity of different regions across the cortex. We found the most important regions for seizure generation were those typically burdened by amyloid-beta at the early stages of AD, as previously reported by in-vivo and post-mortem staging of amyloid plaques. These included cingulate, medial temporal, and orbital regions. Analysis of these spatial distributions also give potential insight into mechanisms of increased susceptibility to generalized (as opposed to focal) seizures in AD vs controls. This research suggests avenues for future studies testing patients with seizures, e.g. co-morbid AD/epilepsy patients, and comparisons with PET and MRI scans to relate regional seizure propensity with amyloid/tau pathology and cortical atrophy.\n\nAuthor summaryPeople with Alzheimers disease (AD) are more likely to develop seizures than cognitively healthy people. In this study, we aimed to understand whether whole-brain network structure is related to this increased seizure likelihood. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to estimate brain networks from people with AD and healthy controls. We subsequently inserted these networks into a model brain and simulated disease progression by increasing the excitability of brain tissue. We found the simulated AD brains were more likely to develop seizures than the simulated control brains. No participants had seizures when we collected data, so our results suggest an increased probability of developing seizures at a future time for AD participants. Therefore functional brain network structure may play a role in increased seizure likelihood in AD. We also used the model to examine which brain regions were most important for generating seizures, and found that the seizure-generating regions corresponded to those typically affected in early AD. Our results also provide a potential explanation for why people with AD are more likely to have generalized seizures (i.e. seizures involving the whole brain, as opposed to  focal seizures which only involve certain areas) than the general population with epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "There exists an intricate relationship between attention and working memory. Recent work has further established that attention and working memory fluctuate synchronously, by tightly interleaving sustained attention and working memory tasks. This work has raised many open questions about physiological signatures underlying these behavioral fluctuations. Across two experiments, we explore pupil dynamics using real-time triggering in conjunction with an interleaved sustained attention and working memory task. In Experiment 1, we use behavioral real-time triggering and replicate recent findings from our lab (deBettencourt et al., 2019) that sustained attention fluctuates concurrently with the number of items maintained in working memory. Furthermore, highly attentive moments, detected via behavior, also exhibited larger pupil sizes. In Experiment 2, we develop a novel real-time pupil triggering technique to track pupil size fluctuations in real time and trigger working memory probes. We reveal that this pupil triggering procedure elicits differences in sustained attention, as indexed by response time. These experiments reflect methodological advances in real-time triggering and further characterize an important biomarker of sustained attention.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, modulate the host immune system to evade clearance and promote long-term persistence, resulting in disease progression or latent infection. Understanding the mechanisms pathogenic mycobacteria use to escape elimination by the host immune system is critical to better understanding the molecular mechanisms of mycobacterial infection. Protein kinase G (PknG) in pathogenic mycobacteria has been shown to play an important role in avoiding clearance by macrophages through blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion; however, the exact mechanism is not completely understood. Here, to further investigate the role of mycobacterial PknG during early events of macrophage infection, RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines were infected with M. bovis BCG wild-type and PknG knock-out mutant strains. After proteolysis, phosphopeptides were enriched via TiO2 columns and subjected to LC-MS/MS to identify differentially phosphorylated peptides between the wild-type and PknG mutant infected macrophages. A total of 1401 phosphosites on 914 unique proteins were identified. Following phosphoproteome normalisation and differential expression analysis, a total of 149 phosphosites were differentially phosphorylated in the wild-type infected RAW 264.7 macrophages versus the PknG knock-out mutant. A subset of 95 phosphosites was differentially up-regulated in the presence of PknG. Functional analysis of our data revealed that PknG kinase activity reprograms normal macrophage function through interfering with host cytoskeletal organisation, spliceosomal machinery, translational initiation, and programmed cell death. Differentially phosphorylated proteins in this study serve as a foundation for further validation and PknG host substrate assignment.\n\nImportanceTuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death from infection worldwide, due to the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to survive and replicate within the host, establishing reservoirs of live bacteria that promote persistence and recurrence of disease. Understanding the mechanisms that Mtb uses to evade the host immune system is thus a major goal in the TB field. Protein kinase G is thought to play an important role in Mtb avoiding clearance by the host through disruption of macrophage function, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this are not well understood. Here, our new phosphoproteomic data reveals that mycobacterial PknG substantially reprograms normal macrophage function through extensive PknG-mediated post-translational control of critical host cellular processes. These novel findings therefore considerably increase our knowledge of mycobacterial pathogenicity, including specific host cellular pathways that might be re-activatable through host-directed therapy, thereby restoring macrophage ability to eliminate Mtb.",

These natural products cover a wide range of chemical classes (e.g., aminoglycosides, lantibiotics, nonribosomal peptides, oligosaccharides, polyketides, terpenes) that are highly valuable for industrial and medical applications1. Metagenomics, as a culture-independent approach, has greatly enhanced our ability to survey the functional potential of microorganisms and is growing in popularity for the mining of BGCs. However, to effectively exploit metagenomic data to this end, it will be crucial to more efficiently identify these genomic elements in highly complex and ever-increasing volumes of data2.

We show the advantages of BiG-MEx compared to standard BGC-mining approaches, and use it to explore the BGC domain and class composition of samples in the TARA Oceans3 and Human Microbiome Project datasets4.

There are increasing concerns that MAP is zoonotic. The prevalence of Johnes disease is increasing worldwide. In an attempt to control an epidemic of ovine Johnes disease (OJD) in New South Wales (NSW), a government/industry sponsored voluntary vaccination/on-farm management program commenced in 2000. We report herein an observational study of changes in disease prevalence as vaccination progressed, based on abattoir surveillance data for OJD from 1999 to 2009. We also discuss the epidemiological, policy, regulatory, research, economic and sociological elements that contributed to the development of a mature control program, whose aim was to halt the epidemic spread of OJD in a naive sheep population.\n\nMethodsNSW was divided into areas of \"High\" (HPA), \"Medium\" (MPA) and \"Low\" (LPA) OJD prevalence. A killed whole cell vaccine (Gudair(R)) was administered to sheep from 2000 to 2009. Trained examiners evaluated the viscera of adult sheep carcasses at slaughter for gross evidence of OJD. MAP infection was confirmed by histopathology.\n\nPrincipal findingsFrom 2000-2009, 12 million vaccine doses were administered in NSW (91%; 10.9 million in the HPA). Many of the vaccinated flocks were suffering > 5% annual mortality in adult sheep, with some individual flocks with 10-15% losses attributable to OJD. A total of 7.6 million carcasses were examined (38%; 2.9 million from the HPA). Overall, 16% of slaughter consignments (sheep consigned to the abattoir from a single vendor) were positive for OJD, of which 94% were from the HPA. In the HPA, the percentage of animals with lesions attributable to OJD at slaughter fell progressively from 2.4% (10,406/432,860) at commencement of vaccination in 2000 to 0.8% (1,573/189,564) by 2009. Herd immunity from vaccination in the HPA was estimated at 70% by 2009.

    "abstract": "It is challenging to associate features such as human health outcomes, diet, environmental conditions, or other metadata to microbial community measurements, due in part to their quantitative properties. Microbiome multi-omics are typically noisy, sparse (zero-inflated), high-dimensional, extremely non-normal, and often in the form of count or compositional measurements. Here we introduce an optimized combination of novel and established methodology to assess multivariable association of microbial community features with complex metadata in population-scale observational studies. Our approach, MaAsLin 2 (Microbiome Multivariable Associations with Linear Models), uses general linear models to accommodate a wide variety of modern epidemiological studies, including cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as a variety of data types (e.g. counts and relative abundances) with or without covariates and repeated measurements. To construct this method, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of a broad range of scenarios under which straightforward identification of meta-omics associations can be challenging. These simulation studies reveal that MaAsLin 2s linear model preserves statistical power in the presence of repeated measures and multiple covariates, while accounting for the nuances of meta-omics features and controlling false discovery. We also applied MaAsLin 2 to a microbial multi-omics dataset from the Integrative Human Microbiome (HMP2) project which, in addition to reproducing established results, revealed a unique, integrated landscape of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) across multiple time points and omics profiles.",

    "abstract": "Robustness and plasticity are essential features that allow biological systems to cope with complex and variable environments. Through the evolution of a given environment, the former, the insensitivity of phenotypes, is expected to increase, whereas the latter, the changeability of phenotypes, tends to diminish. However, in nature, plasticity is preserved to a certain degree. One possible cause for this is environmental variation, with one of the most important \"environmental \" factors being inter-species interactions. As a first step toward investigating phenotypic plasticity in response to an ecological interaction, we present the study of a simple two-species system consisting of hosts and parasites. Hosts are expected to evolve to achieve a phenotype that optimizes fitness and increases the robustness of the corresponding phenotype by reducing phenotypic fluctuations. Conversely, plasticity evolves in order to avoid certain phenotypes being attacked by parasites. By simulating evolution using the host gene-expression dynamics model, we analyze the evolution of genotype-phenotype mapping. If the interaction is weak, the fittest phenotype of the host evolves to reduce phenotypic variances. In contrast, if a sufficient degree of interaction occurs, the phenotypic variances of hosts increase to escape parasite attacks. For the latter case, we found two strategies: if the noise in the stochastic gene expression is below a certain threshold, the phenotypic variance increases via genetic diversification, whereas above the threshold, it is increased due to noise-induced phenotypic plasticity. We examine how the increase in the phenotypic variances due to parasite interactions influences the growth rate of a single host, and observed a trade-off between the two. Our results help elucidate the roles played by noise and genetic mutations in the evolution of phenotypic plasticity and robustness in response to host-parasite interactions.\n\nAuthor summaryPlasticity and phenotypic variability induced by internal or external perturbations are common features of biological systems. However, certain environmental conditions initiate evolution to increase fitness and, in such cases, phenotypic variability is not advantageous, as has been demonstrated by previous laboratory and computer experiments. As a possible origin for such plasticity, we investigated the role of host-parasite interactions, such as those between bacteria and phages. Different parasite types attack hosts of certain phenotypes. Through numerical simulations of the evolution of host genotype-phenotype mapping, we found that, if the interaction is sufficiently strong, hosts increase phenotypic plasticity by increasing phenotypic fluctuations. Depending on the degree of noise in gene expression dynamics, there are two distinct strategies for increasing the phenotypic variances: via stochasticity in gene expression or via genetic variances. The former strategy, which can work over a faster time scale, leads to a decline in fitness, whereas the latter reduces the robustness of the fitted state. Our results provide insights into how phenotypic variances are preserved and how hosts can escape being attacked by parasites whose genes mutate to adapt to changes in parasites. These two host strategies, which depend on internal and external conditions, can be verified experimentally, for example, via the transcriptome analysis of microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "According to experts and medical literature, a healthy thyroid gland, or a thyroid containing benign nodules, tend to be less inflamed and less active than one with malignant nodules. It seems to be a consensus that malignant nodules have more blood veins and it may be related to the maintenance of high and constant temperatures. Investigation of these characteristics, detectable by infrared sensors, and answering if they constitute patterns of malignancy are the aims of this work. Experiments considering biological heat transfer analysis by Finite Element numerical simulations are used to show the influence of nodule and patient characteristics on the identification of malignancy of thyroid nodule by thermography. The used and approved protocol for infrared examination are analyzed and simulated during all its phase that is on transient and steady state behavior, in order to verify how and when their influence can be really recognized in patients. Simulation results and the analysis of infrared exams show that the tissues between the skin and the thyroid, as well as the nodule size, have influence in superficial temperatures. Other thermal parameters of thyroid nodules are also investigated and show little influence on surface temperatures. These characteristics must be considered in nodular infrared analysis and diagnosis by thermography. The infrared examinations of patients that meet the hypotheses related to the vascularization of the nodule confirm the numerical results. All details of the physical parameters used in the simulations, characteristics of the nodules, and their complete thermal examinations are public and available, turning possible that the presented simulation could be compared with other types of heat transfer solutions. This study is a concrete contribution to the answer of under what conditions thermography can be useful in the identification of thyroid nodules.\n\nAuthor summaryThyroid nodules are very common health problems. These nodules may have different characteristics, and some of them could influence the temperature of the region. Many works in the medical literature report that the healthy thyroid and even benign nodules tend to be less inflamed and active than malignant nodules and therefore should exhibit some variation in patterns of behavior related to the temperature variation between them. The focus of this work is to analyze some parameters of the nodules and details of the patients that can influence the identification and diagnosis of thyroid nodules by infrared images. To reach the objective, simulations of bioheat transfer in the neck (using a simple neck geometry and Finite Elements Analysis in COMSOL Multiphysics Software) and real infrared examinations (performed with a FLIR Infrared Camera model SC620 and a proposed protocol) were analyzed. Our results show the thermal insulation effect of the neck fat tissue, and that the effect of nodule sizes can be decremented by a thicker layer of fat. The analysis of the nodule parameters as blood perfusion rate and metabolic heat, which could be related with the nodule vascularization (an important condition related with malignancy), suggest that the thermal effects of thyroid nodules on the neck surface are not sufficient to differentiate benign from malign, and for this other features or methods must be considered.",

    "abstract": "Sharks (Selachimorpha) are iconic marine predators that have survived multiple mass extinctions over geologic time. Their fossil record is represented by an abundance of teeth, which traditionally formed the basis for reconstructing large-scale diversity changes among different selachimorph clades. By contrast, corresponding patterns in shark ecology, as measured through morphological disparity, have received comparatively limited analytical attention. Here, we use a geometric morphometric approach to comprehensively examine the dental morphology of multiple shark lineages traversing the catastrophic end-Cretaceous mass extinction -- this event terminated the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago. Our results show that selachimorphs maintained virtually static levels of dental disparity in most of their constituent clades during the Cretaceous/Paleogene transition. Nevertheless, selective extinctions did impact on apex predator lineages characterized by triangular blade-like teeth, and in particular, lamniforms including the dominant Cretaceous anacoracids. Other groups, such as, triakid carcharhiniforms, squalids, and hexanchids, were seemingly unaffected. Finally, while some lamniform lineages experienced morphological depletion, others underwent a post-extinction disparity increase, especially odontaspidids, which are typified by narrow-cusped teeth adapted for feeding on fishes. This disparity shift coincides with the early Paleogene radiation of teleosts, a possible prey source, as well as the geographic relocation of shark disparity  hotspots, perhaps indicating a regionally disjunct pattern of extinction recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals a complex morphological response to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, the dynamics of which we are only just beginning to understand.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is not known. Alterations in gut microbiome, mucosal barrier function, immune cell activation, and blood flow are characterized events in its development, with stress as a contributing factor. The hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a key mediator of stress responses and influences these aforementioned processes. CRF signaling is modulated by NECs main risk factors of prematurity and formula feeding. Using an established neonatal rat model of NEC, we tested hypotheses that: (i) increased CRF levels--as seen during stress--promote NEC in formula-fed newborn rats, and (ii) antagonism of CRF action ameliorates NEC. Newborn pups were formula-fed to initiate gut inflammation and randomized to: no stress, no stress with subcutaneous CRF administration, stress (acute hypoxia followed by cold exposure--NEC model), or stress after pretreatment with the CRF peptide antagonist Astressin. Dam-fed unstressed and stressed littermates served as controls. NEC incidence and severity in the terminal ileum were determined using a histologic scoring system. Changes in CRF, CRF receptor (CRFRs), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression levels were determined by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, respectively. Stress exposure in FF neonates resulted in 40.0% NEC incidence, whereas exogenous CRF administration resulted in 51.7% NEC incidence compared to 8.7% in FF non-stressed neonates (p<0.001). Astressin prevented development of NEC in FF-stressed neonates (7.7% vs. 40.0%; p=0.003). CRF and CRFR immunoreactivity increased in the ileum of neonates with NEC compared to dam-fed controls or FF unstressed pups. Immunoblotting confirmed increased TLR4 protein levels in FF stressed (NEC model) animals vs. controls, and Astressin treatment restored TLR4 to control levels. Peripheral CRF may serve as specific pharmacologic target for the prevention and treatment of NEC.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, is a significant cause of human infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Phenotypic plasticity between two morphological phenotypes, yeast and hyphae, is a key mechanism by which C. albicans can thrive in many microenvironments and cause disease in the host. Understanding the decision points and key driver genes controlling this important transition, and how these genes respond to different environmental signals is critical to understanding how C. albicans causes infections in the host. Here we build and analyze a Boolean dynamical model of the C. albicans yeast to hyphal transition, integrating multiple environmental factors and regulatory mechanisms. We validate the model by a systematic comparison to prior experiments, which led to agreement in 18 out of 22 cases. The discrepancies motivate alternative hypotheses that are testable by follow-up experiments. Analysis of this model revealed two time-constrained windows of opportunity that must be met for the complete transition from the yeast to hyphal phenotype, as well as control strategies that can robustly prevent this transition. We experimentally validate two of these control predictions in C. albicans strains lacking the transcription factor UME6 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, respectively. This model will serve as a strong base from which to develop a systems biology understanding of C. albicans morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Chloride intracellular channels (CLICs) are a unique family of evolutionarily conserved metamorphic proteins, switching between stable conformations based on redox conditions. CLICs have been implicated in a wide variety biological processes including ion channel activity, apoptosis, membrane trafficking, and enzymatic oxidoreductase activity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which CLICs engage in these activities is an area of active research. Here, the sole Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, Clic, was targeted for RNAi knockdown to identify genes and biological processes associated with Clic expression. Clic knockdown had a substantial impact on global transcription, altering expression of over 9% of transcribed Drosophila genes. Overrepresentation analysis of differentially expressed genes identified enrichment of 23 Gene Ontology terms including Cytoplasmic Translation, Oxidation-Reduction Process, Heme Binding, Membrane, Cell Junction, and Nucleolus. The top term, Cytoplasmic Translation, was enriched almost exclusively with downregulated genes. Drosophila Clic and vertebrate ortholog Clic4 have previously been tied to ethanol sensitivity and ethanol-regulated expression. Clic knockdown-responsive genes from the present study were found to overlap significantly with gene sets from 4 independently published studies related to ethanol exposure and sensitivity in Drosophila. Bioinformatic analysis of genes shared between these studies revealed an enrichment of genes related to amino acid metabolism, protein processing, oxidation-reduction processes, and lipid particles among others. To determine whether the modulation of ethanol sensitivity by Clic may be related to co-regulated oxidation-reduction processes, we evaluated the effect of hyperoxia on ethanol sedation in Clic knockdown flies. Consistent with previous findings, Clic knockdown reduced acute ethanol sedation sensitivity in flies housed under nomoxia. However, this effect was reversed by exposure to hyperoxia, suggesting a common set of molecular-genetic mechanism may modulate each of these processes. This study suggests that Drosophila Clic has a major influence on regulation of oxidative stress signaling and that this function overlaps with the molecular mechanisms of acute ethanol sensitivity in the fly.",

However, the precise requirements of NPHP1 in photoreceptors are not well understood. Here, we characterize retinal degeneration in a mouse model of NPHP1 and show that NPHP1 is required to prevent infiltration of inner segment plasma membrane proteins into the outer segment during the photoreceptor maturation. We demonstrate that Nphp1 gene-trap mutant mice, which were previously described as null, are in fact hypomorphs due to the production of a small quantity of functional mRNAs derived from nonsense-associated altered splicing and skipping of two exons including the one harboring the gene-trap. In homozygous mutant animals, inner segment plasma membrane proteins such as syntaxin-3 (STX3), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), and interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2 (IMPG2) accumulate in the outer segment when outer segments are actively elongating. This phenotype, however, is spontaneously ameliorated after the outer segment elongation is completed. Retinal degeneration also occurs temporarily during the photoreceptor maturation but stops afterward. We further show that Nphp1 genetically interacts with Cep290, another NPHP gene, and that a reduction of Cep290 gene dose results in retinal degeneration that continues until adulthood in Nphp1 mutant mice. These findings demonstrate that NPHP1 is required for the confinement of inner segment plasma membrane proteins during the outer segment development, but its requirement diminishes as photoreceptors mature. Our study also suggests that additional mutations in other NPHP genes may influence the penetrance of retinopathy in human NPHP1 patients.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) genomes comprise eight negative strand RNAs packaged into virions in the form of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Rab11a plays a crucial role in the transport of vRNPs from the nucleus to the plasma membrane via microtubules, allowing assembly and virus production. Here, we identify a novel function for Rab11a in the inter-cellular transport of IAV vRNPs using tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) as molecular highways. TNTs are F-Actin rich tubules that link the cytoplasm of nearby cells. In IAV-infected cells, Rab11a was visualized together with vRNPs in these actin-rich intercellular connections. To better examine viral spread via TNTs, we devised an infection system in which conventional, virion-mediated, spread was not possible. Namely, we generated HA-deficient reporter viruses which are unable to produce progeny virions but whose genomes can be replicated and trafficked. In this system, vRNP transfer to neighboring cells was observed and this transfer was found to be dependent on both actin and Rab11a. Generation of infectious virus via TNT transfer was confirmed using donor cells infected with HA-deficient virus and recipient cells stably expressing HA protein. Mixing donor cells infected with genetically distinct IAVs furthermore revealed the potential for Rab11a and TNTs to serve as a conduit for genome mixing and reassortment in IAV infections. These data therefore reveal a novel role for Rab11a in the IAV life cycle, which could have significant implications for within-host spread, genome reassortment and immune evasion.\n\nAuthor SummaryInfluenza A viruses infect epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans. Infection is propagated by the generation of viral particles from infected cells, which disseminate within the tissue. Disseminating particles can encounter obstacles in the extracellular environment, including mucus, ciliary movement, antibody neutralization and uptake by phagocytic immune cells. An alternative mode of spread, which avoids these hazards, involves direct transport of viral components between cells. This cell-cell spread of infection is not a well understood process. In this study we demonstrate that the host factor Rab11a mediates the transport of viral genomes in the cell-cell spread of infection. Rab11a is already known to play a pro-viral role in the transport of viral genomes to the plasma membrane for assembly into virus particles. Here, we see that this same transport mechanism is co-opted for direct cell-cell spread through cellular connections called tunneling nanotubes. We show that complexes of Rab11a and viral components can be trafficked across tunneling nanotubes, transmitting infection without the formation of virus particles. Importantly, this route of spread often seeds viral genomes from multiple donor cells into recipient cells, which in turn increases viral genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "We studied the phylogeny of Ulex L., a genus of spiny legumes, which its center of diversity in the Iberian Peninsula, using ribosomal DNA markers (rDNA), namely ETS, 5.8S and ITS (45S), and 5S intergenic spacer regions. One of the main findings was the presence of very different haplotypes in 5S-IGS genes and, to a less extent, in ETS and ITS, in seven polyploid taxa. We interpreted these results as an indication of hybrid origins and proposed allopolyploidy for U. argenteus ssp. subsericeus, U. australis ssp. australis, U. australis ssp. welwitschianus, U. densus, U. europaeus ssp. europaeus, U. europaeus ssp. latebracteatus, and U. jussiaei. These results reinforce an early hypothesis which stated that the radiation of Ulex occurred mainly by polyplodization.\n\nPhylograms showed two main clades, one grouping the hydrophilic U. gallii, U. breoganii and U. minor, and the other grouping the southern, xerophytic, taxa. The putative allopolyploids showed haplotypes, which grouped in both clades, indicating that allopolyploidy, occurred through hybridization from these hydrophilic and xerophytic lineages.\n\nThe phylogenetic position of U. micranthus is not certain and it is discussed. The 5S-IGS showed to retain more polymorphisms than ETS gene or ITS markers. This result is compatible with the hypothesis that 5S rDNA region is less vulnerable to inter-loci concerted evolution than 45S, providing a more suitable marker for reconstructing histories of allopolyploid species. We discuss the taxonomic consequences of these results.",

    "abstract": "While blood transfusion is an essential cornerstone of hematological care, patients that require repetitive transfusion remain at persistent risk of alloimmunization due to the diversity of human blood group polymorphisms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an effective means of identifying genotypic and phenotypic variations among the blood groups, while the accurate interpretation of such NGS data is currently hampered by a lack of accessibility to bioinformatics support. To address this unmet need, we have developed the RBCeq (https://www.rbceq.org/) platform, which consists of a novel bioinformatics algorithm coupled with a user-friendly web server capable of comprehensively delineating different blood group variants from genomics data with advanced visualization of results. The software profiles genomic data for 36 blood group systems, including two transcription factors and can identify small genetic alterations, including small indels and copy number variants. The RBCeq algorithm was validated on 403 samples which include 58 complex serology cases from Australian Red Cross LifeBlood, 100 samples from The MedSeq Project (phs000958) and a further 245 from Indigenous Australian participants. The final blood typing data from RBCeq was 99.83% concordant for 403 samples (85 different antigens in 21 blood group systems) with that listed from the International Society for Blood Transfusion database.",

    "abstract": "Microbial nitrification is a critical process governing nitrogen availability in aquatic systems. Freshwater nitrifiers have received little attention, leaving many unanswered questions about their taxonomic distribution, functional potential, and ecological interactions. Here, we reconstructed genomes to infer the metabolism and ecology of free-living picoplanktonic nitrifiers across the Laurentian Great Lakes, a connected series of five of Earths largest lakes. Surprisingly, ammonia oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) related to Nitrosospira dominated over ammonia oxidizing Archaea (AOA) at nearly all stations, with distinct ecotypes prevailing in the transparent, oligotrophic upper lakes compared to Lakes Erie and Ontario. Unexpectedly, one ecotype of Nitrosospira encodes proteorhodopsin, which could enhance survival in conditions where ammonia oxidation is inhibited or substrate limited. Nitrite oxidizing Bacteria (NOB) Ca. Nitrotoga and Nitrospira fluctuated in dominance, with the latter prevailing in deeper, less productive basins. Genome reconstructions reveal highly reduced genomes and features consistent with genome streamlining, along with diverse adaptations to sunlight and oxidative stress and widespread capacity for organic nitrogen use. Our findings expand the known functional diversity of nitrifiers and establish their ecological genomics in large lake ecosystems. By elucidating links between microbial biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, our work also informs ecosystem models of the Laurentian Great Lakes, a critical freshwater resource experiencing rapid environmental change.\n\nImportanceMicroorganisms play critical roles in Earths nitrogen cycle. In lakes, microorganisms called nitrifiers derive energy from reduced nitrogen compounds. In doing so, they transform nitrogen into a form that can ultimately be lost to the atmosphere by a process called denitrification, which helps mitigate nitrogen pollution from fertilizer runoff and sewage. Despite their importance, freshwater nitrifiers are virtually unexplored. To understand their diversity and function, we reconstructed genomes of freshwater nitrifiers across some of Earths largest freshwater lakes, the Laurentian Great Lakes. We discovered several new species of nitrifiers specialized for clear low nutrient waters, and distinct species in comparatively turbid Lake Erie. Surprisingly, one species may be able to harness light energy using a protein called proteorhodopsin, despite the fact that nitrifiers typically live in deep dark water. Our work reveals unique biodiversity of the Great Lakes and fills key gaps in our knowledge of an important microbial group, the nitrifiers.",

Here, we propose to study the adaptive architecture of traits by monitoring the evolution of their phenotypic variance during adaptation to a new environment in well-defined laboratory conditions. Extensive computer simulations show that the evolution of phenotypic variance in a replicated experimental evolution setting provides power to distinguish between oligogenic and polygenic adaptive architectures. We compared gene expression variance in male Drosophila simulans before and after 100 generations of adaptation to a novel hot environment. The variance change in gene expression was indistinguishable for genes with and without a significant change in mean expression after 100 generations of evolution. We suggest that a majority of adaptive gene expression evolution can be explained by a polygenic architecture. We propose that tracking the evolution of phenotypic variance across generations can provide an approach to characterize the adaptive architecture.",

    "abstract": "PurposeIn large clinical centers a small subset of patients present with hydrocephalus that requires surgical treatment. We aimed to develop a screening tool to detect such cases from the head MRI with performance comparable to neuroradiologists.\n\nMethodsWe leveraged 496 clinical MRI exams collected retrospectively at a single clinical site from patients referred for any reason. This diagnostic dataset was enriched to have 259 hydrocephalus cases. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on 16 manually segmented exams (ten hydrocephalus) and subsequently used to automatically segment the remaining 480 exams and extract volumetric anatomical features. A linear classifier of these features was trained on 240 exams to detect cases of hydrocephalus that required treatment with surgical intervention. Performance was compared to four neuroradiologists on the remaining 240 exams. Performance was also evaluated on a separate screening dataset of 451 exams collected from a routine clinical population to predict the consensus reading from four neuroradiologists using images alone. The pipeline was also tested on an external dataset of 31 exams from a 2nd clinical site.\n\nResultsThe most discriminant features were the Magnetic Resonance Hydrocephalic Index (MRHI), ventricle volume, and the ratio between ventricle and brain volume. At matching sensitivity, the specificity of the machine and the neuroradiologists did not show significant differences for detection of hydrocephalus on either dataset (proportions test, p > 0.05). ROC performance compared favorably with the state-of-the-art (AUC 0.90-0.96), and replicated in the external validation.\n\nConclusionHydrocephalus cases requiring treatment can be detected automatically from MRI in a heterogeneous patient population based on quantitative characterization of brain anatomy with performance comparable to that of neuroradiologists.",

Here, we have explored the capacity of the CometChip platform for parallel analysis of multiple DNA repair activities. Taking advantage of the versatility of the traditional comet assay and leveraging micropatterning techniques, the CometChip platform offers increased throughput and sensitivity compared to the traditional comet assay. By exposing cells to DNA damaging agents that create substrates of Base Excision Repair, Nucleotide Excision Repair, and Non-Homologous End Joining, we show that the CometChip is an effective method for assessing repair deficiencies in all three pathways.

To determine whether glial transcriptional states are shared across phases of degeneration, we sequenced 50,498 nuclei from the retinas of seven AMD patients and six healthy controls, generating the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of AMD. We identified groupings of cells implicated in disease pathogenesis by applying a novel topologically-inspired machine learning approach called  diffusion condensation. By calculating diffusion homology features and performing persistence analysis, diffusion condensation identified activated glial states enriched in the early phases of AMD, AD, and MS as well as an AMD-specific proangiogenic astrocyte state promoting pathogenic neovascularization in advanced AMD. Finally, by mapping the expression of disease-associated genes to glial states, we identified key signaling interactions creating hypotheses for therapeutic intervention. Our topological analysis identified an integrated disease-phase specific glial landscape that is shared across neurodegenerative conditions affecting the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are two of the most common mental health disorders, often sharing symptoms and administrations. Most pharmacological agents available to treat these disorders target monoamine systems. Currently, finding the most effective treatment for an individual is a process of trial and error. Therefore, to better understand how disease etiology may predict treatment response, we studied mice exposed developmentally to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (FLX). These mice show the murine equivalent of anxiety- and depression-like symptoms in adulthood and here we report that these mice are also behaviorally resistant to the antidepressant-like effects of adult SSRI administration. We investigated whether tianeptine (TIA), which exerts its therapeutic effects through the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) instead of directly targeting monoaminergic systems, would be more effective in this model.\n\nWe injected C57BL/6J (C57) pups with either FLX (10 mg/kg, i.p) or vehicle from postnatal (PN) day 2 to 11, a period in which mouse brain development parallels that of the third trimester of a human pregnancy. Prior work established that adult 129SvEv (129) mice exposed to FLX in this time period (PN-FLX) showed increased avoidant and decreased hedonic behaviors, which correspond to anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms in humans, respectively. We performed baseline testing in adulthood in C57 PN-FLX animals and confirmed a similar avoidant phenotype to that reported in 129 PN-FLX mice. We then treated these animals with chronic FLX (18 mg/kg in the drinking water) and evaluated effects on two tasks that measure avoidant behavior - the open field and novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) tasks. This administration failed to improve, and even exacerbated, avoidance symptoms in PN-FLX mice. The same animals then underwent chronic administration with TIA (30 mg/kg, 2x/day, i.p.) as an alternative treatment strategy. TIA administration decreased avoidance behavior as measured in the open field and NSF. Overall, this demonstrates that TIA may be a promising alternative treatment to typical antidepressants, especially in patients whose serotonergic system has been altered.",

    "abstract": "Visual inspection of stimulus-induced gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) often reveals a non-sinusoidal shape. Such distortions are a hallmark of non-linear systems and are also observed in mean-field models of gamma oscillations. A thorough characterization of the shape of the gamma cycle can therefore provide additional constraints on the operating regime of such models. However, the gamma waveform has not been quantitatively characterized, partially because the first harmonic of gamma, which arises because of the non-sinusoidal nature of the signal, is typically weak and gets masked due to a broadband increase in power related to spiking. To address this, we recorded local field potential (LFP) from the primary visual cortex (V1) of two awake female macaques while presenting full-field gratings or iso-luminant chromatic hues that produced huge gamma oscillations with prominent peaks at harmonic frequencies in the power spectra. We found that gamma and its first harmonic always maintained a specific phase relationship, resulting in a distinctive shape with a sharp trough and a shallow peak. Interestingly, a Wilson-Cowan (WC) model operating in an inhibition stabilized mode could replicate this shape, but only when the inhibitory population operated in the super-linear regime, as predicted recently. However, another recently developed model of gamma that operates in a linear regime driven by stochastic noise failed to produce salient harmonics or the observed shape. Our results impose additional constraints on models that generate gamma oscillations and their operating regimes.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative traits such as human height are measurable phenotypes that show continuous variation over a wide phenotypic range. Enormous effort has recently been put into determining the genetic influences on a variety of quantitative traits, including human genetic diseases, with mixed success. We identified a quantitative trait in a tractable model system, the GAL pathway in yeast, which controls the uptake and metabolism of the sugar galactose. GAL pathway activation depends both on galactose concentration and on the concentrations of competing, preferred sugars such as glucose. Natural yeast isolates show substantial variation in the behavior of the pathway. All studied yeast strains exhibit bimodal responses relative to external galactose concentration, i.e. a set of galactose concentrations existed at which both GAL-induced and GAL-repressed subpopulations were observed. However, these concentrations differed in different strains. We built a mechanistic model of the GAL pathway and identified parameters that are plausible candidates for capturing the phenotypic features of a set of strains including standard lab strains, natural variants, and mutants. In silico perturbation of these parameters identified variation in the intracellular galactose sensor, Gal3p, the negative feedback node within the GAL regulatory network, Gal80p, and the hexose transporters, HXT, as the main sources of the bimodal range variation. We were able to switch the phenotype of individual yeast strains in silico by tuning parameters related to these three elements. Determining the basis for these behavioral differences may give insight into how the GAL pathway processes information, and into the evolution of nutrient metabolism preferences in different strains. More generally, our method of identifying the key parameters that explain phenotypic variation in this system should be generally applicable to other quantitative traits.\n\nAuthor summaryMicrobes adopt elaborate strategies for the preferred uptake and use of nutrients to cope with complex and fluctuating environments. As a result, yeast strains originating from different ecological niches show significant variation in the way they induce genes in the galactose metabolism (GAL) pathway in response to nutrient signals. To identify the mechanistic sources of this variation, we built a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of the galactose metabolic regulation network, and studied how parameters with different biological implications contributed to the natural variation. We found that variations in the behavior of the galactose sensor Gal3p, the negative feedback node Gal80p, and the hexose transporters HXT were critical elements in the GAL pathway response. Tuning single parameters in silico was sufficient to achieve phenotype switching between different yeast strains. Our computational approach should be generally useful to help pinpoint the genetic and molecular bases of natural variation in other systems.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of the prefrontal executive and limbic networks is the mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Despite the importance of MD in a broad range of behaviors and neuropsychiatric disorders, virtually nothing is known about the physiology of neurons in MD. Here, we injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of adult (8 - 12 week old) male and female wildtype mice. We prepared acute brain slices and used current clamp electrophysiology to measure and compare the intrinsic properties of the neurons in MD that project to mPFC (MD[-&gt;]mPFC neurons). MD[-&gt;]mPFC neurons are located predominantly in the medial (MD-M) and lateral (MD-L) subnuclei of MD. We found that that MD-M[-&gt;]mPFC neurons have longer membrane time constants, higher membrane resistance, less Hyperpolarization and Cyclic Nucleotide gated (HCN) channel activity, and more readily generate action potentials compared to MD-L[-&gt;]mPFC neurons. Additionally, MD-M[-&gt;]mPFC neurons have larger and more complex dendritic arbors compared to MD-L[-&gt;]mPFC neurons. These data demonstrating that the two populations of MD[-&gt;]mPFC neurons have distinct physiologies and morphologies suggests a differential role in thalamocortical information processing and potentially behavior.",
