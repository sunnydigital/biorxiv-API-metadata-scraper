    "abstract": "BackgroundDeposition and spreading of misfolded proteins (-synuclein and tau) have been linked to Parkinsons cognitive dysfunction. The glymphatic system may play an important role in the clearance of these toxic proteins via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through perivascular and interstitial spaces. Recent studies discovered that sleep-dependent global brain activity is coupled to CSF flow that may reflect glymphatic function.\n\nObjectiveTo determine if the decoupling of brain activity-CSF flow is linked to Parkinsons cognitive dysfunction.\n\nMethodsFunctional and structural MRI data, clinical motor (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), and cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) scores were collected from 60 Parkinsons and 58 control subjects. Parkinsons patients were subgrouped into those with (MoCA < 26; N = 29) and without (MoCA [&ge;] 26; N = 31) mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n\nThe coupling strength between the resting-state global blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal (gBOLD) and associated CSF flow was quantified, compared among groups, and associated with clinical and structural measurements.\n\nResultsgBOLD-CSF coupling decreased significantly (p < 0.006) in Parkinsons patients showing MCI, compared to those without MCI and controls. Reduced gBOLD-CSF coupling was associated with decreased MoCA scores that was present in Parkinsons patients (p = 0.005) but not in controls (p = 0.65). Weaker gBOLD-CSF coupling in Parkinsons patients also was associated with a thinner right entorhinal cortex (Spearmans correlation = - 0.36; p = 0.012), an early structural change often seen in Alzheimers.\n\nConclusionsThe decoupling between global brain activity and associated CSF flow is related to Parkinsons cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state network research is extremely influential, yet the functions of many networks remain unknown. In part, this is due to typical (e.g., univariate) analyses testing the function of individual regions and not the full set of co-activated regions that form a network. Connectivity is dynamic and the function of a region may change based on its current connections. Therefore, determining the function of a network requires assessment at the network-level. Yet popular theories implicating the default mode network (DMN) in episodic memory and social cognition, rest principally upon analyses performed at the level of individual brain regions. Here we use independent component analysis to formally test the role of the DMN in episodic and social processing at the network level. As well as an episodic retrieval task, two independent datasets were employed to assess DMN function across the breadth of social cognition; a person knowledge judgement and a theory of mind task. Each task dataset was separated into networks of co-activated regions. In each, the co-activated DMN, was identified through comparison to an a priori template and its relation to the task model assessed. This co-activated DMN did not show greater activity in episodic or social tasks than high-level baseline conditions. Thus, no evidence was found to support hypotheses that the co-activated DMN is involved in explicit episodic or social processing tasks at a network-level. The networks associated with these processes are described. Implications for prior univariate findings and the functional significance of the co-activated DMN are considered.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality in hospitalized patients. Concomitant development of acute kidney injury (AKI) increases sepsis mortality through unclear mechanisms. While electrolyte disturbances and toxic metabolite buildup during AKI could be important, it is possible that the kidney produces a protective molecule lost during sepsis with AKI. We previously demonstrated that systemic Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP, uromodulin), a kidney-derived protein with immunomodulatory properties, falls in AKI. Using a mouse sepsis model without severe kidney injury, we show that the kidney increases circulating THP by enhancing basolateral release of THP from medullary thick ascending limb cells. In sepsis patients, changes in circulating THP are positively associated with critical illness. THP is also found de novo in injured lungs. Genetic ablation of THP in mice leads to increased mortality and bacterial burden during sepsis. Consistent with the increased bacterial burden, the presence of THP in vitro and in vivo leads macrophages and monocytes to upregulate a transcriptional program promoting cell migration, phagocytosis and chemotaxis and treatment of macrophages with purified THP increases phagocytosis. Rescue of septic THP-/- mice with exogenous systemic THP improves survival. Together, these findings suggest that through releasing THP, the kidney modulates the immune response in sepsis by enhancing mononuclear phagocyte function and systemic THP has therapeutic potential in sepsis.\n\nSignificance StatementSepsis is a significant contributor to kidney injury as well as morbidity and mortality worldwide. Specific therapies to improve outcomes in sepsis with kidney injury have largely been limited to symptom management and infectious agent control, in part because it is unclear how kidney injury increases sepsis mortality. This paper describes the identification of Tamm-Horsfall protein, previously known to protect in ischemic models of AKI, as protective in preclinical models of sepsis. It demonstrates how the loss of THP leads to decreased mononuclear phagocyte function and diversity, increased pathogen burden and decreased survival. THP also increases in sepsis without severe kidney injury and concentrates in injured organs. Further study of THP in sepsis could lead to novel sepsis therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of resistance to pesticides in agricultural systems provides an opportunity to study the fitness costs and benefits of novel adaptive traits. Here, we studied a population of Amaranthus tuberculatus (common waterhemp), which has evolved resistance to glyphosate. Following the production of seed families with contrasting levels of glyphosate resistance, we assessed the growth and fitness of seed families in the absence of glyphosate and determined their ability to compete for resources under intra- and interspecific competition. Further investigation revealed a positive correlation between the level of resistance and gene copy number for the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) glyphosate target, thus indicating gene amplification as the mechanism of resistance within the population. Resistant common waterhemp plants were found to have a lower competitive response when compared to the susceptible phenotypes. A substitution rate of 2.76 glyphosate resistant plants was required to have an equal competitive effect as a single susceptible plant. A growth trade-off was associated with the gene amplification mechanism under intra-phenotypic competition where 20 extra gene copies were associated with a 26.5 % reduction in dry biomass. Interestingly, this growth trade-off was mitigated when assessed under interspecific competition from maize.",

    "abstract": "Saccades are a ubiquitous and crucial component of our visual system, allowing for the efficient deployment of the fovea and its accompanying neural resources. Initiation of a saccade is known to cause saccadic suppression, a temporary reduction in visual sensitivity1, 2 and visual cortical firing rates3-6. While saccadic suppression has been well characterized at the level of perception and single neurons, relatively little is known about the visual cortical networks governing this phenomenon. Here we examine the effects of saccadic suppression on distinct neural subpopulations within visual area V4. We find cortical layer- and cell type-specific differences in the magnitude and timing of peri-saccadic modulation. Neurons in the input layer show changes in firing rate and inter-neuronal correlations prior to saccade onset, indicating that this layer receives information about impending saccades. Putative inhibitory interneurons in the input layer elevate their firing rate during saccades, suggesting they play a role in suppressing the activity of other cortical subpopulations. A computational model of this circuit recapitulates our empirical observations and demonstrates that an input layer-targeting pathway can initiate saccadic suppression by enhancing local inhibitory activity. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how eye movement signaling interacts with cortical circuitry to enforce visual stability.",

In respect of this, quantifying how a measure can cluster or organize intrinsic groups is important since currently there is no statistical evaluation of how ordered is, or how much noise is embedded in the resulting clustered vector. Many of the literature focuses on how well the clustering algorithm orders the data, with several measures regarding external and internal statistical measures; but none measure has been developed to statistically quantify the noise in an arranged vector posterior a clustering algorithm, i.e., how much of the clustering is due to randomness.

Pyroptosis is critical in macrophage-mediated inflammation. This study determined effects of pyroptosis on aortic dilation and rupture using GSDMD deficient mice.\n\nApproach and ResultsIn an initial study, male Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice in C57BL/6J background (8 - 10 weeks old) were infected with adeno-associated viral vectors encoding mouse PCSK9D377Y gain-of-function mutation and fed a Western diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. After two weeks of AAV infection, angiotensin II (AngII, 1 {micro}g/kg/min) was infused. During the 4 weeks of AngII infusion, 5 of 13 Gsdmd+/+ mice died of aortic rupture, whereas no aortic rupture occurred in Gsdmd-/- mice. In surviving mice, no differences in either ascending or abdominal aortic dilation were observed between Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice. To determine whether protection of GSDMD deficiency against aortic rupture is specific to AngII infusion, we subsequently examined aortic pathologies in mice administered beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). BAPN (0.5% wt/vol) was administered in drinking water to male Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice (4 weeks old) for 4 weeks. Six of 13 Gsdmd+/+ mice died of aortic rupture, whereas no aortic rupture occurred in Gsdmd-/- mice. In mice survived, no differences of diameters in the ascending, arch, or abdominal aortic regions were observed between Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice.\n\nConclusionsGSDMD deficiency protects against AngII or BAPN-induced aortic ruptures in mice.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGSDMD deficiency protects against angiotensin II-induced aortic rupture in hypercholesterolemic mice.\nC_LIO_LIGSDMD deficiency protects against beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced aortic dissection and rupture in C57BL/6J mice.\nC_LI",

Furthermore, we demonstrated that granulin B, C and E are heavily glycosylated and the glycosylation pattern of granulin C varies in different physiological and pathological conditions. Deficiency of lysosomal proteases leads to alterations in the levels of a specific subset of granulins. These data support that the levels of individual granulin peptides are differentially regulated under physiological and pathological conditions and provide novel insights into how granulin peptides function in the lysosome.",

Morphological characterization was investigated by microscopy. Whilst the results of 16S rRNA were inconclusive, the phylogenetic reconstruction and secondary structures of 16S-23S ITS strongly suggested that A183 strain is a novel species within Thermoleptolyngbya. Moreover, genome-scale average nucleotide identity (ANI) confirmed the genetic divergence of A183 from Thermoleptolyngbya O-77. Comparative genome analysis revealed inconsistent genome structures of Thermoleptolyngbya strains. Further GO analysis showed that the specific genes were distributed in a wide range of functional categories. In addition, analysis of genes related to thermotolerance, signal transduction, and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur assimilation revealed the ability of this strain to adapt to inhospitable niches in hot springs.",

Single-droplet Raman measurements in conjunction with an array of bioinformatic, spectroscopic, microscopic, and mutagenesis studies revealed that the intrinsic disorder and dynamics are retained in the liquid-like condensates. Lower concentrations of RNA promote the phase transition of Y145Stop at low micromolar protein concentrations under physiological condition. Whereas, higher RNA to protein ratios inhibit condensation indicating the role of RNA in modulating the phase behavior of Y145Stop. Highly dynamic liquid-like droplets eventually transform into dynamically-arrested, ordered, {beta}-rich, amyloid-like aggregates via liquid-to-solid transition upon aging. These amyloid-like aggregates formed via phase separation display the self-templating characteristic and are capable of recruiting and autocatalytically converting monomeric Y145Stop into amyloid fibrils. In contrast to this disease-associated intrinsically disordered Y145 truncated variant, the wild-type full-length PrP exhibited a much lower propensity for phase separation and liquid-to-solid maturation into amyloid-like aggregates hinting at a potentially crucial, chaperone-like, protecting role of the globular C-terminal domain that remains largely conserved in vertebrate evolution. Such an intriguing interplay in the modulation of the protein phase behavior will have much broader implications in cell physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "The generation of tissues and organs requires close interaction with vasculature from the earliest moments of embryonic development. Tissue-specific organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells allow for the in vitro recapitulation of elements of embryonic development, however they are not intrinsically vascularized, which poses a major challenge for their sustained growth and for understanding the role of vasculature in fate specification and morphogenesis. Current organoid vascularization strategies do not recapitulate the temporal synchronization and spatial orientation needed to ensure in-vivo-like early co-development. Here, we developed a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based approach to generate organoids which interact with vascular cells in a spatially determined manner. The spatial interaction between organoid and vasculature is enabled by the use of a custom designed 3D printed microfluidic chip which allows for a sequential and developmentally matched co-culture system. We show that on-chip hPSC-derived pericytes and endothelial cells sprout and self-assemble into organized vascular networks, and use cerebral organoids as a model system to explore interactions with this de novo generated vasculature. Upon co-development, vascular cells interact with the cerebral organoid and form an integrated neurovascular organoid on chip. This 3D printing-based platform is designed to be compatible with any organoid system and is an easy and highly cost-effective way to vascularize organoids. The use of this platform, readily performed in any lab, could open new avenues for understanding and manipulating the co-development of tissue-specific organoids with vasculature.",
