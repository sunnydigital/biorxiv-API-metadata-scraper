    "abstract": "Asymmetric inheritance of organelle and cellular compounds between daughter cells impacts on the phenotypic variability and was found to be a hallmark for differentiation and rejuvenation in stem-like cells as much as a mechanism for enhancing resistance in bacteria populations. Whether the same processes take place in the context of cancer cell lines is still poorly investigated. Here, we present a method that allows the measurement of asymmetric organelle partitioning, and we use it to simultaneously measure the partitioning of three kinds of cellular elements, i.e. cytoplasm, membrane, and mitochondria in a proliferating population of human Jurkat T-cells. For this porpoise, we use multiple live cell markers which permit us both to follow the partitioning process for multiple generations and to investigate the correlations between the partitioning of different cellular constituents. Assuming a minimal model of asymmetric partitioning where cell sub-components are divided according to a biased binomial statistics, we derived exact analytical relationships for the average fluorescence intensity and its fluctuations as a function of the generation, obtaining an excellent agreement with the experimental measurements.\n\nWe found that although cell cytoplasm is divided symmetrically, mitochondria and membrane lipids are asymmetrically distributed between the two daughter cells and present a stable positive correlation with cytoplasm apportioning, which is incompatible with an independent division mechanism. Therefore, our findings show that asymmetric segregation mechanisms can also arise in cancer cell populations, and that, in this case, membrane lipids and mitochondria do not respectively segregate independently from the cytoplasm. This helps us understand the high phenotypic variability reported in these cancer cell lines. In perspective, this could be particularly relevant in the case of tumor micro-environment diversity, where comprehension of the non-genetic cell heterogeneity could pave the way to novel and more targeted therapies. Moreover, the developed experimental and theoretical apparatus can be easily generalized to different cell kinds and different cell sub-components providing a powerful tool for understanding partitioning-driven heterogeneity.",

However, the quantification and visualization of these patterns are major computational and epistemological challenges. Here, we present Connectome, a software package for R which facilitates rapid calculation, and interactive exploration, of cell-cell signaling network topologies contained in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Connectome can be used with any reference set of known ligand-receptor mechanisms. It has built-in functionality to facilitate differential and comparative connectomics, in which complete mechanistic networks are quantitatively compared between systems. Connectome includes computational and graphical tools designed to analyze and explore cell-cell connectivity patterns across disparate single-cell datasets.

    "abstract": "Vision neuroscience has made great strides in understanding the hierarchical organization of object representations along the ventral visual stream (VVS). How VVS representations capture fine-grained visual similarities between objects that observers subjectively perceive has received limited examination so far. In the current study, we addressed this question by focusing on perceived visual similarities among subordinate exemplars of real world-categories. We hypothesized that these perceived similarities are reflected with highest fidelity in neural activity patterns downstream from inferotemporal regions, namely in perirhinal and anterolateral entorhinal cortex in the medial temporal-lobe. To address this issue with fMRI, we administered a modified 1-Back task that required discrimination between category exemplars as well as categorization. Further, we obtained observer-specific ratings of perceived visual similarities, which predicted behavioural performance during scanning. As anticipated, we found that activity patterns in perirhinal and anterolateral entorhinal cortex predicted the structure of perceived visual similarity relationships among category exemplars, including its observer-specific component, with higher precision than any other VVS region. Our findings provide new evidence that subjective aspects of object perception that rely on fine-grained visual differentiation are reflected with highest fidelity in the medial temporal lobe.",

Among the three vertebrate ankyrins, little is known about neuronal Ankyrin-R (AnkR). We report AnkR is highly enriched in Pv+ fast-spiking interneurons in mouse and human. We identify AnkR-associated protein complexes including cytoskeletal proteins, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and perineuronal nets (PNNs). We show that loss of AnkR from forebrain interneurons reduces and disrupts PNNs, decreases anxiety-like behaviors, and changes the intrinsic excitability and firing properties of Pv+ fast-spiking interneurons. These changes are accompanied by a dramatic reduction in Kv3.1b K+ channels. We identify a novel AnkR-binding motif in Kv3.1b, and show that AnkR is both necessary and sufficient for Kv3.1b membrane localization in interneurons and at nodes of Ranvier. Thus, AnkR regulates Pv+ fast-spiking interneuron function by organizing ion channels, CAMs, and PNNs, and linking these to the underlying {beta}1 spectrin-based cytoskeleton.",

Here we show that several common peridomestic species, including deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, and striped skunks, are susceptible to infection and can shed the virus in respiratory secretions. In contrast, we demonstrate that cottontail rabbits, fox squirrels, Wyoming ground squirrels, black-tailed prairie dogs, house mice, and racoons are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The emerging diversity of the lysine acylation landscape prompted us to investigate the full proteomic impact of Kbhb. Global protein Kbhb is induced in a tissue-specific manner by a variety of interventions that evoke {beta}-OHB. Mass spectrometry analysis of the {beta}-hydroxybutyrylome in mouse liver revealed 891 sites of Kbhb within 267 proteins enriched for fatty acid, amino acid, detoxification and 1-carbon metabolic pathways. Kbhb of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), a rate-limiting enzyme of the methionine cycle, results in inhibition of enzymatic activity. Our results illuminate the role of Kbhb on hepatic metabolism under ketogenic conditions and demonstrate the functional consequence of this modification on a central metabolic enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant PDGFR{beta} gain-of-function mutations in mice and humans cause a spectrum of wasting and overgrowth disorders afflicting the skeleton and other connective tissues, but the cellular origin of these disorders remains unknown. We demonstrate that skeletal stem cells (SSCs) isolated from mice with a gain-of-function D849V point mutation in PDGFR{beta} exhibit SSC colony formation defects that parallel the wasting or overgrowth phenotypes of the mice. Single-cell RNA transcriptomics with the SSC colonies demonstrates alterations in osteoblast and chondrocyte precursors caused by PDGFR{beta}D849V. Mutant SSC colonies undergo poor osteogenesis in vitro and mice with PDGFR{beta}D849V exhibit osteopenia. Increased expression of Sox9 and other chondrogenic markers occurs in SSC colonies from mice with PDGFR{beta}D849V. Increased STAT5 phosphorylation and overexpression of Igf1 and Socs2 in PDGFR{beta}D849V SSCs suggests that overgrowth in mice involves PDGFR{beta}D849V activating the STAT5-IGF1 axis locally in the skeleton. Our study establishes that PDGFR{beta}D849V causes osteopenic skeletal phenotypes that are associated with intrinsic changes in SSCs, promoting chondrogenesis over osteogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hybrids species can harbour a combination of beneficial traits from each parent and may exhibit hybrid vigour, more readily adapting to new harsher environments. Inter-species hybrids are also sterile and therefore an evolutionary dead-end unless fertility is restored, usually via auto-polyploidisation events. In the Saccharomyces genus, hybrids are readily found in nature and in industrial settings, where they have adapted to severe fermentative conditions. Due to their hybrid sterility, the development of new commercial yeast strains has so far been primarily conducted via selection methods rather than breeding. In this study, we overcame infertility by creating tetraploid intermediates of Saccharomyces inter-species hybrids, to allow continuous multigenerational breeding. We incorporated nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversity within each parental species, allowing for quantitative genetic analysis of traits exhibited by the hybrids, and for nuclear-mitochondrial interactions to be assessed. Using pooled F12 generation segregants of different hybrids with extreme phenotype distributions, we identified QTLs for tolerance to high and low temperatures, high sugar concentration, high ethanol concentration, and acetic acid levels. We identified QTLs that are species specific, that are shared between species, as well as hybrid specific, where the variants do not exhibit phenotypic differences in the original parental species. Moreover, we could distinguish between mitochondria-type dependent and independent traits. This study tackles the complexity of the genetic interactions and traits in hybrid species, bringing hybrids into the realm of full genetic analysis of diploid species, and paves the road for the biotechnological exploitation of yeast biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe mathematically optimal solution in computational protein folding simulations does not always correspond to the native structure, due to the imperfection of the energy force fields. There is therefore a need to search for more diverse suboptimal solutions in order to identify the states close to the native. We propose a novel multimodal optimization protocol to improve the conformation sampling efficiency and modeling accuracy of de novo protein structure folding simulations.\n\nResultsA distance-assisted multimodal optimization sampling algorithm, MMpred, is proposed for de novo protein structure prediction. The protocol consists of three stages: The first is a modal exploration stage, in which a structural similarity evaluation model DMscore is designed to control the diversity of conformations, generating a population of diverse structures in different low-energy basins. The second is a modal maintaining stage, where an adaptive clustering algorithm MNDcluster is proposed to divide the populations and merge the modal by adjusting the annealing temperature to locate the promising basins. In the last stage of modal exploitation, a greedy search strategy is used to accelerate the convergence of the modal. Distance constraint information is used to construct the conformation scoring model to guide sampling. MMpred is tested on a large set of 320 non-redundant proteins, where MMpred obtains models with TM-score[&ge;]0.5 on 268 cases, which is 20.3% higher than that of Rosetta guided with the same set of distance constraints. The results showed that MMpred can help significantly improve the model accuracy of protein assembly simulations through the sampling of multiple promising energy basins with enhanced structural diversity.\n\nAvailabilityThe source code and executable versions are freely available at https://github.com/iobio-zjut/MMpred.\n\nContactzgj@zjut.edu.cn or zhng@umich.edu or sujz@wmu.edu.cn",

In this study, the mechanism of {beta}-oxidation inhibition was investigated by testing the hypothesis that TCDD dose-dependently repressed straight-chain fatty acid oxidation gene expression in mice following oral gavage every 4 days for 28 days. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed a dose-dependent decrease in hepatic acyl-CoA levels, while octenoyl-CoA and dicarboxylic acid levels increased. TCDD also dose-dependently repressed the hepatic gene expression associated with triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester hydrolysis, fatty acid binding proteins, fatty acid activation, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolysis while inducing acyl-CoA hydrolysis. Moreover, octenoyl-CoA blocked the hydration of crotonyl-CoA suggesting short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1) activity was inhibited. Collectively, the integration of metabolomics and RNA-seq data suggested TCDD induced a futile cycle of fatty acid activation and acyl-CoA hydrolysis resulting in incomplete {beta}-oxidation, and the accumulation octenoyl-CoA levels that inhibited the activity of short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1).",

We found that improved task proficiency after sleep lead to an attenuation of the learning curve, suggesting a dynamic juggling learning process. We employed individualized cross-frequency coupling analyses to reduce inter and intra-group variability of oscillatory features. Advancing our previous findings, we identified a more precise SO-spindle coupling in adults compared to adolescents.

The full repertoire of human tissues and organs susceptible to infection is an area of active investigation, and some studies have implicated the reproductive system. The effects of COVID-19 on human reproduction remain poorly understood, and particularly the impact on early embryogenesis and establishment of a pregnancy are not known. In this work, we explore the susceptibility of early human embryos to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We note that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two canonical cell entry factors for SARS-CoV-2, are co-expressed in cells of the trophectoderm in blastocyst-stage preimplantation embryos. Using fluorescent reporter virions pseudotyped with Spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2, we observe robust infection of trophectoderm cells, and this permissiveness could be attenuated with blocking antibodies targeting S or ACE2. When exposing human blastocysts to the live, fully infectious SARS-CoV-2, we detected cases of infection that compromised embryo health. Therefore, we identify a new human target tissue for SARS-CoV-2 with potential medical implications for reproductive health during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.",

    "abstract": "Planarians have a remarkable ability to undergo whole-body regeneration. The timely establishment of polarity at the wound site followed by the specification of the organizing centers- the anterior pole and the posterior pole, are indispensable for successful regeneration. In planarians, polarity, pole, and positional-information determinants are predominantly expressed by muscles. The molecular toolkit that enables this functionality of planarian muscles however remains poorly understood. Here we report that SMED_DDX24, a D-E-A-D Box RNA helicase and the homolog of human DDX24, is critical for planarian head regeneration. DDX24 is enriched in muscles and its knockdown leads to defective muscle-fiber organization and failure to re-specify anterior pole/organizer. Overall, loss of DDX24 manifests into gross misregulation of many well-characterized positional-control genes and patterning-control genes, necessary for organogenesis and tissue positioning and tissue patterning. In addition, wound-induced Wnt signalling was also upregulated in ddx24 RNAi animals. Canonical WNT-{beta}CATENIN signalling is known to suppress head identity throughout bilateria, including planarians. Modulating this Wnt activity by {beta}-catenin-1 RNAi, the effector molecule of this pathway, partially rescues the ddx24 RNAi phenotype, implying that a high Wnt environment in ddx24 knockdown animals likely impedes their normal head regeneration. Furthermore, at a sub-cellular level, RNA helicases are known to regulate muscle mass and function by regulating their translational landscape. ddx24 knockdown leads to the downregulation of large subunit ribosomal RNA and the 80S ribosome peak, implying its role in ribosome biogenesis and thereby influencing the translational output. This aspect seems to be an evolutionarily conserved role of DDX24. In summary, our work demonstrates the role of a D-E-A-D box RNA helicase in whole-body regeneration through muscle fiber organization, and pole and positional-information re-specification, likely mediated through translation regulation.",

    "abstract": "The present study is the first comprehensive report on diversity, population structure, genetic admixture and mitochondrial DNA variation in South Indian draught type zebu cattle. The diversity of South Indian cattle was moderately higher. A significantly strong negative correlation coefficient of -0.674 (P<0.05) was observed between the effective population size of different breeds and their estimated FIS. The phylogeny and genetic structure analysis revealed the distinctness of Kangayam, Vechur and Punganur cattle from the rest of the zebu breeds. The results showed the influence of Hallikar breed in the development of most Mysore type cattle breeds of South India with the exception of Kangayam. Bayesian clustering analysis was performed to assess the taurine admixture in South Indian zebu cattle using purebred Jersey and Holstein-Friesian as reference genotypes. Relatively high levels of taurine admixture (>6.25%) was observed in Punganur, Vechur, Umblachery and Pulikulam cattle breeds. Two major maternal haplogroups, I1 and I2, typical of zebu cattle were observed, with the former being predominant than the later. The pairwise differences among the I2 haplotypes of South Indian cattle were relatively higher than West Indian (Indus valley site) zebu cattle. The results indicated the need for additional sampling and comprehensive analysis of mtDNA control region variations to unravel the probable location of origin and domestication of I2 zebu lineage. The present study also revealed major concerns on South Indian zebu cattle (i) risk of endangerment due to small effective population size and high rate of inbreeding (ii) lack of sufficient purebred zebu bulls for breeding and (iii) increasing level of taurine admixture in zebu cattle. Availability of purebred semen for artificial insemination, incorporation of genomic/molecular information to identify purebred animals and increased awareness among farmers will help to maintain breed purity, conserve and improve these important draught cattle germplasms of South India.",

We longitudinally monitored the song and neuroplasticity in male and female starlings during multiple photoperiods using Diffusion Tensor and Fixel-Based techniques. These exploratory data-driven whole-brain methods resulted in a population-based tractogram uncovering microstructural sexual dimorphisms in the song control system and beyond. Male brains showed microstructural hemispheric asymmetries, whereas females had higher interhemispheric connectivity, which could not be attributed to brain size differences. Only females with large brains sing but differ from males in their song behavior by showing involvement of the hippocampus. Both sexes experienced multisensory neuroplasticity in the song control, auditory and visual system, and the cerebellum, mainly during the photosensitive period. This period with low gonadal hormones might represent a  sensitive window during which different sensory and motor systems in telencephalon and cerebellum can be seasonally re-shaped in both sexes.",

In this article, we present a comprehensive study of the changes in scholarly publication landscape for biomedical sciences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special emphasis on preprints posted on bioRxiv and medRxiv servers. We observe the emergence of a new category of preprint authors working in the fields of immunology, microbiology, infectious diseases, and epidemiology, who extensively used preprint platforms during the pandemic for sharing their immediate findings. The majority of these findings were works-in-progress unfitting for a prompt acceptance by refereed journals. The COVID-19 preprints that became peer-reviewed journal articles were often submitted to journals concurrently with the posting on a preprint server, and the entire publication cycle, from preprint to the online journal article, took on average 63 days. This included an expedited peer-review process of 43 days and journals production stage of 15 days, however there was a wide variation in publication delays between journals. Only one third of COVID-19 preprints posted during the first nine months of the pandemic appeared as peer-reviewed journal articles. These journal articles display high Altmetric Attention Scores further emphasizing a significance of COVID-19 research during 2020. This article will be relevant to editors, publishers, open science enthusiasts, and anyone interested in changes that the 2020 crisis transpired to publication practices and a culture of preprints in life sciences.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWilson Disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Clinical manifestations of WD are variable. Identification of prevalent mutations in a given population is necessary to provide mutation-based molecular diagnosis. Previous studies have detected common mutations in this part of the world and our study aimed to correlate genotype with clinical and radiological features.\n\nMethodsA descriptive cross-sectional observational study was conducted over a period of two years in a tertiary care hospital and neurology referral unit of Kolkata, India. All WD patients within the study period and meeting the inclusion criteria were included. Demographic data collection, clinical examination and relevant laboratory investigations were done. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain and cognitive assessment by Mini Mental Score Exam (MMSE) were also performed. Blood was collected for genetic analyses. PCR-Sanger sequencing of exons 2,4,6,8,10,14,16,18 of ATP7B gene was done based on previous reports of mutation hotspots of ATP7B gene for WD in Eastern India. Genotype phenotype correlation was attempted using two supervised machine learning methods, viz. logistic regression with an elastic-net penalty and the random forest.\n\nResultsOf 52 WD patients were included in the study, 57.7% were males. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.96 years. Majority (61.8%) of the patients had dystonia on presentation, followed by dysarthria (41.2%), tremor (17.6%) and ataxia (11.8%). The mean MMSE and Frontal Assessment Battery score were 23.74 and 10.63 respectively and both were lower than the normal baseline values.Out of the total cohort of 52 patients,15(28.8%) harbored previously reported common mutations from this part of the country. Of the 15, 12 had the same mutation of c.813C>A(p.cys271Ter).The presence of common mutationswas associated with several distinct clinical phenotypes in the mathematical models but larger sample sizes are needed to corroborate the correlation.\n\nConclusionsWD patients in eastern India have significant genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Further studies with larger samples and screening of remaining exons are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasmas are minute bacteria controlled by very small genomes ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 Mbp. They lack a cell wall and have been suggested to have progressed through reductive evolution from phylogenetically closely related Clostridia. They are known to colonize the respiratory tract or the urogenital tract among other organs and can cause chronic and subclinical diseases associated with long persistence of the causative agent. Toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS) are genetic elements that have been described for several respiratory and urogenital pathogens as well as for Clostridia, but never for pathogenic mycoplasmas. Here we describe for the first-time different types of TAS in a Mycoplasma pathogen, namely M. mycoides subsp. capri. We identified candidate TAS in silico via TASmania database. Two candidate TAS identified in silico and another candidate TAS suggested in a minimal cell based on transposon mutagenesis were systematically tested for their functionality in hosts with different phylogenetic distance using heterologous expression. Phylogenetic distance of the host used for heterologous expression influenced the outcome of the functional testing. We corroborated functionality of the three candidate TAS in Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum. Moreover, we confirmed transcription and translation of molecules of the TAS investigated during in vitro growth. We sequence analyzed 15 genomes of M. mycoides subsp. capri and revealed an unequal distribution of the TAS studied pointing towards dynamic gain and loss of TAS within the species.\n\nAuthor summaryMycoplasmas have a minimal genome and have never been shown to possess TAS. In this work we showed the presence of different functional TAS systems in Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, a caprine pathogen for the first time. Sequence analysis of a number of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri strains revealed a plasticity of the genome with respect to TAS carriage. This work paves the way to investigate the biological role of TAS (e.g. persistence, stress tolerance) during infection using mycoplasmas as a simple model organism. Since most mycoplasmas lack classical virulence factors such as exotoxins and go into a kind of stealth mode to evade the immune system, TAS are likely to contribute to the parasitic lifestyle of mycoplasmas and should be investigated in that respect. The availability of synthetic genomics tools to modify a range of Mycoplasma pathogens and well-established challenge models for the latter mycoplasmas will foster future research on TAS in mycoplasmas.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate pigmentation is a fundamentally important, multifaceted phenotype. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been a valuable model for understanding genetics and development of pigment pattern formation due to its genetic and experimental tractability, advantages that are shared across several Danio species having a striking array of pigment patterns. Here, we use the sister species D. quagga and D. kyathit, with stripes and spots, respectively, to understand how natural genetic variation impacts phenotypes at cellular and organismal levels. We first show that D. quagga and D. kyathit phenotypes resemble those of wild-type D. rerio and several single locus mutants of D. rerio, respectively, in a morphospace defined by pattern variation along dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes. We then identify differences in patterning at the cellular level between D. quagga and D. kyathit by repeated daily imaging during pattern development and quantitative comparisons of adult phenotypes, revealing that patterns are similar initially but diverge ontogenetically. To assess the genetic architecture of these differences, we employ reduced-representation sequencing of second-generation hybrids. Despite the similarity of D. quagga to D. rerio, and D. kyathit to some D. rerio mutants, our analyses reveal a complex genetic basis for differences between D. quagga and D. kyathit, with several quantitative trait loci contributing to variation in overall pattern and cellular phenotypes, epistatic interactions between loci, and abundant segregating variation within species. Our findings provide a window into the evolutionary genetics of pattern-forming mechanisms in Danio and highlight the complexity of differences that can arise even between sister species. Further studies of natural genetic diversity underlying pattern variation in D. quagga and D. kyathit should provide insights complementary to those from zebrafish mutant phenotypes and more distant species comparisons.\n\nAuthor SummaryPigment patterns of fishes are diverse and function in a wide range of behaviors. Common pattern themes include stripes and spots, exemplified by the closely related minnows Danio quagga and D. kyathit, respectively. We show that these patterns arise late in development owing to alterations in the development and arrangements of pigment cells. In the closely related model organism zebrafish (D. rerio) single genes can switch the pattern from stripes to spots. Yet, we show that pattern differences between D. quagga and D. kyathit have a more complex genetic basis, depending on multiple genes and interactions between these genes. Our findings illustrate the importance of characterizing naturally occuring genetic variants, in addition to laboratory induced mutations, for a more complete understanding of pigment pattern development and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone secreted from fully differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes that inhibits phosphate reabsorption by kidney proximal tubules. The full-length (i.e., intact) protein mediates FGF23 endocrine functions, while endoproteolytic cleavage at a consensus cleavage sequence for the proprotein convertases (PCs) inactivates FGF23. Two PCs, furin and PC5, were shown to cleave FGF23 in vitro at RHTR179{downarrow}, but whether they are fulfilling this function in vivo is currently unknown. To address this question we used here mice lacking either or both furin and PC5 in cell-specific manners and mice lacking the paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4) in all cells. Our analysis shows that furin inactivation in osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a 25% increase in circulating intact FGF23, without any significant impact on serum phosphate levels, whether mice are maintained on a normal or a low phosphate diet. Under conditions of iron deficiency, FGF23 is normally processed in control mice, but its processing is impaired in mice lacking furin in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In contrast, FGF23 is normally cleaved following erythropoietin or IL-1{beta} injections in mice lacking furin or both furin and PC5, and in PACE4-deficient mice. Altogether, these studies suggest that furin is only partially responsible for FGF23 cleavage under certain conditions in vivo. The processing of FGF23 may therefore involve the redundant action of multiple PCs or of other peptidases in osteoblasts, osteocytes and hematopoietic cells.",

    "abstract": "Visual inspection of stimulus-induced gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) often reveals a non-sinusoidal shape. Such distortions are a hallmark of non-linear systems and are also observed in mean-field models of gamma oscillations. A thorough characterization of the shape of the gamma cycle can therefore provide additional constraints on the operating regime of such models. However, the gamma waveform has not been quantitatively characterized, partially because the first harmonic of gamma, which arises because of the non-sinusoidal nature of the signal, is typically weak and gets masked due to a broadband increase in power related to spiking. To address this, we recorded local field potential (LFP) from the primary visual cortex (V1) of two awake female macaques while presenting full-field gratings or iso-luminant chromatic hues that produced huge gamma oscillations with prominent peaks at harmonic frequencies in the power spectra. We found that gamma and its first harmonic always maintained a specific phase relationship, resulting in a distinctive shape with a sharp trough and a shallow peak. Interestingly, a Wilson-Cowan (WC) model operating in an inhibition stabilized mode could replicate this shape, but only when the inhibitory population operated in the super-linear regime, as predicted recently. However, another recently developed model of gamma that operates in a linear regime driven by stochastic noise failed to produce salient harmonics or the observed shape. Our results impose additional constraints on models that generate gamma oscillations and their operating regimes.",

    "abstract": "Biophysical models of large-scale brain activity are a fundamental tool for understanding the mechanisms underlying the patterns observed with neuroimaging. These models combine a macroscopic description of the within- and between-ensemble dynamics of neurons within a single architecture. A challenge for these models is accounting for modulations of within-ensemble synchrony over time. Such modulations in local synchrony are fundamental for modeling behavioral tasks and resting-state activity. Another challenge comes from the difficulty in parametrizing large scale brain models which hinders researching principles related with between-ensembles differences. Here we derive a parsimonious large scale brain model that can describe fluctuations of local synchrony. Crucially, we do not reduce within-ensemble dynamics to macroscopic variables first, instead we consider within and between-ensemble interactions similarly while preserving their physiological differences. The dynamics of within-ensemble synchrony can be tuned with a parameter which manipulates local connectivity strength. We simulated resting-state static and time-resolved functional connectivity of alpha band envelopes in models with identical and dissimilar local connectivities. We show that functional connectivity emerges when there are high fluctuations of local and global synchrony simultaneously (i.e. metastable dynamics). We also show that for most ensembles, leaning towards local asynchrony or synchrony correlates with the functional connectivity with other ensembles, with the exception of some regions belonging to the default-mode network.\n\nAuthor summaryHere we present and evaluate a parsimonious model of large-scale brain activity. The model represents the brain as a network-of-networks structure. The sub-networks describe the neural activity within a brain region, and the global network encodes interactions between brain regions. Unlike other models, it capture progressive changes of local synchrony and local dynamics can be tuned with one parameter. Therefore the model could be used not only to model resting-state, but also behavioural tasks. Furthermore, we describe a simple framework that can deal with the arduous task of identifying global and local parameters.",

The docking investigation and the molecular simulation studies proposes that there is no single phytochemical included that imparts B. monnieri a significant medicinal effect. It is really the blend of dominant part of natural phytochemicals present in B. monnieri that bestows the anti-neurological activity to B. monnieri. The ADME studies shows the convergence of properties of phytochemicals of B. monnieri with that of commercially available drugs which suggests that phytochemicals of B. monnieri can used as a potential drug source to treat neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "The induction of high photosynthetic capacity in high light (HL) is a common response among many herbaceous dicot plants, however, the signals that control this response remain largely unknown. Here, multiple independent lines of evidence are presented in support of the conclusion that low photorespiratory capacity acts a negative signal to limit photosynthetic capacity acclimation in HL in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a panel of natural accessions, primary nitrogen (N) assimilation and photorespiration rates early after a shift to growth in HL, as well as activities for key enzymes in these pathways, were shown to positively correlate with the magnitude of the subsequent induction of photosynthetic capacity, which occurred several days later. Time-resolved metabolomic data during acclimation to HL were collected using a strongly acclimating ecotype and a weakly acclimating ecotype, revealing in greater detail the differences in N assimilation, photorespiration, and triose-phosphate utilization pathways underlying efficient photosynthetic capacity acclimation. When shifted into HL growth conditions under non-photorespiratory conditions, weakly acclimating ecotypes and even photorespiratory mutants gained the ability to strongly induce high photosynthetic capacity in HL. Thus, a negative, photorespiration-dependent signal early in the HL shift appears to block photosynthetic capacity acclimation in accessions with low photorespiratory capacity, whereas accessions with high photorespiratory capacity are licensed to increase photosynthetic capacity.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal proteins (RPs) are evolutionary conserved proteins that are essential for protein translation. RP expression must be tightly regulated to ensure the appropriate assembly of ribosomes and to respond to the growth demands of cells. The elements regulating the transcription of RP genes (RPGs) have been characterized in yeast and Drosophila, yet how cells regulate the production of RPs in mammals is less well understood. Here, we show that a subset of RPG promoters is characterized by the presence of the palindromic TCTCGCGAGA motif and marked by the recruitment of the protein kinase DYRK1A. The presence of DYRK1A at these promoters is associated with enhanced binding of the TATA-binding protein, TBP, and it is negatively correlated with the binding of the GABP transcription factor, establishing at least two clusters of RPGs that could be coordinately regulated. However, DYRK1A silencing leads to a global reduction of RPGs, mRNA pointing at DYRK1A activities beyond those dependent on its chromatin association. Significantly, cells in which DYRK1A is depleted have reduced RP levels, fewer ribosomes, reduced global protein synthesis and smaller size. We therefore propose a novel role for DYRK1A in coordinating the expression of genes encoding RPs, thereby controlling cell growth in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Pollinators are globally threatened by land-use change, but its effect varies depending on the taxa and the intensity of habitat degradation. However, pollinator-landscape studies typically focus on regions of intensive human activities and on a few focal species. Evaluating pollinator responses in landscapes with moderate land-use changes and on multiple pollinator groups would therefore fill an important knowledge gap. This study aims to determine the predictive capacity and effect of habitat characteristics on the relative abundance of multiple pollinator groups in mixed-use landscapes. To do this, we collected field data on the relative abundance of nectivorous birds, bees, beetles, and butterflies across the Tasman Peninsula (Tasmania, Australia). We then applied Random Forests to resolve the effects of land use (protected areas, plantation, and pasture), land cover at different radii (100 m and 2000 m), and plant genera on pollinator abundance. Overall, land cover and plant genera were more important predictors of pollinator abundance than land use. And the effect of land use, land cover, and plant genera varied depending on the pollinating group. Pollinator groups were associated with a range of plant genera, with the native genera Acacia, Leptospermum, Leucopogon, Melaleuca, Pomaderris, and Pultenaea being among the most important predictors. Our results highlight that one size does not fit all--that is pollinator response to different landscape characteristics vary, emphasise the importance of considering multiple habitat factors to manage and support a dynamic pollinator community, and demonstrates how land management can be informed using predictive modelling.",

    "abstract": "Determining the valence of an odor to provide information to guide rapid approach-avoidance behavior is thought to be one of the core tasks of the olfactory system, yet little is known of its initial neural mechanisms or subsequent behavioral manifestation in humans. In two experiments, we measured the functional processing of odor valence perception in the human olfactory bulb (OB)--the first processing stage of the olfactory system--using a non-invasive method as well as assessed subsequent motor avoidance response. We demonstrate that odor valence perception is associated with both gamma and beta activity in the human OB. Moreover, we show that negative, but not positive, odors initiate an early beta response in the OB, a response that is linked to a preparatory neural motor response in motor cortex. Finally, in a separate experiment we show that negative odors trigger a full-body motor avoidance response, manifested as a rapid leaning away from the odor, in the time period predicted by the OB results. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the human OB processes odor valence in a sequential manner in both the gamma and beta frequency bands and suggest that early processing of unpleasant odors in the OB might underlie rapid approach-avoidance decisions.",

    "abstract": "Functional recovery after brain damage varies widely and depends on many factors, including lesion site and extent. When a neuronal system is damaged, recovery may occur by engaging residual (e.g., perilesional) components. When damage is extensive, recovery depends on the availability of other intact neural structures that can reproduce the same functional output (i.e., degeneracy). A systems response to damage may occur rapidly, require learning or both. Here, we simulate functional recovery from four different types of lesions, using a generative model of word repetition that comprised a default premorbid system and a less used alternative system. The synthetic lesions (i) completely disengaged the premorbid system, leaving the alternative system intact, (ii) partially damaged both premorbid and alternative systems, and (iii) limited the experience-dependent plasticity of both. The results, across 1000 trials, demonstrate that (i) a complete disconnection of the premorbid system naturally invoked the engagement of the other, (ii) incomplete damage to both systems had a much more devastating long-term effect on model performance and (iii) the effect of reducing learning capacity within each system. These findings contribute to formal frameworks for interpreting the effect of different types of lesions.",

With the cost of scRNA-seq decreasing and techniques for sample multiplexing improving, population-scale scRNA-seq, and thus single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) mapping, is increasingly feasible. Mapping of sc-eQTL provides additional resolution to study the regulatory role of common genetic variants on gene expression across a plethora of cell types and states, and promises to improve our understanding of genetic regulation across tissues in both health and disease. While previously established methods for bulk eQTL mapping can, in principle, be applied to sc-eQTL mapping, there are a number of open questions about how best to process scRNA-seq data and adapt bulk methods to optimise sc-eQTL mapping. Here, we evaluate the role of different normalisation and aggregation strategies, covariate adjustment techniques, and multiple testing correction methods to establish best practice guidelines. We use both real and simulated datasets across single-cell technologies to systematically assess the impact of these different statistical approaches and provide recommendations for future single-cell eQTL studies that can yield up to twice as many eQTL discoveries as default approaches ported from bulk studies.",

Previous studies on shape dynamics have modeled biomolecular condensates as purely viscous, but recent data have shown them to be viscoelastic. Here we present an exact analytical solution for the shape recovery dynamics of deformed biomolecular droplets. The shape recovery of viscous droplets has an exponential time dependence, with the time constant given by the \"viscocapillary\" ratio, i.e., viscosity over interfacial tension. In contrast, the shape recovery dynamics of viscoelastic droplets is multi-exponential, with shear relaxation yielding additional time constants. During shape recovery, viscoelastic droplets exhibit shear thickening (increase in apparent viscosity) at fast shear relaxation rates but shear thinning (decrease in apparent viscosity) at slow shear relaxation rates. These results highlight the importance of viscoelasticity and expand our understanding of how material properties affect condensate dynamics in general, including aging.",

    "abstract": "The cell membrane is one of the most important structures of life. Understanding its functioning is essential for several human knowledge areas, mainly how it controls the efflux of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment. Being a complex structure, composed of several classes of compounds such as lipids, proteins, sugars, etc., a convenient way to mimic it is through a phospholipid bilayer. The Molecular Dynamics simulation of lipid bilayers in solution is the main computational approach to model the cell membrane. In this work, we present a method to detect permeation events of molecules through the lipid bilayer, characterizing its crossing time and trajectory. By splitting the simulation box into well-defined regions, the method distinguishes the passage of molecules through the bilayer from artifacts produced by crossing molecules through the simulation box edges when using periodic boundary conditions. We apply the method to study the spontaneous permeation of water molecules through bilayers with different lipid compositions and modeled with different force fields. Our method successfully characterizes the permeation events, and the results obtained show that the frequency and time of permeation are independent of the force field used to model the phospholipids. Besides, it is observed that the increase in the concentration of cholesterol molecules in lipid bilayers induces the reduction of permeation events due to its compacting action on the bilayer, making it denser and, therefore, hindering the diffusion of water molecules inside it. The computational tool to perform the method discussed here is available on https://github.com/crobertocamilo/MD-permeation.",

Increasing the X-ray energy beyond the typical 10-15 keV range promises to provide an extension of crystal lifetime via an increase in diffraction efficiency. To date however hardware limitations have negated any possible gains. Through the first use of a Cadmium Telluride Eiger2 detector and a beamline optimised for high energy data collection, we show that at higher energies fewer crystals will be required to obtain complete data, as the diffracted intensity per unit dose increases by a factor of more than 3 between 12.4 and 25 keV. Additionally, those higher energy data provide more information, evidenced by an increase in high-resolution limit of up to 0.3 [A], pointing to a high energy future for synchrotron-based macromolecular crystallography.",

Gammarid amphipods attained considerable diversity, becoming the worlds second most speciose ancient-lake amphipod radiation. Nonetheless, apart from a few invasive species, this group remains poorly studied. Herein, we review and quantify the taxonomic, morphological and ecological diversity, as well as phylogenetic context of Ponto-Caspian gammarids within the adaptive radiation framework. Published molecular phylogenies indicate that this radiation has a monophyletic mid-Miocene Paratethyan origin, and is nested within the morphologically-conserved Atlanto-Mediterranean genus Echinogammarus. We find extensive disparity in body shape, size, ornamentation and appendage length, along a broad ecological gradient from mountain springs to depths exceeding 500 m, on virtually all substrate types (including symbiosis). We propose four putative ecomorphs that appear convergent with distantly related oceanic and Baikal Lake taxa. Thus, the identified patterns support the adaptive radiation model, although extensive further research is needed. A checklist and provisional key to all known endemic species are provided to facilitate taxonomic research. Ponto-Caspian gammarids could be a potentially powerful model for studying adaptive radiations and invasive species evolution.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of Alzheimers disease is the aggregation of insoluble amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles. A key histopathological observation is that tau protein aggregates follow a structured progression pattern through the brain. Mathematical network models of prion-like propagation have the ability to capture such patterns but a number of factors impact the observed staging result, thus introducing questions regarding model selection. Here, we introduce a novel approach, based on braid diagrams, for studying the structured progression of a marker evolving on a network. We apply this approach to a six-stage  Braak patternof tau proteins, in Alzheimers disease, motivated by a recent observation that seed-competent tau precedes tau aggregation. We show that the different modeling choices, from the model parameters to the connectome resolution, play a significant role in the landscape of observable staging patterns. Our approach provides a systematic way to approach model selection for network propagation of neurodegenerative diseases that ensures both reproducibility and optimal parameter fitting.\n\nAuthor summaryNetwork diffusion models of neurodegenerative diseases are a class of dynamical systems that simulate the evolution of toxic proteins on the connectome. These models predict, from an initial seed, a pattern of invasion called staging. The generalized staging problem seeks to systematically study the effect of various model choices on staging. We introduce methods based on braid diagrams to test the possible staging landscape of a model and how it depends on the choice of connectome, as well as the model parameters. Our primary finding is that connectome construction, the choice of the graph Laplacian, and transport models all have an impact on staging that should be taken into account in any study.",

Within the stomach, inflammation drives a well-established sequence from gastritis to metaplasia, eventually resulting in adenocarcinoma. Unfortunately, the processes that regulate gastric inflammation and prevent carcinogenesis remain unknown. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA-binding protein that promotes the turnover of numerous pro-inflammatory and oncogenic mRNAs. Here, we utilized a TTP-overexpressing model, the TTP{Delta}ARE mouse, to examine whether TTP can protect the stomach from adrenalectomy (ADX)-induced gastric inflammation and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM). We found that TTP{Delta}ARE mice were completely protected from ADX-induced gastric inflammation and SPEM. RNA sequencing revealed that TTP overexpression suppressed the expression of genes associated with the innate immune response. Finally, we show that protection from gastric inflammation was only partially due to suppression of Tnf, a well-known TTP target. Our results demonstrate that TTP exerts broad anti-inflammatory effects in the stomach and suggest that therapies that increase TTP expression may be effective treatments of pro-neoplastic gastric inflammation.",

To try and understand the basis for activation we isolated additional substitutions at this position and found that only the original substitution produced an active mutant whereas drastic changes resulted in an inactive mutant. In another approach we isolated suppressors of an inactive FtsL mutant and obtained FtsWE289G and FtsIK211I and found they bypassed FtsN. Epistatic analysis of these mutations and others confirmed that the FtsN-triggered activation signal goes from FtsQLB to FtsI to FtsW. Mapping these mutations and others affecting the activities of FtsWI on the RodA-PBP2 structure revealed they are located at the interaction interface between the extracellular loop 4 (ECL4) of FtsW and the pedestal domain of FtsI (PBP3). This supports a model in which the interaction between the ECL4 of SEDS proteins and the pedestal domain of their cognate bPBPs plays a critical role in the activation mechanism.\n\nAuthor summaryBacterial cell division requires the synthesis of septal peptidoglycan by the widely conserved SEDS-bPBP protein complex FtsWI, but how the complex is activated during cell division is still poorly understood. Previous studies suggest that FtsN initiates a signaling cascade in the periplasm to activate FtsW. Here we isolated and characterized activated FtsW and FtsI mutants and confirmed that the signaling cascade for FtsW activation goes from FtsN to FtsQLB to FtsI and then to FtsW. The residues corresponding to mutations affecting FtsWI activation are clustered to a small region of the interaction interface between the pedestal domain of FtsI and the extracellular loop 4 of FtsW, suggesting that this interaction mediates activation of FtsW. This is strikingly similar to the proposed activation mechanism for the RodA-PBP2 complex, another SEDS-bPBP complex required for cell elongation. Thus, the two homologous SEDS-bPBP complexes are activated similarly by completely unrelated activators that modulate the interaction interface between the SEDS proteins and the bPBPs.",
