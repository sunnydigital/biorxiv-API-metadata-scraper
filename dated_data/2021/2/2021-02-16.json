    "abstract": "Go is the alpha subunit of the major heterotrimeric G protein in neurons and mediates signaling by every known neurotransmitter, yet the signaling mechanisms activated by Go remain to be fully elucidated. Genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that Go signaling inhibits neuronal activity and neurotransmitter release, but studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have been limited by lack of tools to complement genetic studies with other experimental approaches. Here we demonstrate that inserting the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into an internal loop of the Go protein results in a tagged protein that is functional in vivo and that facilitates cell biological and biochemical studies of Go. Transgenic expression of Go-GFP rescues the defects caused by loss of endogenous Go in assays of egg laying and locomotion behaviors. Defects in body morphology caused by loss of Go are also rescued by Go-GFP. The Go-GFP protein is localized to the plasma membrane of neurons, mimicking localization of endogenous Go. Using GFP as an epitope tag, Go-GFP can be immunoprecipitated from C. elegans lysates to purify Go protein complexes. The Go-GFP transgene reported in this study enables studies involving in vivo localization and biochemical purification of Go to complement the already well-developed genetic analysis of Go signaling.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the diversity of cortical glutamatergic synapses is still only partially understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that presynaptic active zones (AZs) are constructed from molecularly uniform, independent release sites (RSs), the number of which scales linearly with the AZ size. Paired recordings between hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons followed by quantal analysis demonstrate large variability in the number of RSs (N) at these connections. High resolution molecular analysis of functionally characterized synapses reveals highly variable Munc13-1 content of AZs that possess the same N. Replica immunolabeling also shows a 3-fold variability in the Munc13-1 content of AZs of identical size. Munc13-1 is clustered within the AZs; cluster size and density are also variable. Our results provide evidence for quantitative molecular heterogeneity of RSs and support a model in which the AZ is built up from variable numbers of molecularly heterogeneous, but independent RSs.",

    "abstract": "Within the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of ion channels, TRPV5 is a highly Ca2+-selective channel important for active reabsorption of Ca2+ in the kidney. Its channel activity is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism involving calmodulin (CaM) binding. Combining advanced microscopy techniques and biochemical assays, this study characterized the dynamic bilobal CaM regulation and binding stoichiometry. We demonstrate for the first time that functional (full-length) TRPV5 interacts with CaM in the absence of Ca2+, and this interaction is intensified at increasing Ca2+ concentrations sensed by the CaM C-lobe that achieves channel pore blocking. Channel inactivation occurs without CaM N-lobe calcification. Moreover, we reveal a 1:2 stoichiometry of TRPV5:CaM binding by implementing single molecule photobleaching counting, a technique with great potential for studying TRP channel regulation. In conclusion, our study proposes a new model for CaM- dependent regulation - calmodulation - of the Ca2+-selective TRPV5 that involves apoCaM interaction and lobe-specific actions.",

Despite the maternal hb mRNA acting as a paradigm for translational regulation, due to its repression in the posterior of the embryo, little is known about the translatability of zygotically transcribed hb mRNAs. Here we adapt the SunTag system, developed for imaging translation at single mRNA resolution in tissue culture cells, to the Drosophila embryo to study the translation dynamics of zygotic hb mRNAs. Using singlemolecule imaging in fixed and live embryos, we provide evidence for translational repression of zygotic SunTag-hb mRNAs. While the proportion of SunTag-hb mRNAs translated is initially uniform, translation declines from the anterior over time until it becomes restricted to a posterior band in the expression domain. We discuss how regulated hb mRNA translation may help establish the sharp Hb expression boundary, which is a model for precision and noise during developmental patterning. Overall, our data show how use of the SunTag method on fixed and live embryos is a powerful combination for elucidating spatiotemporal regulation of mRNA translation in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThrombotic and microvascular complications are frequently seen in deceased COVID-19 patients. However, whether this is caused by direct viral infection of the endothelium or inflammation-induced endothelial activation remains highly contentious.\n\nMethodsHere, we use patient autopsy samples, primary human endothelial cells and an in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial cell barrier to show that primary human endothelial cells express very low levels the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2.\n\nResultsAccordingly, endothelial cells can only be infected when SARS-CoV-2 is present at very high concentrations. However, this is not a productive infection (i.e. no infectious virus is produced) and viral entry induces an inflammatory response. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect endothelial cells in 3D vessels under flow conditions. We further demonstrate that in a co-culture model endothelial cells are not infected with SARS-CoV-2. They do however sense and respond to infection in the adjacent epithelial cells, increasing ICAM-1 expression and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, these data suggest that in vivo, endothelial cells are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that infection is only likely to occur if the adjacent pulmonary epithelium is denuded (basolateral infection) or a high viral load is present in the blood (apical infection). In such a scenario, whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection of the endothelium can occur, it does not contribute to viral amplification. However, endothelial cells are still likely to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by sensing adjacent infection and mounting a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Chemical control strategies are driving the evolution of pesticide resistance in pest populations. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of these evolutionary processes is of crucial importance to develop sustainable resistance management strategies. The acaricide pyflubumide is one of the most recently developed mitochondrial complex II inhibitors with a new mode of action that specifically targets spider mite pests. In this study, we characterize the molecular basis of pyflubumide resistance in a highly resistant population of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Classical genetic crosses indicated that pyflubumide resistance was incompletely recessive and controlled by more than one gene. To identify resistance loci, we crossed the resistant population to a highly susceptible T. urticae inbred strain and propagated resulting populations with and without pyflubumide exposure for multiple generations in an experimental evolution set-up. High-resolution genetic mapping by a bulked segregant analysis approach led to the identification of three quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to pyflubumide resistance. Two QTLs were found on the first chromosome and centered on the cytochrome P450 CYP392A16 and a cluster of CYP392E6-8 genes. Comparative transcriptomics revealed a consistent overexpression of CYP392A16 and CYP392E8 in the experimental populations that were selected for pyflubumide resistance. We further corroborated the involvement of CYP392A16 in resistance by in vitro functional expression and metabolism studies. Collectively, these experiments uncovered that CYP392A16 N-demethylates the toxic carboxamide form of pyflubumide to a non-toxic compound. A third QTL coincided with cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), a vital component of cytochrome P450 metabolism. We show here that the resistant population harbors three gene copies of CPR and that this copy number variation is associated with higher mRNA abundance. Together, we provide evidence for detoxification of pyflubumide by cytochrome P450s that is likely synergized by gene amplification of CPR.\n\nAuthor summaryOur understanding of the causal genetic variants that drive the evolution of quantitative traits, such as polygenic pesticide resistance, remains very limited. Here, we followed a high-resolution genetic mapping approach to localize the genetic variants that cause pyflubumide resistance in the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Three well-supported QTL were uncovered and pointed towards a major role for cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification. Cis-regulatory variation for cytochrome P450s was observed, and in vitro cytochrome P450 experiments showed that pyflubumide was metabolized into a non-toxic derivate. A third QTL centered on cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is required for cytochrome P450 activity, and is amplified in pyflubumide resistant populations. Our results indicate that pyflubumide resistance is mediated by cytochrome P450 detoxification that is enhanced by gene amplification at the CPR locus.\n\nData availabilitySequence data has been deposited at the Sequence Read Archive (PRJNA596790).

    "abstract": "BackgroundSemantic similarity between concepts in knowledge graphs is essential for several bioinformatics applications, including the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the discovery of associations between diseases and genes. Although knowledge graphs describe entities in terms of several perspectives (or semantic aspects), state-of-the-art semantic similarity measures are general-purpose. This can represent a challenge since different use cases for the application of semantic similarity may need different similarity perspectives and ultimately depend on expert knowledge for manual fine-tuning.\n\nResultsWe present a new approach that uses supervised machine learning to tailor aspect-oriented semantic similarity measures to fit a particular view on biological similarity or relatedness. We implement and evaluate it using different combinations of representative semantic similarity measures and machine learning methods with four biological similarity views: protein-protein interaction, protein function similarity, protein sequence similarity and phenotype-based gene similarity.\n\nConclusionsThe results demonstrate that our approach outperforms non-supervised methods, producing semantic similarity models that fit different biological perspectives significantly better than the commonly used manual combinations of semantic aspects.",

Despite its widespread use, the effect of finite tissue size on model-predicted spatiotemporal morphogen distributions has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we analytically investigated the spatiotemporal distributions of morphogens predicted by a reaction-diffusion model in a finite 1D domain, as a proxy for a biological tissue, and compared it with the solution of the infinite-domain model. We explored the reduced parameter, the tissue length in units of a characteristic reaction-diffusion length, and identified two reaction-diffusion regimes separated by a crossover tissue size estimated in [~]3.3 characteristic reaction-diffusion lengths. While above this crossover the infinite-domain model constitutes a good approximation, it breaks below this crossover, whereas the finite-domain model faithfully describes the entire parameter space. We evaluated whether the infinite-domain model renders accurate estimations of diffusion coefficients when fitted to finite spatial profiles, a procedure typically followed in Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. We found that the infinite-domain model overestimates diffusion coefficients when the domain is smaller than the crossover tissue size. Thus, the crossover tissue size may be instrumental in selecting the suitable reaction-diffusion model to study tissue morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "There has been a spate of interest in association networks in biological and medical research, for example, genetic interaction networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, the extended joint hub graphical lasso (EDOHA), to estimate multiple related interaction networks for high dimensional omics data across multiple distinct classes. To be specific, we construct a convex penalized log likelihood optimization problem and solve it with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed method can also be adapted to estimate interaction networks for high dimensional compositional data such as microbial interaction networks. The performance of the proposed method in the simulated studies shows that EDOHA has remarkable advantages in recognizing class-specific hubs than the existing comparable methods. We also present three applications of real datasets. Biological interpretations of our results confirm those of previous studies and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism in disease.\n\nAuthor summaryReconstruction of multiple association networks from high dimensional omics data is an important topic, especially in biology. Previous studies focused on estimating different networks and detecting common hubs among all classes. Integration of information over different classes of data while allowing difference in the hub nodes is also biologically plausible. Therefore, we propose a method, EDOHA, to jointly construct multiple interaction networks with capacity in finding different hub networks for each class of data. Simulation studies show the better performance over conventional methods. The method has been demonstrated in three real world data.",

Our novel multi-task prediction paradigm--where participants complete four sequence learning tasks, each being a different instance of a common generative family--allows the separate study of within-task learning (i.e., finding the solution to each of the tasks), and across-task learning (i.e., learning a task differently because of past experiences). The very first responses participants make in each task are not yet affected by within-task learning and thus reflect their priors. Our results show that these priors change across successive tasks, increasingly resembling the underlying generative family. We conceptualize multi-task learning as arising from a mixture-of-generative-models learning strategy, whereby participants simultaneously entertain multiple candidate models which compete against each other to explain the experienced sequences.

    "abstract": "Clearance of viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV), must be fine-tuned to eliminate the pathogen without causing immunopathology. As such, an aggressive initial innate immune response favors the host in contrast to a detrimental prolonged inflammation. The complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immune system and contributes to the response by directly clearing pathogens or infected cells, as well as recruiting proinflammatory immune cells and regulating inflammation. However, the impact of modulating complement activation in viral infections is still unclear. In this work, we targeted the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a surface protein that protects cells from non-specific complement attack, and analyzed its role in IAV infections. We found that DAF modulates IAV infection in vivo, via an interplay with the antigenic viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a strain specific manner. Our results reveal that, contrary to what could be expected, DAF potentiates complement activation, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. We also show that viral NA acts on the heavily sialylated DAF and propose that it exacerbates complement activation, leading to lung immunopathology. Remarkably, this mechanism has no impact on viral loads but rather on the host resilience to infection and may have direct implications in zoonotic influenza transmissions.\n\nAuthor summaryExacerbated complement activation and immune deregulation are at the basis of several pathologies induced by respiratory viruses. Here, we report that complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which inhibits complement activation in healthy cells, increases disease severity upon Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Remarkably, DAF interaction with IAV proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), resulted in excessive complement activation and recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells, without affecting viral loads. Furthermore, we observed that viral NA directly cleaves DAF and promotes complement activation, providing a possible link between IAV-DAF interaction and pathology. Therefore, our results unveil a novel pathway that could modulate disease severity, which may help to understand the increased pathogenicity of zoonotic and pandemic IAV infections.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of the foodborne disease listeriosis, one of the deadliest bacterial infections known. In order to cause disease, L. monocytogenes must properly coordinate its metabolic and virulence programs in response to rapidly changing environments within the host. However, the mechanisms by which L. monocytogenes senses and adapts to the many stressors encountered as it transits through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and disseminates to peripheral organs are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of the redox-responsive transcriptional regulator Rex in L. monocytogenes growth and pathogenesis. Rex is a conserved canonical transcriptional repressor that monitors the intracellular redox state of the cell by sensing the ratio of reduced and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NADH and NAD+, respectively). Here, we demonstrated that L. monocytogenes Rex represses fermentative metabolism and is therefore required for optimal growth in the presence of oxygen. We also show that Rex represses the production of virulence factors required for survival and invasion of the GI tract, as a strain lacking rex was more resistant to acidified bile and invaded host cells better than wt. Consistent with these results, Rex was dispensable for colonizing the GI tract and disseminating to peripheral organs in an oral listeriosis model of infection. However, Rex-dependent regulation was required for colonizing the spleen and liver, and L. monocytogenes lacking the Rex repressor were nearly sterilized from the gallbladder. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Rex functions as a repressor of fermentative metabolism and suggests a role for Rex-dependent regulation in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis. Importantly, the gallbladder is the bacterial reservoir during listeriosis, and our data suggest redox sensing and Rex-dependent regulation are necessary for bacterial survival and replication in this organ.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYListeriosis is a foodborne illness caused by Listeria monocytogenes and is one of the deadliest bacterial infections known, with a mortality rate of up to 30%. Following ingestion of contaminated food, L. monocytogenes disseminates from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to peripheral organs, including the spleen, liver, and gallbladder. In this work, we investigated the role of the global redox-responsive regulator Rex in L. monocytogenes growth and pathogenesis. We demonstrated that Rex derepression coordinates expression of genes necessary in the GI tract during infection, including fermentative metabolism, bile resistance, and invasion of host cells. Accordingly, Rex was dispensable for colonizing the GI tract of mice during an oral listeriosis infection. Interestingly, Rex-dependent regulation was required for bacterial replication in the spleen, liver, and gallbladder. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Rex-mediated redox sensing and transcriptional regulation are important for L. monocytogenes metabolic adaptation and virulence.",

    "abstract": "Marine sponges are known for their antimicrobial, antifungal, and cytotoxic activity. In this study, the activity of aqueous and ethanoic extracts of 3 sponges from Martinique were tested on 5 bacterial strains: Bascillus cereus (CIP 783), Echerichia coli (CIP 54127), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CIP A22), Staphylococcus aureus (CIP 67.8) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (CIP 76125). The antimicrobial activity of Agelas clathrodes, Desmapsamma anchorata, and Verongula rigida, was demonstrated using the disc diffusion method and by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration. The ethanoic extract of Agelas clathrodes had an inhibitory activity specifically on Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. No activity was observed for the other extracts. Further chemical analyses will be carried out in order to identify the active molecules of these sponges.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of thousands of genetic variants associated with complex diseases and traits. However, most variants are noncoding and not clearly linked to genes, making it challenging to interpret these GWAS signals. We present a systematic variant-to-function study, prioritizing the most likely functional elements of the genome for experimental follow-up, for >148,000 variants identified for hematological traits. Specifically, we developed VAMPIRE: Variant Annotation Method Pointing to Interesting Regulatory Effects, an interactive web application implemented in R Shiny (http://shiny.bios.unc.edu/vampire/). This tool efficiently integrates and displays information from multiple complementary sources, including epigenomic signatures from blood cell relevant tissues or cells, functional and conservation summary scores, variant impact on protein and gene expression, chromatin conformation information, as well as publicly available GWAS and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) results. Leveraging data generated from independently performed functional validation experiments, we demonstrate that our prioritized variants, genes, or variant-gene links are significantly more likely to be experimentally validated. This study not only has important implications for systematic and efficient revelation of functional mechanisms underlying GWAS variants for hematological traits, but also provides a prototype that can be adapted to many other complex traits, paving the path for efficient variant to function (V2F) analyses.",

    "abstract": "We performed a comparative analysis of replication origin activation by genome-wide single-stranded DNA mapping in two common laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae challenged by hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of the ribonucleotide reductase. By doing so we gained understanding of the impact on origin activation by three factors: replication checkpoint control, DNA sequence polymorphisms, and relative positioning of origin and transcription unit. Our analysis recapitulated the previous finding that the majority of origins are subject to checkpoint control by the Rad53 kinase when cells were treated with HU. In addition, origins either subject to Rad53 checkpoint control or impervious to it are largely concordant between the two strains. However, these two strains also produced different dynamics of origin activation. First, the W303-RAD53 cells showed a significant reduction of fork progression than A364a-RAD53 cells. This phenotype was accompanied by an elevated level of Rad53 phosphorylation in W303-RAD53 cells. Second, W303-rad53K227A checkpoint-deficient cells activated a greater number of origins accompanied by global reduction of ssDNA across all origins compared to A364a-rad53K227A cells; and this is correlated with lower expression level of the mutant protein in W303 than in A364a. We also show that sequence polymorphism in the consensus motifs of the replication origins plays a minor role in determining origin usage. Remarkably, eight strain-specific origins lack the canonical 11-bp consensus motif for autonomously replicating sequences in either strain background. Finally, we identified a new class of origins that are only active in checkpoint-proficient cells, which we named \"Rad53-dependent origins\". The only discernible feature of these origins is that they tend to overlap with an open reading frame, suggesting previously unexplored connection between transcription and origin activation. Our study presents a comprehensive list of origin usage in two diverse yeast genetic backgrounds, fine-tunes the different categories of origins with respect to checkpoint control, and provokes further exploration of the interplay between origin activation and transcription.\n\nAuthor SummaryComparative analysis of origins of replication in two laboratory yeast strains reveals new insights into origin activation, regulation and dependency on the Rad53 checkpoint kinase.",

We examined the discharge characteristics and inactivation effects of intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons--two major types of cortical excitatory neurons that project to cortical and subcortical structures, respectively--in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice performing a delayed response task. We found that IT neurons, but not PT neurons, convey significant working memory-related signals. We also found that the inactivation of IT neurons, but not PT neurons, impairs behavioral performance. In contrast, PT neurons convey far more temporal information than IT neurons during the delay period.

    "abstract": "For metastasis to occur, cancer cells must traverse a range of tissue environments. In part, this is accomplished by cells adjusting their migration mode to one that is best suited to the environment. Melanoma cells have been shown to be particularly plastic, frequently using both mesenchymal and amoeboid (bleb-based) modes of migration. It has been demonstrated that 2D confinement will promote the transition from mesenchymal to bleb-based migration. However, if melanoma cells similarly transition to bleb-based migration in response to 3D confinement, such as within narrow channels, is unknown. Here, using micro-fabricated channels, we demonstrate that melanoma cells adopt features of both mesenchymal and bleb-based migration. In narrow (8 m; height and width) channels coated with fibronectin, ~50% of melanoma cells were found to use either mesenchymal or bleb-based migration modes. In contrast, the inhibition of Src family kinases or coating channels with BSA, completely eliminated any features of mesenchymal migration. Detailed comparisons of migration parameters revealed that blebbing cells, particularly in the absence of adhesions, were faster than mesenchymal cells. In contrast to what has been previously shown under conditions of 2D confinement, pharmacologically inhibiting Arp2/3 promoted a fast filopodial-based mode of migration. Accordingly, we report that melanoma cells adopt a unique range of phenotypes under conditions of 3D confinement.",

    "abstract": "Daily life is full of situations where many people converse at the same time. Under these noisy circumstances, individuals can employ different listening strategies to deal with the abundance of sounds around them. In this fMRI study we investigated how applying two different listening strategies - Selective vs. Distributed attention - affects the pattern of neural activity. Specifically, in a simulated  cocktail party paradigm, we compared brain activation patterns when listeners attend selectively to only one speaker and ignore all others, versus when they distribute their attention and attempt to follow two or four speakers at the same time. Results indicate that the two attention types activate a highly overlapping, bilateral fronto-temporal-parietal network of functionally connected regions. This network includes auditory association cortex (bilateral STG/STS) and higher-level regions related to speech processing and attention (bilateral IFG/insula, right MFG, left IPS). Within this network, responses in specific areas were modulated by the type of attention required. Specifically, auditory and speech-processing regions exhibited higher activity during Distributed attention, whereas fronto-parietal regions were activated more strongly during Selective attention. This pattern suggests that a common perceptual-attentional network is engaged when dealing with competing speech-inputs, regardless of the specific task at hand. At the same time, local activity within nodes of this network varies when implementing different listening strategies, reflecting the different cognitive demands they impose. These results nicely demonstrate the systems flexibility to adapt its internal computations to accommodate different task requirements and listener goals.\n\nSignificance StatementHearing many people talk simultaneously poses substantial challenges for the human perceptual and cognitive systems. We compared neural activity when listeners applied two different listening strategy to deal with these competing inputs: attending selectively to one speaker vs. distributing attention among all speakers. A network of functionally connected brain regions, involved in auditory processing, language processing and attentional control was activated when applying both attention types. However, activity within this network was modulated by the type of attention required and the number of competing speakers. These results suggest a common  attention to speech network, providing the computational infrastructure to deal effectively with multi-speaker input, but with sufficient flexibility to implement different prioritization strategies and to adapt to different listener goals.",

    "abstract": "The topographical distribution of oscillatory power in the alpha band is known to vary depending on the current focus of spatial attention. Here, we investigated to what extend univariate and multivariate measures of post-stimulus alpha power are sensitive to the required spatial specificity of a task. To this end, we varied the perceptual load and the spatial demand in an auditory search paradigm. A centrally presented sound at the beginning of each trial indicated the to-be-localized target sound. This spatially unspecific pre-cue was followed by a sound array, containing either two (low perceptual load) or four (high perceptual load) simultaneously presented lateralized sound stimuli. In separate task blocks, participants were instructed either to report whether the target was located on the left or the right side of the sound array (low spatial demand) or to indicate the exact target location (high spatial demand). Univariate alpha lateralization magnitude was neither affected by perceptual load nor by spatial demand. However, an analysis of onset latencies revealed that alpha lateralization emerged earlier in low (vs. high) perceptual load trials as well as in low (vs. high) spatial demand trials. Finally, we trained a classifier to decode the specific target location based on the multivariate alpha power scalp topography. A comparison of decoding accuracy in the low and high spatial demand conditions suggests that the amount of spatial information present in the scalp distribution of alpha-band power increases as the task demands a higher degree of spatial specificity. Altogether, the results offer new insights into how the dynamic adaption of alpha-band oscillations in response to changing task demands is associated with post-stimulus attentional processing.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveVascular lumen formation requires the redistribution of intracellular proteins to instruct apico-basal polarity, thereby enforcing maturation of both luminal and basal domains. In the absence of proper apical signaling, lumen formation can be distorted leading to lumen collapse and cessation of blood flow. Synaptotagmin-like protein-2a (Slp2a) has been implicated in apical membrane signaling; however, the role of Slp2a in vascular lumen formation has never been assessed.\n\nApproach and ResultsOur results demonstrate that Slp2a is required for vascular lumen formation. Using a 3- dimensional sprouting assay, sub-cellular imaging, and zebrafish blood vessel development we establish that Slp2a resides at the apical membrane acting as a tether for Rab27a that decorates Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). Unique to endothelial tissue, we show that Slp2a regulates exocytic activity of WPBs, thus regulating release of WPB contents into the luminal space during angiogenesis. Angiopoietin-2 is a Tie-2 receptor ligand that is selectively released from WPB secretory granules. We identify a critical role for angiopoietin-2 in regulating endothelial lumenization and show that in the absence of Slp2a, WPB contents cannot fuse with the apical membrane. This disrupts the release of angiopoietin-2 and blocks Tie-2 signaling necessary for proper lumen formation.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate a novel requirement of Slp2a for vascular lumen formation. Moreover, we show that Slp2a is required for the exocytic release of WPB secretory granule cargo during vascular lumen development, and thus is a core upstream component of the WPB secretory pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that WPB-housed angiopoietin-2 is required for vascular lumen formation.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISynaptotagmin-like protein-2a (Slp2a) is required for vascular lumen formation via its interaction with Rab27a and Weibel Palade Body secretory granules.\nC_LIO_LISlp2a is recruited to the apical membrane where it regulates secretion of Weibel Palade Body components into the luminal space.\nC_LIO_LIIn the absence of Slp2a, Weibel Palade Body-housed angiopoietin-2 ligand cannot be exocytosed, this impedes activation of Tie-2 signaling required for lumen biogenesis.\nC_LIO_LIKnockout of Slp2a or Tie-2 in zebrafish blunts the formation of vascular lumens during angiogenic development.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "RationaleWe recently demonstrated that the  Metabesity factor HMG20A regulates islet beta-cell functional maturity and adaptation to physiological stress such as pregnancy and pre-diabetes. HMG20A also dictates central nervous system (CNS) development via inhibition of the LSD1/CoREST complex but its expression pattern and function in adult brain remains unknown. Herein we sought to determine whether HMG20A is expressed in the adult CNS, specifically in hypothalamic astrocytes that are key in glucose homeostasis and whether similar to islets, HMG20A potentiates astrocyte function in response to environmental cues.\n\nMethodsHMG20A expression profile was assessed by quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and/or immunofluorescence in: 1) the hypothalamus of mice exposed or not to a high-fat diet, 2) human blood leukocytes and adipose tissue obtained from healthy or diabetic individuals 3) primary mouse hypothalamic astrocytes exposed to either high glucose or palmitate. To investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of HMG20A, RNA-seq and cell metabolic parameters were performed on astrocytes treated or not with a siHMG20A. The regulatory function of HMG20A on astrogliosis was also assessed pharmacologically using ORY1001. Astrocyte-mediated neuronal survival was evaluated using conditioned media from siHMG20A-treated astrocytes.\n\nResultsWe show that Hmg20a is predominantly expressed in hypothalamic astrocytes, the main nutrient-sensing cell type of the brain. Hmg20A expression was upregulated in diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerant mice, correlating with increased transcript levels of Gfap and Il1b indicative of inflammation and astrogliosis. Expression levels were also increased in adipose tissue of obese non-diabetic individuals as compared to obese diabetic patients. HMG20A silencing in astrocytes resulted in repression of inflammatory, cholesterol biogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways with a concomitant increase in apoptosis and reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics. Motoneuron viability was also hindered in HMG20A-depleted astrocyte-derived conditioned media. Astrogliosis was induced using ORY1001, a pharmacological inhibitor of the LSD1/CoREST complex, mimicking the effect of HMG20A.\n\nConclusionHMG20A coordinates the astrocyte polarization state. Under physiological pressure such as obesity and insulin resistance that induces low grade inflammation, HMG20A expression is increased to induce astrogliosis in an attempt to preserve the neuronal network and glucose homeostasis. Nonetheless, a chronic metabesity state or functional mutations will result in lower levels of HMG20A, failure to promote astrogliosis and increase susceptibility of neurons to stress-mediated apoptosis. Such effects could be therapeutically reversed by ORY1001-induced astrogliosis.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms need to adapt to environmental changes, and genome plasticity can lead to rapid adaptation to hostile environments by increasing genetic diversity. Here, we investigate genome plasticity in the CTG(Ser1) yeast Scheffersomyces stipitis, an organism with an enormous potential for second-generation biofuel production. We demonstrate that S. stipitis has an intrinsically plastic genome and that different S. stipitis isolates have genomes with distinct chromosome organisation. Real-time evolution experiments show that S. stipitis genome plasticity is common and rapid as extensive genomic changes with fitness benefits are detected following in vitro evolution experiments. Hybrid MinION Nanopore and Illumina genome sequencing identifies retrotransposons as major drivers of genome diversity. Indeed, the number and position of retrotransposons is different in different S. stipitis isolates, and retrotransposon-rich regions of the genome are sites of chromosome rearrangements. Our findings provide important insights into the adaptation strategies of the CTG (Ser1) yeast clade and have critical implications in the development of second-generation biofuels. These data highlight that genome plasticity is an essential factor to be considered for the development of sustainable S. stipitis platforms for second-generation biofuels production.",

    "abstract": "Cells can respond to the physical stimulus that comes from their micro-environments. There are several strategies to alter cell behavior. Several tissues like bone and cartilage, which are the point of interest of regenerative medicine, are under significant degrees of mechanical stress in real life. Within this stress, the arising mechanotransduction effect may trigger several behavioral responses on cells. As a novel and efficient way, magnetic nanoparticles can be used to make such a mechanotransductive effect on cells.\n\nIn this study, pre-functionalized Fe3O4 superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized and used to fabricate gelatin-based magnetic cryogels. Cell growth, tissue-specific metabolic activities, differentiation potential to the bone, and cartilage under static magnetic field at different magnetic field strength (1000-4000G) were investigated. Results indicated that there was a better induction in considerable higher magnetic field among all others and magnetic cryogels helps to mediate mesenchymal stem cell behaviour, promote their growth and induce osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Ontogenesis is the development of an organism from its earliest stage to maturity, including homeostasis maintenance throughout adulthood despite environmental perturbations. Almost all cells of a multicellular organism share the same genomic information. Nevertheless, phenotypic diversity and complex supra-cellular architectures emerge at every level, starting from tissues and organs. This is possible thanks to a robust and dynamic interplay of regulative mechanisms.\n\nTo study ontogenesis, it is necessary to consider different levels of regulation, both genetic and epigenetic. Each cell undergoes a specific path across a landscape of possible regulative states affecting both its structure and its functions during development. This paper proposes using the Nets-Within-Nets formalism, which combines Petri Nets simplicity with the capability to represent and simulate the interplay between different layers of regulation connected by non-trivial and context-dependent hierarchical relations.\n\nIn particular, this work introduces a modeling strategy based on Nets-Within-Nets that can model several critical processes involved in ontogenesis. Moreover, it presents a case study focusing on the first phase of Vulval Precursor Cells specification in C. Elegans. The case study shows that the proposed model can simulate the emergent morphogenetic pattern corresponding to the observed developmental outcome of that phase, in both the physiological case and different mutations.

    "abstract": "Virus host shifts are a major source of outbreaks and emerging infectious diseases, and predicting the outcome of novel host and virus interactions remains a key challenge for virus research. The evolutionary relationships between host species can explain variation in transmission rates, virulence, and virus community composition between hosts, but the potential for different viruses to interact with host species effects has yet to be established. Here, we measure correlations in viral load of four Cripavirus isolates across experimental infections of 45 Drosophilidae host species. We find positive correlations between every pair of viruses tested, suggesting that broadly susceptible host clades could act as reservoirs and donors for certain types of viruses. Additionally, we find evidence of genotype-by-genotype interactions between viruses and host species, highlighting the importance of both host and virus traits in determining the outcome of virus host shifts. More closely related viruses tended to be more strongly correlated, providing tentative evidence that virus evolutionary relatedness may be a useful proxy for determining the likelihood of novel virus emergence, which warrants further research.\n\nImpact SummaryMany new infectious diseases are caused by viruses jumping into novel host species. Estimating the probability that jumps will occur, what the characteristics of new viruses will be, and how they are likely to evolve after jumping to new host species are major challenges. To solve these challenges, we require a detailed understanding of the interactions between different viruses and hosts, or metrics that can capture some of the variation in these interactions. Previous studies have shown that the evolutionary relationships between host species can be used to predict traits of infections in different hosts, including transmission rates and the damage caused by infection. However, the potential for different viruses to influence the patterns of these host species effects has yet to be determined. Here, we use four viruses of insects in experimental infections across 45 different fruit fly host species to begin to answer this question. We find similarities in the patterns of replication and persistence between all four viruses, suggesting susceptible groups of related hosts could act as reservoirs and donors for certain types of virus. However, we also find evidence that different virus genotypes interact in different ways with some host species. Viruses that were more closely related tended to behave in similar ways, and so we suggest that virus evolutionary relatedness may prove to be a useful metric for predicting the traits of novel infections and should be explored further in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Current theories propose that the short-term retention of information in working memory (WM) and the recall of information from long-term memory (LTM) are supported by overlapping neural mechanisms in occipital and parietal cortex. Both are thought to rely on reinstating patterns of sensory activity evoked by the perception of the remembered item. However, the extent of the shared representations between WM and LTM are unclear, and it is unknown how WM and LTM representations may differ across cortical regions. We designed a spatial memory task that allowed us to directly compare the representations of remembered spatial information in WM and LTM. Critically, we carefully matched the precision of behavioral responses in these tasks. We used fMRI and multivariate pattern analyses to examine representations in (1) retinotopic cortex and (2) lateral parietal cortex (LPC) regions previously implicated in LTM. We show that visual memories were represented in a sensory-like code in both tasks across retinotopic regions in occipital and parietal cortex. LPC regions also encoded remembered locations in both WM and LTM, but in a format that differed from the sensory-evoked activity. These results suggest a striking correspondence in the format of WM and LTM representations across occipital and parietal cortex. On the other hand, we show that activity patterns in nearly all parietal regions, but not occipital regions, contained information that could discriminate between WM trials and LTM trials. Our data provide new evidence for theories of memory systems and the representation of mnemonic content.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly rewire host signaling pathways to support the viral lifecycle and regulate host cell responses. Here we show that SMAD3 expression is regulated by HCMV miR-UL22A and contributes to the IRF7-mediated induction of type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in human fibroblasts. Addition of exogenous TGF{beta} interferes with the replication of a miR-UL22A mutant virus in a SMAD3-dependent manner in wild type fibroblasts, but not in cells lacking IRF7, indicating that downregulation of SMAD3 expression to limit IFN induction is important for efficient lytic replication. These findings uncover a novel interplay between SMAD3 and innate immunity during HCMV infection and highlight the role of viral miRNAs in modulating these responses.\n\nAuthor SummaryCells trigger the interferon (IFN) response to induce the expression of cellular genes that limit virus replication. In turn, viruses have evolved numerous countermeasures to avoid the effects of IFN signaling. Using a microRNA (miRNA) mutant virus we have uncovered a novel means of regulating the IFN response during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Lytic HCMV infection induces the production of TGF{beta}, which binds to the TGF{beta} receptor and activates the receptor-associated SMAD SMAD3. SMAD3, together with IRF7, induces the expression of IFN{beta} and downstream IFN-stimulated genes in human fibroblasts. To counteract this, HCMV miR-UL22A, along with other HCMV gene products, directly targets SMAD3 for downregulation. Infection of fibroblasts with a miR-UL22A mutant virus results in enhanced type I IFN production in a SMAD3-dependent manner and the virus is impaired for growth in the presence of TGF{beta}, but only when both SMAD3 and IRF7 are present, highlighting the unique interaction between TGF{beta} and innate immune signaling.",

    "abstract": "Macroscopic axonal connections in the human brain distribute information and neuronal activity across the brain. Although brain organoid technologies have recently provided novel avenues to investigate human brain function by replicating small neuronal networks of the brain in vitro, functionality of the macroscopic connections between distant regions has not been investigated with organoids. Here, we describe the neural activity of human cerebral organoids reciprocally connected by a bundle of axons. The connected organoids produced significantly more intense and complex oscillatory activity than conventional cerebral organoids. Optogenetic manipulations revealed that the connected organoids could respond to external stimuli and maintain the elevated frequency of neuronal activity for a short term, indicating that the connected organoids exhibit plasticity as a neuronal network. Our findings highlight functional importance of inter-regional connections and suggest that connected organoids can be used as a powerful tool for investigating the development and functions of macroscopic circuits in the human brain. can allow researchers to develop and test compounds to modulate activity of in vitro neuronal network models in unprecedented ways.",
