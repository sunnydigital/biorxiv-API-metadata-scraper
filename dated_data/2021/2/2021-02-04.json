    "abstract": "O_LIPopulations that expand their range can undergo rapid evolutionary adaptation of life-history traits, dispersal behaviour, and adaptation to the local environment. Such adaptation may be aided or hindered by sexual reproduction, depending on the context.\nC_LIO_LIHowever, few studies have investigated the genomic causes and consequences or genetic architecture of such adaptation during range expansions.\nC_LIO_LIWe here studied genomic adaptation during experimental range expansions of the protist Tetrahymena thermophila in landscapes with a uniform environment or a pH-gradient. Specifically, we investigated two aspects of genomic adaptation during range expansion. Firstly, we investigated the genetic architecture of adaptation in terms of the underlying numbers of allele frequency changes from standing genetic variation and de novo variants. We focused on how sexual reproduction may alter this genetic architecture. Secondly, identified genes subject to selection caused by the expanding range itself, and directional selection due to the presence or absence of the pH-gradient. We focused this analysis on alleles with large frequency changes that occurred in parallel in more than one population to identify the most likely candidate targets of selection.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that sexual reproduction altered genetic architecture both in terms of de novo variants and standing genetic variation. However, sexual reproduction affected allele frequency changes in standing genetic variation only in the absence of long-distance gene flow. Adaptation to the range expansion affected genes involved in cell divisions and DNA repair, whereas adaptation to the pH-gradient additionally affected genes involved in ion balance, and oxidoreductase reactions. These genetic changes may result from selection on growth and adaptation to low pH.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that the evolution of life-history and the adaptation to the local environment has a genetic basis during our range expansion experiment. In the absence of gene flow, sexual reproduction may have aided genetic adaptation. Gene flow may have swamped expanding populations with maladapted alleles, thus reducing the extent of evolutionary adaptation during range expansion. Sexual reproduction also altered the genetic architecture of our evolving populations via de novo variants, possibly by purging deleterious mutations or by revealing fitness benefits of rare genetic variants.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Animals across species compete for limited resources. While in some species competition behavior is solely based on own abilities, others assess their opponents to facilitate these interactions. Using cues and communication signals, contestants gather information about their opponent, adjust their behavior accordingly, and can thereby avoid high costs of escalating fights. We tracked electrocommunication signals, in particular \"rises\", and agonistic behaviors of the gymnotiform electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus in staged competition experiments. A larger body size relative to the opponent was the sole significant predictor for winners. Sex and the frequency of the continuously emitted electric field were only mildly influencing competition outcome. In males, correlations of body-size and winning were stronger than in females and, especially when losing against females, communication and agonistic interactions were enhanced, hinting towards males being more motivated to compete. Fish that lost competitions emitted the majority of rises in dependence on the competitors relative size and sex. The emission of rises was costly since it provoked ritualized biting or chasing behaviors by the other fish. Despite winners being accurately predictable based on rise numbers already after the initial 25 minutes, losers continued to emit rises. The number of rises emitted by losers and the duration of chasing behaviors depended in similar ways on physical attributes of contestants. The detailed evaluation of these correlations hint towards A. leptorhynchus adjusting their competition behavior according to mutual assessment, where rises could signal a losers motivation to continue assessment through ritualized fighting.",

    "abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long linear sulfated polysaccharides implicated in processes linked to disease development such as mucopolysaccharidosis, respiratory failure, cancer, and viral infections, thereby serving as potential biomarkers. A successful clinical translation of GAGs as biomarkers depends on the availability of standardized GAG measurements. However, owing to the analytical complexity associated with the quantification of GAG concentration and structural composition, a standardized method to simultaneously measure multiple GAGs is missing. In this study, we sought to characterize the analytical performance of a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS)-based kit for the quantification of 17 GAG disaccharides. The kit showed acceptable linearity, selectivity and specificity, accuracy and precision, and analyte stability in the absolute quantification of 15 GAG disaccharides. In native human samples, here using urine as a reference matrix, the analytical performance of the kit was acceptable for the quantification of CS disaccharides. Intra- and inter-laboratory tests performed in an external laboratory demonstrated robust reproducibility of GAG measurements showing that the kit was acceptably standardized. In conclusion, these results indicated that the UHPLC-MS/MS kit was standardized for the simultaneous measurement of GAG disaccharides allowing for comparability of measurements and enabling translational research.\n\nSummaryAnalytical performance of a kit for standardized GAG measurements, based on an established UHPLC-MS/MS method",

    "abstract": "Western painted turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii) are the most anoxia-tolerant tetrapod. Survival time improves at low temperature and during ontogeny, such that adults acclimated to 3{degrees}C survive far longer without oxygen than either warm-acclimated adults or cold-acclimated hatchlings. Since protein synthesis is rapidly suppressed to save energy at the onset of anoxia exposure, this study tested the hypothesis that cold-acclimation would evoke preparatory changes in protein expression that would support enhanced anoxia survival in adult but not hatchling turtles. To test this, adult and hatchling turtles were acclimated to either 20{degrees}C (warm) or 3{degrees}C (cold) for 5 weeks, and then the heart ventricles were collected for quantitative proteomic analysis using labeled isobaric tags and mass spectrometry. The relative abundances of 1316 identified proteins were compared between temperatures and developmental stages. The effect of cold-acclimation on the cardiac proteome was most evident when life stage was included as a covariable, suggesting that ontogenic differences in anoxia tolerance may be predicated on successful maturation of the heart from its hatchling to adult form and, only after this maturation occurs, will cold-acclimation induce protein expression changes appropriate for supporting heart function during prolonged anoxia. The main differences between the hatchling and adult cardiac proteomes reflect an increase in metabolic scope that included more myoglobin and increased investment in both aerobic and anaerobic energy pathways. Mitochondrial structure and function were key targets of life stage- and temperature-induced changes to the cardiac proteome, including reduced complex II proteins in cold-acclimated adults that may help down-regulate the electron transport system and avoid succinate accumulation during anoxia. Therefore, targeted cold-induced changes to the cardiac proteome may be a contributing mechanism for stagespecific anoxia tolerance in turtles.",

Although this reservoir is known to be maintained by clonal expansion, the contribution of large, infected cell clones to residual viremia and viral rebound remains underexplored. Here, we conducted an extensive analysis on four ART-treated individuals who underwent an analytical treatment interruption (ATI). We performed subgenomic (V1-V3 env), near full-length proviral and integration site sequencing, and used multiple displacement amplification to sequence both the integration site and provirus from single HIV-infected cells. We found eight proviruses that could phylogenetically be linked to plasma virus obtained before or during the ATI. This study highlights a role for HIV-infected cell clones in the maintenance of the replication-competent reservoir and suggests that infected cell clones can directly contribute to rebound viremia upon ATI.",

In a first step, an optimised peptide extraction applied to 24 isolates otherwise identified in three of the 11 M. tuberculosis complex species by WGS, yielded 94 MALDI-TOF spectra which clustered according to WGS identification. In a second step, 70/74 (95%) other isolates were correctly identified at the species level by this clustering method.

The minor capsid lattice formed by five proteins, shows a novel structure compared to other icosahedral giant viruses. Under the minor capsid proteins, scaffold proteins connect two five-fold vertices and interact with the inner membrane. Previously reported giant viruses utilise \"tape measure\" proteins, proposed to control its capsid size, which could not be identified in tokyovirus, but scaffold proteins appear to perform a similar role. A density on top of the major capsid protein was identified, which suggested to be a 14kDa glycoprotein.

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is an essential phospholipid and critical component of membrane bilayers. The complete deacylation of PI by phospholipases of the B-type leads to the production of intracellular and extracellular glycerophosphoinositol (GPI), a water-soluble glycerophosphodiester. Extracellular GPI is transported into the cell via Git1, a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters that resides at the plasma membrane in yeast. Once internalized, GPI can be degraded to produce inositol, phosphate and glycerol, thereby contributing to reserves of these building blocks. Not surprisingly, GIT1 gene expression is controlled by nutrient balance, with limitation for phosphate or inositol each increasing GIT1 expression to facilitate GPI uptake. Less is known about how Git1 protein levels or localization are controlled. Here we show that the -arrestins, an important class of protein trafficking adaptor, regulate the localization of Git1 in a manner dependent upon their association with the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5. Specifically, -arrestin Aly2 is needed for effective Git1 internalization from the plasma membrane under basal conditions. However, in response to GPI-treatment of cells, either Aly1 or Aly2 can promote Git1 trafficking to the vacuole. Retention of Git1 at the cell surface, as occurs in aly1{Delta} aly2{Delta} cells, results in impaired growth in the presences of excess exogenous GPI and results in increased uptake of radiolabeled GPI, suggesting that accumulation of this metabolite or its downstream products leads to cellular toxicity. We further show that regulation of -arrestin Aly1 by the protein phosphatase calcineurin improves both steady-state and ligand-induced trafficking of Git1 when a mutant allele of Aly1 that mimics the dephosphorylated state at calcineurin-regulated residues is employed. Thus, calcineurin regulation of Aly1 is important for the GPI-ligand induced trafficking of Git1 by this -arrestin, however, the role of calcineurin in regulating Git1 trafficking is much broader than can simply be explained by regulation of the -arrestins. Finally, we find that loss of Aly1 and Aly2 leads to an increase in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate on the limiting membrane of the vacuole and this alteration is further exacerbated by addition of GPI, suggesting that the effect is at least partially linked to Git1 function. Indeed, loss of Aly1 and Aly2 leads to increased incorporation of inositol label from 3H-inositol-labelled GPI into PI, confirming that internalized GPI influences PI synthesis and indicating a role for the -arrestins in regulating the process.",

    "abstract": "Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell. Here, we applied targeted in situ CLMS to structurally probe Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins from SARS-CoV-2, and obtained cross-link sets with an average density of one cross-link per twenty residues. We then employed integrative modeling that computationally combined the cross-linking data with domain structures to determine full-length atomic models. For the Nsp2, the cross-links report on a complex topology with long-range interactions. Integrative modeling with structural prediction of individual domains by the AlphaFold2 system allowed us to generate a single consistent all-atom model of the full-length Nsp2. The model reveals three putative metal binding sites, and suggests a role for Nsp2 in zinc regulation within the replication-transcription complex. For the N protein, we identified multiple intra- and inter-domain cross-links. Our integrative model of the N dimer demonstrates that it can accommodate three single RNA strands simultaneously, both stereochemically and electrostatically. For the Nsp1, cross-links with the 40S ribosome were highly consistent with recent cryo-EM structures. These results highlight the importance of cellular context for the structural probing of recalcitrant proteins and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted in situ CLMS and integrative modeling.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDAdvanced age increases the susceptibility to diet-induced insulin resistance (IR). A key driver of this phenomenon is lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle. It is debated, however, whether this is due to dietary lipid overload or decline of mitochondrial function. To address the interplay of diet and age in the flexibility of muscle lipid and glucose handling, we put young and aged mice on a low- or high-fat diet (HFD).\n\nRESULTSAs expected, aged mice were more susceptible to IR when given a HFD than young mice. The HFD induced intramuscular lipid accumulation specifically in aged mice, including C18:0-containing ceramides and diacylglycerols. This was reflected by the mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation capacity, which was upregulated by the HFD in young, but not in old mice. Conspicuously, most {beta}-oxidation proteins were upregulated by the HFD in both groups, but carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) declined in aged animals. Computational modelling traced the flux control mostly to CPT1B, suggesting a CPT1B-driven loss of flexibility to the HFD with age. Finally, in old animals glycolytic protein levels were reduced and less flexible to the diet.\n\nCONCLUSIONWe conclude that intramuscular lipid accumulation and decreased insulin sensitivity are not due to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction or nutritional overload alone, but rather to their interaction. Moreover, we identify CPT1B as a potential target to counteract age-dependent intramuscular lipid accumulation and thereby IR.",

    "abstract": "Short heat waves (>37{degrees}C) are extremely damaging to non-acclimated plants and their capacity to recover from heat stress is key for their survival. To acclimate, the HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A1 (HSFA1) subfamily activates a transcriptional response that resolves incurred damages. In contrast, little is known how plants acclimate to sustained non-detrimental warm periods at 27-28{degrees}C. Plants respond to this condition with a thermomorphogenesis response. In addition, HSFA1 is critical for plant survival during these warm periods. We find that SUMO, a protein modification whose conjugate levels rise sharply during acute heat stress in eukaryotes, is critical too for plant longevity during warm periods, in particular for normal shoot meristem development. The known SUMO ligases were not essential to endure these warm periods, alone or in combination. Thermo-lethality was also not seen when plants lacked certain SUMO proteases or when SUMO chain formation was blocked. The SUMO-dependent thermo-resilience was as well independent of the autoimmune phenotype of the SUMO mutants. As acquired thermotolerance was normal in the sumo1/2 knockdown mutant, our data thus reveal a role for SUMO in heat acclimation that differs from HSFA1 and SIZ1. We conclude that SUMO is critical for shoot meristem integrity during warm periods.\n\nHighlightThe protein modifier SUMO governs shoot meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis allowing sustained rosette development when plants endure a sustained warm non-detrimental period of 28 degrees Celsius.",

    "abstract": "Ras is the most commonly mutated oncogene in humans and uses three oncogenic effectors: Raf, PI3K, and RalGEF activation of Ral. Understanding the importance of RalGEF>Ral signaling in cancer is hampered by the paucity of knowledge about their function in animal development, particularly in cell movements. We found that mutations that disrupt function of RalGEF or Ral enhance migration phenotypes of mutations in genes with established roles in cell migration. We used as a model the migration of the canal associated neurons (CANs), and validated our results in HSN cell migration, neurite guidance, and general animal locomotion. These functions of RalGEF and Ral are specific to their control of Ral signaling output rather than other published functions of these proteins. In this capacity Ral functions cell autonomously as a permissive developmental signal. In contrast, we observed Ras, the canonical activator of RalGEF>Ral signaling in cancer, to function as an instructive signal. Furthermore, we unexpectedly identified a function for the close Ras relative, Rap1, consistent with activation of RalGEF>Ral. These studies define functions of RalGEF>Ral, Rap1 and Ras signaling in morphogenetic processes that fashion the nervous system. We have also defined a model for studying how small GTPases partner with downstream effectors. Taken together, this analysis defines novel molecules and relationships in signaling networks that control cell movements during development of the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The plight of insect populations around the world and the threats it poses to agriculture and ecosystems has thrown insecticide use into the spotlight. Spinosad is an organic insecticide, considered less harmful to beneficial insects than synthetic insecticides, but its mode of action remains unclear. Using Drosophila, we show that low doses of spinosad reduce cholinergic response in neurons by antagonizing D6 nAChRs. D6 nAChRs are transported to lysosomes that become enlarged and accumulate upon spinosad treatment. Oxidative stress is initiated in the central nervous system, and spreads to midgut and disturbs lipid storage in metabolic tissues in a D6-dependent manner. Spinosad toxicity was ameliorated with the antioxidant N-Acetylcysteine amide (NACA). Chronic exposures lead to mitochondrial defects, severe neurodegeneration and blindness in adult animals. The many deleterious effects of low doses of this insecticide reported here point to an urgent need for rigorous investigation of its impacts on beneficial insects.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the main immunocompetent cells of the brain regulate neuronal function in health and disease, but their contribution to cerebral blood flow (CBF) remained elusive. Here we identify microglia as important modulators of CBF both under physiological conditions and during hypoperfusion. We show that microglia establish direct purinergic contacts with cells in the neurovascular unit that shape cerebral perfusion in both mice and humans. Surprisingly, the absence of microglia or blockade of microglial P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) substantially impairs neurovascular coupling in the barrel cortex after whisker stimulation. We also reveal that hypercapnia, which is associated with acidification, induces microglial adenosine production, while depletion of microglia reduces brain pH and impairs hypercapnia-induced vasodilation. Furthermore, the absence or dysfunction of microglia markedly impairs adaptation to hypoperfusion via P2Y12R after transient unilateral common carotid artery occlusion, which is also influenced by CX3CR1-mediated actions. Thus, our data reveal a previously unrecognized role for microglia in CBF regulation with broad implications for common neurological diseases.",

Here we use super resolution, real time imaging of fluorescent-protein tagged EV cargo combined with in vivo bioassays to study signaling EVs in C. elegans. We find that neuronal sensory cilia shed the TRP polycystin-2 channel PKD-2::GFP-carrying EVs from two distinct sites - the ciliary tip and the ciliary base. Ciliary tip shedding requires distal ciliary enrichment of PKD-2 by the myristoylated coiled-coil protein CIL-7. Kinesin-3 KLP-6 and intraflagellar transport (IFT) kinesin-2 motors are also required for ciliary tip EV shedding. Blocking ciliary tip shedding results in excessive EV shedding from the base. Finally, we demonstrate that C. elegans male ciliated neurons modulate EV cargo composition in response to sensory stimulation by hermaphrodite mating partners. Overall, our study indicates that the cilium and its trafficking machinery act as a specialized venue for regulated EV biogenesis and signaling.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases pose a major threat to human, animal, and plant health. The risk of species-extinctions increases when pathogens can survive in the absence of the host, for example in environmental reservoirs. However, identifying such reservoirs and modes of infection is often highly challenging. In this study, we investigated the presence and nature of an environmental reservoir for the ascomycete fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of white-nose disease. We also characterised the modes and timing of transmission of the pathogen; key elements to better understand the disease dynamics. Using 18 microsatellite markers, we determined the genotypic and genic (based on allele frequencies) differentiation between 1,497 P. destructans isolates collected from nine closely situated hibernacula in North-Eastern Germany. One hibernaculum was the focus of intensive sampling in which both the bats and walls of the site were sampled at regular intervals over five consecutive winter seasons (1,062 isolates). We found significant genic differentiation between sites and few multi-locus genotypes shared across hibernacula (genotypic differentiation). This demonstrates that each hibernaculum has an essentially unique population of the fungus. This would be expected if bats purge viable P. destructans over the summer, preventing the mixing and exchange of the pathogen in maternity colonies, where bats from all of the studied hibernacula meet. Results from the intensively sampled site show higher measures of genotypic richness on walls compared to bats, the absence of genic differentiation between bats and walls, and stable relative abundance of multi-locus genotypes over multiple winter seasons. This clearly implicates hibernacula walls as the main environmental reservoir of the pathogen, from which bats become re-infected annually.",

Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it.\n\nWe analyzed 146,917 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 2,393 NGS datasets from GISAID, NCBI Virus and NCBI SRA archives focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein.\n\nOnly around 13.8% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.98% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 2,592 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only nine and 23 recurrent variants were found in at least 0.5% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 15.1% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition.\n\nThese findings demonstrate the increasing importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "N-glycosylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification that may influence folding, subcellular localization, secretion, solubility and oligomerization of proteins. In this study, we examined the effects of N-glycans on the activity of human Gb3/CD77 synthase, which catalyzes the synthesis of glycosphingolipids with terminal Gal1[-&gt;]4Gal (Gb3 and the P1 antigen) and Gal1[-&gt;]4GalNAc disaccharides (the NOR antigen). The human Gb3/CD77 synthase contains two occupied N-glycosylation sites at positions N121 and N203. Intriguingly, we found that while the N-glycan at N203 is essential for activity and correct subcellular localization, the N-glycan at N121 is dispensable and its absence did not reduce, but, surprisingly, even increased the activity of the enzyme. The fully N-glycosylated human Gb3/CD77 synthase and its glycoform missing the N121 glycan correctly localized in the Golgi, whereas a glycoform without the N203 site partially mislocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum. A double mutein missing both N-glycans was inactive and accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results suggest that the decreased specific activity of human Gb3/CD77 synthase glycovariants results from their improper subcellular localization and, to a smaller degree, a decrease in enzyme solubility. Taken together, our findings show that the two N-glycans of human Gb3/CD77 synthase have opposing effects on its properties, revealing a dual nature of N-glycosylation and potentially a novel regulatory mechanism controlling the biological activity of proteins.",

Here we integrated multiple scRNA-seq studies and found that apCAFs are derived from mesothelial cells. Our data show that during PDA progression, mesothelial cells form apCAFs by down-regulating mesothelial features and gaining the fibroblastic features, a process induced by IL-1 and TGF{beta}. Moreover, apCAFs directly ligate and induce naive CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) in an antigen-specific manner. Our study elucidates an important but neglected cell type in the regulation of PDA immunity and may lead to targeted therapeutic strategies that can overcome immune evasion in PDA.",

Our chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell (2173 CAR T cells) clinical trial (NCT02209376) against Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) variant III (EGFRvIII) demonstrated successful trafficking of T cells across the blood brain barrier into GBM active tumor sites. However, CAR T cell infiltration was associated only with a selective loss of EGFRvIII+ tumor, demonstrating little to no effect on EGFRvIII- tumor cells. Post-CAR T treated tumor specimens showed continued presence of EGFR amplification and oncogenic EGFR extracellular domain (ECD) missense mutations, despite loss of EGFRvIII. To address tumor escape, we generated an EGFR-specific CAR by fusing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 806 to a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain. The resulting construct was compared to 2173 CAR T cells in GBM, using in vitro and in vivo models. 806 CAR T cells specifically lysed tumor cells and secreted cytokines in response to amplified EGFR, EGFRvIII, and EGFR-ECD mutations in U87MG cells, GBM neurosphere-derived cell lines, and patient-derived GBM organoids. 806 CAR T cells did not lyse fetal brain astrocytes or primary keratinocytes to a significant degree. They also exhibited superior antitumor activity in vivo when compared to 2173 CAR T cells. The broad specificity of 806 CAR T cells to EGFR alterations gives us the potential to target multiple clones within a tumor and reduce opportunities for tumor escape via antigen loss.",

Genetic knock-out or small-molecule mediated degradation of BRD9 limited IFN-induced expression of a subset of ISGs in multiple cell-types, and prevented IFN from exerting full antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. Mechanistically, BRD9 acts at the level of ISG transcription, exhibits a proximal association with STAT2 following IFN stimulation, and relies on its intact acetyl-binding bromodomain and unique ncBAF scaffolding function for activity. Given its druggability, BRD9 may be an attractive target for dampening constitutive ISG expression under certain pathogenic autoinflammatory conditions.",

    "abstract": "The ability of an organism to sense and respond to environmental redox fluctuations relies on a signaling network that is incompletely understood in apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii. The impact of changes in redox upon the development of this intracellular parasite is not known. Here, we provide a revised collection of 58 genes containing domains related to canonical antioxidant function, with their encoded proteins widely dispersed throughout different cellular compartments. We demonstrate that addition of exogenous H2O2 to human fibroblasts infected with T. gondii triggers a Ca2+ flux in the cytosol of intracellular parasites that can induce egress. In line with existing models, egress triggered by exogenous H2O2 is reliant upon both Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase 3 and diacylglycerol kinases. Finally, we show that the overexpression a glutaredoxin-roGFP2 redox sensor fusion protein in the parasitophorous vacuole severely impacts parasite replication. These data highlight the rich redox network that exists in T. gondii, evidencing a link between extracellular redox and intracellular Ca2+ signaling that can culminate in parasite egress. Our findings also indicate that the redox potential of the intracellular environment contributes to normal parasite growth. Combined, our findings highlight the important role of redox as an unexplored regulator of parasite biology.",

    "abstract": "In many low- and middle-income countries antibiotic resistant bacteria spread in the environment due to inadequate treatment of wastewater and the poorly regulated use of antibiotics in agri- and aquaculture. Here we characterised the abundance and diversity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in surface waters and sediments in Bangladesh through quantitative culture of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing coliforms and shotgun metagenomics. Samples were collected from highly urbanised settings (n = 7), from rural ponds with a history of aquaculture-related antibiotic use (n = 11) and from rural ponds with no history of antibiotic use (n = 6). ESBL-producing coliforms were found to be more prevalent in urban samples than in rural samples. Shotgun sequencing showed that sediment samples were dominated by the phylum Proteobacteria (on average 73.8% of assigned reads), while in the water samples Cyanobacteria (on average 60.9% of assigned reads) were the predominant phylum. Antibiotic resistance genes were detected in all samples, but their abundance varied 1,525-fold between sites, with the highest levels of antibiotic resistance genes being present in urban surface water samples. We identified an IncQ1 sulphonamide resistance plasmid ancestral to the widely studied RSF1010 in one of the urban water samples. The abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was significantly correlated (R2 = 0.73; P = 8.9 x 10-15) with the abundance of bacteria originating from the human gut, which suggests that the release of untreated sewage is a driver for the spread of environmental antibiotic resistance genes in Bangladesh, particularly in highly urbanised settings.\n\nImportanceLow- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have higher burdens of multidrug-resistant infections than high-income countries and there is thus an urgent need to elucidate the drivers of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in LMICs. Here we study the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in surface water and sediments from rural and urban settings in Bangladesh. We found that urban surface waters are particularly rich in antibiotic resistance genes, with a higher number of them associated with plasmids indicating that they are more likely to spread horizontally. The abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was strongly correlated with the abundance of bacteria that originate from the human gut, suggesting that uncontrolled release of human waste is a major driver for the spread of antibiotic resistance in the urban environment. Improvements in sanitation in LMICs may thus be a key intervention to reduce the dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Nucleophilic amino acids are important in covalent drug development yet underutilized as antimicrobial targets. Over recent years, several chemoproteomic technologies have been developed to mine chemically-accessible residues via their intrinsic reactivity toward electrophilic probes. However, these approaches cannot discern which reactive sites contribute to protein function and should therefore be prioritized for drug discovery. To address this, we have developed a CRISPR-based Oligo Recombineering (CORe) platform to systematically prioritize reactive amino acids according to their contribution to protein function. Our approach directly couples protein sequence and function with biological fitness. Here, we profile the reactivity of >1,000 cysteines on ~700 proteins in the eukaryotic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii and prioritize functional sites using CORe. We competitively compared the fitness effect of 370 codon switches at 74 cysteines and identify functional sites in a diverse range of proteins. In our proof of concept, CORe performed >800 times faster than a standard genetic workflow. Reactive cysteines decorating the ribosome were found to be critical for parasite growth, with subsequent target-based screening validating the apicomplexan translation machinery as a target for covalent ligand development. CORe is system-agnostic, and supports expedient identification, functional prioritization, and rational targeting of reactive sites in a wide range of organisms and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli RseP, a member of the S2P family of intramembrane proteases, is involved in the activation of the {sigma}E extracytoplasmic stress response and elimination of remnant signal peptides. However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this study, we attempted to identify new RseP substrates to explore still unknown physiological roles of this protease. Our mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with the fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription of the fec operon with FecI. Ferric citrate signal-dependent generation of this cleavage product is the essential and sufficient role of RseP in the transcriptional activation of the fec operon. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the intramembrane proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential for regulating iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.",

    "abstract": "Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S - insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.",

Entry into proliferative cycles is driven by Cyclin/Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Conserved Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), p21Cip1/Waf1, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2, bind to Cyclin/Cdks and inhibit Cdk activity. p27 tyrosine phosphorylation, in response to mitogenic signalling, promotes activation of CyclinD/Cdk4 and CyclinA/Cdk2. Tyrosine phosphorylation is conserved in p21 and p57, although the number of sites differs. We use molecular dynamics simulations to compare the structural changes in Cyclin/Cdk/CKI trimers induced by single and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation in CKIs and their impact on CyclinD/Cdk4 and CyclinA/Cdk2 activity. Despite shared structural features, CKI binding induces distinct structural responses in Cyclin/Cdks and the predicted effects of CKI tyrosine phosphorylation on Cdk activity are not conserved across CKIs. Our analyses suggest how CKIs may have evolved to be sensitive to different inputs to give context-dependent control of Cdk activity.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the third zoonotic coronavirus identified in the last twenty years. Enzootic and epizootic coronaviruses of diverse lineages also pose a significant threat to livestock, as most recently observed for virulent strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine acute diarrhea-associated coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Unique to RNA viruses, coronaviruses encode a proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) that lowers point mutation rates to increase the viability of large RNA virus genomes, which comes with the cost of limiting virus adaptation via point mutation. This limitation can be overcome by high rates of recombination that facilitate rapid increases in genetic diversification. To compare dynamics of recombination between related sequences, we developed an open-source computational workflow (IDPlot) to measure nucleotide identity, locate recombination breakpoints, and infer phylogenetic relationships. We analyzed recombination dynamics among three groups of coronaviruses with noteworthy impacts on human health and agriculture: SARSr-CoV, Betacoronavirus-1, and SADSr-CoV. We found that all three groups undergo recombination with highly diverged viruses from sparsely sampled or undescribed lineages, which can disrupt the inference of phylogenetic relationships. In most cases, no parental origin of recombinant regions could be found in genetic databases, suggesting that much coronavirus diversity remains unknown. These patterns of recombination expand the genetic pool that may contribute to future zoonotic events. Our results also illustrate the limitations of current sampling approaches for anticipating zoonotic threats to human and animal health.",

    "abstract": "Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC) are an established patient-specific model system where opportunities are emerging for cell-based therapies. We contrast hiPSCs derived from different tissues, skin and blood, in the same individual. We show extensive single-nucleotide mutagenesis in all hiPSC lines, although fibroblast-derived hiPSCs (F-hiPSCs) are particularly heavily mutagenized by ultraviolet(UV)-related damage. We utilize genome sequencing data on 454 F-hiPSCs and 44 blood-derived hiPSCs (B-hiPSCs) to gain further insights. Across 324 whole genome sequenced(WGS) F-hiPSCs derived by the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (HipSci), UV-related damage is present in ~72% of cell lines, sometimes causing substantial mutagenesis (range 0.25-15 per Mb). Furthermore, we find remarkable genomic heterogeneity between independent F-hiPSC clones derived from the same reprogramming process in the same donor, due to oligoclonal populations within fibroblasts. Combining WGS and exome-sequencing data of 452 HipSci F-hiPSCs, we identify 272 predicted pathogenic mutations in cancer-related genes, of which 21 genes were hit recurrently three or more times, involving 77 (17%) lines. Notably, 151 of 272 mutations were present in starting fibroblast populations suggesting that more than half of putative driver events in F-hiPSCs were acquired in vivo. In contrast, B-hiPSCs reprogrammed from erythroblasts show lower levels of genome-wide mutations (range 0.28-1.4 per Mb), no UV damage, but a strikingly high prevalence of acquired BCOR mutations of ~57%, indicative of strong selection pressure. All hiPSCs had otherwise stable, diploid genomes on karyotypic pre-screening, highlighting how copy-number-based approaches do not have the required resolution to detect widespread nucleotide mutagenesis. This work strongly suggests that models for cell-based therapies require detailed nucleotide-resolution characterization prior to clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Among various vaccination strategies, peptide-based vaccines appear as excellent candidates because they are cheap to produce, are highly stable and harbor low toxicity. However, predicting which MHC-I Associated Peptide (MAP) will ultimately reach cell surface remains challenging, due to high false discovery rates. Previously, we demonstrated that synonymous codon arrangement (usage and placement) is predictive of, and modulates MAP presentation. Here, we apply CAMAP (Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor), the artificial neural network we used to unveil the role of codon arrangement in MAP presentation, to predict SARS-CoV MAPs. We report that experimentally identified SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 MAPs are associated with significantly higher CAMAP scores. Based on CAMAP scores and binding affinity, we identified 48 non-overlapping MAP candidates for a peptide-based vaccine, ensuring coverage for a high proportion of HLA haplotypes in the US population (>78%) and SARS-CoV-2 strains (detected in >98% of SARS-CoV-2 strains present in the GISAID database). Finally, we built an interactive web portal (https://www.epitopes.world) where researchers can freely explore CAMAP predictions for SARS-CoV-1/2 viruses. Collectively, we present an analysis framework that can be generalizable to empower the rapid identification of virus-specific MAPs, including in the context of an emergent virus, to help accelerate target identification for peptide-based vaccine designs that could be critical in safely attaining group immunity in the context of a global pandemic.",

We have tested the synergistic anti-cancer effects of 15 pyrazolopyrimidinones, synthesised in a two-step process, combined with cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), a novel innovation generating reactive species with other unique chemical and physical effects. We identify two pyrazolopyrimidinones that act as prodrugs and display enhanced reactive-species dependent cytotoxicity when used in combination with cold atmospheric plasma. Synergistic activation was evident for both direct CAP treatment on prodrug loaded tumour cells and indirect CAP treatment of prodrug in media prior to adding to tumour cells.

The results add significantly to our understanding of how BRMS1 interactions with Sin3/HDAC complexes regulate metastasis and expand insights into BRMS1s molecular role, as they demonstrate that BRMS1 C-terminus involvement in distinct direct protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Metastases are initiated by disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) that depart from the primary tumor and colonize target organs. Growing evidence suggests that the microenvironment of the primary tumor lesion primes DTCs to display dormant or proliferative fates in target organs. However, the manner in which events taking place in the primary tumor influence DTC fate, sometimes long after dissemination, remains poorly understood. With the advent of a novel intravital imaging technique called the Window for High-Resolution Intravital Imaging of the Lung (WHRIL), we have, for the first time, been able to study the live lung longitudinally and follow the fate of individual DTCs that spontaneously disseminate from orthotopic breast tumors. We find, across several models, a high rate of success for tumor cells to complete the initial steps of the metastatic cascade in the secondary site, including retention of DTCs in the lung vasculature, speed of extravasation, and survival after extravasation. Importantly, initiation of metastatic growth was controlled primarily by a rate-limiting step that occurred post-extravasation and at the stage of the conversion of single DTCs from a dormant to a proliferative state. Detailed analysis of these events revealed that, even before dissemination, a subset of macrophages within the primary tumor induces, in tumor cells that are about to disseminate, the expression of proteins that regulate a pro- dissemination (MenaINV) and pro-dormancy (NR2F1) phenotype. Surprisingly, if cancer cells are intravenously injected, the rate limiting stages of MenaINV-associated extravasation, dormancy, and other parameters, are lost or altered in a way that impacts how DTCs progress through the metastatic cascade. Our work provides novel insight into how specific primary tumor microenvironments prime a subpopulation of cells for dissemination and dormancy. We also propose that dissecting mechanisms of metastasis, or testing anti-metastatic therapies, may yield results of limited application if derived from models that do not follow spontaneous dissemination.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThis study provides important insight into the contribution of primary tumor microenvironmental niches to cancer metastasis by identifying the manner in which these niches spawn subpopulations of DTCs that are primed for dissemination and dormancy in the secondary site. This study may provide novel targets that could be inhibited to prevent successful colonization of the secondary site and, hence, metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal membrane enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and the subsequent accumulation of its substrate, glucosylceramide substrate (GC). Mostly missense mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) lead to GCase misfolding and inhibiting the lysosomes proper trafficking. The accumulated GC leads to lysosomal dysfunction and impairs the autophagy pathway.\n\nGD types 2 and 3 (GD2-3), or the neuronopathic forms, affect not only the Central Nervous System (CNS) but also have severe systemic involvement and progressive bone disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) successfully treats the hematologic manifestations; however, due to the lack of equal distribution of the recombinant enzyme in different organs, it has no impact on the nervous system and has minimal effect on bone involvement. Small molecules have the potential for better tissue distribution. Ambroxol (AMB) is a pharmacologic chaperone that partially recovers the mutated GCase activity and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Eliglustat (EGT) works by inhibiting UDP-glucosylceramide synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes the GC biosynthesis, reducing a GC influx load into the lysosome. Substrate reduction therapy (SRT) using EGT is associated with improvement in GD bone marrow burden score and bone mineral density.\n\nThe effects of EGT and ABX on GCase activity and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) were assessed in primary cell lines derived from patients with GD2-3 and compared to cell lines from healthy controls. While both compounds enhanced GCase activity in control cells, an individualized response was observed in cells from patients with GD2-3 that varied with GBA mutations. EGT and AMB enhanced the formation of lysosomal/ late endosomal compartments and autophagy, and this effect was independent of GBA mutations. Both AMB and EGT increased mitochondrial mass and density in GD2-3 fibroblasts, suggesting enhancement of the mitochondrial function by activating the mitochondrial membrane potential.\n\nThese results suggest that EGT and ABX may have different molecular mechanisms of action, but both enhance GCase activity, improve autophagy-lysosome dynamics and mitochondrial functions.",

The SNPs implicated in these psychiatric disorders and behavioral traits were highly enriched in CTCF binding sites, in conserved regions likely to be enhancers, and in brain-specific promoters, regulatory sites likely to affect dynamic responses. The SNPs relevant for neurological disorders were highly enriched in constitutive coding regions and splice regulatory sites.

    "abstract": "Climate change and resilience to warming climates have implications for humans, livestock, and wildlife. The genetic mechanisms that confer thermotolerance to mammals are still not well characterized. We used dairy cows as a model to study heat tolerance because they are lactating, and therefore often prone to thermal stress. The data comprised almost 0.5 million milk records (milk, fat, and proteins) of 29,107 Australian Holsteins, each having around 15 million imputed sequence variants. Dairy animals often reduce their milk production when temperature and humidity rise; thus, the phenotypes used to measure an individuals heat tolerance were defined as the rate of milk production decline (slope traits) with a rising temperature-humidity index. With these slope traits, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using different approaches, including conditional analyses, to correct for the relationship between heat tolerance and level of milk production. The results revealed multiple novel loci for heat tolerance, including 61 potential functional variants at sites highly conserved across vertebrate species. Moreover, it was interesting that specific candidate variants and genes are related to the neuronal system (ITPR1, ITPR2, and GRIA4) and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction functions for heat tolerance (NPFFR2, CALCR, and GHR), providing a novel insight that can help to develop genetic and management approaches to combat heat stress.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile understanding the genetic basis of heat tolerance is crucial in the context of global warmings effect on humans, livestock, and wildlife, the specific genetic variants and biological features that confer thermotolerance in animals are still not well characterized. The ability to tolerate heat varies across individuals, with substantial genetic control of this complex trait. Dairy cattle are excellent model in which to find genes associated with individual variations in heat tolerance since they significantly suffer from heat stress due to the metabolic heat of lactation. By genome-wide association studies of more than 29,000 cows with 15 million sequence variants and controlled phenotype measurements, we identify many new loci associated with heat tolerance. The biological functions of these loci are linked to the neuronal system and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction functions. Also, several putative causal mutations for heat tolerance are at genomic sites that are otherwise evolutionarily conserved across 100 vertebrate species. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the molecular and biological basis of heat tolerance that can help to develop genetic and management approaches to combat heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the histone deacetylase HDAC4 is associated with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and a feature common to many of these disorders is impaired cognitive function. HDAC4 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in both vertebrates and invertebrates and alterations in the amounts of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic HDAC4 have been implicated in these diseases. In Drosophila, HDAC4 also plays a critical role in the regulation of memory however the mechanisms through which it acts are unknown. Nuclear and cytoplasmically-restricted HDAC4 mutants were expressed in the Drosophila brain to investigate a mechanistic link between HDAC4 subcellular distribution, transcriptional changes and neuronal dysfunction. Deficits in mushroom body morphogenesis, eye development and long-term memory correlated with increased abundance of nuclear HDAC4 but were associated with minimal transcriptional changes. Although HDAC4 sequesters MEF2 into punctate foci within neuronal nuclei, no alteration in MEF2 activity was observed on overexpression of HDAC4, and knockdown of MEF2 had no impact on long-term memory, indicating that HDAC4 is likely not acting through MEF2. Similarly, deletion of the MEF2 binding site also had no impact on HDAC4-induced impairments in eye development, however it did significantly reduce the mushroom body deficits, thus nuclear HDAC4 acts through MEF2 to disrupt mushroom body development. These data provide insight into the mechanisms through which dysregulation of HDAC4 subcellular distribution impairs neurological function and provides new avenues for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Considerable work indicates that instrumental responding is context-dependent, but the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Given the important role for the hippocampal formation in contextual processing, we hypothesized that reversible inactivation of the hippocampus would impair the context-dependence of active avoidance. To test this hypothesis, we used a two-way signaled active avoidance (SAA) task that requires rats to shuttle across a divided chamber during a tone CS in order to avoid a footshock US. After training, avoidance responding was assessed in an extinction test in both the training context and a novel context in a counterbalanced order. Rats performed significantly more avoidance responses in the training context than in the novel context, demonstrating the context-dependence of shuttle avoidance behavior. To examine the role of the hippocampus in the context-dependence of SAA, we reversibly inactivated either the dorsal (DH) or ventral hippocampus (VH) prior to testing. Inactivation of the VH eliminated the context-dependence of SAA and elevated avoidance responding in the novel context to levels similar to that expressed in the training context. In contrast, DH inactivation had no effect on avoidance in either context, and neither manipulation affected freezing behavior. Therefore, the integrity of the VH, but not DH, is required for the expression context-dependence of avoidance behavior.",

Most patients with COVID-19 have a mild course of the disease. However, approximately 20% develop severe illness with a high mortality rate which is associated with age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Epidemiological studies are used to reveal the extent of viral spread in homes, communities, and hospitals. Thus, preventive and control measures can be established by the authorities.\n\nObjectiveIn this study, patients with suspect COVID-19 symptoms who search for hospital care at the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto (Sao Paulo, Brazil) were monitored, in order to identify the first case of this new disease in the region. In the first two months (March and April), more than 3000 individuals looked for the public and private health system with suspected respiratory symptoms, but only 164 (8.4%) were COVID-19 confirmed.\n\nResultsFrom those, males (56.1%) and patients of the age distribution of 16-59 (91.2%), with diarrhea (22.2%), runny nose (25%), altered taste (15.9%), and anosmia (11.6%) presented statistical significance, although none comorbidities were related with COVID-19 occurrence. The odds ratio analysis supports this finding. Days of onset of symptoms are positively associated with whit viral load, and the same happens with the occurrence of symptoms (dyspnea and low saturation).",

Elucidation of host genetic components to M. ovipneumoniae nasal detection would have the potential to reduce the incidence of pneumonia. Nasal mucosal secretions were collected from 647 sheep from a large US sheep flock. Ewes of three breeds (Polypay n=222, Rambouillet n=321, and Suffolk n=104) ranging in age from one to seven years, were sampled at three different times of the production cycle (February, April, and September/October) over four years (2015 to 2018). The presence and quantity of M. ovipneumoniae was determined using a species-specific qPCR with 3 to 10 sampling times per sheep. Breed (P<0.001), age (P<0.024), sampling time (P<0.001), and year (P<0.001) of collection affected log10 transformed M. ovipneumoniae DNA copy number, where Rambouillet had the lowest (P<0.0001) compared with both Polypay and Suffolk demonstrating a possible genetic component to detection. Samples from yearlings, April, and 2018 had the highest (P<0.046) detected DNA copy number mean. Sheep genomic DNA was genotyped with the Illumina OvineHD BeadChip. Principal component analysis identified most of the variation in the dataset was associated with breed. Therefore, genome wide association analysis was conducted with a mixed model (EMMAX), with principle components 1 to 6 as fixed and a kinship matrix as random effects. Genome-wide significant (P<9x10-8) SNPs were identified on chromosomes 6 and 7 in the all-breed analysis. Individual breed analysis had genome-wide significant (P<9x10-8) SNPs on chromosomes 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 15, 17, and 22. Annotated genes near these SNPs are part of immune (ANAPC7, CUL5, TMEM229B, PTPN13), gene translation (PIWIL4), and chromatin organization (KDM2B) pathways. Immune genes are expected to have increased expression when leukocytes encounter M. ovipneumoniae which would lead to chromatin reorganization.

    "abstract": "Implementation of next-generation sequencing in forward genetic screens greatly accelerated gene discovery in species with larger genomes, including many crop plants. In barley, extensive mutant collections are available, however, the causative mutations for many of the genes remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate how a combination of low-resolution genetic mapping, whole-genome resequencing and comparative functional analyses provides a promising path towards candidate identification of genes involved in plastid biology and / or photosynthesis, even if genes are located in recombination poor regions of the genome. As a proof of concept, we simulated the prediction of a candidate gene for the recently cloned variegation mutant albostrians (HvAST / HvCMF7) and adopted the approach for suggesting HvClpC1 as candidate gene for the yellow-green variegation mutant luteostrians.\n\nAuthor SummaryForward genetics is an approach of identifying a causal gene for a mutant phenotype and has proven to be a powerful tool for dissecting the genetic control of biological processes in many species. A large number of barley mutants was generated in the 1940s to 1970s when mutation breeding programs flourished. Genetic dissection of the causative mutations responsible for the phenotype, however, lagged far behind, limited by lack of molecular markers and high-throughput genotyping platforms. Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics, facilitating the process of identifying mutations underlying a phenotype of interest. Multiple mapping-by-sequencing or cloning-by-sequencing strategies were established towards fast gene discovery. In this study, we used mapping-by-sequencing to identify candidate genes within coarsely delimited genetic intervals, for two variegation mutants in barley - luteostrians and albostrians. After testing the approach using the example of the previously cloned albostrians gene HvAST, the gene HvClpC1 could be delimited as candidate gene for luteostrians. The mapping-by-sequencing strategy implemented here is generally suited for surveying barley mutant collections for phenotypes affecting fundamental processes of plant morphology, physiology and development.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALEAppropriate fibrotic tissue formation after myocardial infarction (MI) is crucial to maintenance of the hearts structure. Reparative or M2-like macrophages play a vital role in post-MI fibrosis by activating cardiac fibroblasts. However, the mechanism by which post-MI cardiac fibrosis is regulated is not fully understood.\n\nOBJECTIVEWe investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of post-MI fibrotic tissue formation, especially those related to regulation of cellular senescence and apoptosis.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTSIn vivo and in vitro experiments were used to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which post-MI fibrosis occurs, with a focus on the role of M2-like macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that CD206+F4/80+CD11b+ M2-like macrophages collected from mouse hearts on post-MI day 7 showed increased expression of neuregulin 1 (Nrg1). Nrg1 receptor epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB was expressed on cardiac fibroblasts in the infarct area. In cardiac fibroblasts in which hydrogen peroxide-induced senescence, M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1 suppressed both senescence and apoptosis of the fibroblasts, whereas blockade of ErbB function significantly accelerated. M2-like macrophage-derived Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling, which was shown to be related to anti-senescence, was activated in damaged cardiac fibroblasts. Interestingly, systemic blockade of ErbB function in MI model mice enhanced senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts and exacerbated inflammation. Further, increased accumulation of M2-like macrophages resulted in excessive progression of fibrosis in post-MI murine hearts. The molecular mechanism underlying regulation of fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted myocardium was shown in part to be attenuation of apoptosis and senescence of cardiac fibroblasts by activation of Nrg1/ErbB/PI3K/Akt signaling.\n\nCONCLUSIONSM2-like macrophage-mediated regulation of Nrg1/ErbB signaling, have a substantial effect on fibrotic tissue formation in the infarcted adult mouse heart, is critical for suppressing the progression of senescence and apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "Heterologous protein production is a highly demanded biotechnological process. Secretion of the product to the culture broth is advantageous because it drastically reduces downstream pro-cessing costs. We exploit unconventional secretion for heterologous protein expression in the fungal model microorganism Ustilago maydis. Proteins of interest are fused to carrier chitinase Cts1 for export via the fragmentation zone of dividing yeast cells in a lock-type mechanism. Here, we are first to develop regulatory systems for unconventional protein secretion. This enables uncoupling the accumulation of biomass and protein synthesis of a product of choice from its export. Regulation was successfully established at two different levels using transcriptional and post-translational induction strategies. As a proof-of-principle, we applied autoinduction based on transcriptional regulation for the production and secretion of functional anti-Gfp nanobodies. The presented developments comprise tailored solutions for differentially prized products and thus constitute another important step towards a competitive protein production platform.",

Current methods for assessing the ability of PTVs to induce nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) focus primarily on the position of the variant in the transcript. We used RNA-sequencing of the Genotype Tissue Expression v8 cohort to compute the efficiency of NMD using allelic imbalance for 2,320 rare (genome aggregation database minor allele frequency <=1%) PTVs across 809 individuals in 49 tissues. We created an interpretable predictive model using penalized logistic regression in order to evaluate the comprehensive influence of variant annotation, tissue, and inter-individual variation on NMD. We found that variant position, allele frequency, including ultra-rare and singleton variants, and conservation were predictive of allelic imbalance. Furthermore, we found that NMD effects were highly concordant across tissues and individuals. Due to this high consistency, we demonstrate in silico that utilizing peripheral tissues or cell lines provides accurate prediction of NMD for PTVs.",

    "abstract": "Genetics crucially contributes to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the global leading cause of death. Since the majority of CVDs can be prevented by early intervention there is a high demand for predictive markers. While genome wide association studies (GWAS) correlate genes and CVDs after diagnosis and provide a valuable resource for such markers, preferentially those with previously known or suspected function are addressed further. To tackle the unaddressed blind spot of understudied genes, we particularly focused on the validation of heart GWAS candidates with little or no apparent connection to cardiac function. Building on the high conservation of basic heart function and underlying genetics from fish to human we combined CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of the orthologs of human GWAS candidates in isogenic medaka with automated high-throughput heart rate analysis. Our functional analyses of understudied human candidates uncovered a prominent fraction of heart rate associated genes from adult human patients displaying a heart rate effect in embryonic medaka already in the injected generation. Following this pipeline, we identified 16 GWAS candidates with potential diagnostic and predictive power for human CVDs.",

    "abstract": "The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the devastating ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which poses a great threat to global public health. The spike (S) polypeptide of SARS-CoV-2 consists of the S1 and S2 subunits and is processed by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 boundary. The inclusion of the 4 amino acids (PRRA) at the S1/S2 boundary forms a furin cleavage site (FCS), 682RRAR{downarrow}S686, distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its closest relative, the SARS-CoV. Various deletions surrounding the FCS have been identified in patients. When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, the virus acquired various deletions surrounding the FCS. In the present study, we studied the viral transcriptome in SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability at the S1/S2 boundary using RNA-seq. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the S1/S2 boundary of the S gene: one is a deletion of 12 amino acids, 678TNSPRRAR{downarrow}SVAS689, which contains the FCS, another is a deletion of 5 amino acids, 675QTQTN679, which is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the S gene stability in HAE-ALI but with exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are remained at a high rate. Thus, our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is donor-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Medical imaging as method to assess the longitudinal process of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates is commonly used in research settings. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also regularly used to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities with each other is unknown in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between timepoints in CT score were increased for the second BAL. These results indicate that the effect of BAL on infected lungs is not completed within the first 24 hours. Therefore, it is of importance to acknowledge the interference between BAL and CT in rhesus macaques.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-{beta} production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment. Investigation of different interferon stimulated genes and their role in inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may direct novel antiviral strategies.",

    "abstract": "Household food security exists when households have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food at all times that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food security remains a serious challenge for many households in Ghana and the situation is even more prevalent among smallholder farmers. Using data collected from 2,603 farm households across Ghana and employing an ordered probit model the determinants of food security among farm households were assessed. The food security indicator-Food Consumption Score (FCS) which combines diet diversity, frequency of consumption and relative nutritional importance of different food groups was used for the analysis. Results indicated that farm households (76%) across Ghana were within the acceptable household food consumption groups. Nonetheless, 19% and 6% of farm households respectively were within the borderline and poor food consumption groups respectively. Further analysis revealed the determinants of food security to include experience, gender, improved variety adoption, access to credit and location. The suggestion is that government and private institutions should create an enabling environment to enhancing production capacities, economic and social resilience to improve on food security and nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Advances in the use of RNA-guided Cas9-based genome editing in plants have been rapid over the last few years. A desirable application of genome editing is gene targeting (GT), as it allows a wide range of precise modifications, however this remains inefficient especially in key crop species. Here we describe successful, heritable gene targeting in barley using an in-planta strategy but fail to achieve the same using a wheat dwarf virus replicon to increase copy number of the repair template. Without the replicon, we were able to delete 150bp of the coding sequence of our target gene whilst simultaneously fusing in-frame mCherry in its place. Starting from 14 original transgenic plants, two plants appeared to have the required gene targeting event. From one of these T0 plants, three independent gene targeting events were identified, two of which were heritable. When the replicon was included, 39 T0 plants were produced and shown to have high copy numbers of the repair template. However, none of the 17 lines screened in T1 gave rise to significant or heritable gene targeting events despite screening twice the number of plants in T1 compared to the non-replicon strategy. Investigation indicated that high copy numbers of repair template created by the replicon approach cause false positive PCR results which are indistinguishable at the sequence level to true GT events in junction PCR screens widely used in GT studies. In the successful non-replicon approach, heritable gene targeting events were obtained in T1 and subsequently the T-DNA was found to be linked to the targeted locus. Thus, physical proximity of target and donor sites may be a factor in successful gene targeting.",
