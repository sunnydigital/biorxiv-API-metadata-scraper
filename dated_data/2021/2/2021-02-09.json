    "abstract": "Despite myriad of systemic analysis, our quantitative understanding of signaling networks and their differential outputs is still limited, especially at the dynamic level. Here we employed a network motif approach to dissect key regulatory units of p53 pathway and determined how their collective activities generated context-specific dynamic responses. By combining single-cell imaging and mathematical modeling of dose-dependent p53 dynamics induced by three chemotherapeutics of distinct mechanism-of-action, including Etoposide, Nutlin-3a and 5-Fluouracil, and in five cancer cell types, we identified novel p53 dynamic modes and their mechanistic origins with new insight on previously unknown drug mediators and phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells. Our results established the functional roles of unique feedback motifs of p53 pathway in generating the stimulus- and cell type-specific signaling responses and demonstrated that transitional dynamics activated at intermediate stimulus levels can be exploited as novel quantitative readouts to uncover and elucidate the key building blocks of bio-networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, serious illness and death induced by coronavirus infection will remain a global health burden because of vaccination hesitancy, possible virus mutations, and the appearance of novel coronaviruses. Accordingly, there is a need for new approaches to limit severe illness stemming from coronavirus infections. Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors for GABA (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We previously showed that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity and death rates in mice following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1) which provides a potentially lethal model of COVID-19. Here, we report that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary coronavirus replication. Histopathological analysis revealed that GABA treatment reduced lung inflammatory infiltrates and damages. Since GABA is safe for human consumption, inexpensive, and available worldwide, it is a promising candidate to help treat COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic depends, among other measures, on developing preventive vaccines at an unprecedented pace. Vaccines approved for use and those in development intend to use neutralizing antibodies to block viral sites binding to the hosts cellular receptors. Virus infection is mediated by the spike glycoprotein trimer on the virion surface via its receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody response to this domain is an important outcome of the immunization and correlates well with viral neutralization. Here we show that macromolecular constructs with recombinant RBD conjugated to tetanus toxoid induce a potent immune response in laboratory animals. Some advantages of the immunization with the viral antigen coupled to tetanus toxoid have become evident such as predominant IgG immune response due to affinity maturation and long-term specific B-memory cells. This paper demonstrates that subunit conjugate vaccines can be an alternative for COVID-19, paving the way for other viral conjugate vaccines based on the use of small viral proteins involved in the infection process.",

Proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the S1/S2 boundary facilitates interaction with host ACE2 receptor for cell entry. To address this, high titer antibody was generated against the SARS-CoV-2-specific furin motif. Using a series of innovative ELISA-based assays, this furin site blocking antibody displayed high sensitivity and specificity for the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, and demonstrated effective blockage of both enzyme-mediated cleavage and spike-ACE2 interaction. The results suggest that immunological blocking of the furin cleavage site may afford a suitable approach to stem proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and curtail viral infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Conventional methods of agricultural pest control and crop fertilisation are contributing to a crisis of biodiversity loss, biogeochemical cycle dysregulation, and ecosystem collapse. Thus, we must find ecologically responsible means to control disease and promote crop yields. The root-associated microbiome may contribute to this goal as microbes can aid plants with disease suppression, abiotic stress relief, and nutrient bioavailability. We applied 16S rRNA gene & fungal 18S rRNA gene (ITS2 region) amplicon sequencing to profile the diversity of the bacterial, archaeal & fungal communities associated with the roots of UK elite spring bread wheat variety Triticum aestivum var. Paragon in different soils and developmental stages. This revealed that community composition shifted significantly for all three groups across compartments. This shift was most pronounced for bacteria and fungi, while we observed weaker selection on the ammonia oxidising archaea-dominated archaeal community. Across multiple soil types we found that soil inoculum was a significant driver of endosphere community composition, however several bacterial families were identified as core enriched taxa in all soil conditions. The most abundant of these were Streptomycetaceae and Burkholderiaceae. Moreover, as the plants senesce, both families were reduced in abundance, indicating that input from the living plant was required to maintain their abundance in the endosphere. To understand which microbes are using wheat root exudates in the rhizosphere, root exudates were labelled in a 13CO2 DNA stable isotope probing experiment. This shows that bacterial taxa within the Burkholderiaceae family among other core enriched taxa, such as Pseudomonadaceae, were able to use root exudates but Streptomycetaceae were not. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of the wheat microbiome, including the endosphere community. Understanding crop microbiome formation will contribute to ecologically responsible methods for yield improvement and biocontrol in the future.",

    "abstract": "Reassortment among co-infecting influenza A viruses (IAVs) is an important source of viral diversity and can facilitate expansion into novel host species. Indeed, reassortment played a key role in the evolution of the last three pandemic IAVs. Observed patterns of reassortment within a coinfected host are likely to be shaped by several factors, including viral load, the extent of viral mixing within the host and the stringency of selection. These factors in turn are expected to vary among the diverse host species that IAV infects. To investigate host differences in IAV reassortment, here we examined reassortment of two distinct avian IAV within their natural host (mallards) and a mammalian model system (guinea pigs). Animals were co-inoculated with A/wildbird/California/187718-36/2008 (H3N8) and A/mallard/Colorado/P66F1-5/2008 (H4N6) viruses. Longitudinal samples were collected from the cloaca of mallards or the nasal tract of guinea pigs and viral genetic exchange was monitored by genotyping clonal isolates from these samples. Relative to those in guinea pigs, viral populations in mallards showed higher frequencies of reassortant genotypes and were characterized by higher genotype richness and diversity. In line with these observations, analysis of pairwise segment combinations revealed lower linkage disequilibrium in mallards as compared to guinea pigs. No clear longitudinal patterns in richness, diversity or linkage disequilibrium were present in either host. Our results reveal mallards to be a highly permissive host for IAV reassortment and suggest that reduced viral mixing limits avian IAV reassortment in a mammalian host.",

    "abstract": "Plant metabolites can shape the microbial community composition in the soil. Two indole metabolites, benzoxazolinone (BOA) and gramine, produced by different Gramineae species, and quercetin, a flavonoid synthesized by many dicot species, were studied for their impacts on the community structure of soil bacteria. The three plant metabolites were directly added to agricultural soil over a period of 28 days. Alterations in bacterial composition were monitored by next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene PCR products and phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Treatment of the soil with the plant metabolites altered the composition of bacterial taxa on the phylum and genus levels. Alpha diversity was significantly altered by BOA or quercetin, but not by gramine. BOA treatment caused an increase in the relative abundances of only four genera, three of them belonging to the Actinobacteriota. Gramine or quercetin treatment resulted in the increase in relative abundance of 13 or 14 genera, respectively, most of them belonging to the Proteobacteria. The relative abundance of 22 genera was decreased after BOA treatment, 16 of which were also decreased by gramine or quercetin. Isolation and characterization of cultivable bacterial indicated an enrichment in specific Arthrobacter or Pseudomonas strains. Therefore, the effects of the treatments on soil bacteria were characteristic for each metabolite, with BOA exerting a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect, with only few genera able to proliferate, while gramine and quercetin caused the proliferation of many potentially beneficial strains. As a consequence, benzoxazolinone or gramine biosynthesis which have evolved in different barley species, is accompanied with the association with distinct bacterial communities in the soil, presumably after mutual adaptation during evolution.",

    "abstract": "Pdr5, a member of the extensive ABC transporter superfamily, is representative of a clinically relevant subgroup involved in pleiotropic drug resistance. Through the coupling of nucleotide hydrolysis with drug efflux, Pdr5 homologues enable pathogenic species to survive in the presence of chemically diverse antifungal agents. Our structural and functional results reveal details of an ATP-driven conformational cycle, which mechanically drives drug translocation through an amphipathic channel, and a clamping switch within a conserved linker loop that acts as a nucleotide sensor. One half of the transporter remains nearly invariant throughout the cycle, while its partner undergoes changes that are transmitted across interdomain interfaces to support a peristaltic motion of the pumped molecule. The efflux model proposed here rationalises the pleiotropic impact of Pdr5 and opens avenues for the development of effective antifungal compounds.",

We performed a large-scale experiment using 579 laboratory mice designed to identify and validate the causes of disease variability in the widely used dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Using microbiome analysis, coupled with machine learning and targeted anaerobic culturing, we identified and isolated the novel gut pathobiont species Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis and fulfilled Kochs postulates in mice to show that each pathobiont exerts dominant effects in the DSS model leading to variable treatment responses.

We identify two groups of antibodies: one group that uniquely binds S. aureus in biofilm state and one that recognizes S. aureus in both biofilm and planktonic state.

    "abstract": "Most vertebrate RNA viruses show pervasive suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, closely resembling the dinucleotide composition of host cell transcriptomes. In contrast, CpG suppression is absent in both invertebrate mRNA and RNA viruses that exclusively infect arthropods. Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by invertebrate vectors and thus encounter potentially conflicting evolutionary pressures in the different cytoplasmic environments. Using a newly developed Zika virus (ZIKV) model, we have investigated how demands for CpG suppression in vertebrate cells can be reconciled with potentially quite different compositional requirements in invertebrates, and how this affects ZIKV replication and transmission.\n\nMutant viruses with synonymously elevated CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequencies showed attenuated replication in vertebrate cell lines, which was rescued by knockout of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Conversely, in mosquito cells, ZIKV mutants with elevated CpG dinucleotide frequencies showed substantially enhanced replication compared to wildtype. Host-driven effects on virus replication attenuation and enhancement were even more apparent in mouse and mosquito models. Infections with CpG-or UpA-high ZIKV mutants in mice did not cause typical ZIKV-induced tissue damage and completely protected mice during subsequent challenge with wildtype virus, which demonstrates their potential as live-attenuated vaccines. In contrast, the CpG-high mutants displayed enhanced replication in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and a larger proportion of mosquitoes carried infectious virus in their saliva.\n\nThese findings show that mosquito cells are also capable of discriminating RNA based on dinucleotide composition. However, the evolutionary pressure on the CpG dinucleotides of viral genomes in arthropod vectors directly opposes the pressure present in vertebrate host cells, which provides evidence that an adaptive compromise is required for arbovirus transmission. This suggests that the genome composition of arthropod-borne flaviviruses is crucial to maintain the balance between high-level replication in the vertebrate host and persistent replication in the mosquito vector.",

    "abstract": "The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occurs in chromatin and several histone post-translational modifications have been implicated in the process. Modifications of histone H2A N-terminal tail has also been linked to DNA damage response, through acetylation or ubiquitination of lysine residues that regulate repair pathway choice. Here, we characterize a new DNA damage-induced phosphorylation on chromatin, at serine 15 of H2A in yeast. We show that this SQ motif functions independently of the classical S129 C-terminal site ({gamma}H2A) and mutant mimicking constitutive phosphorylation increases cell sensitivity to DNA damage. H2AS129ph is induced by Tel1ATM and Mec1ATR, and loss of Lcd1ATRIP or Mec1 signaling decreases {gamma}H2A spreading distal to the DSB. In contrast, H2AS15ph is completely dependent on Lcd1ATRIP, indicating that this modification only happens when end resection is engaged. This is supported by an increase of RPA and a decrease in DNA signal near the DSB in the H2AS-15E phosphomimic mutant, indicating higher resection. This serine is replaced by a lysine in mammals (H2AK15), which undergoes an acetyl-monoubiquityl switch to regulate binding of 53BP1 and resection. This regulation seems functionally conserved with budding yeast H2AS15 and 53BP1-homolog Rad9, using different post-translational modifications between organisms but achieving the same function.",

    "abstract": "Scleractinian corals form the foundation of coral reefs by secreting skeletons of calcium carbonate. Their intracellular algal symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) translocate a large proportion of photosynthate to the coral host, which is required to maintain high rates of calcification. Global warming is causing dissociation of coral host and algal symbiont, visibly presented as coral bleaching. Despite decades of study, the precise mechanisms of coral bleaching remain unknown. Separating the thermal stress response of the coral from the algal symbiont is key to understanding bleaching in tropical corals. The facultatively symbiotic northern star coral, Astrangia poculata, naturally occurs as both symbiotic and aposymbiotic (lacking algal symbionts) polyps - sometimes on the same coral colony. Thus, it is possible to separate the heat stress response of the coral host alone from the coral in symbiosis with its symbiont Breviolum psygmophilum. Using replicate symbiotic and aposymbiotic ramets of A. poculata, we conducted a chronic heat stress experiment to increase our understanding of the cellular mechanisms resulting in coral bleaching. Sustained high temperature stress resulted in photosynthetic dysfunction in B. psygmophilum, including a decline in maximum photosynthesis rate, maximum photochemical efficiency, and the absorbance peak of chlorophyll a. Interestingly, the metabolic rates of symbiotic and aposymbiotic corals were differentially impacted. RNAseq analysis revealed more differentially expressed genes between heat-stressed and control aposymbiotic colonies than heat-stressed and control symbiotic colonies. Notably, aposymbiotic colonies increased the expression of inflammation-associated genes such as nitric oxide synthases. Unexpectedly, the largest transcriptional response was observed between heat-stressed and control B. psygmophilum, including genes involved in photosynthesis, response to oxidative stress, and meiosis. Thus, it appears that the algal symbiont suppresses the immune response of the host, potentially increasing the vulnerability of the host to pathogens. The A. poculata-B. psygmophilum symbiosis provides a tractable model system for investigating thermal stress and immune challenge in scleractinian corals.",

    "abstract": "Germline restricted DNA has evolved in diverse animal taxa, and is found in several vertebrate clades, nematodes, and flies. In these lineages, either portions of chromosomes or entire chromosomes are eliminated from somatic cells early in development, restricting portions of the genome to the germline. Little is known about why germline restricted DNA has evolved, especially in flies, in which three diverse families, Chironomidae, Cecidomyiidae, and Sciaridae exhibit germline restricted chromosomes (GRCs). We conducted a genomic analysis of germline restricted chromosomes in the fungus gnat Bradysia (Sciara) coprophila (Diptera: Sciaridae), which carries two large germline restricted \"L\" chromosomes. We sequenced and assembled the genome of B. coprophila, and used differences in sequence coverage and k-mer frequency between somatic and germ tissues to identify GRC sequence and compare it to the other chromosomes in the genome. We found that the GRCs in B. coprophila are large, gene-rich, and have many genes with paralogs on other chromosomes in the genome. We also found that the GRC genes are extraordinarily divergent from their paralogs, and have sequence similarity to another Dipteran family (Cecidomyiidae) in phylogenetic analyses, suggesting that these chromosomes have arisen in Sciaridae through introgression from a related lineage. These results suggest that the GRCs may have evolved through an ancient hybridization event, raising questions about how this may have occurred, how these chromosomes became restricted to the germline after introgression, and why they were retained over time.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells employ three SMC complexes to control DNA folding and topology. The Smc5/6 complex plays roles in DNA repair and in preventing the accumulation of deleterious DNA junctions. To elucidate how specific features of Smc5/6 govern these functions, we reconstituted the yeast holo-complex. We found that the Nse5/6 sub-complex strongly inhibited the Smc5/6 ATPase by preventing productive ATP binding. This inhibition was relieved by plasmid DNA binding but not by short linear DNA, while opposing effects were observed without Nse5/6. We uncovered two binding sites for Nse5/6 on Smc5/6, based on an Nse5/6 crystal structure and cross-linking mass spectrometry data. One binding site is located at the Smc5/6 arms and one at the heads, the latter likely exerting inhibitory effects on ATP hydrolysis. Cysteine cross-linking demonstrated that the interaction with Nse5/6 anchored the ATPase domains in a non-productive state, which was destabilized by ATP and DNA. Under similar conditions, the Nse4/3/1 module detached from the ATPase. Altogether, we show how DNA substrate selection is modulated by direct inhibition of the Smc5/6 ATPase by Nse5/6.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has challenged humankinds ability to quickly determine the cascade of health effects caused by a novel infection. Even with the unprecedented speed at which vaccines were developed and introduced into society, identifying therapeutic interventions and drug targets for patients infected with the virus remains important as new strains of the virus may evolve, or future coronaviruses may emerge, that are resistant to current vaccines. The application of transcriptomic RNA sequencing of infected samples may shed new light on the pathways involved in viral mechanisms and host responses. We describe the application of \"dual RNA-seq\" analysis to consider both the host and pathogen transcriptomes simultaneously, to investigate for the first time the co-regulation of human and SARS-CoV-2 genes. Together with differential expression analysis, we describe the tissue specificity of SARS-CoV-2 expression, an inferred lipopolysaccharide response, and co-regulation of CXCLs, SPRRs, S100s with SARS-CoV-2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide response pathways in particular offer promise for future therapeutic research and the prospect of subgrouping patients based on chemokine expression that may help explain the vastly different reactions patients have to infection. Taken together these findings illuminate previously unappreciated SARS-CoV-2 expression signatures, identify new therapeutic considerations, and contribute a pipeline for studying multi-transcriptome systems.",

    "abstract": "Self-propelled bacteria can exhibit a large variety of non-equilibrium self-organized phenomena. Swarming is one such fascinating dynamical scenario where a number of motile individuals grouped into clusters and move in synchronized flows and vortices. While precedent investigations in rod-like particles confirm that increased aspect-ratio promotes alignment and order, recent experimental studies in bacteria Bacillus subtilis show a non-monotonic dependence of cell-aspect ratio on their swarming motion. Here, by computer simulations of an agent-based model of selfpropelled, mechanically interacting, rod-shaped bacteria in overdamped condition, we explore the collective dynamics of bacterial swarm subjected to a variation of cell-aspect ratio. When modeled with an identical self-propulsion speed across a diverse range of cell aspect ratio, simulations demonstrate that both shorter and longer bacteria exhibit slow dynamics whereas the fastest speed is obtained at an intermediate aspect ratio. Our investigation highlights that the origin of this observed non-monotonic trend of bacterial speed and vorticity with cell-aspect ratio is rooted in the cell-size dependence of motility force. The swarming features remain robust for a wide range of surface density of the cells, whereas asymmetry in friction attributes a distinct effect. Our analysis identifies that at an intermediate aspect ratio, an optimum cell size and motility force promote alignment, which reinforces the mechanical interactions among neighboring cells leading to the overall fastest motion. Mechanistic underpinning of the collective motions reveals that it is a joint venture of the short-range repulsive and the size-dependent motility forces, which determines the characteristics of swarming.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-{beta} (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-{kappa}B pathway, we examined the status of TNF-, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients.\n\nImportanceExosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs and promotes pathogenesis. We expect to detect whether other factors are modulated in the presence of COVID-19 exosomes. Our exosomes related proteomic experiments prioritize after initial verification to further examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 associated other pathogenic mechanisms to target for therapeutic modalities.",

Despite remarkable progress in our molecular understanding of amino acid transport, metabolism and signalling, it remains unclear by what mechanisms cytosolic amino acid concentrations are maintained. We propose that amino acid transporters are the primary determinants of intracellular amino acid levels. We show that a cells endowment with amino acid transporters can be deconvoluted by a logical series of experiments. This was used to computationally simulate amino acid translocation across the plasma membrane. For two different cancer cell lines and human myotubes, transport simulation generates cytosolic amino acid concentrations that are close to those observed in vitro. Perturbations of the system were replicated in silico and could be applied to systems where only transcriptomic data are available. The methodology developed in this study is widely applicable to other transport processes and explain amino acid homeostasis at the systems-level.",

While there is an urgent need for new drug regimens to treat TB, the process of drug evaluation is slow and inefficient owing to the slow growth rate of the pathogen, the complexity of performing bacteriologic assays in a high-containment facility, and the context-dependent variability in drug sensitivity of the pathogen. Here, we report the development of \"DRonA\" and \"MLSynergy\", algorithms to perform rapid drug response assays and predict response of Mtb to novel drug combinations. Using a novel transcriptome signature for cell viability, DRonA accurately detects bacterial killing by diverse mechanisms in broth culture, macrophage infection and patient sputum, providing an efficient, and more sensitive alternative to time- and resource-intensive bacteriologic assays. Further, MLSynergy builds on DRonA to predict novel synergistic and antagonistic multi-drug combinations using transcriptomes of Mtb treated with single drugs. Together DRonA and MLSynergy represent a generalizable framework for rapid monitoring of drug effects in host-relevant contexts and accelerate the discovery of efficacious high-order drug combinations.",

    "abstract": "Negative frequency-dependent selection is one possible mechanism for maintenance of rare species in communities, but the selective advantage of rare species may be checked at lower overall population densities where resources are abundant. Gardnerella spp. belonging to cpn60 subgroup D, are detected at low levels in vaginal microbiomes and are nutritional generalists relative to other more abundant Gardnerella spp., making them good candidates for negative frequency-dependent selection. The vaginal microbiome is a dynamic environment and the resulting changes in density of the microbiota may explain why subgroup D never gains dominance. To test this, we co-cultured subgroup D isolates with isolates from the more common and abundant subgroup C. Deep amplicon sequencing of rpoB was used to determine proportional abundance of each isolate at 0 h and 72 h in 152 co-cultures, and to calculate change in proportion. D isolates had a positive change in proportional abundance in most co-cultures regardless of initial proportion. Initial density affected the change in proportion of subgroup D isolates either positively or negatively depending on the particular isolates combined, suggesting that growth rate, population density and other intrinsic features of the isolates influenced the outcome. Our results demonstrate that population density is an important factor influencing the outcome of competition between Gardnerella spp. isolated from the human vaginal microbiome.",

Synthetic RNAs, however, can also act through the RNAi pathway to regulate transcription and splicing. While nuclear regulation by synthetic RNAs can be robust, a critical unanswered question is whether endogenous functions for nuclear RNAi exist in mammalian cells. Using enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) in combination with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and multiple AGO knockout cell lines, we mapped AGO2 protein binding sites within nuclear RNA. The strongest AGO2 binding sites were mapped to micro RNAs (miRNAs). The most abundant miRNAs were distributed similarly between cytoplasm and nucleus, providing no evidence for mechanisms that facilitate localization of miRNAs in one compartment versus the other. Beyond miRNAs, most statistically-significant AGO2 binding was within introns. Splicing changes were confirmed by RT-PCR and were recapitulated by synthetic duplex RNAs and miRNA mimics complementary to the sites of AGO2 binding. These data support the hypothesis that miRNAs can control gene splicing. While nuclear RNAi proteins have the potential to be a natural regulatory mechanism, careful study will be necessary to identify critical RNA drivers of normal physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "Molecular clock dating is widely used to estimate timescales of phylogenetic histories and to infer rates at which species evolve. One of the major challenges with inferring rates of molecular evolution is the observation of a strong correlation between estimated rates and the timeframe of their measurements. Recent empirical analysis of virus evolutionary rates suggest that a power-law rate decay best explains the time-dependent pattern of substitution rates and that the same pattern is observed regardless of virus type (e.g. groups I-VII in the Baltimore classification). However there exists no explanation for this trend based on molecular evolutionary mechanisms. We provide a simple predictive mechanistic model of the time-dependent rate phenomenon, incorporating saturation and host constraints on the evolution of some sites. Our model recapitulates the ubiquitous power-law rate decay with a slope of -0.65 (95% HPD: -0.72, -0.52) and can satisfactorily account for the variation in inferred molecular evolutionary rates over a wide range of timeframes. We show that once the saturation of sites starts - typically after hundreds of years in RNA viruses and thousands of years in DNA viruses - standard substitution models fail to correctly estimate divergence times among species, while our model successfully re-creates the observed pattern of rate decay. We apply our model to re-date the diversification of genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) to 396,000 (95% HPD: 326,000 - 425,000) years before present, a time preceding the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and also showed that the most recent common ancestor of sarbecoviruses dates back to 23,500 (95% HPD: 21,100 - 25,300) years ago, nearly thirty times older than previous estimates. This not only creates a radical new perspective for our understanding the origins of HCV but also suggests a substantial revision of evolutionary timescales of other viruses can be similarly achieved.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of RNA viruses has been long considered to result from a combination of high copying error frequencies during RNA replication, short generation times and the consequent extensive fixation of neutral or adaptive changes over short periods. While both the identities and sites of mutations are typically modelled as being random, recent investigations of sequence diversity of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have identified a preponderance of C->U transitions, potentially driven by an APOBEC-like RNA editing process. The current study investigated whether this phenomenon could be observed in the more genetically diverse datasets of other RNA viruses. Using a 5% divergence filter to infer directionality, 18 from 32 datasets of aligned coding region sequences from a diverse range of mammalian RNA viruses (including Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae, Matonaviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae) showed a >2-fold base composition normalised excess of C->U transitions compared to U->C (range 2.1x-7.5x). C->U transitions showed a weak favoured 5 U upstream context consistent with previous analyses of APOBEC-mediated RNA targeting. Amongst several genomic compositional and structural parameters, the presence of genome scale RNA secondary structure (GORS) was associated with C->U/U->C transition asymmetries (p < 0.001), potentially reflecting the documented structure dependence of APOBEC-mediated RNA editing. Using the association index metric, C->U changes were specifically over-represented at phylogenetically uninformative sites, consistent with extensive homoplasy documented in SARS-CoV-2. Excess C->U substitutions accounted for 15-20% of standing sequence variability of HCV and other RNA viruses; RNA editing may therefore represent a potent driver of RNA virus sequence diversification and longer term evolution.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe rapid evolution of RNA viruses is thought to arise from high mutation frequencies during replication and the rapid accumulation of genetic changes over time in response to its changing environments. This study describes an additional potent factor that contributes to the evolution of RNA infecting mammals, the deliberate mutation of the viral genome by host antiviral pathways active within the cell when it becomes infected. This so called \"genome editing\" by one or more APOBEC enzymes leads to characteristic C->U mutations that damage the viruss ability to replicate. While this pathway is well characterised as an antiviral defence against HIV and other retroviruses, this study provides evidence for its activity against a wide range of human and veterinary viruses, including HCV and foot and mouth disease virus. APOBEC-driven mutations accounted for 15-20% of standing sequence variability of RNA virus groups, representing a potent driver of RNA virus sequence diversification.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that underlie the {beta}-cell pathophysiology of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) are not fully understood. Our group has defined the unique heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit, Gz, as a key negative regulator of {beta}-cell signal transduction pathways. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice lacking Gz throughout the body are protected from developing T1D-like hyperglycemia. To determine whether this phenotype is {beta}-cell autonomous, we generated and validated a {beta}-cell-specific Gz knockout ({beta}KO) on the NOD background and characterized the phenotype of female and male cohorts. Long-term hyperglycemia incidence was lower in Gz {beta}KO mice as compared to wild-type (WT) controls, but, unlike global Gz knockout mice, this protection was incomplete. While young male and female Gz {beta}KO NOD mice had improved glucose tolerance, WT NOD males were significantly less glucose tolerant than females, and only female Gz {beta}KO mice retained improved glucose tolerance at 28-29 weeks of age. Conversely, {beta}-cell-specific Gz loss only influenced insulitis in 28-29-week old male NOD mice, a phenotype correlating directly with body burden of glucose during oral glucose challenge. Using surrogates for {beta}-cell function and apoptosis, the partial penetrance of euglycemia in Gz {beta}KO NOD was best explained by an early failure to up-regulate {beta}-cell proliferation. We conclude {beta}-cell Gz is an important regulator of the sexually-dimorphic T1D-like phenotype of NOD mice. Yet, other factors must be important in imparting full protection from the disease.",

    "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests the central nervous system (CNS) is frequently impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or indirectly, although mechanisms remain unclear. Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points1. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Prior to infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral  replication hubs, with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids (PCCOs) represent a new  assembloid model2 that supports SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in neural tissue, and PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural infection.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression analysis (e.g., targeted gene panels, transcriptomics) from whole blood can elucidate mechanisms of immune function and aid in the discovery of biomarkers. Conventional venipuncture offers only a small snapshot of our broad immune landscape as immune responses may occur outside of the time and location parameters available for conventional venipuncture. A self-operated method that enables flexible sampling of liquid whole blood coupled with immediate stabilization of cellular RNA is instrumental in facilitating capture and preservation of acute or transient immune fluxes. To this end, we developed homeRNA: a kit for self-collection of peripheral blood ([~]0.5 mL) and immediate stabilization of cellular RNA, using the Tasso- SST blood collection device with a specially designed stabilizer tube containing RNAlater. To assess the feasibility of homeRNA for self-collection and stabilization of whole blood RNA, we conducted a pilot study (n = 47 participants) where we sent homeRNA to participants aged 21-69, located across 10 US states (94% successful blood collections, n = 61/65). Among participants who successfully collected blood, 93% reported no or minimal pain/discomfort using the kit (n = 39/42), and 79% reported very easy/somewhat easy stabilization protocol (n = 33/42). Total RNA yield from the stabilized samples ranged between 0.20 {micro}g and 5.99 {micro}g (mean = 1.51 {micro}g), and all but one RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values were above 7.0 (mean = 8.1), indicating limited RNA degradation.

The recent reemergence of CBB, caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm) revealed many gaps in our understanding of this important disease. In this study, we employed a field isolate of Xcm from Georgia USA (WT) to generate a non- pathogenic, hrcV mutant lacking a functional Type III Secretion System (T3SS-). We tagged the WT and T3SS- strains with an auto-bioluminescent Tn7 reporter and compared colonization patterns of susceptible and resistant cotton seedlings using macroscopic image analysis and bacterial load enumeration. Wildtype and T3SS- Xcm strains colonized cotton cotyledons of resistant and susceptible cotton cultivars. However, Xcm populations were significantly higher in susceptible seedlings inoculated with the WT strain. Additionally, WT and T3SS- Xcm strains systemically colonized true leaves, although at different rates. Finally, we observed that seed-to-seedling transmission of Xcm may involve systemic spread through the vascular tissue of cotton plants. These findings yield novel insights into potential Xcm reservoirs for CBB outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable debate over how visual speech is processed in the absence of sound and whether neural activity supporting lipreading occurs in visual brain areas. Surprisingly, much of this ambiguity stems from a lack of behaviorally grounded neurophysiological findings. To address this, we conducted an experiment in which human observers rehearsed audiovisual speech for the purpose of lipreading silent versions during testing. Using a combination of computational modeling, electroencephalography, and simultaneously recorded behavior, we show that the visual system produces its own specialized representation of speech that is 1) well-described by categorical linguistic units (\"visemes\") 2) dissociable from lip movements, and 3) predictive of lipreading ability. These findings contradict a long-held view that visual speech processing co-opts auditory cortex after early visual processing stages. Consistent with hierarchical accounts of visual and audiovisual speech perception, our findings show that visual cortex performs at least a basic level of linguistic processing.",

We performed single nucleotide replacement (SNR) in dnd with up to 59.2% efficiency, and inserted FLAG elements into slc45a2 and dnd, with up to 36.7 % and 32.7% efficiency, respectively. We found HDR efficiency to be dependent on template concentration, but a trade-off with respect to toxicity was observed. Using this NBT in salmon we demonstrate that precise modification of the genome can be achieved in a single generation, allowing efficient introgression of favorable alleles and bypassing challenges associated with traditional selective breeding.",

To explore the molecular characteristics of esophageal keratinocytes along the squamous differentiation continuum, we performed single cell RNA-Sequencing transcriptomic profiling of 7,972 cells from murine esophageal epithelial sheets. We identified 8 distinct cell clusters in esophageal epithelium, unveiling an unexpected level of diversity, particularly among basal cells. We further mapped the cellular pathways and lineage trajectories within basal, suprabasal, and superficial clusters as well as within the heterogeneous basal cell populations, providing a comprehensive molecular view of esophageal epithelial cells in the context of squamous differentiation. Finally, we explored the impact of tissue aging upon esophageal epithelial cell clusters and demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature of aging in normal esophageal epithelium. These studies provide an unparalleled molecular perspective on murine esophageal keratinocytes that will serve as a valuable resource for dissecting cell type-specific roles in esophageal biology under conditions of homeostasis, aging, and tissue pathology.",

The embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) vasculature was successfully used as a novel route of gene transfer into germline tissues. We established a new method of eggshell windowing for embryo manipulation at different developmental stages. Compared to the other routes of viral vector administration, the embryos bloodstream at Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stages 14-15 achieved the highest rate of germline transmission (GT), 7.7%. Single injection of viral vectors into the CAM vasculature resulted in a GT efficiency of 2.7%, which was significantly higher than the 0.4% obtained by injection into embryos at the blastoderm stage. Double injection of viral vectors into the bloodstream at HH stages 14-15 and through CAM was the most efficient method for producing germline chimeras, giving a GT rate of 13.6%.

    "abstract": "Introgression of major-effect QTLs is an important component of rice breeding for yield-retention under drought. While largely effective, the maximum potentials of such QTLs have not been consistent across genetic backgrounds. We hypothesized that synergism or antagonism with additive-effect peripheral genes across the background could either enhance or undermine the QTL effects. To elucidate the molecular underpinnings of such interaction, we dissected qDTY12.1 synergy with numerous peripheral genes in context of network rewiring effects. By integrative transcriptome profiling and network modeling, we identified the DECUSSATE (OsDEC) within qDTY12.1 as the core of the synergy and shared by two sibling introgression lines in IR64 genetic background, i.e., LPB (low-yield penalty) and HPB (high-yield penalty). OsDEC is expressed in flag leaves and induced by progressive drought at booting stage in LPB but not in HPB. The unique OsDEC signature in LPB is coordinated with 35 upstream and downstream peripheral genes involved in floral development through the cytokinin signaling pathway, which are lacking in HPB. Results further support the differential network rewiring effects through genetic coupling-uncoupling between qDTY12.1 and other upstream and downstream peripheral genes across the distinct genetic backgrounds of LPB and HPB. We propose that the functional DEC-network in LPB defines a mechanism for early flowering as a means for avoiding the depletion of photosyntate needed for reproductive growth due to drought. Its impact on yield-retention is likely through the timely establishment of stronger source-sink dynamics that sustains a robust reproductive transition under drought.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile the Green Revolution of the 1960s significantly increased rice grain yields through the creation of high-yielding varieties for high input systems, current marginal climates pose a significant challenge for providing consistent yield. In rice growing regions of the world, drought affects the livelihood of small-scale and subsistence farmers by inflicting significant yield penalties to their production systems. Breeding of next-generation rice varieties with optimal balance of survivability and productivity traits will be key to providing consistent yields year to year. Within this paradigm, the use of large effect QTLs such as qDTY12.1 to improve yield retention under drought have been largely successful. By integrating the use of high resolution transcriptome datasets with a focused biological interrogation of agronomic results from this and previous studies, we uncovered a putative functional genetic network, anchored by the DECUSSATE gene (OsDEC) within qDTY12.1, that effectively minimizes drought penalties to yield by driving cellular processes that culminate in timely flowering that maximizes the use of photosynthetic sources for efficient reproduductive transition and ultimately seed development. Our study further illuminates the qDTY12.1 function and speaks to the misconception that qDTY introgression alone is sufficient for providing consistently large positive effects to yield retention under reproductive stage drought.",

    "abstract": "There are two well-established facts about vertebrate brains: brains are physiologically costly organs, and both absolute and relative brain size varies greatly between and within the major vertebrate clades. While the costs are relatively clear, scientists struggle to establish how larger brains translate into higher cognitive performance. Part of the challenge is that intuitively larger brains are needed to control larger bodies without any changes in cognitive performance. Therefore, body size needs to be controlled to establish the slope of cognitive equivalence between animals of different sizes. Potentially, intraspecific slopes provide the best available estimate of how an increase in body size translates into an increase in brain size without changes in cognitive performance. Here, we provide the first evaluation of this hypothesis for fishes. First, a dataset of 51 species that included only samples of [&ge;] ten wild-caught individuals yielded a mean brain-body slope of 0.46 (albeit with a large range of 0.26 to 0.79). This mean slope is similar to the encephalisation quotients for ectotherm higher taxa, i.e. teleost fishes, amphibians and reptiles ([~] 0.5). However, the slope is much higher than what has been found in endotherm vertebrate species ([~] 0.3). Second, we provide slope estimates for brain-body sizes and for cognition-body sizes in wild-caught cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus as a case study. Brain-body slopes from two datasets gave the values of 0.58 (MRI scans data) and 0.47 (dissection data). Furthermore, we have cognitive performance data from 69 individuals tested in four different cognitive tasks that estimated learning, numerical, and inhibitory control abilities. In all four tasks, the cognitive performance did not correlate significantly with body size. These results suggest that the brain-body slopes represent estimates of intraspecific cognitive equivalence for this species. While subject to further studies on various species, our results suggest that endo- and ectotherm brain organisations and resulting cognitive performances are fundamentally different.",

    "abstract": "The common marmoset has enormous promise as a nonhuman primate model of human brain functions. While resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided evidence for a similar organization of marmoset and human cortices, the technique cannot be used to map the functional correspondences of brain regions between species. This limitation can be overcome by movie-driven fMRI (md-fMRI), which has become a popular tool for non-invasively mapping the neural patterns generated by rich and naturalistic stimulation. Here, we used md-fMRI in marmosets and humans to identify whole-brain functional correspondences between the two primate species. In particular, we describe functional correlates for the well-known human face, body, and scene patches in marmosets. We find that these networks have a similar organization in both species, suggesting a largely conserved organization of higher-order visual areas between New World marmoset monkeys and humans. However, while face patches in humans and marmosets were activated by marmoset faces, only human face patches responded to the faces of other animals. Together, the results demonstrate that md-fMRI is a powerful tool for interspecies functional mapping and characterization of higher-order visual functions.",

    "abstract": "Animals rely on sensory feedback to generate accurate, reliable movements. In many flying insects, strain-sensitive neurons on the wings provide rapid feedback that enables stable flight control. While the impacts of wing structure on aerodynamic performance have been widely studied, the impacts of wing structure on sensing remain unexplored. In this paper, we show how the structural properties of the wing and encoding by mechanosensory neurons interact to jointly determine optimal sensing strategies and performance. Specifically, we examine how neural sensors can be placed effectively over a flapping wing to detect body rotation about different axes, using a computational wing model with varying flexural stiffness inspired by the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. A small set of mechanosensors, conveying strain information at key locations with a single action potential per wingbeat, permit accurate detection of body rotation. Optimal sensor locations are concentrated at either the wing base or the wing tip, and they transition sharply as a function of both wing stiffness and neural threshold. Moreover, the sensing strategy and performance is robust to both external disturbances and sensor loss. Typically, only five sensors are needed to achieve near-peak accuracy, with a single sensor often providing accuracy well above chance. Our results show that small-amplitude, dynamic signals can be extracted efficiently with spatially and temporally sparse sensors in the context of flight. The demonstrated interaction of wing structure and neural encoding properties points to the importance of their joint evolution.",

We analyzed asynchronous release, paired pulse facilitation, and synaptic vesicle replenishment, and found that SYT7 contributes to each of these processes to different degrees.  Zap-and-freeze electron microscopy revealed that loss of SYT7 impairs the docking of synaptic vesicles after a stimulus and the recovery of depleted synaptic vesicles after a stimulus train.

    "abstract": "Online recruitment platforms are increasingly utilized for experimental research. Crowdsourcing is associated with numerous benefits but also notable constraints, including lack of control over participants environment and engagement. In the context of auditory experiments, these limitations may be particularly detrimental to threshold-based tasks that require effortful listening. Here, we ask whether incorporating a performance-based monetary bonus will improve speech reception performance of online participants. In two experiments, participants performed an adaptive matrix-type speech-in-noise task (where listeners select two key words out of closed sets). In Experiment 1, our results revealed worse performance in online (N = 49) compared with in-lab (N = 81) groups. Specifically, relative to the in-lab cohort, significantly fewer participants in the online group achieved very low (< -17dB) thresholds. In Experiment 2 (N = 200), we show that a monetary reward improved listeners threshold to levels similar to those observed in the lab setting. Overall the results suggest that providing a small performance-based bonus increases participants task-engagement, facilitating a more accurate estimation of auditory ability under challenging listening conditions.",

    "abstract": "Although co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ T cells reflects activation during influenza, SARS-CoV-2, Dengue, Ebola and HIV-1 viral infections, high and prolonged CD38+HLA-DR+ expression can be associated with severe and fatal disease outcomes. As the expression of CD38+HLA-DR+ is poorly understood, we used mouse models of influenza A/H7N9, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 infection to investigate the mechanisms underpinning CD38+MHC-II+ phenotype on CD8+ T-cells. Our analysis of influenza-specific immunodominant DbNP366+CD8+ T-cell responses showed that CD38+MHC-II+ co-expression was detected on both virus-specific and bystander CD8+ T-cells, with increased numbers of both CD38+MHC-II+CD8+ T-cell populations observed in the respiratory tract during severe infection. To understand the mechanisms underlying CD38 and MHC-II expression, we also used adoptively-transferred transgenic OT-I CD8+ T-cells recognising the ovalbumin-derived KbSIINFEKL epitope and A/H1N1-SIINKEKL infection. Strikingly, we found that OT-I cells adoptively-transferred into MHC-II-/- mice did not display MHC-II after influenza virus infection, suggesting that MHC-II was acquired via trogocytosis in wild-type mice. Additionally, detection of CD19 on CD38+MHC II+ OT-I cells further supports that MHC-II was acquired by trogocytosis, at least partially, sourced from B-cells. Our results also revealed that co-expression of CD38+MHC II+ on CD8+ T-cells was needed for the optimal recall ability following secondary viral challenge. Overall, our study provides evidence that both virus-specific and bystander CD38+MHC-II+ CD8+ T-cells are recruited to the site of infection during severe disease, and that MHC-II expression occurs via trogocytosis from antigen-presenting cells. Our findings also highlight the importance of the CD38+MHC II+ phenotype for CD8+ T-cell memory establishment and recall.\n\nSummaryCo-expression of CD38 and MHC-II on CD8+ T cells is recognized as a classical hallmark of activation during viral infections. High and prolonged CD38+HLA-DR+ expression, however, can be associated with severe disease outcomes and the mechanisms are unclear. Using our established influenza wild-type and transgenic mouse models, we determined how disease severity affected the activation of influenza-specific CD38+MHC-II+CD8+ T cell responses in vivo and the antigenic determinants that drive their activation and expansion. Overall, our study provides evidence that both virus-specific and bystander CD38+MHC-II+ CD8+ T-cells are recruited to the site of infection during severe disease, and that MHC-II expression occurs, at least in part, via trogocytosis from antigen-presenting cells.

In this study, we used a combination of quantitative and structural mass spectrometry techniques to determine the composition and structure of the interaction network formed between human plasma proteins and the surface of different S. pyogenes serotypes. Quantitative network analysis revealed that S. pyogenes form serotype-specific interaction networks that are highly dependent on the domain arrangement of the surface-attached M protein. Subsequent structural mass spectrometry analysis and computational modelling on one of the M proteins, M28 revealed that the network structure changes across different host microenvironments. We report that M28 binds secretory IgA via two separate binding sites with high affinity in saliva. During vascular leakage mimicked by increasing plasma concentrations in saliva, the binding of secretory IgA was replaced by binding of monomeric IgA and C4BP. This indicates that an upsurge of C4BP in the local microenvironment due to damage of the mucosal membrane drives binding of C4BP and monomeric IgA to M28. The results suggest that S. pyogenes has evolved to form microenvironment-dependent host-pathogen protein complexes to combat the human immune surveillance during both mucosal and systemic infections.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated evolution is often driven by the interaction between environmental factors and genes. However, it remains unclear whether accelerated evolution can be ignited. Here, we focused on adaptive events during the emergence of chorioallantoic placenta. We scanned the chromosome X and identified eight accelerated regions in the ancestral lineage of eutherian mammals. Five of these regions (P = 5.61 x 10-11 ~ 9.03 x 10-8) are located in the five exons of Nik-related kinase (Nrk), which is essential in placenta development and fetoplacental induction of labor. Moreover, a eutherian-specific exogenous exon lack of splice variant was found to be conserved. Structure modelling of NRK suggests that the accelerated exons and the eutherian-specific exon could change the enzymatic activity of eutherian NRK. Since the eutherian-specific exon was surrounded by accelerated exons, it indicates that the accelerated evolution of Nrk may be ignited by the emergence of the new exon in the ancestral lineage of eutherian mammals. The new exon might shift the function of Nrk and provide a new fitness landscape for eutherian species to explore. Although multiple exons were accelerated in both of the Nrk catalytic and regulatory domains, positive selection can only be revealed on the regulatory domain if the branch specific nonsynonymous and synonymous rate test was performed by PAML. Thus, it may be important to detect accelerated evolution when studying positive selection on coding regions. Overall, this work suggests that the fundamental process of placental development and fetoplacental induction of labor has been targeted by positive Darwinian selection. Identifying positively selected placental genes provides insights into how eutherian mammals gain benefits from the invasive chorioallantoic placenta to form one of the most successful groups among terrestrial vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "In motor learning, sequence-specificity, i.e. the learning of specific sequential associations, has predominantly been studied using task-based fMRI paradigms. However, offline changes in resting state functional connectivity after sequence-specific motor learning are less well understood. Previous research has established that plastic changes following motor learning can be divided into stages including fast learning, slow learning and retention. A description of how resting state functional connectivity after sequence-specific motor sequence learning (MSL) develops across these stages is missing. This study aimed to identify plastic alterations in whole-brain functional connectivity after learning a complex motor sequence by contrasting an active group who learned a complex sequence with a control group who performed a control task matched for motor execution. Resting state fMRI and behavioural performance were collected in both groups over the course of 5 consecutive training days and at follow-up after 12 days to encompass fast learning, slow learning, overall learning and retention. Between-group interaction analyses showed sequence-specific decreases in functional connectivity during overall learning in the right supplementary motor area (SMA). We found that connectivity changes in key regions of the motor network including the superior parietal cortex (SPC) and primary motor cortex (M1) were not a result of sequence-specific learning but were instead linked to motor execution. Our study confirms the sequence-specific role of SMAthat has previously been identified in online task-based learning studies, and extends it to resting state network changes after sequence-specific MSL.",

    "abstract": "Hypersensitive response (HR)-conferred resistance is associated with an induction of programmed cell death (PCD) and pathogen spread restriction in its proximity. While the pivotal role of salicylic acid (SA) in the restriction of pathogen spread during HR has been confirmed, the exact role of chloroplastic reactive oxygen species and the link between SA signalling and chloroplast redox state during HR remain unexplained. To unravel these relationships, we performed detailed spatiotemporal analysis of chloroplast redox response to potato virus Y (PVY) infection in resistant Ny-1-gene-bearing potato and its transgenic counterpart with impaired SA accumulation and compromised resistance. We found that the chloroplasts are highly oxidized in the cells adjacent to the cell death zone at different stages after virus inoculation in both genotypes. Moreover, we detected individual cells with moderately oxidized chloroplasts, which we call \"signalling cells\", in close proximity as well as farther from the cell death zone. These are relatively rare in SA-deficient plants, suggesting their role in signalling for HR-conferred resistance. This hypothesis is further supported by highly induced formation of stroma filled tubules that extend from chloroplasts (stromules) in the cells adjacent to signalling cells. Unexpectedly, the cells with the highest occurrence of stromules have chloroplasts in more reduced state than the adjacent ones. In addition, we show that stromules are induced also at the edge of PVY multiplication zone. We conclude that chloroplast redox state and stromule formation are tightly spatiotemporally regulated by SA-signalling which leads to effective HR response.",

    "abstract": "Skin inflammation is an evolutionary-honed protective mechanism that serves to clear noxious cues and irritants and initiate regeneration. Calcium-permeable transient-receptor-potential (TRP) ion channels have critical functions in sensory transduction which is sensitized in skin inflammation. Skin sensory transduction relies on skin-innervating sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), but also on innervated keratinocytes (KC). The multimodally-activated TRPV4 is robustly expressed in KC, where it can readily be activated by Ultraviolet-B (UVB). Our goal was to deconstruct keratinocyte TRPV4-mediated signaling, specifically how TRPV4 can facilitate inflammatory injury, thus lowering pain thresholds and rendering KC into pain-generator cells. We wanted to uncover the effect of TRPV4-mediated signaling on UVB-induced inflammasome activation in KC given the powerful impact of the activated inflammasome on pro-inflammatory/pro-algesic secretory signaling, using mouse models and cultured human KC. In mice, our evidence suggests that TRPV4 functions as calcium-permeable channel upstream of the KC inflammasome. Furthermore, we found that UVB induced activation of TRPV4 caused rapid - within minutes - Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, caspase-1 activation and Interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) secretion. In human primary KC we demonstrated that UVB induced secretion of IL-1{beta} was dependent on the NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome. Direct chemical TRPV4 activation could also activate NLRP1 and to lesser extent NLPR3. Building on our previous work, we now define at increased resolution TPRV4-dependent forefront signaling mechanisms in KC in response to UVB, showing TRPV4 upstream of the NLRP1 inflammasome, subsequent rapid ERK activation and pro-inflammatory/pro-algesic secretory function.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic stimulation of the primary visual cortex (V1) is a promising therapy for sight restoration, but it remains unclear what total cerebral volume is activated after surface stimulation. In this study, we expressed the red-shifted opsin ChrimsonR in excitatory neurons within V1 in rats, and used the fine spatial resolution provided by functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) over the whole depth of the brain to investigate the brain response to focal surface stimulation. We observed optogenetic activation of a high proportion of the volume of V1. Extracellular recordings confirmed the neuronal origin of this activation. Moreover, neuronal responses were even located in deep layers under conditions of low irradiance, spreading to the LGN and V2, consistent with a normal visual information process. This study paves the way for the use of optogenetics for cortical therapies, and highlights the value of coupling fUS with optogenetics.",

    "abstract": "Sexual differentiation in bryophytes occurs in the dominant gametophytic generation. Over half of bryophytes are dioicous, and this pattern in liverworts is even more profound as over 70% of species are dioicous. However, the evolutionary mechanisms leading to the prevalence of dioicy and the shifts of sexual systems between dioicy and monoicy have remained poorly known. These essential factors in reproductive biology are explored here in light of phylogenetics combined with evidence of genomic characterization of sex chromosomes and sex-determination, as well as cytology. Our analyses and discussions on liverworts are focused on: (1) ancestry and shifts in sexuality, (2) evolution of sex chromosomes and maintenance of haploid dioicy, and (3) environmental impact on the evolution of monoicism. We show that the dioicous condition is ancestral in liverworts, and the evolution of sexual systems is both conserved and stable with an ancient origin, but also highly dynamic in certain more recently diverged lineages. We assume that the haploid dioicy maintained in the course of evolution must be linked to the genetically controlled sex-determination, and transition from genetically to developmentally controlled sex determination, the evolution of monoicism, is driven by ephemeral and unstable environments. Monoicy is less stable in the long-term than dioicy, and thus, ultimately, dioicy is selected in liverworts. It is concluded that sexual dimorphism is maintained through a highly dynamic evolutionary process, sex chromosomes bearing distinct set of evolutionary forces that can have large impacts on genome evolution and may also promote speciation.",

    "abstract": "The hallmark of meiosis is chromosomal pairing and synapsis via synaptonemal complexes, but chromosomal pairing also depends on cytoplasmic counterparts that tether and rotate telomeres on the nuclear envelope. Telomeres slide on perinuclear microtubules, shuffling chromosomes and mechanically driving their homology searches. Pull of telomeres towards the centrosome drives formation of the \"zygotene chromosomal bouquet\". These telomere dynamics are essential for pairing and fertility, and the bouquet, discovered in 1900, is universally conserved. Nevertheless, how cytoplasmic counterparts of bouquet formation are mechanically regulated has remained enigmatic. Here, we report the \"zygotene cilium\" - a previously unrecognized cilium, in oocytes. We show in zebrafish that this cilium specifically connects to the bouquet centrosome, constituting a cable system of the cytoplasmic bouquet machinery. Furthermore, zygotene cilia extend throughout the germline cyst, a conserved germ cell organization. Using multiple ciliary mutants and laser-induced excision, we demonstrate that the zygotene cilium is essential for chromosomal bouquet and synaptonemal complex formation, germ cell morphogenesis, ovarian development and fertility. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that the cilium functions at least partly via anchoring the bouquet centrosome in order to counterbalance telomere rotation and pulling. We also show that the zygotene cilium is conserved in both male and female meiosis in zebrafish, as well as in mammals. Our work uncovers the novel concept of a cilium as a critical player in meiosis and sheds new light on reproduction phenotypes in ciliopathies. We propose a cellular paradigm that cilia can control chromosomal dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The biotrophic fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is a crucial factor causing reduction of global wheat production. Wild wheat relatives, e.g. Thinopyrum intermedium, is one of the wild-used parents in wheat disease-resistant breeding. From T. intermedium line, we identified the aspartic acid protein gene, TiAP1, which involved in resistance against Bgt. TiAP1 is a secreted protein that accumulates in large amounts at the infection sites of powdery mildew and extends to the intercellular space. Yeast two-hybrid showed that it interacted with the chitin deacetylase (BgtCDA1) of Bgt. The yeast expression, purification, and invitro test confirmed the chitin deacetylase activity of BgtCDA1. The bombardment and VIGS mediated host-induced gene silencing showed BgtCDA1 promotes the invasion of Bgt. Transcriptome analysis showed the cell wall xylan metabolism, lignin biosynthesis-related, and defence genes involved in the signal transduction were upregulated in the transgenic TiAP1 wheat induced by Bgt. The TiAP1 in wheat may inactivate the deacetylation function of BgtCDA1, cause chitin oligomers expose to wheat chitin receptor, then trigger the wheat immune response to inhibit the growth and penetration of Bgt, and thereby enhance the tolerance of wheat to pathogens.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWith a large number of metagenomic datasets becoming available, the eukaryotic metagenomics emerged as a new challenge. The proper classification of eukaryotic nuclear and organellar genomes is an essential step towards the better understanding of eukaryotic diversity.\n\nResultsWe developed Tiara, a deep-learning-based approach for identification of eukaryotic sequences in the metagenomic data sets. Its two-step classification process enables the classification of nuclear and organellar eukaryotic fractions and subsequently divides organellar sequences to plastidial and mitochondrial. Using test dataset, we have shown that Tiara performs similarly to EukRep for prokaryotes classification and outperformed it for eukaryotes classification with lower calculation time. Tiara is also the only available tool correctly classifying organellar sequences.\n\nAvailability and implementationTiara is implemented in python 3.8, available at https://github.com/ibe-uw/tiara and tested on Unix-based systems. It is released under an open-source MIT license and documentation is available at https://ibe-uw.github.io/tiara. Version 1.0.1 of Tiara has been used for all benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "As implantable optical systems recently enabled new approaches to study the brain with optical radiations, tapered optical fibers emerged as promising implantable waveguides to deliver and collect light from sub-cortical structures of the mouse brain. They rely on a specific feature of multimodal fiber optics: as the waveguide narrows, the number of guided modes decreases and the radiation can gradually couple with the environment. This happens along a taper segment whose length can be tailored to match with the depth of functional structures of the mouse brain, and can extend for a few millimeters. This anatomical requirement results in optical systems which have an active area that is very long compared to the wavelength of the light they guide and their behavior is typically estimated by ray tracing simulations, because finite element methods are too computationally demanding. Here we present a computational technique that exploits the beam-envelope method and the cylindrical symmetry of the fibers to provide an efficient and exact calculation of the electric field along the fibers, which may enable the design of neural interfaces optimized to meet different goals.",

    "abstract": "Olfaction relies on a coordinated partnership between odorant flow and neuronal communication. Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters. Our experiments uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which a virus with a very selective tropism can elicit persistent transcriptional changes in cells that evade it, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The influence of language on perceptual processes, referred to as the Whorfian hypothesis, has been a contentious issue. Cross-linguistic research and lab-based experiments have shown that verbal labels can facilitate perceptual and discriminatory processes, mostly in visual and auditory modalities. Here, we investigated whether verbal labels improve performance in a tactile texture discrimination task using natural textures. We also explored whether the grammatical category of these verbal labels plays a role in discrimination ability. In our experiments, we asked the participants to discriminate between pairs of textures presented to the fingertip after a five-day training phase. During the training phase, the tactile textures and English pseudowords were co-presented consistently in the congruent (experimental) condition and inconsistently in the incongruent (control) condition, allowing them to form implicit associations only in the former condition. The pseudoword verbal labels belonged to two grammatical categories, verb-like and noun-like. We found an improvement in the texture discrimination ability only for the congruent condition, irrespective of the grammatical category.",
