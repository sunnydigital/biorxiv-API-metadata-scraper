    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to orchestrate cognitive dynamics. However, in tests of bistable visual perception, no direct evidence supporting such presumable causal roles of the PFC has been reported. Here, using a novel brain-state-dependent neural stimulation system, we found that three PFC regions--right frontal eye fields and anterior/posterior dorsolateral PFCs (a/pDLPFCs)--have causal effects on perceptual dynamics but the behavioural effects are detectable only when we modulated the PFC activity in brain-state-/state-history-dependent manners. Also, we revealed that the brain-dynamics-dependent behavioural causality is underpinned by transient changes in the brain state dynamics, and such neural changes are determined by structural transformations of hypothetical energy landscapes. Moreover, we identified different functions of the three PFC areas: in particular, we found that aDLPFC enhances the integration of the two PFC-active brain states, whereas pDLPFC promotes the diversity between them. This work resolves the controversy over the PFC roles in spontaneous perceptual switching and underlines brain state dynamics in fine investigations of brain-behaviour causality.\n\nImpact statementPrefrontal causal roles are changing during bistable visual perception, which was determined by large-scale brain state dynamics and attributable to hypothetical energy landscapes that underpin the brain state dynamics.",

    "abstract": "While still controversial, it has been demonstrated that vascular defects can precede the onset of the other AD hallmarks features, making it an important therapeutic target. Given that the protein transthyretin (TTR) has been established as neuroprotective in AD, here we investigated the influence of TTR in the vasculature. AD transgenic mice with TTR genetic reduction, AD/TTR+/-, exhibited a thicker BM in brain microvessels and decreased vessel length than animals with normal TTR levels, AD/TTR+/+. Further in vivo investigation, using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, revealed that TTR is a pro-angiogenic molecule. Also, TTR increased the expression of key angiogenic molecules, by endothelial cells under tube formation conditions. We showed that TTR reduction leads to a thicker BM in AD mice than in NT animals, strengthening the idea that TTR is a neuroprotective protein. We also studied the effect of TTR tetrameric stabilization on BM thickness, showing that AD mice treated with iododiflunisal (IDIF) displayed a significant reduction of BM thickness and increased vessel length when compared to non-treated littermates. Our in vivo results show the involvement of TTR in angiogenesis, particularly as a modulator of vascular alterations occurring in AD. Since TTR is decreased early in AD, its tetrameric stabilization can represent a therapeutic avenue for the early treatment of AD through the maintenance of the vascular structure.",

    "abstract": "Neonicotinoid insecticides represent nearly a quarter of the global market and are widely used in agriculture but also for lawn, garden care, and pest control. They are highly water-soluble, persistent in soil, and may enter the aquatic compartment via spray drift, runoff, or leaching, and contribute to downstream aquatic toxicity. Although insects appear to be the most sensitive group to neonicotinoids, other groups, such as crustaceans and birds, may also be affected. Furthermore, most studies focus on single-insecticide exposure and very little is known concerning the impact of neonicotinoid mixtures on aquatic invertebrates. The present study was designed to test potential toxicological effects of an environmentally relevant mixture of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam on populations of Ceriodaphnia dubia and Daphnia magna under controlled conditions. Chronic toxicity tests were conducted in the laboratory, and survival and reproduction were measured for both species under exposure to nominal concentrations of imidacloprid (0.256 {micro}g/L), clothianidin (3.11 {micro}g/L), thiamethoxam (1.49 {micro}g/L), and a mixture of the three compounds at the same concentrations of the individual compounds. The neonicotinoids did not affect the survival of C. dubia and D. magna founders. Reproduction of C. dubia was affected only by the mixture. All three individual insecticides as well as the mixture caused a significant reduction in the reproduction of D. magna. Our results highlight the complexity of pesticide toxicity and show that traditional toxicological approaches such as acute mortality studies, especially tests with single compounds, can underestimate negative impacts that occur in the environment.\n\nHighlightsO_LINeonicotinoids are currently the most frequently used insecticides worldwide.\nC_LIO_LIAn environmentally relevant mixture of three neonicotinoids was evaluated on two daphniid species.\nC_LIO_LIThe mixture negatively affected the reproduction of C. dubia and Daphnia magna.\nC_LIO_LITraditional toxicological approaches with single compounds may underestimate the effects occurring in the environment at low concentrations.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Zebras stripes cannot protect them from predators, Darwin concluded, and current consensus tends to support his view1,2. In principle, stripes could support crypsis or aposematism, could dazzle, confuse or disrupt predators perception3-8, yet no such effects are manifest in predator-prey interactions9-11. Instead, narrow stripes covering zebras head, neck, limbs and flanks are an effective deterrent to tabanids12, vectors for equine disease13,14. Accordingly, while other potential benefits, e.g., thermoregulation15,16 and intraspecific communication17, cannot be excluded, zebra stripes likely evolved primarily to deter parasites18-20. Rump stripes, however, do not fit this, or any extant view. Typically horizontal and broader in sub-species with width variation, they are ill-suited to crypsis or parasite-deterrence12 and vary with hyaena threat18, perhaps shaped by an additional selective pressure. We observed that rump (and rear-flank) stripes remain highly conspicuous when viewed in motion or at distance, while other stripes do not. To study this striking effect, we filtered images of zebra to simulate acuity limitations in lion and hyaena photopic and mesopic vision. For mountain zebra and plains zebra without shadow striping, rump stripes were the most conspicuous image regions according to computational salience models, corroborated by human observers judgements of maximally attention-capturing image locations, which were strongly biased toward the rear. By hijacking exogenous attention mechanisms to force predator attention to the rear, salient rump stripes confer benefits to zebra, estimated here in pursuit simulations. Benefits of rump stripe salience may counteract anti-parasite benefits and costs of conspicuity to shape rump and shadow stripe variation.\n\n1 HighlightsO_LIZebra stripes likely evolved to deter biting flies, but rump stripes are ill-suited to this.\nC_LIO_LIRump-stripes remain highly conspicuous when viewed at distance or in motion.\nC_LIO_LIComputational models and human observers judge rump stripes are most salient stripes.\nC_LIO_LISalient rump stripes drive predator attention to rear, hindering capture by predators.\nC_LIO_LIObserve this striking effect in moving zebra at: viscog.psychol.cam.ac.uk/resources-and-downloads\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStructural Variations (SVs) are very diverse genomic rearrangements. In the past, their detection was restricted to cytological approaches, then to NGS read size and partitionned assemblies. Due to the current capabilities of technologies such as long read sequencing and optical mapping, larger SVs detection are becoming more and more accessible.\n\nThis study proposes a comparison in SVs detection and characterization from long-read sequencing obtained with the MinION device developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies and from optical mapping produced by the Saphyr device commercialized by Bionano Genomics. The genomes of the two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Landsberg erecta 1 (Ler-1) were chosen to guide the use of one or the other technology.\n\nResultsWe described the SVs detected from the alignment of the best ONT assembly and DLE-1 optical maps of A. thaliana Ler-1 on the public reference Col-0 TAIR10.1. After filtering, 1 184 and 591 Ler-1 SVs were retained from ONT and BioNano technologies respectively. A total of 948 Ler-1 ONT SVs (80.1%) corresponded to 563 Bionano SVs (95.3%) leading to 563 common locations in both technologies. The specific locations were scrutinized to assess improvement in SV detection by either technology. The ONT SVs were mostly detected near TE and gene features, and resistance genes seemed particularly impacted.\n\nConclusionsStructural variations linked to ONT sequencing error were removed and false positives limited, with high quality Bionano SVs being conserved. When compared with the Col-0 TAIR10.1 reference, most of detected SVs were found in same locations. ONT assembly sequence leads to more specific SVs than Bionano one, the later being more efficient to characterize large SVs. Even if both technologies are obvious complementary approaches, ONT data appears to be more adapted to large scale populations study, while Bionano performs better in improving assembly and describing specificity of a genome compared to a reference.",

    "abstract": "Conversion of solar energy into electrical current by photosynthetic organisms has the potential to produce clean energy. Previously reported bio-photoelectrochemical cells (BPECs) have utilized unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms. In this study, we describe for the first time BPECs that utilize intact live marine macroalgae (seaweeds) in natural seawater or saline buffer or natural seawater. The BPECs produce electrical currents from of >50mA/cm2, from both light-dependent (photosynthesis) and light independent processes. These values are significantly greater than the current densities that have been reported for single-cell microorganisms. The photocurrent is inhibited by the Photosystem II inhibitor DCMU, indicating that the source of light-driven electrons is from water oxidation via NADPH and other reduced molecules. We show here that intact seaweed cultures can be used in a large-scale BPEC containing seawater that produces bias-free photocurrent. The ability to produce bioelectricity from intact seaweeds may pave the way to future development of a low-cost energy technology using BPECs.",

    "abstract": "Flowering signals are sensed in plant leaves and transmitted to the shoot apical meristems, where the formation of flowers is initiated. Searches for a diffusible hormone-like signaling entity (\"florigen\") went on for many decades, until in the 1990s a product of plant gene FT was identified as the key component of florigen, based on genetic evidence and protein localization studies. Sequence homologs of FT protein are found throughout prokaryotes and eukaryotes; some eukaryotic family members appear to bind phospholipids or interact with the components of the signal transduction cascades. We studied molecular features of the FT homologs in prokaryotes and analyzed their genome context, to find tentative evidence connecting the bacterial family members with small molecule metabolism, often involving sugar- or ribonucleoside-containing substrates. Most FT homologs share a constellation of five charged residues, three of which, i.e., two histidines and an aspartic acid, circumfere the rim of a well-defined cavity on the protein surface. We argue that this conserved feature is more likely to be an enzymatic active center than a catalytically inactive ligand-binding site. We propose that most of FT-related proteins are enzymes operating on small diffusible molecules, which may constitute an overlooked essential ingredient of the florigen signal.",

The proteins enriched within MLOs are often classified as high-valency \"scaffolds\" or low valency \"clients\", with the former being associated with a phase-separation promoting role. In this study, we employ a minimal model for P-body components, with a defined protein-protein interaction network, to study their phase-separation at biologically realistic low protein concentrations. Without RNA multivalent proteins can assemble into solid-like clusters only in the regime of high concentration and stable interactions. RNA molecules promote cluster formation in an RNA-length dependent manner, even in the regime of weak interactions and low protein volume fraction. Our simulations reveal that long RNA chains act as super-scaffolds that stabilize large RNA-protein clusters by recruiting low-valency proteins within them while also ensuring functional \"liquid-like\" turnover of components. Our results suggest that RNA-mediated phase separation could be a plausible mechanism for spatiotemporally regulated phase-separation in the cell.",

Here, we show that conditional processing of the 3 tail is a viable general approach towards switchable Pol II-transcribed Cas12a gRNAs that can activate gene expression in mammalian cells in an input-dependent manner. Processing of the 3 tail can be achieved using microRNA and short hairpin RNA as inputs, via a guanine-responsive ribozyme, and also using an RNA strand displacement mechanism. We further show that Cas12a along with several independently switchable gRNAs can be integrated on a single transcript using stabilizing RNA triplexes, providing a route towards compact Cas12a-based gene regulation constructs with multi-input switching capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Observers can learn the locations where salient distractors appear frequently to reduce potential interference - an effect attributed to better suppression of distractors at frequent locations. But how distractor suppression is implemented in the visual cortex and frontoparietal attention networks remains unclear. We used fMRI and a regional distractor-location learning paradigm (Sauter et al. 2018, 2020) with two types of distractors defined in either the same (orientation) or a different (colour) dimension to the target to investigate this issue. fMRI results showed that BOLD signals in early visual cortex were significantly reduced for distractors (as well as targets) occurring at the frequent versus rare locations, mirroring behavioural patterns. This reduction was more robust with same-dimension distractors. Crucially, behavioural interference was correlated with distractor-evoked visual activity only for same- (but not different-) dimension distractors. Moreover, with different- (but not same-) dimension distractors, a colour-processing area within the fusiform gyrus was activated more when a colour distractor was present versus absent and with a distractor occurring at a rare versus frequent location. These results support statistical learning of frequent distractor locations involving regional suppression in the early visual cortex and point to differential neural mechanisms of distractor handling with different-versus same-dimension distractors.",

Natural killer (NK) cells exhibit potent anti-tumoral activity and therefore represent potential targets for immunotherapeutic approaches in HCC treatment. However, the human NK-cell repertoire is highly diverse including conventional and adaptive NK cells that differ in phenotype and effector function. Adaptive NK-cell frequencies are increased in association with HCMV (human cytomegalovirus) seropositivity that is also common in HCC patients. In this study, we aimed to gain a better understanding of the NK-cell repertoire and the associated anti-tumoral activity in HCC patients.\n\nMethodsIn-depth phenotypic and functional flow-cytometry analyses of the HCMV-associated NK cell-repertoire obtained from 57 HCC patients, 33 liver cirrhosis patients and 36 healthy donors (HD).\n\nResultsFirst, adaptive subsets are present in all three cohorts with conserved characteristics in patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC. Second, adaptive NK cells can be isolated from HCC tissue however lack features of tissue-residency and thus probably represent circulating/infiltrating lymphocytes. Third, the anti-tumoral activity by adaptive NK cells is reduced compared to conventional NK-cell subsets, also in HCC. Lastly, frequencies of adaptive NK cells were increased in patients suffering from Hepatitis B virus-associated HCC providing a link between etiology and the NK-cell repertoire in HCC.\n\nConclusionAdaptive NK cells limit the anti-tumoral activitity of NK cells in HCC, especially in association with HBV infection that is accompanied by an expansion of this NK cell subset.\n\nLay summaryIn patients with liver cancer (HCC), a subset of natural killer cells, so called adaptive NK cells show a diminished anti-tumoral activity compared to other, called conventional NK cells. Adaptive NK cells are expanded in patients with HCC associated to Hepatitis B virus infection. Thus, presence of adaptive NK cells contributes to the immune escape in HCC.",

Here, we evaluated an antibiotic-based procedure for producing axenic ecologically-contrasting earthworm species (E. fetida, L. terrestris, A. chlorotica) as the first step towards soil studies aimed at understanding the importance of the earthworm microbiome for host health and function. Individual earthworms were exposed to antibiotics: cycloheximide (150 g ml-1), ampicillin (100 g ml-1), ciprofloxacin (50 g ml-1), nalidixic acid (50 g ml-1), and gentamicin (50 g ml-1) either singly or in a cocktail via culture (96 h) in a semi-solid agar carrier. Compared to the non-antibiotic treated control, the cocktail (for all three species) and ciprofloxacin (for E. fetida and A. chlorotica) treatments significantly reduced (P<0.05) culturable microbial abundance on nutrient agar and potato dextrose agar. The microbial counts were reduced to below detection (<50 CFU individual-1) for E. fetida and A. chlorotica receiving the cocktail. Illumina 16S rDNA amplicon sequence analysis of culturable L. terrestris -associated bacteria showed that antibiotic treatment influenced community composition revealing putative sensitive (Comomonas, Kosakonia and Sphingobacterium) and insensitive (Aeromonas, Pseudochrobactrum) taxa. Overall, we report a rapid, with minimal earthworm-handling, process of creating  axenic E. fetida and A. chlorotica individuals or L. terrestris with a suppressed microbiome as a tool to be used in future ecological studies of earthworm microbial interactions affecting host health and function.",

    "abstract": "Optic nerve head (ONH) biomechanics is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, a blinding ocular condition often characterized by elevation and fluctuation of the intraocular pressure and resulting loads on the ONH. Further, tissue viscoelasticity is expected to strongly influence the mechanical response of the ONH to mechanical loading, yet the viscoelastic mechanical properties of the ONH remain unknown. To determine these properties, we conducted micromechanical testing on porcine ONH tissue samples, coupled with finite element modeling based on a mixture model consisting of a biphasic material with a viscoelastic solid matrix. Our results provide a detailed description of the viscoelastic properties of the porcine ONH at each of its four anatomical quadrants (i.e., nasal, superior, temporal, and inferior). We showed that the ONHs viscoelastic mechanical response can be explained by a dual mechanism of fluid flow and solid matrix viscoelasticity, as is common in other soft tissues. We obtained porcine ONH properties as follows: matrix Youngs modulus E=1.895 [1.056,2 .391] kPa (median [min., max.]), Poissons ratio{nu} =0.142 [0.060,0 .312], kinetic time-constant{tau} =214 [89,921] sec, and hydraulic permeability k=3.854 x 10-1 [3.457 x 10-2,9.994 x 10-1] mm4/(N sec). These values can be used to design and fabricate physiologically appropriate ex vivo test environments (e.g., 3D cell culture) to further understand glaucoma pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Modern implementations of widefield fluorescence microscopy often rely on sCMOS cameras, but this camera architecture inherently features pixel-to-pixel variations. Such variations lead to image artifacts and render quantitative image interpretation difficult. Although a variety of algorithmic corrections exists, they require a thorough characterization of the camera, which typically is not easy to access or perform. Here, we developed a fully automated pipeline for camera characterization based solely on thermally generated signal, and implemented it in the popular open-source software Micro-Manager and ImageJ/Fiji. Besides supplying the conventional camera maps of noise, offset and gain, our pipeline also gives access to dark current and thermal noise as functions of the exposure time. This allowed us to avoid structural bias in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), which without correction is substantial even for scientific-grade, cooled cameras. In addition, our approach enables high-quality 3D super-resolution as well as live-cell time-lapse microscopy with cheap, industry-grade cameras. As our approach for camera characterization does not require any user interventions or additional hardware implementations, numerous correction algorithms demanding camera characterization become easily applicable.",

    "abstract": "In buzz-pollinated plants, bees apply vibrations produced by their thoracic muscles to the flower, causing pollen release from anthers, often through small apical pores. During floral buzzing, bees grasp one or more anthers with their mandibles, and vibrations are transmitted to the focal anther(s), adjacent anthers, and the whole flower. Because pollen release depends on the vibrations experienced by the anther, the transmission of vibrations through flowers with different morphologies may determine patterns of release, affecting both bee foraging and plant fitness. Anther morphology and intra-floral arrangement varies widely among buzz-pollinated plants. Here, we compare the transmission of vibrations among focal and non-focal anthers in four species with contrasting anther morphologies: Cyclamen persicum (Primulaceae), Exacum affine (Gentianaceae), Solanum dulcamara and S. houstonii (Solanaceae). We used a mechanical transducer to apply bee-like artificial vibrations to focal anthers, and simultaneously measured the vibration frequency and displacement amplitude at the tips of focal and non-focal anthers using high-speed video analysis (6,000 frames per second). In flowers in which anthers are tightly held together (C. persicum and S. dulcamara), vibrations in focal and non-focal anthers are indistinguishable in both frequency and displacement amplitude. In contrast, flowers with loosely arranged anthers (E. affine) including those in which stamens are morphologically differentiated within the same flower (heterantherous S. houstonii), show the same frequency but higher displacement amplitude in non-focal anthers compared to focal anthers. Our results suggest that stamen arrangement affects vibration transmission with potential consequences for pollen release and bee behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Conformational sampling profoundly impacts the overall activity and temperature dependence of enzymes. Peroxidases have emerged as versatile platforms for high value biocatalysis owing to their broad palette of potential biotransformations. Here, we explore the role of conformational sampling in mediating a de novo peroxidases activity. We demonstrate that 2,2,2-triflouoroethanol (TFE) affects the equilibrium of enzyme conformational states, tending towards a more globally rigid structure. This is correlated with increases both stability and activity. Notably, these effects are concomitant with the emergence of curvature in the temperature-activity profile, trading off activity gains at ambient temperature with losses at high temperatures. We apply macromolecular rate theory (MMRT) to understand enzyme temperature dependence data. These data point to an increase in protein rigidity associated with a difference in the distribution of protein dynamics between the ground and transition state. We compare the thermodynamics of the de novo enzyme activity to those of a natural peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase. We find that the native enzyme resembles the rigidified de novo enzyme in terms of the thermodynamics of enzyme catalysis and the putative distribution of protein dynamics between the ground and transition state. The addition of TFE apparently causes C45 to behave more like the natural enzyme. Our data suggest robust, generic strategies for improving biocatalytic activity by manipulating protein rigidity; for functional de novo protein catalysts in particular, this can provide more enzyme-like catalysts without further rational engineering, computational redesign or directed evolution.",

    "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is a major public health issue associated with degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD). The early stages of degeneration are characterized by the dehydration of the central, gelatinous portion of the IVD, the nucleus pulposus (NP). One possible treatment approach is to replace the NP in the early stages of IVD degeneration with a hydrogel that restores healthy biomechanics while supporting tissue regeneration. The present study evaluates a novel thermosensitive hydrogel based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-graft-chondroitin sulfate) (PNIPAAM-g-CS) for NP replacement. The hypothesis was tested that the addition of freeze-dried, calcium crosslinked alginate microparticles (MPs) to aqueous solutions of PNIPAAm-g-CS would enable tuning of the rheological properties of the injectable solution, as well as the bioadhesive and mechanical properties of the thermally precipitated composite gel. Further, we hypothesized that the composite would support encapsulated cell viability and differentiation. Structure-material property relationships were evaluated by varying MP concentration and diameter. The addition of high concentrations (50 mg/mL) of small MPs (20 {+/-} 6 {micro}m) resulted in the greatest improvement in injectability, compressive mechanical properties, and bioadhesive strength of PNIPAAm-g-CS. This combination of PNIPAAM-g-CS and alginate MPs supported the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) towards an NP-like phenotype in the presence of soluble GDF-6. When implanted ex vivo into the intradiscal cavity of degenerated porcine IVDs, the formulation restored the compressive and neutral zone (NZ) stiffnesses to intact values and resisted expulsion under lateral bending. Overall, results indicate the potential of the hydrogel composite to serve as a scaffold for supporting NP regeneration. This work uniquely demonstrates that encapsulation of re-hydrating polysaccharide-based MPs may be an effective method for improving key functional properties of in situ forming hydrogels for orthopaedic tissue engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Genetic alterations that activate protein kinase A (PKA) signaling are found across many tumor types, but their downstream oncogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. We used global phosphoproteomics and kinome activity profiling to map the conserved signaling outputs driven by diverse genetic changes that activate PKA in human cancer, including melanoma and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). We define two consensus networks of effectors downstream of PKA in cancer models. One is centered on RAS/MAPK components, and a second involves Aurora Kinase A (AURKA). We find that AURKA stabilizes c-MYC and n-MYC protein levels and expression programs in PKA-dependent tumor models, in part via a positive feedback loop mediated by the oncogenic kinase PIM2. This process can be suppressed by conformation-disrupting AURKA inhibitors such as CD-532. Our findings elucidate two independent mechanisms of PKA-driven tumor cell growth and offer insight into drug targets for study in FLC and other PKA-dependent malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Natural vision involves the activation of a wide range of higher-level regions processing objects, motion, faces and actions. Here, we pursue a data-driven approach to explore how higher-level visual processes relate to the underlying structural and functional connectivity. Using a free-viewing paradigm in four awake rhesus macaque monkeys, we investigate how different visual scenes change functional connectivity. Additionally, we explore how such functional connectivity, as measured through fMRI, is related to the structural connectivity, as measured through diffusion weighted imaging. At first, we evaluate the consistency of the elicited free-viewing pattern using standard analytical techniques. We also evaluate the underlying structural connectivity via diffusion data by tracking white matter bundle projections from the visual cortex. We then reconstruct free-viewing and structural networks and quantify their properties. Centrality measures over the entire fMRI time-series revealed a consistent functional network engaged during free-viewing that included widespread hub regions across frontal (FEF, 46v), parietal (LIP, Tpt), and occipitotemporal cortex (MT, V4 and TE) among others. Interestingly, a small number of highly-weighted and long-length inter-hemispheric connections indicated the presence of long-range integrative properties during free-viewing. We hypothesized that during free-viewing, networks had the capacity to change their local and distal connections depending on the on-going changes in visual scenes. To capture these network dynamics, we depart from the static modular architecture of the structural networks and demonstrate that hubs in free-viewing networks reorganize according to the presence of objects, motion, and faces in the movie scenes indicating poly-functional properties. Lastly, we compare each NHP subject network and observe high consistency between individuals across the same network type with closer correspondence between structural networks (e.g., diffusion based and those partially assembled from tract-tracing). In summary, our network analyses revealed ongoing changes in large-scale functional organization present during free-viewing in the macaque monkey and highlight the advantages of multi-contrast imaging in awake monkeys for investigating dynamical processes in visual cognition. To further promote the use of naturalistic free-viewing paradigms and increase the development of macaque neuroimaging resources, we share our datasets in the PRIME-DE consortium.",

In healthy neurons SARM1 is autoinhibited, but single amino acid changes can abolish autoinhibition leading to constitutively-active SARM1 enzymes that promote degeneration when expressed in cultured neurons. To investigate whether naturally-occurring human variants might similarly disrupt SARM1 autoinhibition and potentially contribute to risk for neurodegenerative disease, we assayed the enzymatic activity of 29 rare SARM1 alleles identified among 8,507 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Ten missense variants or small in-frame deletions exhibit constitutive NADase activity, including more than half of those that are unique to the ALS patients or that occur in multiple patients. Expression of these constitutively active ALS-associated SARM1 alleles in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is pro-degenerative and cytotoxic. Intrathecal injection of an AAV expressing the common SARM1 reference allele is innocuous to mice, but a construct harboring SARM1V184G, the constitutively active variant found most frequently in the ALS patients, causes axon loss, motor dysfunction, and sustained neuroinflammation. These results implicate rare hypermorphic SARM1 alleles as candidate genetic risk factors for ALS and other neurodegenerative conditions.",

This study examined how mindfulness training and various types of mindfulness practices altered brain activity. Specifically, the spectral powers of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) of the MBSR group who underwent an 8-week mindfulness training--including mindful breathing and body-scan--were evaluated and compared with those of the waitlist controls. Empirical results indicated that the long-term mindfulness intervention effect significantly elevated the resting-state beta powers and reduced resting-state delta powers in both practices; such changes were not observed in the waitlist control. Compared with mindful breathing, body-scanning resulted in an overall decline in EEG spectral powers at both delta and gamma bands among trained participants. Together with our preliminary data of expert mediators, the aforementioned spectral changes were salient after intervention, but mitigated along with expertise. Additionally, after receiving training, the MBSR groups mindfulness and emotion regulation levels improved significantly, which were correlated with the EEG spectral changes in the theta, alpha, and low-beta bands. This study elaborated the neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness practices, suggesting that MBSR might function as a unique internal processing that involves increased vigilant capability and induces alterations similar to other cognitive training.",

Inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling by Tocilizumab, prior to exposure of supernatant to endothelial cells, inhibited p16 and p21 induction. Likewise, inhibition of receptor signaling by Zanabrutinib or Brd4 function by AZD5153 also led to limited induction of p16 expression. Senescence lead to an enhanced level of adhesion molecule, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in human endothelial cells, and TPH1 attachment by in vitro assay. Inhibition of senescence or SASP function prevented ICAM/VCAM expression and leukocyte attachment. We also observed an increase in oxidative stress in A549 spike transfected and endothelial cells exposed to Spike CM. ROS generation in TMNK was reduced after treatment with the IL-6 specific inhibitor Tociliximab, and with the specific inhibitors Zanabrutinib and AZD5153. Taken together, we identified that the exposure of human endothelial cells to cell culture supernatant derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression displayed cellular senescence markers leading to enhanced leukocyte adhesion with coronary blockade potential.",

    "abstract": "The presence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, including the emerging variant B.1.1.7, has raised great concerns in terms of pathogenesis, transmission, and immune escape. Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations, evolution, and effects on infectivity and pathogenicity is crucial to the design of antibody therapies and surveillance strategies. Here we analyzed 454,443 SARS-CoV-2 spike genes/proteins and 14,427 whole-genome sequences. We demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or within human populations. Our extensive analyses suggested that Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7. An alternative hypothesis is that the variant was simply yet to be sampled. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome represents a large number of potential co-mutations with very strong statistical significances (p value<E- 44). In addition, we used an experimental SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon system to introduce the dominant co-mutations NSP12_c14408t, 5UTR_c241t, and NSP3_c3037t into the viral genome, and to monitor the effect of the mutations on viral replication. Our experimental results demonstrated that the co-mutations significantly attenuated the viral replication. The study provides valuable clues for discovering the transmission chains of variant B.1.1.7 and understanding the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "In the search for treatment schemes of COVID-19, we start by examining the general weakness of coronaviruses and then identify approved drugs attacking that weakness. The approach, if successful, should identify drugs with a specific mechanism that is at least as effective as the best drugs proposed and are ready for clinical trials. All coronaviruses translate their non-structural proteins ([~]16) in concatenation, resulting in a very large super-protein. Homo-harringtonine (HHT), which has been approved for the treatment of leukemia, blocks protein elongation very effectively. Hence, HHT can repress the replication of many coronaviruses at the nano-molar concentration. In two mouse models, HHT clears SARS-CoV-2 in 3 days, especially by nasal dripping of 40 ug per day. We also use dogs to confirm the safety of HHT delivered by nebulization. The nebulization scheme could be ready for large-scale applications at the onset of the next epidemics. For the current COVID-19, a clinical trial has been approved by the Ditan hospital of Beijing but could not be implemented for want of patients. The protocol is available to qualified medical facilities.",

Here we undertake a comprehensive analysis, in very fine time-course, of the events following exposure of ectoderm to the organizer. Using transcriptomics and epigenomics we generate a Gene Regulatory Network comprising 175 transcriptional regulators and 5,614 predicted interactions between them, with fine temporal dynamics from initial exposure to the signals to expression of mature neural plate markers. Using in situ hybridization, single-cell RNA-sequencing and reporter assays we show that neural induction by a grafted organizer closely resembles normal neural plate development.

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is essential for reproductive success. Yet, many fundamental aspects of meiosis remain unclear, including the mechanisms regulating homolog pairing across species. This gap is partially due to our inability to visualize individual chromosomes during meiosis. Here, we employ Oligopaint FISH to investigate homolog pairing and compaction of meiotic chromosomes in a classical model system, the silkworm Bombyx mori. Our Oligopaint design combines multiplexed barcoding with secondary oligo labeling for high flexibility and low cost. These studies illustrate that Oligopaints are highly specific in whole-mount gonads and on meiotic chromosome spreads. We show that meiotic pairing is robust in both males and female meiosis. Additionally, we show that meiotic bivalent formation in B. mori males is highly similar to bivalent formation in C. elegans, with both of these pathways ultimately resulting in the pairing of chromosome ends with non-paired ends facing the spindle pole and microtubule recruitment independent of the centromere-specifying factor CENP-A.\n\nAuthors SummaryMeiosis is the specialized cell division occurring exclusively in ovaries and testes to produce egg and sperm cells, respectively. The accurate distribution of chromosomes (the genetic material) during this process is essential to prevent infertility/sterility and developmental disorders in offspring. As researchers are specifically unable to study the mechanisms regulating meiosis in depth in humans, identifying broadly conserved aspects of meiotic chromosome segregation is essential for making accurate inferences about human biology. Here, we use a sophisticated chromosome painting approach called Oligopaints to visualize and study chromosomes during meiosis in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. We illustrate that Oligopaints are highly specific in B. mori and demonstrate how Oligopaints can be used to study the dynamics of meiotic chromosomes in diverse species.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive catalogue of recurrent mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the diverse molecular driving events and the resulting range of disease phenotypes remain incompletely understood. To study the molecular heterogeneity of CLL, we performed RNA-sequencing on 184 CLL patient samples. Unsupervised analysis revealed two major independent axes of gene expression variation: the first one aligned with the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes, and concomitantly, with the three-group stratification of CLL by global DNA methylation pattern, and affected biological functions including B- and T-cell receptor signaling. The second one aligned with trisomy 12 status and affected chemokine signaling. Furthermore, we searched for differentially expressed genes associated with gene mutations and copy-number aberrations and detected strong signatures for TP53, BRAF and SF3B1, as well as for del(11)(q22.3), del(17)(p13) and del(13)(q14) beyond the dosage effect. We discovered strong non-additive effects (i.e., genetic interactions, or epistasis) of IGHV mutation status and trisomy 12 on multiple phenotypes, including the expression of 893 genes. Multiple types of epistasis were observed, including synergy, buffering, suppression and inversion. Our study reveals previously underappreciated gene expression signatures for (epi)genomic variants in CLL and the presence of epistasis between them. The findings will serve as a reference for a functional resolution of CLL molecular heterogeneity.",

Control of fungal diseases on crops necessitates a global understanding of fungal pathogenicity determinants and their expression during infection. Genomes of phytopathogenic fungi are often compartmentalized: the core genome contains housekeeping genes whereas the fast-evolving genome mainly contains transposable elements and species-specific genes. In this study, we analysed nucleosome landscapes of four phytopathogenic fungi with contrasted genome organizations to describe and compare nucleosome repartition patterns in relation with genome structure and gene expression level. We combined MNase-seq and RNA-seq analyses to concomitantly map nucleosome-rich and transcriptionally active regions during fungal growth in axenic culture; we developed the MNase-seq Tool Suite (MSTS) to analyse and visualise data obtained from MNase-seq experiments in combination with other genomic data and notably RNA-seq expression data. We observed different characteristics of nucleosome profiles between species, as well as between genomic regions within the same species. We further linked nucleosome repartition and gene expression. Our findings support that nucleosome positioning and occupancies are subjected to evolution, in relation with underlying genome sequence modifications. Understanding genomic organization and its role in expression regulation is the next gear to understand complex cellular mechanisms and their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Behavior of the bacterial flagellar motor depends sensitively on the external loads it drives. Motor switching, which provides the basis for the run-and-tumble behavior of flagellated bacteria, has been studied for motors under zero to high loads, revealing a non-equilibrium effect that is proportional to the motor torque. However, behavior of the motor switching at stall (with maximum torque) remains unclear. An extrapolation from previous studies would suggest maximum non-equilibrium effect for motor switching at stall. Here, we stalled the motor using optical tweezers and studied the motor switching with a high time resolution of about 2 ms. Surprisingly, our results showed exponentially distributed counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) intervals, indicating that motor switching at stall is probably an equilibrium process. Combined with previous experiments at other loads, our result suggested that the non-equilibrium effect in motor switching arises from the asymmetry of the torque generation in the CCW and CW directions. By including this non-equilibrium effect in the general Ising-type conformation spread model of the flagellar switch, we consistently explained the motor switching over the whole range of load conditions. We expect to see similar mechanism of non-equilibrium regulation in other molecular machines.",

Gasdermin D (GsdmD) serves as a final executor of inflammasome activity, by generating membrane pores for the release of mature Interleukin-1beta (IL-1{beta}). Inflammation dampens reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and promotes atherogenesis, while anti-IL-1{beta} antibodies were shown to reduce cardiovascular disease in humans. Though Nlrp3/AIM2 and IL-1{beta} nexus is an emerging atherogenic pathway, the direct role of GsdmD in atherosclerosis is not yet fully clear. Here, we used in-vivo Nlrp3 inflammasome activation to show that the GsdmD-/- mice release ~80% less IL-1{beta} vs WT mice. The GsdmD-/- macrophages were more resistant to Nlrp3 inflammasome mediated reduction in cholesterol efflux, showing ~26% decrease vs. ~60% reduction in WT macrophages. GsdmD expression in macrophages exacerbated foam cell formation in an IL-1{beta} dependent fashion. The GsdmD-/- mice were resistant to Nlrp3 inflammasome mediated defect in RCT, with ~32% reduction in plasma RCT vs. ~ 57% reduction in WT mice, ~ 17% reduction in RCT to liver vs. 42% in WT mice, and ~ 37% decrease in RCT to feces vs. ~ 61% in WT mice. The LDLr anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) induced hyperlipidemic mouse model showed the role of GsdmD in promoting atherosclerosis. The GsdmD-/- mice exhibit ~42% decreased atherosclerotic lesion area in females and ~33% decreased lesion area in males vs. WT mice. The atherosclerotic plaque-bearing sections stained positive for the cleaved N-terminal fragment of GsdmD, indicating cleavage of GsdmD in atherosclerotic plaques.

The glucagon like peptide 1 (Glp-1) has emerged as a hormone with broad pharmacological potential toward T2D treatment, notably by improving {beta}-cell functions. Recent data have shown that the transcription factor E2f1, besides its role as a cell cycle regulator, is involved in glucose homeostasis by modulating {beta}-cell mass, function and identity. Here, we demonstrate a crosstalk between the E2F1, phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and Glp-1 signaling pathways. We found that {beta}-cell specific E2f1 deficient mice (E2f1{beta}-/-) presented with impaired glucose homeostasis and decreased glucose stimulated-insulin secretion mediated by exendin 4 (i.e., GLP1R agonist), which were associated with decreased expression of Glp1r encoding Glp-1 receptor (GLP1R) in E2f1{beta}-/- pancreatic islets. Decreasing E2F1 transcriptional activity with an E2F inhibitor in islets from nondiabetic humans decreased GLP1R levels and blunted the incretin effect of exendin 4 on insulin secretion. Conversely, overexpressing E2f1 in pancreatic {beta} cells increased Glp1r expression associated with enhanced insulin secretion mediated by GLP1R agonist. Interestingly, kinome analysis of mouse islets demonstrated that an acute treatment with exendin 4 increased pRb phosphorylation and subsequent E2f1 transcriptional activity. This study suggests a molecular crosstalk between the E2F1/pRb and GLP1R signaling pathways that modulates insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.",

The following experiments utilize the efflux of a DNA-binding dye, Vyrbant DyeCycle Violet (DCV), to isolate bona fide side populations in the adult mouse dentate gyrus and SVZ and test their sensitivity to ABC transporter inhibitors. A distinct side population was found in both the adult lateral ventricle and dentate gyrus using DCV fluorescence and forward scatter instead of the conventional dual fluorescence approach. These side populations responded strongly to inhibition with the ABC transporter antagonists, verapamil and fumitremorgin C.

    "abstract": "The Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the major allelic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD). APOE4 associates with a pro-inflammatory phenotype increasingly considered as critical in AD initiation and progression. Yet, the mechanisms driving an APOE4-dependent neuroinflammation remain unelucidated. Leveraging patient specific human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) we demonstrate inflammatory chronicity and hyperactivated responses upon cytokines in human APOE4 astrocytes via a novel mechanism. We uncovered that APOE4 represses Transgelin 3 (TAGLN3), a new interacting partner of I{kappa}B, thus increasing the NF-kB activity. The transcriptional repression of TAGLN3 was shown to result from an APOE4-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The functional relevance of TAGLN3 was demonstrated by the attenuation of APOE4-driven neuroinflammation after TAGLN3 supplementation. Importantly, TAGLN3 downregulation was confirmed in the brain of AD patients. Our findings highlight the APOE4-TAGLN3 axis as a new pathogenic pathway that paves the way for the development of therapeutics to prevent maladaptive inflammatory responses in APOE4 carriers, while placing TAGLN3 downregulation as a potential biomarker of AD.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=98 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/440108v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1036557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f245bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c07c4aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1200396_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "EEG has been central to investigations of the time course of various neural functions underpinning visual word recognition. Recently the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm has been increasingly adopted for word recognition studies due to its high signal-to-noise ratio. Such studies, however, have been typically framed around a single source in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT). Here, we combine SSVEP recorded from 16 adult native English speakers with a data-driven spatial filtering approach--Reliable Components Analysis (RCA)--to elucidate distinct functional sources with overlapping yet separable time courses and topographies that emerge when contrasting words with pseudofont visual controls. The first component topography was maximal over left vOT regions with an early latency (approximately 180 msec). A second component was maximal over more dorsal parietal regions with a longer latency (approximately 260 msec). Both components consistently emerged across a range of parameter manipulations including changes in the spatial overlap between successive stimuli, and changes in both base and deviation frequency. We then contrasted word-in-nonword and word-in-pseudoword to test the hierarchical processing mechanisms underlying visual word recognition. Results suggest that these hierarchical contrasts fail to evoke a unitary component that might be reasonably associated with lexical access.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCTs) dramatically reduce HIV reservoirs in antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppressed individuals. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for these post-transplant viral reservoir declines are not fully understood but may include pre-transplant conditioning regimens, ART-mediated protection of donor cells, and graft-versus-host (GvH) responses. Therefore, we modeled allo-HSCT in ART-suppressed simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCMs) to illuminate factors contributing to transplant-induced viral reservoir decay.\n\nResultsWe infected four MCMs with CCR5-tropic SHIV162P3 and started ART 6-16 weeks post-infection (p.i.) to establish robust viral reservoirs. We maintained the MCMs on continuous ART during myeloablative conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI) and while transplanting allogeneic MHC-matched /{beta} T cell-depleted bone marrow cells. Post-transplant, we prophylactically treated the MCMs with cyclophosphamide and tacrolimus to prevent GvH disease (GvHD). The transplants produced ~85% whole blood donor chimerism without causing high-grade GvHD. Consequently, three MCMs had undetectable SHIV DNA in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells post-transplant. However, SHIV-harboring cells persisted in various tissues. We detected viral DNA in lymph node biopsies and terminal analyses of tissues between 38 and 62 days post-transplant. Further, we removed ART from one MCM at 63 days post-transplant, resulting in viral rebound within seven days and viral loads nearing 1x108 SHIV RNA copies/ml of plasma after treatment interruption.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that myeloablative conditioning and maintaining ART through the peri-transplant period alone are insufficient for eradicating latent viral reservoirs early after allo-HSCTs. Furthermore, our findings suggest that extended ART and GvH responses may be necessary to substantially deplete viral reservoirs after allo-HSCTs.",

In this study we investigated the effect of deleting combinations of different genes from a previously attenuated virus, Benin{Delta}DP148R on: virus replication in macrophages, virus persistence and clinical signs post immunization, and induction of protection against challenge. Deletion of either EP402R or EP153R genes individually or in combination from Benin{Delta}DP148R did not reduce virus replication in vitro. However, deletion of EP402R dramatically reduced viral persistence in vivo, whilst maintaining high levels of protection against challenge. The additional deletion of EP153R (Benin{Delta}DP148R{Delta}EP153R{Delta}EP402R) further attenuated the virus and no viremia or clinical signs were observed post immunization. This was associated with decreased protection and detection of moderate levels of challenge virus in blood. Interestingly, the deletion of EP153R alone from Benin{Delta}DP148R did not result in further virus attenuation and a slight increase in virus genome copies in blood was observed at different times post immunization when compared with Benin{Delta}DP148R. These results show that EP402R and EP153R have a synergistic role in promoting viremia, however EP153R alone does not seem to have a major impact on virus levels in blood.",

However, how target inhibition relates to biological activity is often left unexplored. Here we studied the effects of 1,2,3-triazole ureas on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). After screening ~200 compounds, we focused on two inhibitors active against both exponentially replicating and hypoxia-induced drug-tolerant Mtb that form part of a four-compound structure-activity series. The compound with negligible activity revealed potential false positive targets not addressed in other ABPP studies. Biochemistry, computational docking, and morphological analysis confirmed that active compounds preferentially inhibit serine hydrolases with cell wall and lipid metabolism functions and that disruption of the cell wall underlies biological activity. Our findings showed that ABPP identifies the targets most likely relevant to a compounds antibacterial activity.",

    "abstract": "Retinoids act as chromophore co-factors for light-detecting rhodopsin proteins. In vertebrates, retinoids also actively regulate gene expression. Whether retinoids regulate gene expression in Drosophila for a specific biological function remains unclear. Here, we report that Drosophila fatty acid binding protein (fabp) is a retinoid-inducible gene required for Rhodopsin-1 (Rh1) protein homeostasis and photoreceptor survival. Specifically, we performed a photoreceptor-specific gene expression profiling study in flies bearing a misfolding-prone Rhodopsin-1 (Rh1) mutant, ninaEG69D, which serves as a Drosophila model for Retinitis Pigmentosa. ninaEG69D photoreceptors showed increased expression of genes that control Rh1 protein levels, along with a poorly characterized gene, fabp. We found that in vivo fabp expression was reduced when the retinoids were deprived through independent methods. Conversely, fabp mRNA was induced when we challenged cultured Drosophila cells with retinoic acid. In flies reared under light, loss of fabp caused an accumulation of Rh1 proteins in cytoplasmic vesicles. fabp mutants exhibited light-dependent retinal degeneration, a phenotype also found in other mutants that block light-activated Rh1 degradation. These observations indicate that a retinoid-inducible gene expression program regulates fabp that is required for Rh1 proteostasis and photoreceptor survival.\n\nAuthor SummaryRhodopsins are light-detecting proteins that use retinoids as chromophore co-factors. In vertebrates, retinoids also actively regulate gene expression. Whether retinoids regulate Rhodopsin function aside from its role as a chromophore remains unclear. Here, we report that Drosophila fatty acid binding protein (fabp) is a retinoid-inducible gene required for Rhodopsin-1 (Rh1) protein homeostasis and photoreceptor survival. Specifically, we found that fabp is among the genes induced by a misfolding-prone Rhodopsin-1 (Rh1) mutant, ninaEG69D, which serves as a Drosophila model for Retinitis Pigmentosa. We further found that fabp induction in ninaEG69D photoreceptors required retinoids. fabp was required in photoreceptors to help degrade light-activated Rh1. In the absence of fabp, Rh1 accumulated in cytoplasmic vesicles in a light-dependent manner, and exhibited light-dependent retinal degeneration. These observations indicate that a retinoid-inducible gene expression program regulates fabp that is required for Rh1 proteostasis and photoreceptor survival.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global crisis that included collapsing healthcare systems and shut-down communities, producing considerable economic burden. Despite the number of effective vaccines quickly implemented, the emergence of new variants is a primary concern. The scientific community undertook a rapid response to better study this new virus. However, critical questions about viral protein-protein interactions and mechanisms of its physiopathology are still unclear. Although severe COVID-19 was associated with hematological dysfunctions, scarce experimental data were produced about iron dysmetabolism and the viral proteins possible interaction with hemoglobin (Hb) chains. This work demonstrates the binding of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to hemin and Hb using a multimethodological approach. In silico analysis indicated binding motifs between a cavity in the viral nucleoprotein and hemoglobins porphyrin coordination region. Different hemin binding capacities of mock and SARS-CoV-2-infected culture extracts were noticed using gel electrophoresis and TMB staining. Hemin-binding proteins were isolated from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by affinity chromatography and identified by shotgun proteomics, indicating that structural (nucleoprotein, spike, and membrane protein) and non-structural (Nsp3 and Nsp7) viral proteins interact with hemin. In vitro analyses of virus adsorption to host cells and viral replication studies in Vero cells demonstrated inhibitory activities - at different levels - by hemin, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) Hb. Strikingly, free Hb at 1M suppressed viral replication (99 %), and its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 was localized to the RBD region of the Spike protein. The findings showed clear evidence of new avenues to disrupt viral replication and understand virus physiopathology that warrants further investigation.",

Here, using high quality data from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we systematically investigate marker replicability for 85 neuronal cell types.

We estimate that 10 to 200 meta-analytic markers provide optimal performance in downstream computational tasks. Replicable marker lists condense single cell atlases into interpretable and generalizable information about cell types, opening avenues for downstream applications, including cell type annotation, selection of gene panels and bulk data deconvolution.",

Yet, the demand to understand and predict the responses of such living communities to environmental changes is increasing, calling for new approaches. Here, we test the possibility to establish a simplified but relevant model of multispecies biofilm in a laboratory setup enabling in situ real-time monitoring of the community development and control of the environmental parameters in order to decipher the mechanisms underlying the formation of the community. Using video-microscopy and species combinatorial approach, we assess the global and individual species spatiotemporal development in millifluidic channels under constant flow of nutrients. Based on quantitative measurements of expansion kinetics, local dynamics and spatial distribution, we demonstrate that the four chosen species (Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Kocuria varians and Rhodocyclus sp.) form a dynamical community that deterministically reaches its equilibrium after about 30 hours of growth. We evidence the emergence of complexity in this simplified community as reported by spatial heterogeneity rise and non-monotonic developmental kinetics. We find interspecies interactions consisting in competition for resources -- in particular oxygen -- and both direct and indirect physical interactions but no positive feedback. Thereby, we introduce a model of multispecies adherent community where effective couplings result from individual species quest for fitness optimization in a moving and heterogenous environment. This control and the understanding of this simplified experimental model shall open new avenues to apprehend adherent bacterial communities behavior in a context of rapid global change.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis exacts a terrible toll on human and animal health. While Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is restricted to humans, Mycobacterium bovis (Mb) is present in a large range of mammalian hosts. In cattle, bovine TB (bTB) is a notifiable disease responsible for important economic losses in developed countries and underestimated zoonosis in the developing world. Early interactions that take place between mycobacteria and the lung tissue early after aerosol infection govern the outcome of the disease. In cattle, these early steps remain poorly characterized. The precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) model preserves the structure and cell diversity of the lung. We developed this model in cattle in order to study the early lung response to mycobacterial infection. In situ imaging of PCLS infected with fluorescent Mb revealed bacilli in the alveolar compartment, adjacent or inside alveolar macrophages (AMPs) and in close contact with pneumocytes. We analyzed the global transcriptional lung inflammation signature following infection of PCLS with Mb and Mtb in two French beef breeds: Blonde dAquitaine and Charolaise. Whereas lungs from the Blonde dAquitaine produced high levels of mediators of neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in response to infection, such signatures were not observed in the Charolaise in our study. In the Blonde dAquitaine lung, whereas the inflammatory response was highly induced by two Mb strains, AF2122 isolated from cattle in the UK and Mb3601 circulating in France, the response against two Mtb strains, H37Rv the reference laboratory strain and BTB1558 isolated from zebu in Ethiopia, was very low. Strikingly, the type I interferon pathway was only induced by Mb but not Mtb strains indicating that this pathway may be involved in mycobacterial virulence and host tropism. Hence, the PCLS model in cattle is a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of early interactions between lung host cells and mycobacteria. It revealed striking differences between cattle breeds and mycobacterial strains. This model could help deciphering biomarkers of resistance versus susceptibility to bTB in cattle as such information is still critically needed for bovine genetic selection programs and would greatly help the global effort to eradicate bTB.",

    "abstract": "The adhesion of organisms to surfaces in aquatic environments provides a diversity of benefits such as better access to nutrients or protection from the elements or from predation. Differences in ionic strength, pH, temperature, shear forces, and other environmental factors impact adhesion and organisms have evolved various strategies to optimize their adhesins for their specific environmental conditions. We know essentially nothing about how bacteria evolved their adhesive mechanisms to attach efficiently in environments with different physico-chemical conditions. Many species of Alphaproteobacteria, including members of the order Caulobacterales, use a polar adhesin, called holdfast, for surface attachment and subsequent biofilm formation in both freshwater and marine environments. Hirschia baltica, a marine member of Caulobacterales, produces a holdfast adhesin that tolerates a drastically higher ionic strength than the holdfast produced by its freshwater relative, Caulobacter crescentus. In this work, we show that the holdfast polysaccharide deacetylase HfsH plays an important role in adherence in high ionic strength environments. We show that deletion of hfsH in H. baltica disrupts holdfast binding properties and structure. Increasing expression of HfsH in C. crescentus improved holdfast binding in high salinity, whereas lowering HfsH expression in H. baltica reduced holdfast binding at high ionic strength. We conclude that HfsH plays a role in modulating holdfast binding at high ionic strength and hypothesize that this modulation occurs through varied deacetylation of holdfast polysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "When exposed to stressful conditions, eukaryotic cells respond by inducing the formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes called stress granules. Stress granules are thought to have a protective function but their exact role is still unclear. Here we use C. elegans to study two proteins that have been shown to be important for stress granule assembly in human cells: PQN-59, the ortholog of human UBAP2L, and GTBP-1, the ortholog of the human G3BP1 and G3BP2 proteins. Both proteins fall into stress granules in the embryo and in the germline when C. elegans is exposed to stressful conditions. None of the two proteins is essential for the assembly of stress induced granules, but the granules formed in absence of PQN-59 or GTBP-1 are less numerous and dissolve faster than the ones formed in control embryos. Despite these differences, pqn-59 or gtbp-1 mutant embryos do not show a higher sensitivity to stress than control embryos. pqn-59 mutants display reduced progeny and a high percentage of embryonic lethality, phenotypes that are not dependent on stress exposure and that are not shared with gtbp-1 mutants. Our data indicate that both GTBP-1 and PQN-59 contribute to stress granule formation but that PQN-59 is, in addition, required for C. elegans development.\n\nAuthor summaryThe formation of so-called stress granules is an adaptive response that cells and organisms put into action to cope with changes in internal and environmental conditions and thus to survive to stressful conditions. Although it is generally thought that stress granule formation protects cells from stress-related damage, the exact role of stress granules in cells and organisms is not well understood. Moreover, the mechanisms governing stress granule assembly, and if and how the ability to form stress granules is important for C. elegans development is still unclear.\n\nOur work focuses on two conserved proteins, known to be involved in stress granule assembly in mammalian cells, and investigates their role in C. elegans embryos. We find that these proteins are important but not essential to assemble stress-induced granules in C. elegans. We moreover did not observe a different sensitivity to stress exposure between wild-type and mutant developing embryos, suggesting that at least in these conditions these proteins do not exert a protective role.",

    "abstract": "Elongator is a highly conserved protein complex required for transcriptional elongation, intracellular transport and translation. Elongator complex protein 1 (ELP1) is the scaffolding protein of Elongator and is essential for its assembly and stability. Familial dysautonomia (FD), a hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, is caused by a mutation in ELP1 that lead to a tissue-specific reduction of ELP1 protein. Our work to generate a phenotypic mouse model for FD led to the discovery that homozygous deletion of the mouse Elp1 gene leads to embryonic lethality prior to mid-gestation. Given that FD is caused by a reduction, not loss, of ELP1, we generated two new mouse models by introducing different copy numbers of the human FD ELP1 transgene into the Elp1 knockout mouse (Elp1-/-) and observed that human ELP1 expression rescues embryonic development in a dose dependent manner. We then conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis in mouse embryos to identify genes and pathways whose expression correlates with the amount of ELP1. We found that ELP1 is essential for the expression of genes responsible for the formation and development of the nervous system. Further, gene length analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that the loss of Elp1 mainly impacts the expression of long genes and that by gradually restoring Elongator their expression is progressively rescued. Finally, through evaluation of co-expression modules, we identified gene sets with unique expression patterns that depended on ELP1 expression. Overall, this study highlights the crucial role of ELP1 during early embryonic neuronal development and reveals gene networks and biological pathways that are regulated by Elongator.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe objective was to create multilayer cellular constructs using fetal or adult, decellularized articular cartilage in particulate form as microcarriers for expansion and fusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to regenerate the stratified structure of articular cartilage.\n\nMethodsPorous microparticles (CMPs) generated from decellularized fetal or adult bovine articular cartilage were used as microcarriers for expansion of human MSCs. The CMP expanded MSCs (CMP-MSCs) were used to generate injectable hydrogels or preformed multilayer constructs for articular cartilage regeneration. In the injectable approach, CMP-MSCs were suspended in alginate gel, crosslinked with calcium chloride, and incubated in chondrogenic medium to generate an injectable regenerative construct. In the preformed approach, fetal or adult CMP-MSCs were suspended in a culture medium, allowed to settle sequentially by the force of gravity, and fused by incubation in chondrogenic medium to generate multilayer cell sheets. The constructs were characterized with respect to compressive modulus, cellularity, and expression of chondrogenic markers.\n\nResultsHuman MSCs expanded on fetal or adult CMPs in basal medium maintained the expression of mesenchymal markers. The injectable CMP-MSCs hydrogels had significantly higher expression of chondrogenic markers and compressive modulus after four weeks incubation in chondrogenic medium compared to MSCs directly encapsulated in alginate gel; preformed CMP-MSCs cell sheets had significantly higher compressive modulus and expression of chondrogenic markers compared to MSCs in the pellet culture.\n\nConclusionThe preformed cell sheet approach is potentially useful for creating multilayer constructs by sequential gravitational settling of CMP-MSCs to mimic the stratified structure of articular cartilage.\n\nInsight, Innovation, IntegrationThis work described a novel approach to recreate the zonal structure of articular cartilage. Human MSCs were expanded on porous microcarrier beads generated from decellularized fetal or adult bovine articular cartilage. The cell-seeded microbeads were fused by gravitational settling to form mono- or bi-layer cell sheets. The cell sheets were cultured in chondrogenic medium to regenerate the articular cartilage tissue. The in vitro regenerated tissue had higher compressive modulus and expression of chondrogenic markers compared to the MSC pellet culture.",

    "abstract": "The occurring climate change is causing temperature increment in crop production areas worldwide, generating conditions of heat stress that negatively affect crop productivity. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a major vegetable crop, is highly susceptible to conditions of heat stress. When tomato plants are exposed to ambient day/night temperatures that exceed 32{degrees}C/20{degrees}C respectively during the reproductive phase, fruit set and fruit weight are reduced, leading to a significant decrease in yield. Processing tomato cultivars are cultivated in open fields, where environmental conditions are not controlled, therefore plants are exposed to multiple abiotic stresses, including heat stress. Understanding the physiological response of modern processing tomato cultivars to heat stress may facilitate the development of thermotolerant cultivars. Here, we compared two tomato processing cultivars, H4107 and H9780, that we found to be constantly differing in yield performance. Using field and temperature-controlled greenhouse experiments, we show that the observed difference in yield is attributed to the occurrence of heat stress conditions. In addition, fruit-set and seed production were significantly improved in the thermotolerant cultivar H4107, compared with H9780. Despite the general acceptance of pollen viability as a measure of thermotolerance, there was no difference in the percentage of viable pollen between H4107 and H9780 under either of the conditions tested. Therefore, processing tomato cultivars may present a particular case, in which other factors are central for heat stress tolerance. Our results also demonstrate the value of combining controlled with uncontrolled experimental settings, in order to identify heat stress related responses and facilitate the development of thermotolerant processing tomato cultivars.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the role of extracellular Heat shock protein 90 alpha (eHsp90) in conferring protection of neuronal cells against fibrillary amyloid beta (f-A{beta}1-42) toxicity mediated by microglial cells. Formation of f-A{beta}1-42 plaques leads to neurotoxic inflammation, a critical pathological feature of Alzheimers Disease. We observed increased uptake and clearance of internalized f-A{beta}1-42 by microglial cells treated with eHsp90, an effect associated with activation of NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) - mediated autophagy. eHsp90 thus mitigated the neuronal toxicity of f-A{beta}1-42-activated microglia. In addition, eHsp90 facilitated f-A{beta}1-42 engulfment by microglial cells in vitro. In summary, eHsp90 triggers NRF2-mediated autophagy in microglia and thus protects against the neurotoxic effects of f-A{beta}1-42.",
