    "abstract": "While SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been characterized to play essential roles in host immune protection in COVID-19 patients, few researches focus on the functional validation of T cell epitopes and development of vaccines inducing specific T cell responses. In this study, 120 CD8+ T cell epitopes from E, M, N, S and RdRp proteins were validated. Among them, 110 epitopes have not been reported previously; 110, 15, 6, 14 and 12 epitopes were highly homologous with SARS-CoV, OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E, respectively; 4 epitopes from S protein displayed one amino acid distinct from the current variants of SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-one epitopes restricted by HLA-A2 molecule were used to generate peptide cocktail vaccines in combination with Poly(I:C), R848 or polylactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles, which elicited robust specific CD8+ T cell responses in wild-type and HLA-A2/DR1 transgenic mice. Seven of the 31 epitopes were found to be cross-presented by HLA-A2 and H-2K/Db molecules. Unlike previous researches, this study established a modified cell co-culture system of DC-peptide-PBL using healthy donors PBMCs to validate the CD8+ T cell epitope on-silicon predicted; provided a library of CD8+ T cell epitopes restricted by a series of high-frequency HLA-A allotypes which covering broad Asian populations; identified the HLA-A cross-restrictions of these CD8+ T cell epitopes using competitive binding experiments with HMy2.CIR cell lines expressing indicated HLA-A molecules; and initially confirmed the in vivo feasibility of 9 or 10-mer peptide cocktail vaccines of SARS-CoV2. These data will facilitate the development of vaccines inducing antiviral CD8+ T cell responses.",

    "abstract": "Coagulopathy is a significant aspect of morbidity in COVID-19 patients. The clotting cascade is propagated by a series of proteases, including factor Xa and thrombin. While certain host proteases, including TMPRSS2 and furin, are known to be important for cleavage activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike to promote viral entry in the respiratory tract, other proteases may also contribute. Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that factor Xa and thrombin can also directly cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike, enhancing viral entry. A drug-repurposing screen identified a subset of protease inhibitors that promiscuously inhibited spike cleavage by both transmembrane serine proteases as well as coagulation factors. The mechanism of the protease inhibitors nafamostat and camostat may extend beyond inhibition of TMPRSS2 to coagulation-induced spike cleavage. Anticoagulation is critical in the management of COVID-19, and early intervention could provide collateral benefit by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. We propose a model of positive feedback whereby infection-induced hypercoagulation exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Early in the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic concerns were raised regarding infection of other animal hosts and whether these could play a significant role in the viral epidemiology. Infection of animals could be detrimental by causing clinical disease but also of concern if they become a viral reservoir allowing further mutations, plus having the potential to infect other animals or humans. The first reported animals to be infected both under experimental conditions and from anecdotal field evidence were cats described in China early in 2020. Given the concerns this finding raised and the close contacts between humans and cats, we aimed to determine whether a vaccine candidate could be developed that was suitable for use in multiple susceptible animal species and whether this vaccine could reduce infection of cats in addition to preventing spread to other cats.\n\nHere we report that a Replicon Particle (RP) vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), known to be safe and efficacious for use in a variety of animals, expressing a stabilised Spike antigen, could induce neutralising antibody titers in guinea pigs and cats. After two intramuscular vaccinations, virus neutralising antibodies were detected in the respiratory tract of the guinea pigs and a cell mediated immune response was induced. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen was shown to be critical in developing a strong neutralising antibody response. Vaccination of cats was able to induce a serum neutralising antibody response which lasted for the course of the experiment. Interestingly, in contrast to control animals, infectious virus could not be detected in oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after challenge. Moreover, the challenged control cats spread the virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit virus. The results show that the RP vaccine induces sterile immunity preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. This data suggests that this RP vaccine could be a multi-species vaccine useful for preventing spread to and between other animals should that approach be required.",

    "abstract": "The development of effective vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and distributed worldwide is necessary to mitigate the devastating health and economic impacts of pandemics like COVID-19. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, we found that clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum were unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here we show that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising CpG/Alum adjuvant in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel elicited potent anti-RBD and anti-spike antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems. Notably, a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay revealed that hydrogel-based vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses when bolus vaccines did not. Together, these results suggest that slow delivery of RBD subunit vaccines with PNP hydrogels can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of RBD and induce neutralizing humoral immunity.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-coronaviruses alone have been responsible for three major global outbreaks in the 21st century. The current crisis has led to an urgent requirement to develop therapeutics. Even though a number of vaccines are available, alternative strategies targeting essential viral components are required as a back-up against the emergence of lethal viral variants. One such target is the main protease (Mpro) that plays an indispensible role in viral replication. The availability of over 270 Mpro X-ray structures in complex with inhibitors provides unique insights into ligand-protein interactions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive comparison of all non-redundant ligand-binding sites available for SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mpro. Extensive adaptive sampling has been used to explore conformational dynamics employing convolutional variational auto encoder-based deep learning, and investigates structural conservation of the ligand binding sites using Markov state models across {beta}-coronavirus homologs. Our results indicate that not all ligand-binding sites are dynamically conserved despite high sequence and structural conservation across {beta}-coronavirus homologs. This highlights the complexity in targeting all three Mpro enzymes with a single pan inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Density dependent interactions are fundamental to community ecology, but studies often reduce the complex nature of species interactions. In plant ecology, interactions during vegetative growth and flowering are often considered separately, though both can affect reproductive output. Here we use communities of annual flowering plants in the genus Clarkia to ask how interactions during growth and flowering contribute to density dependence in plant seed production, and if pollinator behaviors explain apparent patterns in plant interactions during flowering. We measure seed set (seed number per ovule) and total fecundity (whole-plant seed production) of Clarkia focal plants in experimental interaction plots with the effect of pollinators experimentally removed through supplemental pollination or retained. We also observe pollinator behaviors in the plots and experimental arrays to document pollinator preference, constancy and joint attraction. During flowering, pollinators significantly changed the density dependent effects of Clarkia interactions on seed set in 31% of species interactions, and these changes corresponded to pollinator behaviors. Total fecundity, however, did not depend on interactions between Clarkia; instead, earlier-flowering, non-Clarkia forbs limited total fecundity. Our study shows that interactions during vegetative growth can preclude the effect of pollinator- mediated interactions on fecundity by limiting potential reproductive output. Simultaneously studying different types of species interactions allows for understanding the contingency of ecological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, is found on pericytes, contractile cells enwrapping capillaries that regulate brain, heart and kidney blood flow. ACE2 converts vasoconstricting angiotensin II into vasodilating angiotensin-(1-7). In brain slices from hamster, which has an ACE2 sequence similar to human ACE2, angiotensin II alone evoked only a small capillary constriction, but evoked a large pericyte-mediated capillary constriction generated by AT1 receptors in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). The effect of the RBD was mimicked by blocking ACE2. A mutated non-binding RBD did not potentiate constriction. A similar RBD-potentiated capillary constriction occurred in human cortical slices. This constriction reflects an RBD-induced decrease in the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7). The clinically-used drug losartan inhibited the RBD-potentiated constriction. Thus AT1 receptor blockers could be protective in SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing pericyte-mediated blood flow reductions in the brain, and perhaps the heart and kidney.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that threaten the efficacy of existing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies underscores the urgent need for new antibody-based tools that potently neutralize variants by targeting multiple sites of the spike protein. We isolated 216 monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 from plasmablasts and memory B cells of COVID-19 patients. The three most potent antibodies targeted distinct regions of the RBD, and all three neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. The crystal structure of the most potent antibody, CV503, revealed that it binds to the ridge region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, competes with the ACE2 receptor, and has limited contact with key variant residues K417, E484 and N501. We designed bispecific antibodies by combining non-overlapping specificities and identified five ultrapotent bispecific antibodies that inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection at concentrations of <1 ng/mL. Through a novel mode of action three bispecific antibodies cross-linked adjacent spike proteins using dual NTD/RBD specificities. One bispecific antibody was >100-fold more potent than a cocktail of its parent monoclonals in vitro and prevented clinical disease in a hamster model at a 2.5 mg/kg dose. Notably, six of nine bispecific antibodies neutralized B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and the wild-type virus with comparable potency, despite partial or complete loss of activity of at least one parent monoclonal antibody against B.1.351. Furthermore, a bispecific antibody that neutralized B.1.351 protected against SARS-CoV-2 expressing the crucial E484K mutation in the hamster model. Thus, bispecific antibodies represent a promising next-generation countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",

In incubation experiments, where oxygen concentrations were resolved to the nanomolar range, we show that Nitrosopumilus maritimus produces oxygen (O2) and dinitrogen (N2). The pathway is not completely resolved, but it has nitric oxide as a key intermediate. Part of the oxygen produced is directly used for ammonia oxidation, while some accumulates in the surrounding environment. N. maritimus joins a small handful of organisms known to produce oxygen in the dark, and based on this ability, we re-evaluate their role in oxygen-depleted marine environments.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing serious infections in immune compromised persons. These infections are difficult to erase with antibiotics, due to the formation of biofilms. The biofilm lifecycle is regulated by the second messenger molecule c-di-GMP (bis-3,5-cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate). P. aeruginosa encodes 40 genes for enzymes presumably involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP. A tight regulation of expression, subcellular localized function and protein interactions control the activity of these enzymes. In this work we elucidated the transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase NbdA. We previously reported a transcriptional and posttranslational role of nitric oxide (NO) on nbdA and its involvement in biofilm dispersal. NO is released from macrophages during infections but can also be produced by P. aeruginosa itself during anaerobic denitrification. Recently however, contradictory results about the role of NbdA within NO-induced biofilm dispersal were published. Therefore, the transcriptional regulation of nbdA was reevaluated to obtain insights into this discrepancy. Determination of the transcriptional start site of nbdA by 5-RACE and subsequent identification of the promoter region revealed a shortened open reading frame (ORF) in contrast to the annotated one. In addition, putative binding sites for RpoS and AmrZ were discovered in the newly defined promoter region. Employing chromosomally integrated transcriptional lacZ reporter gene fusions demonstrated a RpoS-dependent activation and AmrZ repression of nbdA transcription. In order to investigate the impact of NO on nbdA transcription, conditions mimicking exogenous and endogenous NO were applied. While neither exogenous nor endogenous NO had an influence on nbdA promoter activity, deletion of the nitrite reductase gene nirS strongly increased nbdA transcription independently of its enzymatic activity during denitrification. The latter supports a role of NirS in P. aeruginosa apart from its enzymatic function.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses a network of genes encoding proteins for the turnover of the second messenger c-di-GMP involved in regulating-among others-the lifestyle switch between planktonic, motile cells and sessile biofilms. Insight into the transcriptional regulation of these genes is important for the understanding of the protein function within the cell. Determination of the transcriptional start site of the phosphodiesterase gene nbdA revealed a new promoter region and consequently a shortened open reading frame for the corresponding protein. Binding sites for RpoS and AmrZ were identified in silico and confirmed experimentally. Previously reported regulation by nitric oxide was reevaluated and a strong influence of the moonlighting protein NirS identified.",

All 22 N-glycan sites of SARS-CoV-2 Spike remain highly conserved among the variants B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1, opening an avenue for robust therapeutic intervention. Here we used a comprehensive library of mammalian carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to probe critical sugar residues on the full-length trimeric Spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Two lectins, Clec4g and CD209c, were identified to strongly bind to Spike. Clec4g and CD209c binding to Spike was dissected and visualized in real time and at single molecule resolution using atomic force microscopy. 3D modelling showed that both lectins can bind to a glycan within the RBD-ACE2 interface and thus interferes with Spike binding to cell surfaces. Importantly, Clec4g and CD209c significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections. These data report the first extensive map and 3D structural modelling of lectin-Spike interactions and uncovers candidate receptors involved in Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infections. The capacity of CLEC4G and mCD209c lectins to block SARS-CoV-2 viral entry holds promise for pan-variant therapeutic interventions.",

RTqPCR was performed to quantify expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 relative to the reference gene YWHAZ. Western blots were performed on placental homogenates to quantify protein levels. The impact of fetal sex and SARS-CoV-2 exposure on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA.\n\nResultsSARS-CoV-2 virus was undetectable in all placentas. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection impacted TMPRSS2 placental gene and protein expression in a sexually dimorphic fashion (2-way ANOVA interaction p-value: 0.002). We observed no impact of fetal sex or maternal SARS-CoV-2 status on placental ACE2 gene or protein expression. Placental TMPRSS2 expression was significantly correlated with ACE2 expression in males (Spearmans {rho}=0.54, p=0.02) but not females ({rho}=0.23, p=0.34) exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2.\n\nConclusionsSex differences in placental TMPRSS2 but not ACE2 were observed in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings may have implications for offspring vulnerability to placental infection and vertical transmission.These findings may have implications for offspring vulnerability to placental infection and vertical transmission.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) finely tune protein expression and target networks of 100s-1000s of genes that control specific biological processes. They are critical regulators of glycosylation, one of the most diverse and abundant posttranslational modifications. In recent work, miRs have been shown to predict the biological functions of glycosylation enzymes, leading to the \"miRNA proxy hypothesis\" which states, \"if a miR drives a specific biological phenotype..., the targets of that miR will drive the same biological phenotype.\" Testing of this powerful hypothesis is hampered by our lack of knowledge about miR targets. Target prediction suffers from low accuracy and a high false prediction rate. Herein, we develop a high-throughput experimental platform to analyze miR:target interactions, miRFluR. We utilize this system to analyze the interactions of the entire human miRome with beta-3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT), a glycosylation enzyme whose loss underpins the congenital disorder Peters Plus Syndrome. Although this enzyme is predicted by multiple algorithms to be highly targeted by miRs, we identify only 27 miRs that downregulate B3GLCT, a >96% false positive rate for prediction. Functional enrichment analysis of these validated miRs predict phenotypes associated with Peters Plus Syndrome, although B3GLCT is not in their known target network. Thus, biological phenotypes driven by B3GLCT may be driven by the target networks of miRs that regulate this enzyme, providing additional evidence for the miRNA Proxy Hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal recessive mutations in PINK1 and Parkin cause Parkinsons disease. How activation of PINK1 and Parkin leads to elimination of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy is largely based on cell culture studies with few molecular studies in neurons. Herein we have undertaken a global proteomic-analysis of mitochondria from mouse neurons to identify ubiquitylated substrates of endogenous Parkin activation. Comparative analysis with human iNeuron datasets revealed a subset of 49 PINK1-dependent diGLY sites upregulated upon mitochondrial depolarisation in 22 proteins conserved across mouse and human systems. These proteins were exclusively localised at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) including, CISD1, CPT1, ACSL1, and FAM213A. We demonstrate that these proteins can be directly ubiquitylated by Parkin in vitro. We also provide evidence for a subset of cytoplasmic proteins recruited to mitochondria that undergo PINK1 and Parkin independent ubiquitylation including SNX3, CAMK2 and CAMK2{beta} indicating the presence of alternate ubiquitin E3 ligase pathways that are activated by mitochondrial depolarisation in neurons. Finally we have developed an online resource to visualise mitochondrial ubiquitin sites in neurons and search for ubiquitin components recruited to mitochondria upon mitochondrial depolarisation, MitoNUb. This analysis will aid in future studies to understand Parkin activation in neuronal subtypes. Our findings also suggest that monitoring ubiquitylation status of the 22 identified MOM proteins may represent robust biomarkers for PINK1 and Parkin activity in vivo.",

However, the route electrons take from thylakoid membranes to the cell exterior is not understood. Electrochemistry is a powerful analytical technique for studying electron transfer pathways. Here, we show how photoelectrochemistry can be used to compare electron flux from cyanobacterial cells of different growth stages, species and with the outer layers systematically removed. We show that the periplasmic space contributes significantly to the photocurrent profile complexity of whole cells, indicating that it gates electron transfer in exoelectrogenesis. We found that although components of the type IV pili machinery do not have a role in exoelectrogenesis, they contribute significantly to cell-electrode adherence. This study establishes that analytical photoelectrochemistry and molecular microbiology provide a powerful combination to study exoelectrogenesis, enabling future studies to answer biological questions and advance solar energy conversion applications.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis controls the release of glucocorticoids, which regulate immune and inflammatory function by modulating cytokines, white blood cells (WBCs), and oxidative stress via glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. Although the response to HPA activation is well characterized in many species, little is known about the impacts of HPA activation during extreme physiological conditions in marine mammals. Hence, we challenged 18 simultaneously fasting and developing elephant seal pups with daily intramuscular injections of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), a GR antagonist (RU486), or a combination (ACTH+RU486) for four days (4d). We collected blood at baseline, two hours (2h), and 4d after the beginning of treatment. ACTH and ACTH+RU486 elevated serum aldosterone and cortisol at 2h, with effects diminishing at 4d. RU486 alone induced a compensatory increase in aldosterone, but not cortisol, at 4d. ACTH decreased neutrophils at 2h while decreasing lymphocytes and increasing neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio at 4d. These effects were abolished by RU486. Despite alterations in WBCs, there was no effect of ACTH or RU486 on transforming growth factor-{beta} or interleukin-6 levels; however, both cytokines decreased with the 4-d fasting progression. Similarly, ACTH did not impact protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, or antioxidant enzymes, but plasma isoprostanes and catalase activity decreased while glutathione peroxidase increased with fasting progression. These data demonstrate differential acute (2h) and chronic (4d) modulatory effects of HPA activation on WBCs and that the chronic effect is mediated, at least in part, by GR. These results also underscore elephant seals resistance to potential oxidative stress derived from repeated HPA activation.\n\nSummary statementMany species experience oxidative stress and inflammation after repeated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We show that simultaneously fasting and developing elephant seals are resistant to repeated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation.",

    "abstract": "Vaccinia virus (VV) is the most studied member of the poxvirus family, is responsible for the successful elimination of smallpox worldwide, and has been developed as a vaccine vehicle for infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy. We have previously shown that the unique potency of VV in the activation of CD8+ T cell response is dependent on efficient activation of the innate immune system through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent and -independent pathways. However, it remains incompletely defined what regulate CD8+ T cell response to VV infection. In this study, we showed that {gamma}{delta}T cells play an important role in promoting CD8+ T cell response to VV infection. We found that {gamma}{delta}T cells can directly present viral antigens in the context MHC-I for CD8+ T cell activation to VV in vivo, and we further demonstrated that cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling in {gamma}{delta}T cells is required for activation of {gamma}{delta}T cells and CD8+ T cells. These results illustrate a critical role for {gamma}{delta}T cells in the regulation of adaptive T cell response to viral infection and may shed light on the design of more effective vaccine strategies based on manipulation of {gamma}{delta}T cells.\n\nImportanceTargeting the immune systems has powerful potentials to treat many disorders, such as some cancers and viral infections. By understanding how the immune system responds to model infections, we can better determine strategies to manipulate our immune systems. Vaccinia virus is responsible for the worldwide elimination of smallpox and produces one of the longest immune responses known in humans. We know from previous findings that NK cells are required for initial immune response and CD8+ T cells are required for the elimination of the virus. How CD8+ T cells are activated in response to Vaccinia virus is not fully understood. This manuscript found that {gamma}{delta}T cells activate CD8+ T cells in response to Vaccinia virus infection through MyD88 pathway",

    "abstract": "Tuberculous granulomas that develop in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection are highly dynamic entities shaped by the host immune response and disease kinetics. Within this microenvironment, immune cell recruitment, polarization and activation is driven not only by co-existing cell types and multi-cellular interactions, but also by M.tb-mediated changes involving metabolic heterogeneity, epigenetic reprogramming and rewiring of the transcriptional landscape of host cells. There is an increased appreciation of the in vivo complexity, versatility and heterogeneity of the cellular compartment that constitutes the tuberculosis (TB) granuloma, and the difficulty in translating findings from animal models to human disease. Here we describe a novel biomimetic in vitro 3-dimentional (3D) human lung granuloma model, resembling early \"innate\" and \"adaptive\" stages of the TB granuloma spectrum, and present results of histological architecture, host transcriptional characterization, mycobacteriological features, cytokine profiles and spatial distribution of key immune cells. A range of manipulations of immune cell populations in these granulomas will allow the study of host/pathogen pathways involved in the outcome of infection, as well as pharmacological interventions.\n\nIMPORTANCETuberculosis is a highly infectious disease, with granulomas as its hallmark. Granulomas play an important role in the control of M.tb infection and as such are crucial indicators for our understanding of host resistance to TB. Correlates of risk and protection to M.tb are still elusive, and the granuloma provides the perfect environment in which to study the immune response to infection and broaden our understanding thereof; however, human granulomas are difficult to obtain, and animal models are costly and do not always faithfully mimic human immunity. In fact, most TB research is conducted in vitro on immortalized or primary immune cells and cultured in 2D on flat, rigid plastic, which does not reflect in vivo characteristics. We have therefore conceived a 3D, human in vitro granuloma model which allows researchers to study features of granuloma-forming diseases, in an 3D structural environment resembling in vivo granuloma architecture and cellular orientation.",

The relationship between these fundamental growth parameters have only been described for a few bacterial species, in particular Escherichia coli, but are missing for most bacterial phyla. In this study, we systematically analysed the growth-rate dependency of ribosome abundance and translation elongation rate for Corynebacterium glutamicum, a gram-positive model species differing from E. coli by a lower growth temperature optimum and a lower {micro}max. Ribosomes were quantified via single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) using fluorescently tagged ribosomal proteins and via RNA/protein ratio. Both methods revealed a non-linear relationship with little change in ribosome abundance below {micro} = 0.4 h-1 and a steep increase at higher {micro}. Unlike E. coli, C. glutamicum keeps a large pool of active ribosomes at low {micro}, but the translation elongation rate declines from [~]9 amino acids s-1 at {micro}max to <2 aa s-1 at {micro} < 0.1 h-1. A model-based approach shows that depletion of translation precursors at low growth rates can explain the observed decrease in translation elongation rate.

    "abstract": "The continued emergence of bacterial pathogens presenting antimicrobial resistance is widely recognised as a global health threat and recent attention focused on potential environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Freshwater environments such as rivers represent a potential hotspot for ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria as they are receiving systems for effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Effluent also contains low levels of different antimicrobials including antibiotics and biocides. Sulfonamides are antibacterial chemicals widely used in clinical, veterinary and agricultural settings and are frequently detected in sewage sludge and manure in addition to riverine ecosystems. The impact of such exposure on ARG prevalence and diversity is unknown, so the aim of this study was to investigate the release of a sub-lethal concentration of the sulfonamide compound sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on the river bacterial microbiome using a flume system. This system was a semi-natural in vitro flume using river water (30 L) and sediment with circulation to mimic river flow. A combination of  omics approaches were conducted to study the impact of SMX exposure on the microbiomes within the flumes. Metagenomic analysis showed that the addition of low concentrations of SMX (<4 g L-1) had a limited effect on the bacterial resistome in the water fraction only, with no impact observed in the sediment. Metaproteomics did not show differences in ARGs expression with SMX exposure in water. Overall, the river bacterial community was resilient to short term exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of SMX which mimics the exposure such communities experience downstream of WWTPs throughout the year.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is an aquatic Gram-negative bacterium that causes severe diarrheal cholera disease when ingested by humans. To eliminate competitor cells in both the external environment and inside hosts, V. cholerae uses the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS). The T6SS is a macromolecular weapon employed by many Gram-negative bacteria to deliver cytotoxic proteins into adjacent cells. In addition to canonical T6SS gene clusters encoded by all sequenced V. cholerae isolates, strain BGT49 encodes an additional locus, which we named auxiliary cluster 4 (Aux 4). The Aux 4 cluster is located on a mobile genetic element and can be used by killer cells to eliminate both V. cholerae and Escherichia coli cells in a T6SS-dependent manner. A putative toxin encoded in the cluster, which we name TpeV (Type VI Permeabilizing Effector Vibrio), shares no homology to known proteins and does not contain motifs or domains indicative of function. Ectopic expression of TpeV in the periplasm of E. coli permeabilizes cells and disrupts the membrane potential. Using confocal microscopy, we confirm that susceptible target cells become permeabilized when competed with killer cells harboring the Aux 4 cluster. We also determine that tpiV, the gene located immediately downstream of tpeV, encodes an immunity protein that neutralizes the toxicity of TpeV. Finally, we show that TpeV homologs are broadly distributed across important animal and plant pathogens and are localized in proximity to other T6SS genes. Our results suggest that TpeV is a toxin that belongs to a large family of T6SS proteins.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria live in polymicrobial communities where competition for resources and space is essential for survival. Proteobacteria use the T6SS to eliminate neighboring cells and cause disease. However, the mechanisms by which many T6SS toxins kill or inhibit susceptible target cells are poorly understood. The sequence of the TpeV toxin we describe here is unlike any previously described protein. We demonstrate that it has antimicrobial activity by permeabilizing cells, eliminating membrane potentials and causing severe cytotoxicity. TpeV homologs are found near known T6SS genes in human, animal and plant bacterial pathogens, indicating that the toxin is a representative member of a broadly distributed protein family. We propose that TpeV-like toxins contribute to the fitness and pathogenicity of many bacteria. Finally, since antibiotic resistance is a critical global health threat, the discovery of new antimicrobial mechanisms could lead to the development of new treatments against resistant strains.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, uses its spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral membrane to enter host cells. The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to enrich the Golgi-resident fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer, and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on soluble and virion S trimers, is predominantly modified in the Golgi by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized gene editing and fast tracked our capacity to manipulate genes of interest for the benefit of both research and therapeutic applications. Whilst many advances have, and continue to be made in this area, perhaps the most utilized technology to date has been the generation of knockout cells, tissues and animals by taking advantage of Cas9 function to promote indels in precise locations in the genome. Whilst the advantages of this technology are many fold, some questions still remain regarding the effects that long term expression of foreign proteins such as Cas9, have on mammalian cell function. Several studies have proposed that chronic overexpression of Cas9, with or without its accompanying guide RNAs, may have deleterious effects on cell function and health. This is of particular concern when applying this technology in vivo, where chronic expression of Cas9 in tissues of interest may promote disease-like phenotypes and thus confound the investigation of the effects of the gene of interest. Although these concerns remain valid, no study to our knowledge has yet to demonstrate this directly. Thus, in this study we used the lox-stop-lox (LSL) spCas9 ROSA26 transgenic (Tg) mouse line to generate four tissue-specific Cas9-Tg models with expression in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. We performed comprehensive phenotyping of these mice up to 20-weeks of age and subsequently performed molecular analysis of their organs. We demonstrated that Cas9 expression in these tissues had no detrimental effect on whole body health of the animals, nor did it induce any tissue-specific effects on energy metabolism, liver health, inflammation, fibrosis, heart function or muscle mass. Thus, our data suggests that these models are suitable for studying the tissue specific effects of gene deletion using the LSL-Cas9-Tg model, and that phenotypes observed utilizing these models can be confidently interpreted as being gene specific, and not confounded by the chronic overexpression of Cas9.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBotrytis bunch rot, caused by Botrytis cinerea, is an economically important disease of grapes in Australia and across grape growing regions worldwide. Control of this disease relies on canopy management and the application of fungicides. Fungicide application can lead to the selection of resistant B. cinerea populations, which has an adverse effect on management of the disease. Characterising the distribution and severity of resistant B. cinerea populations is needed to inform resistance management strategies.\n\nRESULTSIn this study, 725 isolates were sampled from 75 Australian vineyards during 2013 - 2016 and were screened against seven fungicides with different modes of action (MOAs). The resistance frequencies for azoxystrobin, boscalid, fenhexamid, fludioxonil, iprodione, pyrimethanil and tebuconazole were 5, 2.8, 2.1, 6.2, 11.6, 7.7 and 2.9% respectively. Nearly half of the resistant isolates (43.8%) were resistant to more than one of the fungicides tested. The frequency of vineyards with at least one isolate simultaneously resistant to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 fungicides was 19.5, 7.8, 6.5, 10.4 and 2.6%. Resistance was associated with previously published genotypes in CytB (G143A), SdhB (H272R/Y), Erg27 (F412S), Mrr1 (D354Y), Bos1 (I365S, N373S + Q369P, I365S + D757N) and Pos5 (V273I, P319A, L412F/V). Novel genotypes were also described in Mrr1 (S611N, D616G) Pos5 (V273L) and Cyp51 (P347S). Expression analysis was used to characterise fludioxonil resistant isolates exhibiting overexpression (6.3-9.6-fold) of the ABC transporter gene AtrB (MDR1 phenotype).\n\nCONCLUSIONResistance frequencies were lower when compared to most previously published surveys of B. cinerea resistance in grape and other crops. Nevertheless, continued monitoring of critical MOAs used in Australian vineyards is recommended.",

Here we show that Rab40b interacts with Cullin5 via the Rab40b SOCS domain. We demonstrate that loss of Rab40b/Cullin5 binding decreases cell motility and invasive potential, and show that defective cell migration and invasion stem from alteration to the actin cytoskeleton, leading to decreased invadopodia formation, decreased actin dynamics at the leading edge, and an increase in stress fibers. We also show that these stress fibers anchor at less dynamic, more stable focal adhesions. Mechanistically, changes in the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion dynamics are mediated in part by EPLIN, which we demonstrate to be a binding partner of Rab40b and a target for Rab40b/Cullin5 dependent localized ubiquitylation and degradation. Thus, we propose a model where the Rab40b/Cullin5 dependent ubiquitylation regulates EPLIN localization to promote cell migration and invasion by altering focal adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics.",

Here we show IGF2BP2 is a substrate of the deacetylase and tumor suppressor sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and regulates the expression of the vacuolar ATPase subunit ATP6V1A. SIRT1 down-regulation in aggressive cancers leads to increased acetylation of IGF2BP2 which recruits the XRN2 nuclease to degrade the ATP6V1A transcript, decreasing its expression. This impairs lysosomal function and results in the production of a secretome that enhances cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. These findings describe a previously unrecognized role for IGF2BP2 in the degradation of an mRNA transcript essential for lysosomal function and highlight how its sirtuin-regulated acetylation state can have significant biological and disease consequences.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAcetylation of the RNA binding protein IGF2BP2, upon down-regulation of SIRT1, leads to degradation of the transcript encoding ATP6V1A and impaired lysosomal function in aggressive cancer cells.",

Signals from dying cells are crucial to this process and are best understood in the context of regeneration following programmed cell death, like apoptosis. Conversely, regeneration following unregulated forms of death such as necrosis have yet to be fully explored. Here we have developed a method to investigate regeneration following necrosis using the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We show that necrosis stimulates regeneration at an equivalent level to that of apoptosis-mediated cell death and activates a similar response at the wound edge involving localized JNK signaling. Unexpectedly however, necrosis also results in significant apoptosis far from the site of ablation, which we have termed necrosis-induced apoptosis (NiA). This apoptosis occurs independent of changes at the wound edge and importantly does not rely on JNK signaling. Furthermore, we find that blocking NiA limits proliferation and subsequently inhibits regeneration, suggesting that tissues damaged by necrosis can activate programmed cell death at a distance from the injury to promote regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The dense glycan shield is an essential feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) architecture, key to immune evasion and to the activation of the prefusion conformation. Recent studies indicate that the occupancy and structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycans depend not only on the nature of the host cell, but also on the structural stability of the trimer; a point that raises important questions about the relative competence of different glycoforms. Moreover, the functional role of the glycan shield in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis suggests that the evolution of the sites of glycosylation is potentially intertwined with the evolution of the protein sequence to affect optimal activity. Our results from multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the type of glycosylation at N234, N165 and N343 greatly affects the stability of the receptor binding domain (RBD) open conformation, and thus its exposure and accessibility. Furthermore, our results suggest that the loss of glycosylation at N370, a newly acquired modification in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycan shields topology, may have contributed to increase the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity as we find that N-glycosylation at N370 stabilizes the closed RBD conformation by binding a specific cleft on the RBD surface. We discuss how the absence of the N370 glycan in the SARS-CoV-2 S frees the RBD glycan binding cleft, which becomes available to bind cell-surface glycans, potentially increases host cell surface localization.",

On maize silks, the cuticular cutin matrix is infused with cuticular lipids, consisting of a homologous series of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), aldehydes, and hydrocarbons that serve as precursors, intermediates, and end-products of the elongation, reduction, and decarbonylation reactions of the hydrocarbon-producing pathway. To deconvolute the potentially confounding impacts of the silk microenvironment and silk development on the hydrocarbon-producing pathway, spatio-temporal cuticular lipid profiling was conducted on the agronomically important inbreds B73 and Mo17, and their reciprocal hybrids. Statistical interrogation via multivariate analyses of the metabolite abundances of the hydrocarbon-producing pathway demonstrate that the cellular VLCFA pool is positively correlated with the cuticular lipid metabolome, and this metabolome is primarily affected by the silk microenvironment and the plant genotype. Moreover, genotype has a major effect on the pathway, with increased cuticular hydrocarbon and concomitant reduction of cuticular VLCFA accumulation on B73 silks, suggesting that conversion of VLCFAs to hydrocarbons is more effective in B73 than Mo17. Statistical modeling of the ratios between cuticular hydrocarbons and cuticular VLCFAs reveals the complexity of the product-precursor ratio relationship, demonstrating a significant role of precursor chain length. Longer-chain VLCFAs are preferentially utilized as precursors for hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate maize silks as an effective and novel system for dissection of the complex dynamics of cuticular lipid accumulation in plants.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryThe product-precursor ratios in the cuticular hydrocarbon-producing pathway are impacted by fatty acid precursor chain length, plant genotype and the spatio-temporal dynamic gradients of maize silks.",

    "abstract": "Accurate quantification of plant-associative bacterial nitrogen (N) fixation is crucial for selection and development of elite diazotrophic inoculants that could be used to supply cereal crops with nitrogen in a sustainable manner. Because a low oxygen environment that may not be conducive to plant growth is essential for optimal stability and function of the N-fixing catalyst nitrogenase, quantification of N fixation is routinely carried out on \"free-living\" bacteria grown in the absence of a host plant. Such experiments may not divulge the true extent of N fixation occurring in the rhizosphere where the availability and forms of nutrients such as carbon and N, which are key regulators of N fixation, may vary widely. Here, we present a modified in planta acetylene reduction assay, utilising the model cereal barley as a host, to quantify associative N fixation by diazotrophic bacteria. The assay is rapid, highly reproducible, applicable to a broad range of diazotrophs, and can be performed with simple equipment commonly found in most laboratories that investigate plant-microbe interactions.\n\nImportanceExploiting \"nitrogen-fixing\" bacteria that reduce atmospheric dinitrogen into ammonia as inoculants of cereal crops has great potential to alleviate current inputs of environmentally deleterious fertiliser nitrogen and drive more sustainable crop production. Accurately quantifying plant-associative bacterial nitrogen fixation is central to the development of such inoculant bacteria, but most assays fail to adequately reproduce the conditions of plant root systems. In this work, we have validated and optimised a simple in planta assay to accurately quantify N fixation in bacteria occupying the root and surrounding soil of the model cereal barley. This assay represents a benchmark for quantification of plant-associative bacterial N fixation.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryote mobilome genomes rely on host machineries for survival and replication. Given that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) derive their energy from host cells, we investigated the diversity of ATP-utilizing proteins in MGE genomes to determine whether they might be associated with proteins that could suppress related host proteins that consume host energy. A comprehensive search of 353 huge phage genomes revealed that up to 9% of the proteins have ATPase domains. For example, ATPase proteins constitute ~3% of the genomes of Lak phages with ~550 kbp genomes that occur in the microbiomes of humans and other animals. Statistical analysis shows the number of ATPase proteins increases linearly with genome length, consistent with a large sink for host ATP during replication of megaphages. Using metagenomic data from diverse environments, we found 505 mobilome proteins with ATPase domains fused to diverse functional domains. Among these composite ATPase proteins, 61.6% have known functional domains that could contribute to host energy diversion during the mobilome life cycle. As many have domains that are known to interact with nucleic acids and proteins, we infer that numerous ATPase proteins are used during replication and for protection from host immune systems. We found a set of uncharacterized ATPase proteins with nuclease and protease activities, displaying unique domain architectures that are energy intensive based on the presence of multiple ATPase domains. In many cases, these composite ATPase proteins genomically co-localize with small proteins in genomic contexts that are reminiscent of toxin-antitoxin systems and phage helicase-antibacterial helicase systems. Small proteins that function as inhibitors may be a common strategy for control of cellular processes, thus could inspire the development of new nucleic acid and protein manipulation tools, with diverse biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "mRNA level is controlled by factors that mediate both mRNA synthesis and decay, including the exonuclease Xrn1 - a major mRNA synthesis and decay factor. Here we show that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Xrn1 and of some of its associated mRNA decay factors plays a key role in determining both mRNA synthesis and decay. Shuttling is regulated by RNA-controlled binding of the karyopherin Kap120 to two nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) in Xrn1. The decaying RNA binds and masks NLS1, establishing a link between mRNA decay and Xrn1 shuttling. Mutations in the two NLSs, which prevent Xrn1 import, compromise transcription and, unexpectedly, also the cytoplasmic decay of [~]50% of the cellular mRNAs - comparably to Xrn1 deletion. These findings uncover a cytoplasmic mRNA decay pathway that begins in the nucleus. Interestingly, Xrn1 shuttling is required for proper adaptation to environmental changes, in particular to ever changing environmental fluctuations.",

The disease can cause extensive damages and the removal of diseased-wood and heavily infected trees can be laborious and expensive. Currently, there is no way to eradicate the fungus from infected trees and our knowledge of the infection process is limited. Thus, in order to target and modify genes efficiently, the genetic transformation technique developed for N. ditissima back in 2003 was modified. We report on the upgraded protocol and show that protoplasts were viable, able to uptake foreign DNA, and able to regenerate back into a mycelial colony, either as targeted gene-disruption mutants or as ectopic mutants expressing GFP.",

    "abstract": "Membrane-less organelles (MLOs) formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play pivotal roles in biological processes. During LLPS, proteins and nucleotides are extremely condensed, resulting in changes of their conformation and biological functions. Disturbed LLPS homeostasis in MLOs cause fatal diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, it is important to detect changes of the degree of crowding in MLOs. However, it has not been investigated well due to lack of an appropriate method. To address this, we developed a genetically-encoded molecular crowding sensor CRONOS that senses the degree of macromolecular crowding in MLOs using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. CRONOS is a very bright biosensor with wider dynamic range and detect changes in the macromolecular volume fraction better than the previously reported mCer-mCit sensor in solution. By fusing to scaffold protein of each MLO, we successfully delivered CRONOS to MLO of interest and detected previously undescribed difference of the degree of crowding in each MLO. If not tagged, CRONOS localized to interstitial space of MLOs, giving us the crowding information of inspace. CRONOS also detected changes of degree of macromolecular crowding in nucleolus induced by environmental stress or inhibition of transcription. These findings suggest that CRONOS can be a useful tool for determination of molecular crowding and detection of pathological changes in MLOs in live cells.",

    "abstract": "Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ubiquitous metallocofactors found across diverse protein families, where they perform myriad functions including redox chemistry, radical generation, and gene regulation. Monitoring Fe-S cluster occupancy in protein targets directly within native biological systems has been challenging. Commonly utilized spectroscopic methods to detect Fe-S clusters require purification of proteins prior to analysis. Global iron incorporation into the proteome can be monitored using radiolabeled iron, but limitations include the low resolution afforded by gel-based autoradiography. Here, we report the development of a mass spectrometry-based strategy to assess Fe-S cluster binding in a native proteome. This chemoproteomic strategy relies on monitoring changes in the reactivity of Fe-S cluster cysteine ligands upon disruption of Fe-S cluster incorporation. Application to E. coli cells cultured under iron-depleted conditions enabled monitoring of disruptions to Fe-S cluster incorporation broadly across the E. coli Fe-S proteome. Evaluation of E. coli deletion strains of three scaffold proteins within the Isc Fe-S biogenesis pathway enabled the identification of Fe-S clients that are reliant on each individual scaffold protein for proper cluster installation. Lastly, cysteine-reactivity changes characteristic of Fe-S ligands were used to identify previously unannotated Fe-S proteins, including the tRNA hydroxylase, TrhP, and a member of a family of membrane transporter ATPase subunits, DppD. In summary, the chemoproteomic strategy described herein provides a powerful tool to report on Fe-S cluster incorporation directly within a native proteome, to interrogate the role of scaffold and accessory proteins within Fe-S biogenesis pathways, and to identify previously uncharacterized Fe-S proteins.",

    "abstract": "Brain size significantly impacts the organization of white matter fibers. Fiber length scaling - the degree to which fiber length varies according to brain size - was overlooked. We investigated how fiber lengths within the corpus callosum, the most prominent white matter tract, vary according to brain size. The results showed substantial variation in length scaling among callosal fibers, replicated in two large healthy cohorts ([~]2000 individuals). The underscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the precentral gyrus and parietal cortices, whereas the overscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the prefrontal cortices. The variation in such length scaling was biologically meaningful: larger scaling corresponded to larger neurite density index but smaller fractional anisotropy values; cortical regions connected by the callosal fibers with larger scaling were more lateralized functionally as well as phylogenetically and ontogenetically more recent than their counterparts. These findings highlight an interaction between interhemispheric communication and organizational and adaptive principles underlying brain development and evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementBrain size varies across evolution, development, and individuals. Relative to small brains, the neural fiber length in large brains is inevitably increased, but the degree of such increase may differ between fiber tracts. Such a difference, if it exists, is valuable for understanding adaptive neural principles in large versus small brains during evolution and development. The present study showed a substantial difference in the length increase between the callosal fibers that connect the two hemispheres, replicated in two large healthy cohorts. Altogether, our study demonstrates that reorganization of interhemispheric fibers length according to brain size is intrinsically related to fiber composition, functional lateralization, cortical myelin content, evolutionary and developmental expansion.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of offspring results from the combined expression of maternal and paternal genes. Genomic imprinting silences some genes in a parent-of-origin specific manner, a process that, among all animals, occurs only in mammals. How genomic imprinting affects the behavior of mammalian offspring, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we studied how the loss of the paternally inherited gene Magel2 in mouse pups affects the emission of separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). Using quantitative analysis of more than one hundred thousand USVs, we characterized the rate of vocalizations as well as their spectral features from postnatal days 6 to 12 (P6-P12), a critical phase of mouse development during which pups fully depend on the mother for survival. Our analyses show that Magel2 deficient offspring emit separation-induced vocalizations at lower rates and with altered spectral features. We also show that dams display altered behavior towards their own Magel2 deficient offspring. In a test to compare the retrieval of two pups, dams retrieve wildtype control pups first and faster than Magel2 deficient offspring. These results suggest that the loss of Magel2 impairs the expression of separation-induced vocalization in pups as well as maternal behavior, both of which support the pups growth and development.",

    "abstract": "Occipital cortices of different sighted people contain analogous maps of visual information (e.g., foveal vs. peripheral space). In congenital blindness, \"visual\" cortices enhance responses to nonvisual stimuli. Do deafferented visual cortices of different blind people represent common informational maps? We leverage a naturalistic stimulus paradigm and inter-subject pattern similarity analysis to address this question. Blindfolded sighted (S, n=22) and congenitally blind (CB, n=22) participants listened to three auditory excerpts from movies; a naturalistic spoken narrative; and matched degraded auditory stimuli (i.e., shuffled sentences and backwards speech) while undergoing fMRI scanning. In a parcel-based whole brain analysis, we measured the spatial activity patterns evoked by each unique, ten-second segment of each auditory clip. We then compared each subjects spatial pattern to that of all other subjects in the same group (CB or S) within and across segments. In both blind and sighted groups, segments of meaningful auditory stimuli produced distinctive patterns of activity that were shared across individuals. Crucially, only in the CB group, this segment-specific, cross-subject pattern similarity effect emerged in visual cortex, but only for meaningful naturalistic stimuli and not backwards speech. These results suggest that spatial activity patterns within deafferented visual cortices encode meaningful, segment-level information contained in naturalistic auditory stimuli, and that these representations are spatially organized in a similar fashion across blind individuals.\n\nSignificance StatementRecent neuroimaging studies show that the so-called \"visual\" cortices activate during non-visual tasks in people who are born blind. Do the visual cortices of people who are born blind develop similar representational maps? While congenitally blind individuals listened to naturalistic auditory stimuli (i.e., sound clips from movies), distinct timepoints within each stimulus elicited unique spatial activity patterns in visual cortex, and these patterns were shared across different people. These findings suggest that in blindness, the visual cortices encode meaningful information embedded in naturalistic auditory signals in a spatially distributed manner, and that a common representational map can emerge in visual cortex independent of visual experience.",
