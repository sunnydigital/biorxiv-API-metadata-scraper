    "abstract": "Regenerative medicine approaches for massive craniomaxillofacial bone defects face challenges associated with the scale of missing bone, the need for rapid graft-defect integration, and challenges related to inflammation and infection. Mineralized collagen scaffolds have been shown to promote mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis due to their porous nature and material properties, but are mechanically weak, limiting surgical practicality. Previously, these scaffolds were combined with 3D-printed polycaprolactone mesh to form a scaffold-mesh composite to increase strength and promote bone formation in sub-critical sized porcine ramus defects. Here, we compare the performance of mineralized collagen-polycaprolactone composites to the polycaprolactone mesh in a critical-sized porcine ramus defect model. While there were no differences in overall healing response between groups, our data demonstrated broadly variable metrics of healing regarding new bone infiltration and fibrous tissue formation. Abscesses were present surrounding some implants and polycaprolactone polymer was still present after 9-10 months of implantation. Overall, while there was limited successful healing, with 2 of 22 implants showed substantial levels of bone regeneration, and others demonstrating some form of new bone formation, the results suggest targeted improvements to improve repair of large animal models to more accurately represent craniomaxillofacial bone healing. Notably, strategies to increase osteogenesis throughout the implant, modulate the immune system to support repair, and employ shape-fitting tactics to avoid implant micromotion and resultant fibrosis. Improvements to the mineralized collagen scaffolds involve changes in pore size and shape to increase cell migration and osteogenesis and inclusion or delivery of factors to aid vascular ingrowth and bone regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater fossil fish faunas have been long used to infer past drainage connections, as they are bounded by physical freshwater barriers. Here we study a middle Miocene (15.0--15.5 Ma) freshwater fish fossil fauna (Makaraipao) from the Castilletes Formation in northern Colombia, nowadays west of the Andes. We record the presence of lungfishes (Lepidosiren), pacus (Mylossoma and Piaractus), armored catfishes (Callichthyidae), and red-tail catfishes (Phractocephalus). Extant members of all those groups (except the Callichthyidae, due to lack of taxonomic resolution) are found in Amazonian faunas east of the Andes and are absent from faunas west of the Andes, indicating that the riverine systems of the Guajira Peninsula were connected to Amazonia during the middle Miocene. The similarity of La Venta (west of the Andes) and Rio Acre (east of the Andes) fish faunas during the late Miocene further indicates that the northern Andean uplift was not a complete barrier at least until[~] 11 Myr ago. However, there is a continental-wide structuring of the Miocene fish faunas that is also found in the extant faunas, suggesting that other factors such as ecological conditions, in addition to the uplift of the Andes, have shaped the biogeographic evolution of South American fish faunas.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe quality of both teaching and learning techniques in health sciences determines the competency of the doctors produced and the patient care. Realizing the necessity of active learning at the undergraduate level, curricular reforms were crucial to ensure that students play an active role in the learning process and imbibe all the prerequisite qualities of a competent health professional. The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate case-based learning in the physiology curriculum.\n\nMethodsThe study included 150 first-year MBBS students. We followed a mixed research design in this study. A short lecture on anemia was followed by two sessions of CBL with a gap of one week. A structured questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale was used to collect students perceptions. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was Cronbach -statistic = 0.8. Faculties feedback was collected through Focus Group Discussion (FGD).\n\nResultsOut of 145 participants, 117 responded to feedback. Students perceived that the CBL method was effective in understanding anemia topic (71%); promoted meaningful learning (83%); encouraged teamwork (69%); improved communication skills (65%); helps in future application of knowledge (81%); motivated self-directed learning (66%); helped to understand physiology concepts better (72%); leads to the development of problem-solving abilities (70%); and better student-teacher relationship (72%). Faculties suggested developing an assessment plan for future CBL sessions.\n\nConclusionIn our experience, CBL is an effective, active teaching-learning tool that improves students understanding of basic concepts, clinical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, teamwork, communication skills, student-teacher relationship, and self-directed learning.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a devastating injury to the brain that can have permanent or fatal effects, leading to life-long deficits or death. Among these effects is psychosis and schizophrenia, sometimes reported in the population of TBI sufferers. Here we evaluate a possible mechanism of post-traumatic psychosis, shedding light on the anomalous nature of psychosis as over-activity and brain injury as destruction. Using a multiscale model of the brain to relate molecular pathology to connectomic and macroscopic features of the brain, we identify cell lysis and membrane deformation as a possible mechanism for psychosis after injury. We also evaluate the reorganisation of functional networks and cortical activation post-injury, and find the features of a simulated brain under traumatic injury correlate with recorded results on the schizophrenic functional connectome. This provides a possible mechanism for post-traumatic psychosis, as well as a proof-of-principle of advanced multiscale modelling methods in computational psychiatry and neuromedicine. It also elaborates on the relationship between structure and function in the brain, information processing, and the delicate regulation of activity in healthy brains.",

    "abstract": "Overwhelming activation of T cells in acute malaria is associated with severe outcomes. Thus, counter-regulation by anti-inflammatory mechanisms is indispensable for an optimal resolution of disease. Using Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection of C57BL/6 mice, we performed a comprehensive analysis of co-inhibitory molecules expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using an unbiased cluster analysis approach. We identified similar T cell clusters co-expressing several co-inhibitory molecules like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) in the CD4+ and the CD8+ T cell compartment. Interestingly, despite expressing co-inhibitory molecules, which are associated with T cell exhaustion in chronic settings, these T cells were more functional compared to activated T cells that were negative for co-inhibitory molecules. However, T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and LAG-3 also conferred suppressive capacity and thus resembled type I regulatory T cells. To our knowledge, this is the first description of malaria-induced CD8+ T cells with suppressive capacity. Importantly, we found an induction of T cells with a similar co-inhibitory rich phenotype in Plasmodium falciparum infected patients. In conclusion, we demonstrate that malaria-induced T cells expressing co-inhibitory molecules are not exhausted, but acquire additional suppressive capacity, which might represent an immune regulatory pathway to prevent further activation of T cells during acute malaria.",

The human gut microbiota can be influenced by a variety of factors, including geography, dietary habits, living environment, age and altered lifestyle etc. This study was conducted to explore the gut microbiota compositions in officials who are in a stable working environment and train drivers who are in a dynamic working environment. Microbiota communities in the feces of 80 officials and 88 train drivers were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and ITS1 region of fungi. There were significant differences between the two groups in diversity and richness of gut microbiota, while the microbial community compositions of the two groups were similar. The relationship between gut microbiota and clinical characteristics was investigated. We found that more bacteria and fungi were positively correlated with clinical characteristics. Functional prediction analysis of the gut microbiota between the two groups by PICRUSt2 revealed significant differences between the official group and the train driver group. Elucidating these differences of the microbiome between the two groups will provide a foundation understanding of the impact of a dynamic environment on gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Actomyosin contractility generated cooperatively by nonmuscle myosin II and actin filaments plays essential roles in a wide range of biological processes, such as cell motility, cytokinesis, and tissue morphogenesis. However, it is still unknown how actomyosin contractility generates force and maintains cellular morphology. Here, we demonstrate an optogenetic method to induce relaxation of actomyosin contractility. The system, named OptoMYPT, combines a catalytic subunit of the type I phosphatase-binding domain of MYPT1 with an optogenetic dimerizer, so that it allows light-dependent recruitment of endogenous PP1c to the plasma membrane. Blue-light illumination was sufficient to induce dephosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains and decrease in traction force at the subcellular level. The OptoMYPT system was further employed to understand the mechanics of actomyosin-based cortical tension and contractile ring tension during cytokinesis. We found that the relaxation of cortical tension at both poles by OptoMYPT accelerated the furrow ingression rate, revealing that the cortical tension substantially antagonizes constriction of the cleavage furrow. Based on these results, the OptoMYPT system will provide new opportunities to understand cellular and tissue mechanics.",

We studied the effects of TPs at environmentally relevant concentrations along a wide concentration gradient (0 - 160 mg g-1) and tested the effects on plant growth, soil pH and the key ecosystem process of litter decomposition and soil respiration. The addition of TPs negatively affected shoot and root growth already at low concentrations. Tea litter decomposition slightly increased with lower additions of TPs but decreased later on. Soil pH increased until a TP concentration of 80 mg kg-1 and leveled off afterwards. Soil respiration clearly increased with increasing concentration of added TPs. Plant growth was likely reduced with starting contamination and stopped when contamination reached a certain level in the soil. The presence of TPs altered a number of biogeochemical soil parameters that can have further effects on plant performance. Considering the quantities of yearly produced TPs, their persistence, and toxic potential, we assume that these particles will eventually have a significant impact on terrestrial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades there has been an increase in conservation and restoration projects targeting Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar - AS), as populations in eastern Canada decline. Missing however, is an understanding of thermo-hydraulic habitat use by adult AS during summer, and thus the actual benefits of altering in-river physical structures. Here, we illustrated how optical and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery acquired from a UAV can be used in concert with in-situ depth and velocity data to map adult AS and develop models of thermo-hydraulic habitats in the Miramichi River, New Brunswick. We found during optimal thermal conditions (< 19 {degrees}C) proximity to boulders and Froude numbers, a non-dimensional hydraulic metric, were key parameters that characterized adult AS habitat. However, during behavioural thermoregulation events (>19 {degrees}C), proximity to the cool thermal plume and Froude number, a non-dimensional hydraulic parameter, were critical controls on habitat use. We also observed AS formed a distinct geometric formation during behavioural thermoregulation events, and term this formation a  thermal-peloton. The primary function of the peloton is undoubtedly to reduce thermally induced stressed; however, we conceptualize the geometry of the peloton attenuates hydraulic-drag, and reduces energetic expenditure of individuals practicing behavioural thermoregulation. These data provide an unrivaled viewpoint of thermo-hydraulic habitat selection by adult AS, and a blue print for restoration work. The use of UAV-based sensors has the potential to instigate a paradigm shift for river sciences. The age of applying hyper-resolution, remote sensing for river science and aquatic ecology is immensely exciting.",

    "abstract": "Ecological patterns are often fundamentally chronological. However, generalization of data is necessarily accompanied by a loss of detail or resolution. Temporal data in particular contains information not only in data values but in the temporal structure, which is lost when these values are aggregated to provide point estimates. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a time series comparison method that is capable of efficiently comparing series despite temporal offsets that confound other methods. The DTW method is both efficient and remarkably flexible, capable of efficiently matching not only time series but any sequentially structured dataset, which has made it a popular technique in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytical tasks. DTW is rarely used in ecology despite the ubiquity of temporally structured data. As technological advances have increased the richness of small-scale ecological data, DTW may be an attractive analysis technique because it is able to utilize the additional information contained in the temporal structure of many ecological datasets. In this study we use an example dataset of high-resolution fish movement records obtained from otolith microchemistry to compare traditional analysis techniques with DTW clustering. Our results suggest that DTW is capable of detecting subtle behavioral patterns within otolith datasets which traditional data aggregation techniques cannot. These results provide evidence that the DTW method may be useful across many of the temporal data types commonly collected in ecology, as well other sequentially ordered \"pseudo time series\" data such as classification of species by shape.\n\nKeywords: classification, cluster analysis, data generalization, DTW, dynamic time warping, otolith chemistry, time series",

Although studies have shown pulsed evolution is prevalent in animals, our knowledge about the tempo and mode of evolution across the tree of life is very limited. This long-standing debate calls for a test in bacteria and archaea, the most ancient and diverse forms of life with unique population genetic properties (asexual reproduction, large population sizes, short generation times, high dispersal rates and extensive lateral gene transfers). Using a likelihood-based framework, we analyzed evolutionary patterns of four microbial genomic traits (genome size, genome GC%, 16S rRNA GC% and the nitrogen use in proteins) on a broad macroevolutionary timescale. Our model fitting of phylogenetic comparative data shows that pulsed evolution is not only present, but also prevalent and predominant in microbial genomic trait evolution. Interestingly, for the first time, we detected two distinct types of pulsed evolution (small frequent and large rare jumps) that are predicted by the punctuated equilibrium and quantum evolution theories. Our findings suggest that major bacterial lineages could have originated in quick bursts and pulsed evolution is a common theme across the tree of life despite the drastically different population genetic properties of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.",

This developmental and evolutionary history constrains normal physiological functions and biases the ways in which dysfunction contributes to reproductive trait diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Here, we show that gene expression changes in the human endometrium during pregnancy are associated with the evolution of human-specific traits and pathologies of pregnancy. We found that hundreds of genes gained or lost endometrial expression in the human lineage. Among these are genes that may contribute to human-specific maternal-fetal communication (HTR2B) and maternal-fetal immunotolerance (PDCD1LG2) systems, as well as vascular remodeling and deep placental invasion (CORIN). These data suggest that explicit evolutionary studies of anatomical systems complement traditional methods for characterizing the genetic architecture of disease. We also anticipate our results will advance the emerging synthesis of evolution and medicine (\"evolutionary medicine\") and be a starting point for more sophisticated studies of the maternal-fetal interface. Furthermore, the gene expression changes we identified may contribute to the development of diagnostics and interventions for adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

Yet, their potential for reducing disease spread are poorly understood as the necessary theoretical framework for estimating epidemiological effects arising from gene editing applications is currently lacking. Here, we develop semi-stochastic modelling approaches to investigate how the adoption of gene editing may affect infectious disease prevalence in farmed animal populations and the prospects and time-scale for disease elimination. We apply our models to the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome PRRS, one of the most persistent global livestock diseases to date. Whereas extensive control efforts have shown limited success, recent production of gene-edited pigs that are fully resistant to the PRRS virus have raised expectations for eliminating this deadly disease.\n\nOur models predict that disease elimination on a national scale would be difficult to achieve if gene editing was used as the only disease control. However, when complemented with vaccination, the introduction of 10% of genetically resistant animals in a fraction of herds could be sufficient for eliminating the disease within 3-6 years. Besides strategic distribution of genetically resistant animals, several other key determinants underpinning the epidemiological impact of gene-editing were identified.",

    "abstract": "The true mahseer (Tor spp.) is one of the highest valued fish in the world due to its high nutritional value and great unique taste. Nevertheless, its morphological characterization and single mitochondrial gene phylogeny in the past had yet to resolve the ambiguity in its taxonomical classification. In this study, we sequenced and assembled 11 complete mahseer mitogenomes collected from Java of Indonesia, Pahang and Terengganu of Peninsular Malaysia as well as Sarawak of East Malaysia. The mitogenome evolutionary relationships among closely related Tor spp. samples were investigated based on maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree construction. Compared to the commonly used COX1 gene fragment, the complete COX1, Cytb, ND2, ND4 and ND5 genes appear to be better phylogenetic markers for genetic differentiation at the population level. In addition, a total of six population-specific mitolineage haplotypes were identified among the mahseer samples analyzed, which this offers hints towards its taxonomical landscape.",

    "abstract": "Non-hormonal products for on-demand contraception are a global health technology gap, motivating us to pursue the use of sperm-binding monoclonal antibodies as a strategy to enable safe, effective, desirable, on-demand contraception. Here, using cGMP-compliant Nicotiana-expression system, we produce an ultra-potent sperm-binding IgG antibody possessing 6 Fab arms per molecule that bind a well-established contraceptive antigen target, CD52g. We term this hexavalent antibody \"Fab-IgG-Fab\" (FIF) to reflect its molecular orientation. The Nicotiana-produced FIF exhibits at least 10-fold greater sperm agglutination potency and kinetics than the parent IgG, while preserving Fc-mediated trapping of individual spermatozoa in mucus. We formulate the Nicotiana-produced FIF into a polyvinyl alcohol-based water-soluble contraceptive film, and evaluate its potency in reducing progressively motile sperm in the sheep vagina. Two minutes after vaginal instillation of human semen, no progressively motile sperm are recovered from the vaginas of sheep receiving FIF-Film. In contrast, high numbers of progressively motile sperm are recovered from sheep receiving a placebo film control. Our work supports the potential of highly multivalent contraceptive antibodies to provide safe, effective, on-demand non-hormonal contraception.",

    "abstract": "As single-cell datasets grow in sample size, there is a critical need to characterize cell states that vary across samples and associate with sample attributes like clinical phenotypes. Current statistical approaches typically map cells to cell-type clusters and examine sample differences through that lens alone. Here we present covarying neighborhood analysis (CNA), an unbiased method to identify cell populations of interest with greater flexibility and granularity. CNA characterizes dominant axes of variation across samples by identifying groups of very small regions in transcriptional space--termed neighborhoods--that covary in abundance across samples, suggesting shared function or regulation. CNA can then rigorously test for associations between any sample-level attribute and the abundances of these covarying neighborhood groups. We show in simulation that CNA enables more powerful and accurate identification of disease-associated cell states than a cluster-based approach. When applied to published datasets, CNA captures a Notch activation signature in rheumatoid arthritis, redefines monocyte populations expanded in sepsis, and identifies a previously undiscovered T-cell population associated with progression to active tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-coated structures must assemble on cell membranes to perform their primary function of receptor internalization. These structures show marked plasticity and instability, but what conditions are necessary to stabilize against disassembly have not been quantified. Recent in vitro fluorescence experiments have measured kinetics of stable clathrin assembly on membranes as controlled by key adaptor proteins like AP-2. Here, we combine this experimental data with microscopic reaction-diffusion simulations and theory to quantify mechanisms of stable vs unstable clathrin assembly on membranes. Both adaptor binding and dimensional reduction on the 2D surface are necessary to reproduce the cooperative kinetics of assembly. By applying our model to more physiologic-like conditions, where the stoichiometry and volume to area ratio are significantly lower than in vitro, we show that the critical nucleus contains ~25 clathrin, remarkably similar to sizes of abortive structures observed in vivo. Stable nucleation requires a stoichiometry of adaptor to clathrin that exceeds 1:1, meaning that AP-2 on its own has too few copies to nucleate lattices. Increasing adaptor concentration increases lattice sizes and nucleation speeds. For curved clathrin cages, we quantify both the cost of bending the membrane and the stabilization required to nucleate cages in solution. We find the energetics are comparable, suggesting that curving the lattice could offset the bending energy cost. Our model predicts how adaptor density controls stabilization of clathrin-coated structures against spontaneous disassembly, and shows remodeling and disassembly does not require ATPases, which is a critical advance towards predicting control of productive vesicle formation.\n\nSignificance StatementStochastic self-assembly of clathrin-coated structures on the plasma membrane is essential for transport into cells. We show here that even with abundant clathrin available, robust nucleation and growth into stable structures on membranes is not possible without sufficient adaptor proteins. Our results thus provide quantitative justification for why structures observed to form in vivo can still spontaneously disassemble over many seconds. The ATPases that drive clathrin disassembly after productive vesicle formation are therefore not necessary to control remodeling during growth. With parameterization against in vitro kinetics of assembly on membranes, our reaction-diffusion model provides a powerful and extensible tool for establishing determinants of productive assembly in cells.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to dog associated human rabies cases decline year by year due to the rabies vaccination coverage rates increase in China, ferret badger (FB, Melogale moschata)-associated human rabies cases emerged in the 1990s, and are now an increasingly recognized problem in southeast China. To investigate epidemiology, temporal evolution dynamics, transmission characterization and pathogenicity of FB-associated rabies viruses (RABVs), from 2008 to 2018, we collected 3,622 FB brain samples in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Province, and detected 112 RABV isolates. Four FB-related lineages were identified by phylogenetic analysis (lineages A-D), the estimated Times to Most Recent Common Ancestor were 1941, 1990, 1937 and 1997 for lineages A-D respectively. Furthermore, although no FB-associated human rabies case has been reported there apart from Wuyuan area, FB-RABV isolates are mainly distributed in Jiangxi Province. Pathogenicity of FB-RABVs was assessed using peripheral inoculation in mice and in beagles with masseter muscles, mortality-rates ranging from 20% to 100% in mice and 0 to 20% in beagles in the groups infected with the various isolates. Screening of sera from humans with FB bites and no postexposure prophylaxis to rabies, revealed that 5 of 9 were positive for neutralizing antibodies of RABV. All the results above indicated that FB-RABV variants caused a lesser pathogenicity in mice, beagles and even humans. Vaccination in mice suggests that inactivated vaccine or recombinant subunit vaccine products can be used to control FB- associated rabies, however, oral vaccines for stray dogs and wildlife need to be developed and licensed in China urgently.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn recent years FB-associated rabies virus has been identified as a major life-threatening pathogen in some districts in China. To understand the risk to public health and the contemporary dynamics, the present study conducted extensive investigations on FB rabies, distribution, virus isolation, phylogeny analysis, pathogenicity determination of various FB rabies virus strains, besides, serologic epidemiology survey to those whom bit by FB was also collected. The results show that the majority of FBs dwell in southeast China, like Jiangxi and Zhejiang Province, Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all isolated FB RABVs evolved from dogs, and the FB RABV can separate into 4 distinct lineages distributed relatively independent in different areas. The isolate strains differ in pathogenicity, although they have relatively lower pathogenicity compared to dog rabies virus according to our study, the need for further study to licensed oral vaccines and FB RABV pathogenesis is emphasized in order to control rabies.",

Under the assumption that annual plants grow to maximize fitness, we can use techniques from optimal control theory to understand this process. We introduce a model for resource allocation in annual plants which extends classical work by Iwasa and Roughgarden to a case where both carbohydrates and mineral nutrients are allocated to shoots, roots, and fruits in annual plants. We use optimal control theory to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy for the plant throughout its growing season as well as develop a numerical scheme to implement the model in MATLAB. Our results suggest that what is optimal for an individual plant is highly dependent on initial conditions, and optimal growth has the effect of driving a wide range of initial conditions toward common configurations of biomass by the end of a growing season.",

We performed silicon probe population recordings of neuronal activity in V1 during task performance and showed that task context (whether the animal should base its decision on visual or auditory stimuli) can be decoded during both intertrial intervals and stimulus presentations. Context and visual stimuli were represented in overlapping populations but were orthogonal in the population activity space. Context representation was not static but displayed distinctive dynamics upon stimulus onset and offset. Thus, activity patterns in V1 independently represent visual stimuli and cognitive variables relevant to task execution.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAMPH and METH are known to increase DAergic signaling in the brain reward system by stimulating the release of DA through the reversal of DAT function. However, there is evidence that insulin signaling pathways have the ability to modulate DAT functions. Some studies have reported that hypoinsulinemia attenuates DAT functions, and as a consequence, psychostimulant-induced behaviors are reduced. In the present study, we examined the effects of acute food deprivation, which also reduces insulin levels, on METH-induced locomotor sensitization.\n\nMETHODSSeparate groups of rats were treated with METH (1 mg/kg i.p.) or saline for 5 days (development phase). On the test day (expression phase), the groups were treated with METH or saline after food deprivation for 24 h. Furthermore, in separate groups of rats, levels of glucose, insulin, and phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 were also examined after food deprivation for 24 h.\n\nRESULTSThe results showed that repeated administration of METH induced a progressive increase in locomotor activity in rats during the development phase. However, METH administration in the expression phase produced a decrease in locomotor activity after 24 h of food deprivation. In addition, the results showed that a reduction in glucose, insulin, and Akt levels occurred as a result of food deprivation.\n\nCONCLUSIONThese results are in line with previous studies and suggest that food deprivation reduces some behavioral effects of psychostimulants such as AMPH and METH.\n\nHighlightsAdministration of METH increases DAergic neurotransmission by interfering with proper DA transporter (DAT) function\n\nSome evidence suggests that insulin signaling pathways modulate the DAT in the brain reward system\n\nAcute food deprivation reduces glucose and insulin levels\n\nThis study examined the effects of acute food deprivation on METH-induced locomotor sensitization\n\nPresent study showed that food deprivation for 24 h reduced METH-induced locomotor sensitization\n\nPlain Language SummaryThe dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for the reuptake of dopamine (DA) and the termination of DA neurotransmission. DAT is also the target for psychostimulant drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. These drugs produce an increase of DA neurotransmission in the reward system. It is now well established that insulin levels modulate DAT function. Several studies have reported that hypoinsulinemia attenuates DAT function, and as a consequence, psychostimulant-induced behaviors are reduced. Food deprivation reduces glucose and insulin levels. In the present study we evaluated the effects of food deprivation on methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization. This behavior reflects brain neuroadaptations that contribute to drug addiction. Rats of the main experimental group were treated with methamphetamine for 5 days (development phase). On the test day (expression phase) the rats were treated with methamphetamine after food deprivation for 24 h. In separated groups of rats levels of glucose and insulin were evaluated after food deprivation for 24 h. The results showed that acute food deprivation reduced methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization. It was also observed that insulin and glucose levels were reduced after food deprivation. The results of the present study suggest that food deprivation can modulate some behavioral effects of methamphetamine.",

    "abstract": "Social isolation is a growing concern in public health. Although isolation at any age is harmful, previous studies have shown that isolation during adolescence, correlating with critical periods of brain development, can impair cognitive function and increase the risk for psychiatric illness later in life. In this study, we utilized a mouse model of adolescent social isolation (SI) and compared performance of isolated and group-housed mice on touchscreen-based continuous performance test (CPT) and fixed ratio/progressive ratio (FR/PR) tasks in adulthood. SI increased sensitivity in the CPT in male mice and had no effect in female mice. The increase in sensitivity was consistent across time bins within the 45-minute testing session and there were no SI effects on reaction times or reward retrieval latencies. A possible confound for performance in the CPT would be SI-induced changes in reward-seeking or motivation for the strawberry milk reward. We next compared the SI mice to their group-housed littermate controls on both FR and PR schedules of reinforcement and found that male SI mice earned significantly more reinforcers on FR schedules of reinforcement and had higher breakpoints on PR schedules compared to their group-housed littermates. SI had no effect on FR or PR performance in female mice. These data indicate that SI during adolescence has striking, sex-specific effects on reward-seeking behavior in adult mice and may provide a useful behavioral model for studying the link between SI and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Once activated by Cdc25, that reverses inhibitory phosphorylation operated by Wee1/Myt1, Cdk1 clears the cytoplasm from microtubules by inhibiting microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) with microtubule growth-promoting properties. Nevertheless, some of these MAPs are required for spindle assembly, creating quite a conundrum. We show here that a Cdk1 fraction bound to spindle structures escaped Cdc25 action and remained inhibited by phosphorylation (i-Cdk1) in mitotic human cells. Loss or restoration of i-Cdk1 inhibited or promoted spindle assembly, respectively. Furthermore, polymerizing spindle microtubules fostered i-Cdk1 by aggregating with Wee1 and excluding Cdc25. Our data reveal that spindle assembly relies on compartmentalized control of Cdk1 activity.",

We investigated patterns of diversification, phylogenetic relationships, and biogeography, and determined the age of the lineage using 43 nuclear gene loci. We also assessed the current taxonomic circumscription of the ca. 285 species by developing a phylogenetic taxonomic bootstrap method. Penstemon originated during the Pliocene/Pleistocene transition. Patterns of diversification and biogeography are associated with glaciation cycles during the Pleistocene, with the bulk of diversification occurring from 1.0-0.5 mya. The radiation across the North American continent tracks the advance and retreat of major and minor glaciation cycles during the past 2.5 million years with founder-event speciation contributing the most to diversification of Penstemon. Our taxonomic bootstrap analyses suggest the current circumscription of the genus is in need of revision. We propose rearrangement of subgenera, sections, and subsections based on our phylogenetic results. Given the young age and broad distribution of Penstemon across North America, it offers an excellent system for studying a rapid evolutionary radiation in a continental setting.",

Rare variants in TM2D3 are associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) and its fly ortholog almondex is required for embryonic Notch signaling. However, the functions of this gene family remain elusive. We knocked-out all three TM2D genes (almondex, CG11103/amaretto, CG10795/biscotti) in Drosophila and found that they share the same maternal-effect neurogenic defect. Triple null animals are not phenotypically worse than single nulls, suggesting these genes function together. Overexpression of the most conserved region of the TM2D proteins acts as a potent inhibitor of Notch signaling at the {gamma}-secretase cleavage step. Lastly, Almondex is detected in the brain and its loss causes shortened lifespan accompanied by progressive electrophysiological defects. The functional links between all three TM2D genes are likely to be evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that this entire gene family may be involved in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is controlled by cis-regulatory elements recognized by networks of trans-acting factors. Here we investigate modes and mechanisms of AS co-regulation by MBNL1 and RBFOX1, two RNA binding proteins (RBPs) critical for developmental AS transitions. We generated two cell models that express each RBP under separate inducible promoters. Transcriptome-wide categorization of the impacts of RBFOX1 expression on MBNL1 splicing revealed a common co-regulatory mode through which RBFOX1 buffers MBNL1 dose-dependent splicing regulation by reducing the total range of exon inclusion or exclusion. Minigene mutational analysis and in vitro binding experiments suggest that this buffering mechanism occurs through a shared cis-regulatory element previously unidentified as critical for MBNL1-dependent activity. Overall, our studies define a conserved co-regulatory mechanism through which RBFOX1 and MBNL1 can fine-tune and provide redundancy for AS outcomes. These studies indicate overlapping use of RNA motifs with potential implications for when activity of RBPs is disrupted.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis by the ribosome is coordinated by an intricate series of large-scale conformational rearrangements. Structural studies can provide information about long-lived states, however biological kinetics are controlled by the intervening free-energy barriers. While there has been progress describing the energy landscapes of bacterial ribosomes, very little is known about the energetics of large-scale rearrangements in eukaryotic systems. To address this topic, we constructed an all-atom model with simplified energetics and performed simulations of subunit rotation in the yeast ribosome. In these simulations, the small subunit (SSU; ~1MDa) undergoes spontaneous and reversible rotations (~ 8{degrees}). By enabling the simulation of this rearrangement under equilibrium conditions, these calculations provide initial insights into the molecular factors that control dynamics in eukaryotic ribosomes. Through this, we are able to identify specific inter-subunit interactions that have a pronounced influence on the rate-limiting free-energy barrier. We also show that, as a result of changes in molecular flexibility, the thermodynamic balance between the rotated and unrotated states is temperature-dependent. This effect may be interpreted in terms of differential molecular flexibility within the rotated and unrotated states. Together, these calculations provide a foundation, upon which the field may begin to dissect the energetics of these complex molecular machines.",

    "abstract": "Disease heterogeneity is a significant obstacle to understanding pathological processes and delivering precision diagnostics and treatment. Clustering methods have gained popularity for stratifying patients into subpopulations (i.e., subtypes) of brain diseases using imaging data. However, unsupervised clustering approaches are often confounded by anatomical and functional variations not related to a disease or pathology of interest. Semi-supervised clustering techniques have been proposed to overcome this and, therefore, capture disease-specific patterns more effectively. An additional limitation of both unsupervised and semi-supervised conventional machine learning methods is that they typically model, learn and infer from data using a basis of feature sets pre-defined at a fixed anatomical or functional scale (e.g., atlas-based regions of interest). Herein we propose a novel method, \"Multi-scAle heteroGeneity analysIs and Clustering\" (MAGIC), to depict the multi-scale presentation of disease heterogeneity, which builds on a previously proposed semi-supervised clustering method, HYDRA. It derives multi-scale and clinically interpretable feature representations and exploits a double-cyclic optimization procedure to effectively drive identification of inter-scale-consistent disease subtypes. More importantly, to understand the conditions under which the clustering model can estimate true heterogeneity related to diseases, we conducted extensive and systematic semi-simulated experiments to evaluate the proposed method on a sizeable healthy control sample from the UK Biobank (N=4403). We then applied MAGIC to imaging data from Alzheimers disease (ADNI, N=1728) and schizophrenia (PHENOM, N=1166) patients to demonstrate its potential and challenges in dissecting the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of common brain diseases. Taken together, we aim to provide guidance regarding when such analyses can succeed or should be taken with caution. The code of the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/anbai106/MAGIC.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe propose a novel multi-scale semi-supervised clustering method, termed MAGIC, to disentangle the heterogeneity of brain diseases.\nC_LIO_LIWe perform extensive semi-simulated experiments on large control samples (UK Biobank, N=4403) to precisely quantify performance under various conditions, including varying degrees of brain atrophy, different levels of heterogeneity, overlapping disease subtypes, class imbalance, and varying sample sizes.\nC_LIO_LIWe apply MAGIC to MCI and Alzheimers disease (ADNI, N=1728) and schizophrenia (PHENOM, N=1166) patients to dissect their neuroanatomical heterogeneity, providing guidance regarding the use of the semi-simulated experiments to validate the subtypes found in actual clinical applications.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/440501v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2769e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19a691borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6a9264org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0e686_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In this vein, we propose the idea of sentinel cells, cellular biosensors capable of detecting viral antigens and responding to them with customizable responses. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a test case, we developed a live cell sensor (SARSNotch) using a de novo-designed protein binder against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. SARSNotch is capable of driving custom genetically-encoded payloads in immortalized cell lines or in primary T lymphocytes in response to purified SARS-CoV-2 Spike or in the presence of Spike-expressing cells. Furthermore, SARSNotch is functional in a cellular system used in directed evolution platforms for development of better binders or therapeutics. In keeping with the rapid dissemination of scientific knowledge that has characterized the incredible scientific response to the ongoing pandemic, we extend an open invitation for others to make use of and improve SARSNotch sentinel cells in the hopes of unlocking the potential of the next generation of smart antiviral therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Carbon isotope biosignatures preserved in the Precambrian geologic record are primarily interpreted to reflect ancient cyanobacterial carbon fixation catalyzed by Form I RuBisCO enzymes. The average range of isotopic biosignatures generally follows that produced by extant cyanobacteria. However, this observation is difficult to reconcile with several environmental (e.g., temperature, pH, and CO2 concentrations), molecular, and physiological factors that likely would have differed during the Precambrian and can produce fractionation variability in contemporary organisms that meets or exceeds that observed in the geologic record. To test a range of genetic and environmental factors that may have impacted ancient carbon isotope biosignatures, we engineered a mutant strain of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 that overexpresses RuBisCO and characterized the resultant physiological and isotope fractionation effects. We specifically investigated how both increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and RuBisCO regulation influence cell growth, oxygen evolution rate, and carbon isotope fractionation in cyanobacteria. We found that elevated CO2 increases the growth rate of wild-type and mutant strains, and that the pool of active RuBisCO enzyme increases with increased expression. RuBisCO overexpression in our engineered strain does not significantly affect isotopic discrimination at all tested CO2 concentrations, yielding cellular 13C/12C isotope discrimination ({varepsilon}p) of [~]24{per thousand} for both wild-type and mutant strains at elevated CO2. Understanding the environmental factors that impact gene regulation, physiology, and evolution is crucial for reconciling microbially driven carbon isotope fractionation with the geologic record carbon biosignatures.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia infections are a fascinating example of reproductive parasitism with strong potential to combat vector-borne diseases, due to their combined ability to spread in insect populations and block pathogen replication. Though the Wolbachia factors mediating the notable reproductive manipulation cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) have now been identified as prophage WO genes cifA and cifB, the relative role of these genes is still intensely debated, with different models claiming that CI requires either both factors or cifB alone. Here we investigated whether cifA and cifB are sufficient to induce conditional sterility in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, a species that appears to have limited susceptibility to invasion by Wolbachia. We report that CI can be fully recapitulated in these mosquitoes, and that cifB is sufficient to cause this reproductive manipulation. cifB-induced sterility is fully rescued by high levels of cifA expression in females. Surprisingly, however, when cifA is highly expressed in males alongside cifB, the CI phenotype is attenuated. cifB strongly impairs fertility also when expressed in the female germline, again mitigated by cifA. These data support a system whereby cifB and cifA must be fine-tuned to exercise CI and rescue, respectively, possibly explaining the limited success of Wolbachia at invading Anopheles. Our findings pave the way towards facilitating Wolbachia infections in anopheline vectors, for use in malaria control strategies.",

Rhamnose is a deoxyhexose sugar abundant in a range of environments including the human intestine, and can be degraded in anaerobic conditions into 1,2-propanediol, next to acetate and lactate. Rhamnose-derived 1,2-propanediol has been found to link with BMCs in a limited number of commensal human colonic species and some human pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, but the involvement of BMCs in rhamnose metabolism and potential physiological effects on L. monocytogenes are still unknown. In this study, we firstly test the effect of rhamnose uptake and utilization on anaerobic growth of L. monocytogenes EGDe without and with added vitamin B12, followed by metabolic analysis. We unveil that the vitamin B12-dependent activation of pdu stimulates metabolism and anaerobic growth of L. monocytogenes EGDe on rhamnose via 1,2-propanediol degradation into 1-propanol and propionate. Transmission electron microscopy of pdu-induced cells shows that BMCs are formed and additional proteomics experiments confirm expression of pdu BMC shell proteins and enzymes.

We had previously shown that HlyF encoded by a large virulence plasmid harbored by pathogenic E. coli is not a hemolysin but a cytoplasmic enzyme leading to the overproduction of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Here, we show that these specific OMVs inhibit the autophagic flux by impairing the autophagosome - lysosome fusion, thus preventing the formation of acidic autophagolysosome and autophagosome clearance. Furthermore, HlyF-associated OMVs are more prone to activate the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Since autophagy and inflammation are crucial in the hosts response to infection especially during sepsis, our findings reveal an unsuspected role of OMVs in the crosstalk between bacteria and their host, highlighting the fact that these extracellular vesicles have exacerbated pathogenic properties.",

    "abstract": "Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is an emerging poxviral pathogen of cattle that is currently spreading throughout Asia. The disease situation is of high importance for farmers and policy makers in Asia. In October 2020, feral cattle in Hong Kong developed multifocal cutaneous nodules consistent with lumpy skin disease (LSD). Gross and histological pathology further supported the diagnosis and samples were sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory at The Pirbright Institute for confirmatory testing. LSDV was detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and additional molecular analyses. This is the first report of LSD in Hong Kong. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the strain LSDV/HongKong/2020 and phylogenetic analysis were carried out in order to identify connections to previous outbreaks of LSD, and better understand the drivers of LSDV emergence. Analysis of the 90 core poxvirus genes revealed LSDV/HongKong/2020 was a novel strain most closely related to the live-attenuated Neethling vaccine strains of LSDV and more distantly related to wildtype LSDV isolates from Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Analysis of the more variable regions located towards the termini of the poxvirus genome revealed genes in LSDV/HongKong/2020 with different patterns of grouping when compared to previously published wildtype and vaccine strains of LSDV. This work reveals that the LSD outbreak in Hong Kong in 2020 was caused by a different strain of LSDV than the LSD epidemic in the Middle East and Europe in 2015-2018. The use of WGS is highly recommended when investigating LSDV disease outbreaks.",

One promising candidate, obatoclax, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral lung load in mice. Ultimately, this work establishes a rigorous approach for future pharmacological and computational identification of novel host factor dependencies and treatments for viral diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although gene editing workflows typically consider the possibility of off-target editing, pseudogene-directed homology repair has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously. Here, we employed a CRISPR-Cas9 strategy for targeted excision of exon 2 in CD33 in U937 human monocyte cell line. Candidate clonal cell lines were screened by using a clinically relevant antibody known to label the IgV domain encoded by exon 2 (P67.6, gemtuzumab). In addition to the anticipated deletion of exon 2, we also found unexpected P67.6-negative cell lines which had apparently retained CD33 exon 2. Sequencing revealed that these lines underwent gene conversion from the nearby SIGLEC22P pseudogene during homology repair that resulted in three missense mutations relative to CD33. Ectopic expression studies confirmed that the P67.6 epitope is dependent upon these amino acids. In summation, we report that pseudogene-directed homology repair can lead to aberrant CRISPR gene editing.",

    "abstract": "For a better understanding of the evolution of antibiotic resistance, it is imperative to study the factors that determine the initial establishment of mutant resistance alleles. In addition to the antibiotic concentration, the establishment of resistance alleles may be affected by interactions with the surrounding susceptible cells from which they derive, for instance via the release of nutrients or removal of the antibiotic. Here, we investigate the effects of social interactions with surrounding susceptible cells on the establishment of Escherichia coli mutants with increasing {beta}-lactamase activity (i.e. the capacity to hydrolyze {beta}-lactam antibiotics) from single cells under the exposure of the antibiotic cefotaxime on agar plates. We find that mutant establishment probability is increased in the presence of susceptible cells due to the active breakdown of the antibiotic, but the rate of breakdown by the susceptible strain is much higher than expected based on its low enzymatic activity. A detailed theoretical model suggests that this observation can be explained by cell filamentation causing delayed lysis. While susceptible cells may hamper the spread of higher-resistant {beta}-lactamase mutants at relatively high frequencies, our findings show that they could promote establishment during their emergence.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor RUNX2 is a key regulator of chondrocyte phenotype during development, making it an ideal target for prevention of undesirable chondrocyte maturation in cartilage tissue engineering strategies. Here, we engineered an autoregulatory gene circuit (cisCXp-shRunx2) that negatively controls RUNX2 activity in chondrogenic cells via RNA interference initiated by a tunable synthetic Col10a1-like promoter (cisCXp). The cisCXp-shRunx2 gene circuit is designed based on the observation that induced RUNX2 silencing after early chondrogenesis enhances the accumulation of cartilaginous matrix in ATDC5 cells. We show that the cisCXp-shRunx2 initiates RNAi of RUNX2 in maturing chondrocytes in response to the increasing intracellular RUNX2 activity without interfering with early chondrogenesis. The induced loss of RUNX2 activity in turn negatively regulates the gene circuit itself. Moreover, the efficacy of RUNX2 suppression from cisCXp-shRunx2 can be controlled by modifying the sensitivity of cisCXp promoter. Finally, we show the efficacy of inhibiting RUNX2 in preventing matrix loss in human MSC-derived cartilage under conditions that induce chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation, including inflammation. Overall, our results demonstrated that the negative modulation of RUNX2 activity with our autoregulatory gene circuit enhanced matrix synthesis and resists ECM degradation by reprogrammed MSC-derived chondrocytes in response to the microenvironment of the degenerative joint.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful tool for producing genomic insertions and deletions (indels) to interrogate gene function. Modified CRISPR/Cas9 protocols can produce targeted genetic changes that are more precise than indels, but founder recovery is less efficient. Focusing on producing missense mutations in zebrafish using single-stranded oligo deoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor templates, we pioneered a strategy of adding synonymous changes to create novel restriction-enzyme (RE) sites, allowing detection of rare precise edits in a modified fluorescent-PCR fragment assay. We have named this process TIARS (test for incorporation of added recognition sites). Aided by TIARS, we induced two distinct amino-acid substitutions (T979I and P1387S) in the atp7a gene among somatic tissues of CRISPR-Cas9-treated F0 zebrafish. One of these F0s transmitted the allele to atp7aT979I/+ F1 progeny, and trans-heterozygosity of this allele against a null atp7a allele causes hypopigmentation, consistent with more severe pigment deficits in zebrafish or humans carrying only null mutations in atp7a/ATP7A. Design of ssODNs with novel RE recognition sites is labor-intensive, so we developed an in silico tool, TIARS Designer, and performed bioinformatic validation indicating that TIARS should be generalizable to other genes and experimental systems that employ donor template DNA.",

The fatty acid hydroxylase mutant fah1 fah2 exhibits high ceramide levels and moderately elevated LCB levels. Salicylic acid (SA) is strongly induced in these mutants, but no cell death is visible. To determine the effect of ceramides with different chain lengths, fah1 fah2 was crossed with ceramide synthase mutants longevity assurance gene one homologue1-3 (loh1, loh2 and loh3). Surprisingly, only triple mutants with loh2 show a cell death phenotype under the selected conditions. Sphingolipid profiling revealed that the greatest differences between the triple mutant plants are in the LCB and LCB-phosphate (LCB-P) fraction. fah1 fah2 loh2 plants accumulate LCB d18:0 and LCB-P d18:0. Crossing fah1 fah2 loh2 with the SA synthesis mutant sid2-2, and with the SA signaling mutants enhanced disease susceptibility 1-2 (eds1-2) and phytoalexin deficient 4-1 (pad4-1), revealed that lesions are SA- and EDS1-dependent. These quadruple mutants also suggest that there may be a feedback loop between SA and sphingolipid metabolism as they accumulated less ceramides and LCBs. In conclusion, PCD in fah1 fah2 loh2 is a SA and EDS1-dependent phenotype, which is likely due to accumulation of LCB d18:0.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe carbohydrate polymers that encapsulate plants cells have benefited humans for centuries and have valuable biotechnological uses. In the past five years, exciting possibilities have emerged in the engineering of polysaccharide-based biomaterials. Despite impressive advances on bacterial cellulose-based hydrogels, comparatively little is known about how plant hemicelluloses can be reconstituted and modulated in cells suitable for biotechnological purposes.\n\nResultsHere, we assembled cellulose synthase-like A (CSLA) enzymes using an optimized Pichia pastoris platform to produce tunable heteromannan (HM) polysaccharides in yeast. By swapping the domains of plant mannan and glucomannan synthases, we engineered chimeric CSLA proteins that made {beta}-1,4-linked mannan in quantities surpassing those of the native enzymes while minimizing the burden on yeast growth. Prolonged expression of a glucomannan synthase from Amorphophallus konjac was toxic to yeast cells: reducing biomass accumulation and ultimately leading to compromised cell viability. However, an engineered glucomannan synthase as well as CSLA pure mannan synthases and a CSLC glucan synthase did not inhibit growth. Interestingly, Pichia cell size could be increased or decreased depending on the composition of the CSLA protein sequence. HM yield and glucose incorporation could be further increased by co-expressing chimeric CSLA proteins with a MANNAN-SYNTHESIS-RELATED (MSR) co-factor from Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nConclusionThe results provide novel routes for the engineering of polysaccharide-based biomaterials that are needed for a sustainable bioeconomy. The characterization of chimeric cellulose synthase-like enzymes in yeast offers an exciting avenue to produce plant polysaccharides in a tunable manner. Furthermore, cells modified with non-toxic plant polysaccharides such as {beta}-mannan offer a modular chassis to produce and encapsulate sensitive cargo such as therapeutic proteins.",

    "abstract": "Protein flexibility remains a major challenge in library docking due to difficulties in sampling conformational ensembles with accurate probabilities. Here we use the model cavity site of T4 Lysozyme L99A to test flexible receptor docking with energy penalties from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Crystallography with larger and smaller ligands indicates that this cavity can adopt three major conformations, open, intermediate, and closed. Since smaller ligands typically bind better to the cavity site, we anticipate an energy penalty for cavity opening. To estimate its magnitude, we calculate conformational preferences from MD simulations. We find that including a penalty term is essential for retrospective ligand enrichment, otherwise high-energy states dominate the docking. We then prospectively docked a library of over 900,000 compounds for new molecules binding to each conformational state. Absent a penalty term, the open conformation dominated the docking results; inclusion of this term led to a balanced sampling of ligands against each state. High ranked molecules were experimentally tested by Tm-upshift and X-ray crystallography. From 33 selected molecules, we identified 18 new ligands and determined 13 crystal structures. Most interesting were those bound to the open cavity, where the buried site opens to bulk solvent. Here, highly unusual ligands for this cavity had been predicted, including large ligands with polar tails; these were confirmed both by binding and by crystallography. In docking, incorporating protein flexibility with thermodynamic weightings may thus access new ligand chemotypes. The MD approach to accessing and, crucially, weighting such alternative states may find general applicability.\n\nSignificance StatementThe dynamic nature of biomolecules is typically neglected in docking screens for ligand discovery. Key to benefitting from various receptor conformations is not only structural but also thermodynamic information. Here we test a general approach that uses conformational preferences from enhanced and conventional MD simulations to account for the cost of transitions to high energy states. Including this information as a conformational penalty term in a docking scoring function, we perform retrospective and prospective screens and experimentally confirm novel ligands with Tm-upshift and X-ray crystallography.",

    "abstract": "Nanopores comprise a versatile class of membrane proteins that carry out a range of key physiological functions and are increasingly developed for different biotechnological applications. Yet, a capacity to study and engineer protein nanopores by combinatorial means has so far been hampered by a lack of suitable assays that combine sufficient experimental resolution with throughput. Addressing this technological gap, the Functional Nanopore (FuN) screen now provides a quantitative and dynamic read-out of nanopore assembly and function in E. coli. The assay is based on genetically-encoded fluorescent protein sensors that resolve the nanopore-dependent influx of Ca2+ across the inner membrane of E. coli. Illustrating its versatile capacity, the FuN screen is first applied to dissect the molecular features that underlie the assembly and stability of nanopores formed by the S2168 holin. In a subsequent step, nanopores are engineered by recombining the transmembrane module of S2168 with different ring-shaped oligomeric protein structures that feature defined hexa-, hepta- and octameric geometries. Library screening highlights substantial plasticity in the ability of the S2168 transmembrane module to oligomerize in alternative geometries while the functional properties of the resultant nanopores can be fine-tuned through the identity of the connecting linkers. Overall, the FuN screen is anticipated to facilitate both fundamental studies and complex nanopore engineering endeavors with many potential applications in biomedicine, biotechnology and synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "The interrelatedness of human blood innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets, and how they are perturbed by HIV-1, remains unclear. Transcriptional and chromatin profiling separated blood ILCs into ILC2s, ILCPs, one cluster that included CD56dim and CD56-NK cells, and CD56hiNK cells that have features of both CD56dim/-NK cells and ILCs. In contrast to mice, human NK cells expressed tissue repair protein amphiregulin (AREG), with greater production by CD56hiNK cells than by ILCs. AREG was induced by TCF7/WNT signaling, IL-2, or IL-15, but not by inflammatory cytokines, and was inhibited by TGFB1, a cytokine elevated in people living with HIV-1. NK cell knockout of the TGFB1-stimulated WNT antagonist RUNX3 increased AREG production. In people living with HIV-1, AREG+NK cell percentage correlated with numbers of ILCs and CD4+T cells, and correlated inversely with inflammatory cytokine IL-6. RNA-Seq showed increased antiviral gene expression in all ILC subsets from people who were HIV-1 viremic, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory gene MYDGF in CD56hiNK cells from elite controllers. Functionally-defective CD56-NK cells were increased in people living with HIV-1 in inverse correlation with CD56dimNK cells, ILCs, and CD4+T cells. Experiments with human PBMCs ex vivo and in humanized mice revealed that CD4+T cells and their production of IL-2 prevented CD56dim transition to CD56-NK cells by activating mTOR, and, in people living with HIV-1, plasma IL-2 correlated with CD4+T cell number but not with CD8+T cells. These studies clarify how ILC subsets are interrelated and provide insight into how HIV-1 infection disrupts NK cells, including homeostatic functions of NK cells discovered here.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/440368v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d6be2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@115f0e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b1a28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f262e9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Bamfordviruses are arguably the most diverse group of viruses infecting eukaryotes. They include the Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), virophages, adenoviruses, Mavericks and Polinton-like viruses. Two main hypotheses for their origins have been proposed: the \"nuclear-escape\" and \"virophage-first\" hypotheses. The \"nuclear-escape\" hypothesis proposes an endogenous, Maverick-like ancestor which escaped from the nucleus and gave rise to adenoviruses and NCLDVs. In contrast, the \"virophage-first\" hypothesis proposes that NCLDVs coevolved with protovirophages; Mavericks then evolved from virophages that became endogenous, with adenoviruses escaping from the nucleus at a later stage. Here, we test the predictions made by both models and consider alternative evolutionary scenarios. We use a data set of the four core virion proteins sampled across the diversity of the lineage, together with Bayesian and maximum-likelihood hypothesis-testing methods, and estimate rooted phylogenies. We find strong evidence that adenoviruses and NCLDVs are not sister groups, and that Mavericks and Mavirus acquired the rve-integrase independently. We also found strong support for a monophyletic group of virophages (family Lavidaviridae) and a most likely root placed between virophages and the other lineages. Our observations support alternatives to the nuclear-escape scenario and a billion years evolutionary arms-race between virophages and NCLDVs.",

Understanding plant-microbe interactions will inform microbiome management to enhance crop productivity and resilience to stress. Here, we apply a genome-centric approach to identify key leaf microbiome members on field-grown switchgrass and miscanthus, and quantify their activities for switchgrass over two growing seasons. We integrate metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing from 192 leaf samples collected over key time points in crop phenology. We curated 40 focal metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) and conservatively focus analysis on transcript recruitment to medium and high-quality MAGs that were <10% contaminated and >50% complete. Classes represented by these MAGs (Actinomycetia, Alpha- and Gamma-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidota) were active and had seasonal dynamics in key functions, including enrichments in transcripts for of short chain dehydrogenase, molybdopterin oxioreductase, and polyketide cyclase in the late season. The majority of MAGs had activated stress-associated pathways, including trehalose metabolism, indole acetic acid degradation, betaine biosynthesis, and reactive oxygen species degradation, suggesting direct engagement with the host environment. We also detected seasonally activated biosynthetic pathways for terpenes (carotenoid and isoprenoids), and for various non-ribosomal peptide pathways that were poorly annotated. Overall, this study overcame laboratory and bioinformatic challenges associated with field-based leaf metatranscriptome analysis to inform potential key activities of these phyllosphere populations. These activities collectively support that leaf-associated bacterial populations are seasonally dynamic, responsive to host cues and interactively engage in feedbacks with the plant.",

    "abstract": "Thermophilic Methanothermobacter spp. are used as model microbes to study the physiology and biochemistry of the conversion of hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane (i.e., hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis), because of their short doubling times and robust growth with high growth yields. Yet, a genetic system for these model microbes was missing despite intense work for four decades. Here, we report the establishment of tools for genetic modification of M. thermautotrophicus. We developed the modular Methanothermobacter vector system, which provided shuttle-vector plasmids (pMVS) with exchangeable selectable markers and replicons for both Escherichia coli and M. thermautotrophicus. For M. thermautotrophicus, a thermostable neomycin-resistance cassette served as the selectable marker for positive selection with neomycin, and the cryptic plasmid pME2001 from Methanothermobacter marburgensis served as the replicon. The pMVS-plasmid DNA was transferred from E. coli into M. thermautotrophicus via interdomain conjugation. After the successful validation of DNA transfer and positive selection in M. thermautotrophicus, we demonstrated heterologous gene expression of a thermostable {beta}-galactosidase-encoding gene (bgaB) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus under the expression control of four distinct synthetic and native promoters. In quantitative in-vitro enzyme activity assays, we found significantly different {beta}-galactosidase activity with these distinct promoters. With a formate dehydrogenase operon-encoding shuttle vector, we allowed growth of M. thermautotrophicus on formate as the sole growth substrate, while this was not possible for the empty vector control. These genetic tools provide the basis to investigate hypotheses from four decades of research on the physiology and biochemistry of Methanothermobacter spp. on a genetic level.\n\nSignificance StatementThe world economies are facing permanently increasing energy demands. At the same time, carbon emissions from fossil sources need to be circumvented to minimize harmful effects from climate change. The power-to-gas platform is utilized to store renewable electric power and decarbonize the natural gas grid. The microbe Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus is already applied as the industrial biocatalyst for the biological methanation step in large-scale power-to-gas processes. To improve the biocatalyst in a targeted fashion, genetic engineering is required. With our shuttle-vector system for heterologous gene expression in M. thermautotrophicus, we set the cornerstone to engineer the microbe for optimized methane production, but also for production of high-value platform chemicals in power-to-x processes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use surface appendages called type IV pili to perform diverse activities including DNA uptake, twitching motility, and attachment to surfaces. Dynamic extension and retraction of pili is often required for these activities, but the stimuli that regulate these dynamics remain poorly characterized. To study this question, we use the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae, which uses mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) pili to attach to surfaces in aquatic environments as the first step in biofilm formation. Here, we find that V. cholerae cells retract MSHA pili and detach from a surface in microaerobic conditions. This response is dependent on the phosphodiesterase CdpA, which decreases intracellular levels of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) under microaerobic conditions to induce MSHA pilus retraction. CdpA contains a putative NO-sensing NosP domain, and we demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO) is necessary and sufficient to stimulate CdpA-dependent detachment. Thus, we hypothesize that microaerobic conditions result in endogenous production of NO (or an NO-like molecule) in V. cholerae. Together, these results describe a regulatory pathway that allows V. cholerae to rapidly abort biofilm formation. More broadly, these results show how environmental cues can be integrated into the complex regulatory pathways that control pilus dynamic activity and attachment in bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "Primordial microorganisms are postulated to have emerged in H2-rich alkaline Hadean serpentinite-hosted environments with homoacetogenesis as a core metabolism. However, investigation of two modern serpentinization-active analogues of early Earth reveals that conventional H2-/CO2-dependent homoacetogenesis is thermodynamically unfavorable in situ due to picomolar CO2 levels. Through metagenomics and thermodynamics, we discover unique taxa capable of metabolism adapted to the habitat. This included a novel deep-branching phylum, \"Ca. Lithoacetigenota\", that exclusively inhabits Hadean analogues and harbors genes encoding alternative modes of H2-utilizing lithotrophy. Rather than CO2, these metabolisms utilize reduced carbon compounds detected in situ presumably serpentinization-derived: formate and glycine. The former employs a partial homoacetogenesis pathway and the latter a distinct pathway mediated by a rare selenoprotein - the glycine reductase. A survey of serpentinite-hosted system microbiomes shows that glycine reductases are diverse and nearly ubiquitous in Hadean analogues. \"Ca. Lithoacetigenota\" glycine reductases represent a basal lineage, suggesting that catabolic glycine reduction is an ancient bacterial innovation for gaining energy from geogenic H2 even under serpentinization-associated hyperalkaline, CO2-poor conditions. This draws remarkable parallels with ancestral archaeal H2-driven methyl-reducing methanogenesis recently proposed. Unique non-CO2-reducing metabolic strategies presented here may provide a new view into metabolisms that supported primordial life and the diversification of LUCA towards Archaea and Bacteria.",

    "abstract": "During evolution, viruses had to adapt to an increasingly complex environment of eukaryotic cells. Viral proteins that need to enter the cell nucleus or associate with nucleoli possess nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nucleolar localization signals (NoLSs) for nuclear and nucleolar accumulation, respectively. As viral proteins are relatively small, acquisition of novel sequences seems to be a more complicated task for viruses than for eukaryotes. Here, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the basic domain (BD) of HIV-1 Tat to show how viral proteins might evolve with NLSs and NoLSs without an increase in protein size. The HIV-1 Tat BD is involved in several functions, the most important being the transactivation of viral transcription. The BD also functions as an NLS, although it is substantially longer than a typical NLS. It seems that different regions in the BD could function as NLSs due to its enrichment with positively charged amino acids. Additionally, the high positive net charge inevitably causes the BD to function as an NoLS through a charge-specific mechanism. The integration of NLSs and NoLSs into functional domains enriched with positively charged amino acids might be a mechanism that allows the condensation of different functional sequences in small protein regions and, as a result, to reduce protein size, influencing the origin and evolution of NLSs and NoLSs in viruses.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes is a major obstacle in maintaining the momentum in reducing the malaria burden; mitigating strategies require improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Mutations in the target site of insecticides (the voltage gated sodium channel for the most widely used pyrethroid class) and over-expression of detoxification enzymes are commonly reported, but their relative contribution to phenotypic resistance remain poorly understood. Here we present a genome editing pipeline to introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms in An. gambiae which we have used to study the effect of the classical kdr mutation L1014F (L995F based on An. gambiae numbering), one of the most widely distributed resistance alleles. Introduction of 1014F in an otherwise fully susceptible genetic background increased levels of resistance to all tested pyrethroids and DDT ranging from 9.9-fold for permethrin to >24-fold for DDT. The introduction of the 1014F allele was sufficient to reduce mortality of mosquitoes after exposure to deltamethrin treated bednets, even as the only resistance mechanism present. When 1014F was combined with over-expression of glutathione transferase Gste2, resistance to permethrin increased further demonstrating the critical combined effect between target site resistance and detoxification enzymes in vivo. We also show that mosquitoes carrying the 1014F allele in homozygosity showed fitness disadvantages including increased mortality at the larval stage and a reduction in fecundity and adult longevity, which can have consequences for the strength of selection that will apply to this allele in the field.\n\nAuthor SummaryEscalation of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens to reduce the effectiveness of our most important tools in malaria control. Studying the mechanisms underlying insecticide resistance is critical to design mitigation strategies. Here, using genome modified mosquitoes, we functionally characterize the most prevalent mutation in resistant mosquitoes, showing that it confers substantial levels of resistance to all tested pyrethroids and undermines the performance of pyrethroid-treated nets. Furthermore, we show that combining this mutation with elevated levels of a detoxification enzyme further increases resistance. The pipeline we have developed provides a robust approach to quantifying the contribution of different combinations of resistance mechanisms to the overall phenotype, providing the missing link between resistance monitoring and predictions of resistance impact.",

    "abstract": "Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein. Although best known as a regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), it is also implicated in the regulation of cellular bioenergetics and extramitochondrial activities. In addition, being a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), deletion of CypD is likely to affect protein stability in the mitochondria; however, there is little direct evidence of this. In this study, untargeted 1H NMR metabolomics, coupled with multivariate analysis, was used to describe simultaneous changes in the metabolic system of CypD-deficient mice liver, heart, and pancreas, with data from the serum to identify systematic changes. Metabolomics Pathway Analyses (MetPA) revealed commonly perturbed metabolites in the different mouse tissues lacking CypD, with significantly enriched pathways that are related to amino acid, glucose and purine metabolisms, and bioenergetics. Serum from CypD-deficient mice confirmed changes in tissue urea cycle, lipid metabolism and ketogenesis. Overall this study reveals the role of CypD in maintaining protein homeostasis, concurring with its biochemical property as a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and also demonstrates the wider metabolic adaptations induced by the deletion of the ppif gene, resulting in a CypD-deficient mice metabolome that is different from the wild-type system.",

Both BiP AMPylation and deAMPylation are catalysed by a single ER-localised enzyme, FICD. Here we present long-sought crystallographic and solution structures of a deAMPylation Michaelis complex formed between mammalian AMPylated BiP and FICD. The latter, via its tetratricopeptide repeat domain, binds a surface that is specific to ATP-state Hsp70 chaperones, explaining the exquisite selectivity of FICD for BiPs ATP-bound conformation both when AMPylating and deAMPylating Thr518. The eukaryotic deAMPylation mechanism thus revealed, rationalises the role of the conserved Fic domain Glu234 as a gatekeeper residue that both inhibits AMPylation and facilitates hydrolytic deAMPylation catalysed by dimeric FICD. These findings point to a monomerisation-induced increase in Glu234 flexibility as the basis of an oligomeric state-dependent switch between FICDs antagonistic activities, despite a similar mode of engagement of its two substrates -- unmodified and AMPylated BiP.",

    "abstract": "Planarians have long been studied for their regenerative abilities. Moving forward, tools for ectopic expression of non-native proteins will be of substantial value. Using a luminescent reporter to overcome the strong autofluorescence background of planarian tissues, we demonstrate heterologous protein expression in planarian cells and live animals. Our approach is based on the introduction of mRNA through several nanotechnological and chemical transfection methods. We improve reporter expression by altering untranslated region (UTR) sequences and codon bias, facilitating measurement of expression kinetics both in isolated cells and in whole planarians using luminescence imaging. We also examine protein expression as a function of variations in the UTRs of delivered mRNA, demonstrating a framework to investigate gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Together, these advances expand the toolbox for the mechanistic analysis of planarian biology and establish a strong foundation for the development and expansion of transgenic techniques in this unique model system.\n\nMotivationThe study of planarians has contributed to advances in our understanding of regeneration, stem cell dynamics, and many other fundamental biological processes. However, the persistent challenge of expressing transgenes in planarians has led to the speculation that they may be resistant to transfection. In this work, we develop methods to express exogenous mRNAs in both isolated planarian cells and whole animals by optimizing delivery techniques, genetic constructs, and detection methods. These methods allow us to study transfection kinetics and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in a quantitative manner. Beyond planarian research, this work should also provide a broadly applicable strategy to develop similar tools for animals that are also challenging to modify genetically.",

For in vitro applications such as bio-hybrid photodevices this deficiency can be addressed by effectively coupling RCs with synthetic lightharvesting materials. Here, we studied the time scale and efficiency of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a nanoconjugate assembled from a synthetic quantum dot (QD) antenna and a tailored RC engineered to be fluorescent. Time-correlated single photon counting spectroscopy of biohybrid conjugates enabled the direct determination of FRET from QDs to attached RCs on a time scale of 26.6 {+/-} 0.1 ns and with a high efficiency of 0.75 {+/-} 0.01.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in synthetic biology allows the construction of dynamic control circuits for metabolic engineering. This technology promises to overcome many challenges encountered in traditional pathway engineering, thanks to their ability to self-regulate gene expression in response to bioreactor perturbations. The central components in these control circuits are metabolite biosensors that read out pathway signals and actuate enzyme expression. However, the construction of metabolite biosensors is a major bottleneck for strain design, and a key challenge is to understand the relation between biosensor dose-response curves and pathway performance. Here we employ multiobjective optimization to quantify performance trade-offs that arise in the design and calibration of metabolite biosensors. Our approach reveals strategies for tuning dose-response curves along an optimal trade-off between production flux and the cost of an increased expression burden on the host. We explore properties of control architectures built in the literature, and identify their advantages and caveats in terms of performance and robustness to growth conditions and leaky promoters. We demonstrate the optimality of a control circuit for glucaric acid production in Escherichia coli, which has been shown to increase titer by 2.5-fold as compared to static designs. Our results lay the groundwork for the automated design of control circuits for pathway engineering, with applications in the food, energy and pharmaceutical sectors.",

Saliva antibody conversion defined as [&ge;]4-fold increase in IgM, IgA and/or IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens between two visits over a 5-week period was 3.22% (49/1518), or 2.36% if accounting for potentially cross-reactive antibodies, six times higher than the cumulative infection rate (0.53%) by weekly saliva RT-PCR screening. IgG conversion was higher in adults (2.94%, 11/374) than children (1.31%, 15/1144) (p=0.035), IgG and IgA levels moderately increased with age, and antibodies were higher in females. Most antibody converters increased both IgG and IgA antibodies but some augmented either IgG or IgA, with a faster decay over time for IgA than IgG. Nucleocapsid rather than spike was the main antigen target. Anti-spike antibodies were significantly higher in individuals not reporting symptoms than symptomatic individuals, suggesting a protective role against COVID-19. To conclude, saliva antibody profiling including three isotypes and multiplexing antigens is a useful and more user-friendly tool for screening pediatric populations to determine SARS-CoV-2 exposure and guide public health policies during pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Human bromodomain-containing BET family members are promising targets for therapy of cancer and immunoinflammatory diseases, but their mechanisms of action and functional redundancies are poorly understood. Bdf1/2, yeast homologues of the human BET factors, were previously proposed to target transcription factor TFIID to acetylated histone H4, analogous to bromodomains that are present within the largest subunit of metazoan TFIID. We investigated the genome-wide roles of Bdf1/2 and found that their important contributions to transcription extend beyond TFIID function, as transcription of many genes is more sensitive to Bdf1/2 than to TFIID depletion. Bdf1/2 co-occupy the majority of yeast promoters and affect preinitiation complex formation through recruitment of TFIID, Mediator and basal transcription factors to chromatin. Surprisingly, we discovered that hypersensitivity of genes to Bdf1/2 depletion results from combined defects in transcription initiation and processive elongation, a striking functional similarity to human BET proteins, most notably Brd4. Our results establish Bdf1/2 as critical for yeast transcription and provide important mechanistic insights into the function of BET proteins in all eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Animal development relies on a sequence of specific stages that allow the formation of adult structures with a determined size. In general, juvenile stages are dedicated mainly to growth, whereas last stages are devoted predominantly to the maturation of adult structures. In holometabolous insects, metamorphosis marks the end of the growth period as the animals stops feeding and initiate the final differentiation of the tissues. This transition is controlled by the steroid hormone ecdysone produced in the prothoracic gland. In Drosophila different signals have been shown to regulate the production of ecdysone, such as PTTH/Torso, TGF{beta} and Egfr signaling. However, to which extent the role of these signals is conserved remains unknown. Here, we study the role of Egfr signaling in post-embryonic development of the basal holometabolous beetle Tribolium castaneum. We show that Tc-Egfr and Tc-pointed are required to induced a proper larval-pupal transition through the control of the expression of ecdysone biosynthetic genes. Furthermore, we identified an additional Tc-Egfr ligand in the Tribolium genome, the neuregulin-like protein Tc-Vein (Tc-Vn), which contributes to induce larval-pupal transition together with Tc-Spitz (Tc-Spi). Interestingly, we found that in addition to the redundant role in the control of pupa formation, each ligand possesses different functions in organ morphogenesis. Whereas Tc-Spi acts as the main ligand in urogomphi and gin traps, Tc-Vn is required in wings and elytra. Altogether, our findings show that in Tribolium, post-embryonic Tc-Egfr signaling activation depends on the presence of two ligands and that its role in metamorphic transition is conserved in holometabolous insects.",

    "abstract": "Theory and empirical studies in metazoans predict that apex predators should shape the behavior and ecology of mesopredators and prey at lower trophic levels. Despite the ecological importance of microbial communities, few studies of predatory microbes examine such behavioral responses and the multiplicity of trophic interactions. Here, we sought to assemble a three-level microbial food chain and to test for behavioral interactions between the predatory nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the predatory social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus when cultured together with two basal prey bacteria that both predators can eat - Escherichia coli and Flavobacterium johnsoniae. We find that >90% of C. elegans worms failed to interact with M. xanthus even when it was the only potential prey species available, whereas most worms were attracted to pure patches of E. coli and F. johnsoniae. In addition, M. xanthus altered nematode predatory behavior on basal prey, repelling C. elegans from two-species patches that would be attractive without M. xanthus, an effect similar to that of C. elegans pathogens. The nematode also influenced the behavior of the bacterial predator: M. xanthus increased its predatory swarming rate in response to C. elegans in a manner dependent both on basal-prey identity and on worm density. Our results suggest that M. xanthus is an unattractive prey for some soil nematodes and is actively avoided when more lucrative prey are available. Most broadly, we find that nematode and bacterial predators mutually influence one anothers predatory behavior, with likely consequences for coevolution within complex microbial food webs.",

    "abstract": "Anopheles coluzzii females, important malaria vectors in Africa, mate only once in their lifetime. Mating occurs in aerial swarms with a high male-to-female ratio, where the traits underlying male mating success are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) influence mating success in natural mating swarms in Burkina Faso. As insecticides are widely used in this area for malaria control, we also determined whether CHCs affect insecticide resistance levels. We find that mated males have higher CHC abundance than unmated controls, suggesting CHCs could be a determinant of mating success. Additionally, mated males have higher insecticide resistance under pyrethroid challenge, and we show a link between resistance intensity and CHC abundance. Taken together, our results reveal overlapping roles played by CHCs in mate choice and insecticide resistance, and point to sexual selection for insecticide resistance traits that limit the efficacy of our best malaria control tools.",

    "abstract": "The Second Plague Pandemic started in Europe with the Black Death in 1346 and lasted until the 19th century. Based on ancient DNA studies, there is a scientific disagreement over whether the bacterium, Yersinia pestis, came into Europe once (Hypothesis 1), or repeatedly over the following four centuries (Hypothesis 2). Here we synthesize the most updated phylogeny together with historical, archeological, evolutionary and ecological information. On the basis of this holistic view, we conclude that Hypothesis 2 is the most plausible. We also suggest that Y. pestis lineages might have developed attenuated virulence during transmission, which can explain the convergent evolutionary signals, including pla-decay, that appeared at the end of the pandemics.\n\nSignificance StatementOver the last few years there has been a great deal of scientific debate regarding whether the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, spread from a Western European reservoir during the Second Plague Pandemic, or if it repeatedly came to Europe from Asia. Here we make a synthesis of the available evidence, including genomes of ancient DNA, historical, archeological and ecological information. We conclude that the bacterium most likely came to Europe from Asia several times during the Second Plague Pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a central trafficking pathway in eukaryotic cells regulated by phosphoinositides. The plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) plays an instrumental role in driving CME initiation. The F-BAR domain only protein 1 and 2 complex (FCHo1/2) is among the early proteins that reach the plasma membrane, but the exact mechanisms triggering its recruitment remains elusive. Here, we show the molecular dynamics of FCHo2 self-assembly on membranes by combining bottom-up synthetic approaches on in vitro and cellular membranes. Our results indicate that PI(4,5)P2 domains assist FCHo2 docking at specific membrane regions, where it self-assembles into ring-like shape protein patches. We show that binding of FCHo2 on cellular membranes promotes PI(4,5)P2 clustering at the boundary of cargo receptors and that this accumulation enhances clathrin assembly. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic framework that could explain the recruitment of early PI(4,5)P2-interacting proteins at endocytic sites.",
