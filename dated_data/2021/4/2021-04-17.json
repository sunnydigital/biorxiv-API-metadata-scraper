    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) oxidation is one of Earths major biogeochemical processes, key to weathering, soil formation, water quality, and corrosion. However, our understanding of microbial contribution is limited by incomplete knowledge of microbial iron oxidation mechanisms, particularly in neutrophilic iron-oxidizers. The genomes of many, diverse iron-oxidizers encode a homolog to an outer-membrane cytochrome (Cyc2) shown to oxidize iron in two acidophiles. Phylogenetic analyses show Cyc2 sequences from neutrophiles cluster together, suggesting a common function, though this function has not been verified in these organisms. Therefore, we investigated the iron oxidase function of heterologously expressed Cyc2 from a neutrophilic iron-oxidizer Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1. Cyc2PV-1 is capable of oxidizing iron, and its redox potential is 208 {+/-} 20 mV, consistent with the ability to accept electrons from Fe2+ at neutral pH. These results support the hypothesis that Cyc2 functions as an iron oxidase in neutrophilic iron-oxidizing organisms. Sequence analysis and modeling reveal the entire Cyc2 family share a unique fused cytochrome-porin structure, with a defining consensus motif in the cytochrome region. Based on structural analyses, we predict that the monoheme cytochrome Cyc2 specifically oxidizes dissolved Fe2+, in contrast to multiheme iron oxidases, which may oxidize solid Fe(II). With our results, there is now functional validation for diverse representatives of Cyc2 sequences. We present a comprehensive Cyc2 phylogenetic tree and offer a roadmap for identifying cyc2/Cyc2 homologs and interpreting their function. The occurrence of cyc2 in many genomes beyond known iron-oxidizers presents the possibility that microbial iron oxidation may be a widespread metabolism.\n\nImportanceIron is practically ubiquitous across Earths environments, central to both life and geochemical processes, which depend heavily on the redox state of iron. Although iron oxidation, or \"rusting,\" can occur abiotically at near neutral pH, we find neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) are widespread, including in aquifers, sediments, hydrothermal vents, pipes, and water treatment systems. FeOB produce highly reactive Fe(III) oxyhydroxides that bind a variety of nutrients and toxins, thus these microbes are likely a controlling force in iron and other biogeochemical cycles. There has been mounting evidence that Cyc2 functions as an iron oxidase in neutrophiles, but definitive proof of its function has long eluded us. This work provides conclusive biochemical evidence of iron oxidation by Cyc2 from neutrophiles. Cyc2 is common to a wide variety of iron-oxidizers, including acidophilic and phototrophic iron-oxidizers, suggesting that this fused cytochrome-porin structure is especially well-adapted for iron oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Ion Channels (CNGCs) have been firmly established as Ca2+-conducting ion channels that regulate a wide variety of physiological responses in plants. CNGC2 has been implicated in plant immunity and Ca2+ signaling due to the autoimmune phenotypes exhibited by null mutants of CNGC2. However, cngc2 mutants display additional phenotypes that are unique among autoimmune mutants, suggesting that CNGC2 has functions beyond defense and generates distinct Ca2+ signals in response to different triggers. In this study we found that cngc2 mutants showed reduced gravitropism, consistent with a defect in auxin signaling. This was mirrored in the diminished auxin response detected by the auxin reporters DR5::GUS and DII-VENUS and in a strongly impaired auxin-induced Ca2+ response. Moreover, the cngc2 mutant exhibits higher levels of the endogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indicating that excess auxin in cngc2 causes its pleiotropic phenotypes. These auxin signaling defects and the autoimmunity syndrome of cngc2 could be suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in the auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA6 (YUC6), as determined by identification of the cngc2 suppressor mutant repressor of cngc2 (rdd1) as an allele of YUC6. A loss-of-function mutation in the upstream auxin biosynthesis gene TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA1, WEAK ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE8) also suppressed the cngc2 phenotypes, further supporting the tight relationship between CNGC2 and the TAA-YUC-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway. Taking these results together, we propose that the Ca2+ signal generated by CNGC2 is a part of the negative feedback regulation of auxin homeostasis in which CNGC2 balances cellular auxin perception by influencing auxin biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "In the human neocortex coherent interlaminar theta oscillations are driven by deep cortical layers, suggesting neurons in these layers exhibit distinct electrophysiological properties. To characterize this potential distinctiveness, we use in vitro whole-cell recordings from cortical layers 2 and 3 (L2&3), layer 3c (L3c) and layer 5 (L5) of the human cortex. Across all layers we observe notable heterogeneity, indicating human cortical pyramidal neurons are an electrophysiologically diverse population. L5 pyramidal cells are the most excitable of these neurons and exhibit the most prominent sag current (abolished by blockade of the hyperpolarization activated cation current, Ih). While subthreshold resonance is more common in L3c and L5, we rarely observe this resonance at frequencies greater than 2Hz. However, the frequency dependent gain of L5 neurons reveals they are most adept at tracking both delta and theta frequency inputs, a unique feature that may indirectly be important for the generation of cortical theta oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Reduced representation libraries (RRS) allow large scale studies on non-model species to be performed without the need for a reference genome, by building a pseudo-reference locus catalog directly from the data. However, using closely-related high-quality genomes can help maximize nucleotide variation identified from RRS libraries. While chromosome-level genomes remain unavailable for most species, researchers can still invest in building high-quality and project-specific de novo locus catalogs. Among methods that use restriction enzymes (RADSeq), those including fragment size selection to help obtain the desired number of loci - such as double-digest RAD (ddRAD) - are highly flexible but can present important technical issues. Inconsistent size selection reproducibility across libraries and variable coverage across fragment lengths can affect genotyping confidence, number of identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and quality and completeness of the de novo reference catalog. We have developed a strategy to optimize locus catalog building from ddRAD-like data by sequencing overlapping reads that recreate original fragments and add information about coverage per fragment size. Further in silico size selection and digestion steps limit the filtered dataset to well-covered sets of loci and identity thresholds are estimated based on sequence pairwise comparisons. We have developed a full workflow that identifies a set of reduced-representation single-copy orthologs (R2SCOs) for any given species and that includes estimating and evaluating allelic variation in comparison with SNP calling results. We also show how to use our concept in an established RADSeq pipeline - Stacks - and confirm that our approach increases average coverage and number of SNPs called per locus in the final catalog. We have demonstrated our full workflow using newly generated data from five sea turtle species and provided further proof-of-principle using published hybrid sea turtle and primate datasets. Finally, we showed that a project-specific set of R2SCOs perform better than a draft genome as a reference.",

We used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to induce mosaic inactivation of zebrafish ccm2 resulting in a novel lethal multi-cavernous lesion in the embryonic caudal venous plexus (CVP) caused by obstruction of blood flow by intraluminal pillars. These pillars mimic those that mediate intussusceptive angiogenesis; however, in contrast to the normal process, the pillars failed to fuse to split the pre-existing vessel in two. Abortive intussusceptive angiogenesis stemmed from mosaic inactivation of ccm2 leading to patchy klf2a over-expression and resultant aberrant flow signaling. Surviving adult fish manifested histologically-typical hemorrhagic CCM. Formation of mammalian CCM requires the flow-regulated transcription factor KLF2; fish CCM and the embryonic CVP lesion failed to form in klf2a null fish indicating a common pathogenesis with the mammalian lesion. These studies describe a zebrafish CCM model and establish a mechanism that can explain the formation of characteristic multi-cavernous lesions.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine signaling is thought to mediate reward-based learning. We tested for a role of dopamine in motor adaptation by administering the dopamine precursor levodopa to healthy participants in two experiments involving reaching movements. Levodopa has been shown to impair reward-based learning in cognitive tasks. Thus, we hypothesized that levodopa would selectively impair aspects of motor adaptation that depend on reinforcement of rewarding actions.\n\nIn the first experiment, participants performed two separate tasks in which adaptation was driven either by visual error-based feedback of the hand position or binary reward feedback. We used EEG to measure event-related potentials evoked by task feedback. We hypothesized that levodopa would specifically diminish adaptation and the neural responses to feedback in the reward learning task. However, levodopa did not affect motor adaptation in either task nor did it diminish event-related potentials elicited by reward outcomes.\n\nIn the second experiment, participants learned to compensate for mechanical force field perturbations applied to the hand during reaching. Previous exposure to a particular force field can result in savings during subsequent adaptation to the same force field or interference during adaptation to an opposite force field. We hypothesized that levodopa would diminish savings and anterograde interference, as previous work suggests that these phenomena result from a reinforcement learning process. However, we found no reliable effects of levodopa.\n\nThese results suggest that reward-based motor adaptation, savings, and interference may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms that have been shown to be disrupted by levodopa during various cognitive tasks.\n\nNew and NoteworthyMotor adaptation relies on multiple processes including reinforcement of successful actions. Cognitive reinforcement learning is impaired by levodopa-induced disruption of dopamine function. We administered levodopa to healthy adults who participated in multiple motor adaptation tasks. We found no effects of levodopa on any component of motor adaptation. This suggests that motor adaptation may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms as cognitive forms or reinforcement learning that have been shown to be impaired by levodopa.",

To illustrate the new types of studies that are enabled by PTA, we developed direct measurement of environmental mutagenicity (DMEM), a new tool for mapping genome-wide interactions of mutagens with single living human cells at base pair resolution. In addition, we utilized PTA for genome-wide off-target indel and structural variant detection in cells that had undergone CRISPR-mediated genome editing, establishing the feasibility for performing single-cell evaluations of biopsies from edited tissues. The improved precision and accuracy of variant detection with PTA overcomes the current limitations of accurate whole genome amplification, which is the major obstacle to studying genetic diversity and evolution at cellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA methylating agent, is the primary chemotherapeutic drug used in glioblastoma treatment. TMZ induces mostly N-alkylation adducts (N7-methylguanine and N3-methyladenine) and some O6-methylguanine (O6mG). Current models propose that during DNA replication, thymine is incorporated across from O6mG, promoting a futile cycle of mismatch repair (MMR) that leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). To revisit the mechanism of O6mG processing, we reacted plasmid DNA with N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), a temozolomide mimic, and incubated it in Xenopus egg extracts. We show that in this system, mismatch repair (MMR) proteins are enriched on MNU-treated DNA and we observe robust, MMR-dependent, repair synthesis. Our evidence also suggests that MMR, initiated at O6mG:C sites, is strongly stimulated in cis by repair processing of other lesions, such as N-alkylation adducts. Importantly, MNU-treated plasmids display DSBs in extracts, the frequency of which increased linearly with the square of alkylation dose. We suggest that DSBs result from two independent repair processes, one involving MMR at O6mG:C sites and the other involving BER acting at a nearby N-alkylation adducts. We propose a new, replication-independent mechanism of action of TMZ, that operates in addition to the well-studied cell cycle dependent mode of action.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale tissue deformation during biological processes such as morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells, called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1 transitions, which we call the \"T1 delay time\". We study how variations in T1 delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two. We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1 delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a more elastic-like - and less fluid-like - tissue response. Our work suggests that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is an important chronic disease affecting about 10% of the adult population in the US and over 420 million people worldwide, resulting in 1.6 million deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization. The most common type of the disease, type 2 diabetes, can be pharmacologically managed using oral hypoglycemic agents or thiazolidinediones (TZDs), such as pioglitazone, which act by activating the Peroxisome Proliferated-Activated Receptor {gamma}. Despite their beneficial effects in diabetes treatment, TZDs like rosiglitazone and troglitazone were withdrawn due to safety reasons, creating a void in the pharmacological options for the treatment of this important disease. Here, we explored a structure-based approach in the screening for new chemical probes for a deeper investigation of the effects of PPAR{gamma} activation. A class of tetrazole compounds was identified and the compounds named T1, T2 and T3 were purchased and evaluated for their ability to interact with the PPAR{gamma} ligand binding domain (LBD). The compounds were binders with micromolar range affinity, as determined by their IC50 values. A Monte Carlo simulation of the compound T2 revealed that the tetrazole ring makes favorable interaction with the polar arm of the receptor binding pocket. Finally, the crystal structure of the PPAR{gamma}-LBD-T2 complex was solved at 2.3 [A], confirming the binding mode for this compound. The structure also revealed that, when the helix H12 is mispositioned, an alternative binding conformation is observed for the ligand suggesting an H12-dependent binding conformation for the tetrazole compound.",

    "abstract": "Predicting disease progression remains a particularly challenging endeavor in chronic degenerative disorders and cancer, thus limiting early detection, risk stratification, and preventive interventions. Here, profiling the spectrum of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) as a model, we identify the blood platelet transcriptome as a proxy for highly sensitive progression biomarkers that also enables prediction of advanced disease via machine learning algorithms. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we derive disease-relevant gene expression in purified platelets from 120 peripheral blood samples constituting two time-separated cohorts of patients diagnosed with one of three MPN subtypes at sample acquisition - essential thrombocythemia, ET (n=24), polycythemia vera, PV (n=33), and primary or post ET/PV secondary myelofibrosis, MF (n=42), and healthy donors (n=21). The MPN platelet transcriptome reveals an incremental molecular reprogramming that is independent of patient driver mutation status or therapy and discriminates each clinical phenotype. Leveraging this dataset that shows a characteristic progressive expression gradient across MPN, we develop a machine learning model (Lasso-penalized regression) and predict advanced subtype MF at high accuracy and under two conditions of external validation: i) temporal: our two Stanford cohorts, AUC-ROC of 0.96; and ii) geographical: independently published data of an additional n=25 MF and n=46 healthy donors, AUC-ROC of 0.97). Lasso-derived signatures offer a robust core set of < 5 MPN transcriptome markers that are progressive in expression. Mechanistic insights from our data highlight impaired protein homeostasis as a prominent driver of MPN evolution, with persistent integrated stress response. We also identify JAK inhibitor-specific signatures and other interferon, proliferation, and proteostasis-associated markers as putative targets for MPN-directed therapy. Our platelet transcriptome snapshot of chronic MPNs demonstrates a proof of principle for disease risk stratification and progression beyond genetic data alone, with potential utility in other progressive disorders.\n\nHighlightsLeveraging two independent and mutually validating MPN patient cohorts, we identify progressive transcriptomic markers that also enable externally validated prediction in MPNs.\n\nOur platelet RNA-Seq data identifies impaired protein homeostasis as prominent in MPN progression and offers putative targets of therapy.\n\nVISUAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/435190v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72dc16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf5096org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3d460org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c0ddc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved remarkable diversity in inflorescence architecture. At the center of this diversity lies a meristem maturation program featured by transition of stem cell populations from a vegetative state into a reproductive growth, determining when, where, and how many flowers are produced on inflorescences. Here we identified a new meristem maturation regulator TMF FAMILY MEMBER3 (TFAM3) that encodes an ALOG family transcription factor. Loss of TFAM3 results in early flowering and simplified inflorescences with fewer flowers. Genetic analysis by creating high-order mutants of TFAM3 with three key regulators of tomato shoot meristem maturation, TERMINATING FLOWER (TMF), TMF FAMILY MEMBER1 (TFAM1) and TMF FAMILY MEMBER2 (TFAM2), suggested that they synergistically control flowering transition and inflorescence architecture. The four paralogous ALOG proteins share the prion-like properties and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. Strikingly, TMF can recognize cognate TFAM proteins and selectively recruit them into phase separated condensates. Supporting this, they interact with themselves and each other to form biomolecular condensates in the nucleus. Their interaction induces formation of transcriptional condensates that directly repress expression of floral identity gene ANANTHA. Our study revealed a selective-recruitment phase separation mechanism for transcriptional condensation by which plants achieve optimal coordination of functional overlapped paralogs within a protein family to enable precise control of shoot meristem maturation for flowering and production of compound inflorescences.",

    "abstract": "Cassiicolin (Cas), a toxin produced by Corynespora cassiicola, is responsible for corynespora leaf fall disease in rubber trees. Currently, the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxicity of Cas and its host selectivity have not been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed the binding of Cas1 and Cas2 to membranes consisting of different plant lipids and their membrane-disruption activities. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy and confocal microscopy, we reveal that the binding and disruption activities of Cas1 and Cas2 on lipid membranes are strongly dependent on the specific plant lipids. The negative phospholipids, glycerolipids, and sterols are more susceptible to membrane damage caused by Cas1 and Cas2 than neutral phospholipids and betaine lipids. Cytotoxicity tests on rubber leaves of RRIV 1, RRIV 4, and PB 255 clones suggest that the toxins cause necrosis of rubber leaves, except for the strong resistance of PB 255 against Cas2. Cryo- SEM analyses of necrotic leaf tissues exposed to Cas1 confirm that cytoplasmic membranes are vulnerable to the toxin. Thus, the host selectivity of Cas toxin is attained by the lipid-dependent binding activity of Cas to the membrane, and the cytotoxicity of Cas arises from its ability to form biofilm-like structures and disrupt specific membranes.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/438527v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17ef3f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c24d41org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e071aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@24740e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LICas1 and Cas2 directly damage and cause necrosis in the leaves of specific rubber clones.\nC_LIO_LICas1 and Cas2 can form biofilm-like structures on specific lipid membranes (negative phospholipids, glycerolipids, and sterols).

    "abstract": "As generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) have become a widespread tool in ecology, the need to guide the use of such tools is increasingly important. One common guideline is that one needs at least five levels of a random effect. Having such few levels makes the estimation of the variance of random effects terms (such as ecological sites, individuals, or populations) difficult, but it need not muddy ones ability to estimate fixed effects terms - which are often of primary interest in ecology. Here, I simulate ecological datasets and fit simple models and show that having too few random effects terms does not influence the parameter estimates or uncertainty around those estimates for fixed effects terms. Thus, it should be acceptable to use fewer levels of random effects if one is not interested in making inference about the random effects terms (i.e. they are  nuisance parameters used to group non-independent data). I also use simulations to assess the potential for pseudoreplication in (generalized) linear models (LMs), when random effects are explicitly ignored and find that LMs do not show increased type-I errors compared to their mixed-effects model counterparts. Instead, LM uncertainty (and p values) appears to be more conservative in an analysis with a real ecological dataset presented here. These results challenge the view that it is never appropriate to model random effects terms with fewer than five levels - specifically when inference is not being made for the random effects, but suggest that in simple cases LMs might be robust to ignored random effects terms. Given the widespread accessibility of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, future simulation studies and further assessments of these statistical methods are necessary to understand the consequences of both violating and blindly following simple guidelines.",

The SAM-II riboswitch is a class of riboswitches, that recognizes S-adenosyl methionine. It has been previously illustrated that the presence of Mg2+ ions stabilizes the pre-existing minor state of the riboswitch, which is structurally characterised by having a nucleated pseudoknot, leading to the increase of its probability. In this study, an analytical equilibrium model is developed to describe the impact of Mg2+ ions concentration on the folding of the SAM-II riboswitch, linking RNA folding and tertiary interactions energetics to ligand binding, and, hence enabling quantitative predictions. The method was used to study the role of the P1 helix sequence in determining the fraction of binding competent conformers of the SAM-II riboswitch, by simulating the Mg2+ titration curves of various mutants.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/439486v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19367ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8be5ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3fec6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab9d65_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Visual and auditory stimuli place different demands on WM and recruit different brain networks. Separate auditory- and visual-biased WM networks extend into the frontal lobes, but several challenges confront attempts to parcellate human frontal cortex, including fine-grained organization and between-subject variability. Here, we use differential intrinsic functional connectivity from two visual-biased and two auditory-biased frontal structures to identify additional candidate sensory-biased regions in frontal cortex. We then examine direct contrasts of task fMRI during visual vs. auditory 2-back WM to validate those candidate regions. Three visual-biased and five auditory-biased regions are robustly activated bilaterally in the frontal lobes of individual subjects (N=14, 7 women). These regions exhibit a sensory preference during passive exposure to task stimuli, and that preference is stronger during WM. Hierarchical clustering analysis of intrinsic connectivity among novel and previously identified bilateral sensory-biased regions confirms that they functionally segregate into visual and auditory networks, even though the networks are anatomically interdigitated. We also observe that the fronto-temporal auditory WM network is highly selective and exhibits strong functional connectivity to structures serving non-WM functions, while the fronto-parietal visual WM network hierarchically merges into the multiple-demand cognitive system.",

    "abstract": "Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder specific to arithmetic learning even with normal intelligence and age-appropriate education. Difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood. Underlying neurobiological mechanisms of DD, however, are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify possible structural connectivity alterations in DD. We evaluated 10 children with pure DD (11.3 {+/-} 0.7 years) and 16 typically developing (TD) peers (11.2 {+/-} 0.6 years) using diffusion tensor imaging. We first assessed white matter microstructure with tract-based spatial statistics. Then we used probabilistic tractography to evaluate tract lengths and probabilistic connectivity maps in specific regions. At whole brain level, we found no significant microstructural differences in white matter between children with DD and TD peers. Also, seed-based connectivity probabilities did not differ between groups. However, we did find significant differences in regions-of-interest tracts which had previously been related to math ability in children. The major findings of our study were reduced white matter coherence and shorter tract lengths of the left superior longitudinal/arcuate fasciculus and left anterior thalamic radiation in the DD group. Furthermore, lower white matter coherence and shorter pathways corresponded with the lower math performance as a result of the correlation analyses. These results from regional analyses indicate that learning, memory and language-related pathways in the left hemisphere might underlie DD.",

Regions of an Anterior Temporal Network represented information about people, generalizing across contexts, whereas regions of a Posterior Medial Network represented context information, generalizing across people. Medial prefrontal cortex generalized across videos depicting the same schema, whereas the hippocampus maintained event-specific representations. Similar effects were seen in real-time and recall, suggesting reuse of event components across overlapping episodic memories. These findings reveal a computationally optimal strategy in cortico-hippocampal networks for encoding different high-level event components, supporting efficient reuse for event comprehension, imagination, and recollection.",

Besides basal autophagy, which constantly degrades cellular material, the pathway is highly responsive to several stress conditions. However, the exact protein content and phospholipid composition of autophagosomes under changing autophagy conditions remain elusive so far. Here, we introduce a FACS-based approach for isolation of native unmanipulated autophagosomes and ensure the quality of the preparations. Employing quantitative proteomics and phospholipidomics, we obtained a profound cargo and lipid profile of autophagosomes purified upon basal autophagy conditions, nutrient deprivation, and proteasome inhibition. Indeed, starvation only mildly affected the content profile, while interference with proteasome activity showed stronger effects and specifically altered autophagosome cargoes. Interestingly, the phospholipid composition of autophagosomes was unaffected by the different treatments. Thus, the novel isolation method enables purification of intact autophagosomes in large quantities and allows protein content and phospholipid profiling without the requirement of exhaustive cellular fractionation or genetic manipulation.",

In this study, 12 high-affinity antibodies were generated from convalescent donors in early outbreaks using immune antibody phage display libraries. Of them, two RBD-binding antibodies (F61 and H121) showed high affinity neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, whereas three S2-target antibodies failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Following structure analysis, F61 identified a linear epitope located in residues G446 -S494, which overlapped with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding sites, while H121 recognized a conformational epitope located on the side face of RBD, outside from ACE2 binding domain. Hence the cocktail of the two antibodies achieved better performance of neutralization to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, F61 and H121 exhibited efficient neutralizing activity against variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, those showed immune escape. Efficient neutralization of F61 and H121 against multiple mutations within RBD revealed a broad neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, which mitigated the risk of viral escape. Our findings defined the basis of therapeutic cocktails of F61 and H121 with broad neutralization and delivered a guideline for the current and future vaccine design, therapeutic antibody development, and antigen diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and its novel variants.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae rewires its transcriptional output to survive stressful environments, such as nitrogen scarcity under fermentative conditions. Although divergence in nitrogen metabolism has been described among natural yeast populations, the impact of regulatory genetic variants modulating gene expression and nitrogen consumption remains to be investigated. Here, we employed an F1 hybrid from two contrasting S. cerevisiae strains, providing a controlled genetic environment to map cis factors involved in the divergence of gene expression regulation in response to nitrogen scarcity. We used a dual approach to obtain genome-wide allele-specific profiles of chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and gene expression through ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. We observed large variability in allele-specific expression and accessibility between the two genetic backgrounds, with a third of these differences specific to a deficient nitrogen environment. Furthermore, we discovered events of allelic bias in gene expression correlating with allelic bias in transcription factor binding solely under nitrogen scarcity, where the majority of these transcription factors orchestrates the Nitrogen Catabolite Repression regulatory pathway and demonstrates a cis x environment-specific response. Our approach allowed us to find cis variants modulating gene expression, chromatin accessibility and allelic differences in transcription factor binding in response to low nitrogen culture conditions.\n\nImportanceHistorically, coding variants were prioritized when searching for causal mechanisms driving adaptation of natural populations to stressful environments. However, the recent focus on non-coding variants demonstrated their ubiquitous role in adaptation. Here we performed genome-wide regulatory variation profiles between two divergent yeast strains when facing nitrogen nutritional stress. The open chromatin availability of several regulatory regions changes in response to nitrogen scarcity. Importantly we describe regulatory events that deviate between strains. Our results demonstrate a widespread variation in gene expression regulation between naturally occurring populations in response to stressful environments.",

Depletion of STING suppressed and re-expression of the protein in STING-deficient cells upregulated degradation of nascent DNA. Fork arrest was accompanied by the STING pathway activation, and a STING mutant that does not activate the pathway failed to upregulate nascent strand degradation.

    "abstract": "Sensory systems dynamically optimize their processing properties in order to process a wide range of environmental and behavioral conditions. However, attempts to infer the function of these systems via modeling often treat system components as having static processing properties. This is particularly evident in the Drosophila motion detection circuit, where the core algorithm for motion detection is still debated, and where inputs to motion detecting neurons remain underdescribed. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we measured the state- and stimulus-dependent filtering properties of inputs to the OFF motion-detecting T5 cell in Drosophila. Simply summing these inputs within the framework of a connectomic-constrained model of the circuit demonstrates that changes in the shape of input temporal filters are sufficient to explain conflicting theories of T5 function. Therefore, with our measurements and our model, we reconcile motion computation with the anatomy of the circuit.",

    "abstract": "RNA N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification, and forms part of an epitranscriptomic system that modulates RNA function. RNA modifications can be reversibly catalyzed by several specific enzymes, and those modifications can be recognized by RNA binding proteins that in turn regulate biological processes. Although there are many reports demonstrating m6A participation in critical biological functions, this exploration has mainly been conducted through the global knockout or knockdown of the writers, erasers, or readers of m6A. Consequently, there is a lack of information about the role of m6A on single transcripts in biological processes, posing a challenge in understanding the biological functions of m6A. Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR/dCas13a-based RNA m6A-editor which can target mRNAs using single crRNA or multiple crRNAs array to methylate or demethylate m6A. We systematically assay its capabilities to enable the targeted rewriting of m6A dynamics, including modulation of circular RNA translation and transcript half-life. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the system by specifically modulating XIST m6A levels, which can control X chromosome silencing and activation. Based on our editors, m6A on single and multiple transcripts can be modified to allow the exploration of the role of m6A on in biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Body fat depots are heterogeneous concerning their embryonic origin, structure, exposure to environmental stressors, and availability. Thus, investigating adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) from different sources is essential to standardization for future therapies. In vitro amplification is also critical because it may predispose cell senescence and mutations, reducing regenerative properties and safety. Here, we evaluated long-term culture of human facial ASCs (fASCs) and abdominal ASCs (aASCs) and showed that both met the criteria for MSCs characterization, but presented differences in their immunophenotypic profile, and differentiation and clonogenic potentials. The abdominal tissue yielded more ASCs, but facial cells displayed fewer mitotic errors at higher passages. However, both cell types reduced clonal efficiency over time and entered replicative senescence around P12, as evaluated by progressive morphological alterations, reduced proliferative capacity, and SA-{beta}-galactosidase expression. Loss of genetic integrity was detected by a higher proportion of cells showing nuclear alterations and {gamma}-H2AX expression. Our findings indicate that the source of ASCs can substantially influence their phenotype and therefore should be carefully considered in future cell therapies, avoiding, however, long-term culture to ensure genetic stability.",

    "abstract": "Accurate control of the cell cycle is critical for development and tissue homeostasis and requires precisely-timed expression of many genes. Cell cycle gene expression is regulated through transcriptional and translational control, as well as through regulated protein degradation. Here, we show that widespread and temporally-controlled mRNA decay acts as an additional mechanism for gene expression regulation during the cell cycle. We find that two waves of mRNA decay occur sequentially during the mitosis-to-G1 phase transition, and identify the deadenylase CNOT1 as a factor that contributes to mRNA decay during this cell cycle transition. Collectively, our data show that, akin to protein degradation, scheduled mRNA decay helps to reshape cell cycle gene expression as cells move from mitosis into G1 phase.",

In this study, I used image-based phenotypic profiling to screen a pharmacologically active compound library with the aim of identifying new druggable targets in the EGFR pathway. As anticipated, the phenotypic screen identified compounds that produce phenotypes resulting from targeting a known specific molecule or pathway. The assay also showed that compounds with diverse known mechanisms of action produced similar, EGFR-related cellular phenotypes. Biochemical assays revealed that those compounds share a previously unappreciated common target/pathway, showing that the image-based assay can identify new target molecules that are independent of the compounds known target. Further experiments showed that ROCK1 and PSMD2 are novel druggable targets within the EGFR pathway.",

    "abstract": "Nanobodies are becoming increasingly popular as tools for manipulating and visualising proteins in vivo. The ability to control nanobody/antigen interactions using light could provide precise spatiotemporal control over protein function. We develop a general approach to engineer photo-activatable nanobodies using photocaged amino acids that are introduced into the target binding interface by genetic code expansion. Guided by computational alanine scanning and molecular-dynamics simulations, we tune nanobody/target binding affinity to eliminate binding before uncaging. Upon photo-activation, binding is restored. We use this approach to generate improved photocaged variants of two anti-GFP nanobodies. These variants exhibit photo-activatable binding triggered by illumination with 365nm light. We demonstrate that the photocaged nanobodies we have created are highly robust and function in a complex cellular environment. We apply them to control subcellular protein localisation in the nematode worm C. elegans. Our approach provides a rare example of computationally designed proteins being directly applied in living animals and demonstrates the importance of accounting for in vivo effects on protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "The essential micronutrient zinc plays regulatory roles in immune responses through its ability to affect signaling pathways. In activated monocytes/macrophages, signaling networks mediate metabolic reprogramming in order to meet the demands of participating in immune responses. Despite its known immunoregulatory roles, the effect of zinc on metabolic reprogramming in monocytes/macrophages remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic bioavailable zinc is essential for regulating IL-1{beta} production in activated human monocytes/macrophages downstream of mTORC1-induced glycolysis. The cytoplasmic zinc level was influenced by extracellular zinc concentration through a zinc-specific importer, Zip8, which was markedly increased in monocytes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disease, and even in LPS-stimulated monocytes/macrophages of healthy individuals. Mechanically, phosphorylation of S6 kinase, a substrate of mTORC1, was significantly enhanced by zinc-mediated inhibition of PP2A, an S6 kinase phosphatase. As a result, IL-1{beta} production was increased due to the activation of mTORC1-induced glycolysis. The expression of Zip8 and MT2A, a zinc-inducible gene, and the phosphorylation of S6 kinase by monocytes of RA patients was significantly enhanced compared with those of HCs and Zip8 levels positively correlated with RA clinical parameters, suggesting that Zip8-mediated zinc influx is related to inflammatory conditions. These results provide insight into the role of cytoplasmic bioavailable zinc in the metabolic reprogramming of human monocytes/macrophages which is an essential process for inflammatory responses.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCytoplasmic zinc regulates IL-1{beta} production in monocytes/macrophages downstream of mTORC1-S6K-induced glycolysis via zinc-mediated inhibition of PP2A.",

    "abstract": "The clinical impact of rhinovirus C (RV-C) is well-documented; yet the viral life cycle remains poorly defined. Thus, we characterized RV-C15 replication at the single-cell level and its impact on the human airway epithelium (HAE) using a physiologically-relevant in vitro model. RV-C15 replication was restricted to ciliated cells where viral RNA levels peaked at 12 hours post-infection (hpi), correlating with elevated titers in the apical compartment at 24 hpi. Notably, infection was associated with a loss of polarized expression of the RV-C receptor, cadherin-related family member 3. Visualization of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during RV-C15 replication revealed two distinct replication complex arrangements within the cell, likely corresponding to different time points in infection and correlating with the formation of large intracellular vesicles. To further define RV-C15 replication sites, we analyzed the expression of giantin, phosphatidylinositol-4- phosphate, and calnexin, as well as the colocalization of these markers with dsRNA. Fluorescence levels of all three cellular markers were elevated during infection and altered giantin distribution further indicated Golgi fragmentation. However, unlike previously characterized RVs, the high ratio of calnexin-dsRNA colocalization implicated the endoplasmic reticulum as the primary site for RV-C15 replication in HAE. RV-C15 infection was also associated with elevated stimulator of interferon genes (STING) expression, facilitating replication, and the induction of incomplete autophagy, a mechanism used by other RVs to promote non-lytic release of progeny virions. Finally, RV-C15 infection resulted in a temporary loss in epithelial barrier integrity and the translocation of tight junction proteins while a reduction in mucociliary clearance indicated cytopathic effects on epithelial function. Together, our findings identify both shared and unique features of RV-C replication compared to related rhinoviruses and define the impact of RV-C on both epithelial cell organization and tissue functionality - aspects of infection that may contribute to pathogenesis in vivo.\n\nAuthor summaryRhinovirus C has a global distribution and significant clinical impact - especially in those with underlying lung disease. Although RV-C is genetically, structurally, and biologically distinct from RV-A and -B viruses, our understanding of the RV-C life cycle has been largely inferred from these and other related viruses. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of RV-C15 replication in a physiologically-relevant model of human airway epithelium. Our single-cell, microscopy-based approach revealed that - unlike other RVs - the endoplasmic reticulum is the primary site for RV- C15 replication. RV-C15 replication also stimulated STING expression, which was proviral, and triggered dramatic changes in cellular organization, including altered virus receptor distribution, fragmented Golgi stacks, and the induction of incomplete autophagy. Additionally, we observed a loss of epithelial barrier function and a decrease in mucociliary clearance, a major defense mechanism in the lung, during RV-C15 infection. Together, these data reveal novel insight into RV-C15 replication dynamics and resulting cytopathic effects in the primary target cells for infection, thereby furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of RV-C. Our work highlights similar, as well as unique, aspects of RV-C15 replication compared to related pathogens, which will help guide future studies on the molecular mechanisms of RV-C infection.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) exploit host glycans in airway epithelial mucosa to gain entry and initiate infection. Rapid detection of changes in IAV specificity towards host glycan classes can provide early indication of virus transmissibility and infection potential. IAVs use hemagglutinins (HA) to bind sialic acids linked to larger glycan structures and a switch in HA specificity from 2,3-to 2,6-linked sialoglycans is considered a prerequisite for viral transmission from birds to humans. While the changes in HA structure associated with the evolution of binding phenotype have been mapped, the influence of glycan receptor presentation on IAV specificity remains obscured. Here, we describe a glycan array platform which uses synthetic mimetics of mucin glycoproteins to model how receptor presentation in the mucinous glycocalyx, including glycan type and valency of the glycoconjugates and their surface density, impact IAV binding. We found that H1N1 virus produced in embryonated chicken eggs, which recognizes both receptor types, exclusively engaged mucin-mimetics carrying 2,3-linked sialic acids in their soluble form. The virus was able utilize both receptor structures when the probes were immobilized on the array; however, increasing density in the mucin-mimetic brush diminished viral adhesion. Propagation in mammalian cells produced a change in receptor pattern recognition by the virus, without altering its HA affinity, toward improved binding of 2,6-sialylated mucin mimetics and reduced sensitivity to surface crowding of the probes. Application of a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm as part of the glycan array binding analysis efficiently characterized this shift in binding preference and may prove useful to study the evolution of viral responses to a new host.",

    "abstract": "Serratia marcescens, a member of the order Enterobacterales, is adept at colonizing healthcare environments and an important cause of invasive infections. Antibiotic resistance is a daunting problem in S. marcescens because in addition to plasmid-mediated mechanisms, most isolates have considerable intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. To discover endogenous modifiers of antibiotic susceptibility in S. marcescens, a high-density transposon insertion library was subjected to sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations of two cephalosporins, cefoxitin and cefepime, as well as the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Comparisons of transposon insertion abundance before and after antibiotic exposure identified hundreds of potential modifiers of susceptibility to these agents. Using single gene deletions, we validated several candidate modifiers of cefoxitin susceptibility and chose ydgH, a gene of unknown function, for further characterization. In addition to cefoxitin, deletion of ydgH in S. marcescens resulted in decreased susceptibility to multiple 3rd generation cephalosporins, and in contrast, to increased susceptibility to both cationic and anionic detergents. YdgH is highly conserved throughout the Enterobacterales, and we observed similar phenotypes in Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Enterobacter cloacae mutants. YdgH is predicted to localize to the periplasm and we speculate that it may be involved there in cell envelope homeostasis. Collectively, our findings provide insight into chromosomal mediators of antibiotic resistance in S. marcescens and will serve as a resource for further investigations of this important pathogen.",

When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PcDHCR7 showed a {bigtriangleup}7-sterol reductase activity. Knocking out PcDHCR7 in P. capsici resulted in loss of the capacity to transform ergosterol into brassicasterol, which means PcDHCR7 has a {bigtriangleup}7-sterol reductase activity in P. capsici itself. This enables P. capsici to transform sterols recruited from the environment for better use. Biological characteristics were compared between wild-type isolate and PcDHCR7 knock-out transformants.

    "abstract": "During retroviral replication, unspliced viral genomic RNA (gRNA) must escape the nucleus for translation into viral proteins and packaging into virions. \"Complex\" retroviruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) use cis-acting elements on the unspliced gRNA in conjunction with trans-acting viral proteins to facilitate this escape. \"Simple\" retroviruses such as Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus (MPMV) and Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) exclusively use cis-acting elements on the gRNA in conjunction with host nuclear export proteins for nuclear escape. Uniquely, the simple retrovirus Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) has a Gag structural protein that cycles through the nucleus prior to plasma membrane binding. This trafficking has been implicated in facilitating gRNA nuclear export and is thought to be a required mechanism. Previously described mutants that abolish nuclear cycling displayed enhanced plasma membrane binding, enhanced virion release, and a significant loss in genome incorporation resulting in loss of infectivity. Here, we describe a nuclear cycling deficient RSV Gag mutant that has similar plasma membrane binding and genome incorporation to WT virus and surprisingly, is replication competent albeit with a slower rate of spread compared to WT. This mutant suggests that RSV Gag nuclear cycling is not strictly required for RSV replication.\n\nImportanceWhile mechanisms for retroviral Gag assembly at the plasma membrane are beginning to be characterized, characterization of intermediate trafficking locales remain elusive. This is in part due to the difficulty of tracking individual proteins from translation to plasma membrane binding. RSV Gag nuclear cycling is a unique phenotype that may provide comparative insight to viral trafficking evolution and may present a model intermediate to cis- and trans-acting mechanisms for gRNA export.",

    "abstract": "Flower colour constitutes a pivotal evolutionary force in speciation. The Mediterranean Lysimachia arvensis and L. monelli are morphologically variable species having both blue or red flowered plants. Previous studies suggested that L. arvensis plants differing in colour are diverging lineages, but this variation has not been considered in a phylogenetic context. We reconstruct the phylogenetic signal and the ancestral states of flower colour of Mediterranean Lysimachia species by using nuclear (ITS) and three plastid markers. Blue and red specimens are nested in two independent clades in the ITS tree, thus supporting that L. arvensis and L. monelli are polyphyletic, whereas low phylogenetic resolution was found in plastid markers. Blue-flowered L. arvensis is reconstructed sister to L. talaverae in a monophyletic clade sister to the remaining Lysimachia. Red-flowered L. arvensis is reconstructed sister to red-flowered L. monelli in a monophyletic clade sister to blue-flowered L. monelli and L. foemina. Our results suggest that colour lineages in L. arvensis and L. monelli constitute different species, but flower colour did not promote the separation of these lineages. We propose a new name for blue-flowered L. arvensis (L. loeflingii) and a new combination for red-flowered L. monelli (L. collina).",

    "abstract": "Peer victimization is common in adolescence and have been associated with a broad variety of psychopathology and alcohol use. The present study assessed whether peer victimization has a time-varying effect on alcohol use through internalizing and externalizing symptoms and whether this indirect association throughout time is moderated by personality. This 5-year longitudinal study (3,800 grade 7 adolescents) used Bayesian multilevel moderated mediation models: independent variable was peer victimization; moderators were four personality dimensions (anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity, and sensation seeking); internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depressive symptoms) and externalizing symptoms (conduct, hyperactivity problems) were the mediators; and alcohol use, the outcome. Results indicated significant between, within, and lagged effects on alcohol use through internalizing and externalizing symptoms. There was significant between and within effects on alcohol use through internalizing symptoms for adolescents with high anxiety sensitivity and hopelessness, and significant between, within, and lagged effects on alcohol use through externalizing for adolescents with high impulsivity and sensation seeking. These findings implicate two risk pathways that account for how peer victimization enhances alcohol use risk and emphasize the importance of personality profiles that can shape the immediate and long-term consequences of victimization.",

    "abstract": "Axis formation in fish and amphibians is initiated by a prepattern of maternal gene products in the blastula. The embryogenesis of annual killifish challenges prepatterning models because blastomeres disperse and then re-aggregate to form the germ layers and body axes. This dispersion-aggregation process prompts the question how axis determinants such as Huluwa and germ layer inducers such as Nodal function in annual killifish. Here we show in Nothobranchius furzeri that huluwa, the factor thought to break symmetry by stabilizing {beta}-catenin, is a non-functional pseudogene. Nuclear {beta}-catenin is not selectively stabilized on one side of the blastula but accumulates in cells forming the incipient aggregate. Inhibition of Nodal signaling blocks aggregation and disrupts coordinated cell migration, establishing a novel role for this signaling pathway. These results reveal a surprising departure from classic mechanisms of axis formation: canonical Huluwa-mediated prepatterning is dispensable and Nodal coordinates morphogenesis.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAxis formation in annual killifish relies on Nodal to coordinate cell migration and is independent of Huluwa-mediated prepatterning.",

    "abstract": "Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) is a technique for identifying the genetic loci that underlie phenotypic trait differences. The basic approach of this method is to compare two pools of individuals from the opposing tails of the phenotypic distribution, sampled from an interbred population. Each pool is sequenced and scanned for alleles that show divergent frequencies between the pools, indicating potential association with the observed trait differences. BSA has already been successfully applied to the mapping of various quantitative trait loci in organisms ranging from yeast to maize. However, these studies have typically suffered from rather low mapping resolution, and we still lack a detailed understanding of how this resolution is affected by experimental parameters. Here, we use coalescence theory to calculate the expected genomic resolution of BSA. We first show that in an idealized interbreeding population of infinite size, the expected length of the mapped region is inversely proportional to the recombination rate, the number of generations of interbreeding, and the number of genomes sampled, as intuitively expected. In a finite population, coalescence events in the genealogy of the sample reduce the number of potentially informative recombination events during interbreeding, thereby increasing the length of the mapped region. This is incorporated into our theory by an effective population size parameter that specifies the pairwise coalescence rate of the interbreeding population. The mapping resolution predicted by our theory closely matches numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that the approach can easily be extended to modifications of the crossing scheme. Our framework enables researchers to predict the expected power of their mapping experiments, and to evaluate how their experimental design could be tuned to optimize mapping resolution.",

    "abstract": "Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are potent cis-acting regulators of mRNA translation and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). While both AUG- and non-AUG initiated uORFs are ubiquitous in ribosome profiling studies, few uORFs have been experimentally tested. Consequently, the relative influences of sequence, structural, and positional features on uORF activity have not been determined. We quantified thousands of yeast uORFs using massively parallel reporter assays in wildtype and {Delta}upf1 yeast. While nearly all AUG uORFs were robust repressors, most non-AUG uORFs had relatively weak impacts on expression. Machine learning regression modeling revealed that uORF functions are strongly impacted by both their sequences and locations within transcript leaders. Indeed, alternative transcription start sites highly influenced uORF activity. These results define the scope of natural uORF activity, identify features associated with translational repression and NMD, and suggest that the locations of uORFs in transcript leaders are nearly as important as uORF sequences.",

Coupled with long-range technologies, they can reveal the architecture of complex regions, like centromeres or rDNA clusters. These technologies also make it possible to know the complete organization of chromosomes, which remained complicated before even when using genetic maps. However, generating a gapless and telomere-to-telomere assembly is still not trivial, and requires a combination of several technologies and the choice of suitable software. Here, we report a chromosome-scale assembly of a banana genome (Musa acuminata) generated using Oxford Nanopore long-reads. We generated a genome coverage of 177X from a single PromethION flowcell with near 17X with reads longer than 75Kb. From the 11 chromosomes, 5 were entirely reconstructed in a single contig from telomere to telomere, revealing for the first time the content of complex regions like centromeres or clusters of paralogous genes.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) enables many metabolic processes by regenerating both mitochondrial and cytosolic NAD+ and ATP. The oxidation by the RC of the NADH metabolically produced in the cytosol involves redox shuttles as the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) and is of paramount importance for cell fate. However, the specific metabolic regulations allowing mitochondrial respiration to prioritize NADH oxidation in response to high NADH/NAD+ redox stress have not been elucidated. Our work demonstrates the crucial role played by MDH2 in orchestrating the electron fuelling of the RC. On one hand, MDH2 mediated oxaloacetate (OAA) production allows mitochondria to metabolize pyruvate and glutamate and to feed complex I with NADH, whereas on the other hand, OAA inhibits complex II. This regulatory mechanism synergistically increases RCs NADH oxidative capacity and rewires MDH2 driven anaplerosis of the TCA favouring the oxidation of malate produced by the MAS.",

    "abstract": "The bowl-shaped structure of PIEZO channels is predicted to flatten in response to mechanical stimuli, gating their pore open. However, how this unique structure allows them to detect exquisitely small changes in membrane tension remains unclear. Here, using pressure clamp electrophysiology, modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the single channel open probability of PIEZO1 increases weakly with respect to pressure-induced tension. In contrast, when multiple channels are present in a membrane patch, channel open probability increases steeply as a function of the number of open channels. These cooperative effects are consistent with an inter-channel energetic repulsion due to the local membrane deformation created by the non-planar PIEZO structure. When channels open, this deformation shrinks, allowing open channels to diffuse closer to each other, thus delaying closure. This study reveals how PIEZO1 channels acquire their exceptional mechanosensitivity and suggests a possible mechanism by which cells could rapidly tune mechanosensitivity.",

Rapid and inexpensive, it is possible to carry out genetic and drug screens at a far larger scale than in vertebrate organisms. Such whole-organism-based drug screens permits assessment of drug absorption and toxicity, reducing the possibility of false positives. Activating mutations in the Wnt and Ras signalling pathways are common in many epithelial cancers, and when driven in the adult Drosophila midgut, it induces aggressive intestinal tumour-like outgrowths that recapitulate many aspects of human colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we have taken a Drosophila CRC model in which tumourous cells are marked with both GFP and luciferase reporter genes, and developed novel high-throughput assays for quantifying tumour burden. Leveraging these assays, we find that the Drosophila CRC model responds rapidly to treatment with standard CRC-drugs, opening the door to future rapid genetic and drug screens.",

    "abstract": "Approximately, 30% of early-stage localized prostate cancer cases reoccur within 5 to 10 years [1, 2]. However, identifying precise molecular subtypes attributable to specific stages of prostate cancer has proven difficult due to high heterogeneity within localized tumors [3-5]. Bulk assays represent a population average, which is a result of the heterogeneity that exists at the individual prostate cancer cell level [6]. Here, we sequenced the accessible chromatin regions of 14,424 single-cells collected from 18 fresh-frozen prostate tumors using sci-ATAC-seq [7, 8]. We observed that shared chromatin features among low-grade prostate cancer epithelial cells were lost in high-grade tumors. Despite this loss, all high-grade tumors exhibited an enrichment for FOXA1, HOXB13 and CDX2 transcription factor binding sites within their accessible chromatin regions, indicating a shared trans-regulatory program. Single-cell analysis of the differentially accessible regions in high- versus low-grade prostate tumors identified two unique genes encoding neuronal adhesion molecules, NRXN1 and NLGN1. We found that NRXN1 and NLGN1 are expressed in the epithelial luminal, basal and neuroendocrine cells, as well as the immune, endothelial and neuronal cell types in all prostate tumors. Overall, these results provide a deeper understanding of the active gene regulatory networks in low- and high-grade prostate tumors at a striking resolution and provide critical insights for molecular stratification of the disease.",

The ability of engineered uAbs to accelerate the turnover of exogenous or endogenous POIs in a posttranslational manner offers a simple yet robust tool for dissecting diverse functional properties of cellular proteins as well as for expanding the druggable proteome to include tumorigenic protein families that have yet-to-be successfully drugged by conventional inhibitors. Here, we describe the engineering of uAbs comprised of a highly modular human E3 ubiquitin ligase, human carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), tethered to different designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) that bind to nonphosphorylated (inactive) and/or doubly phosphorylated (active) forms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Two of the resulting uAbs were found to be global ERK degraders, pan-specifically capturing all endogenous ERK1/2 protein forms and redirecting them to the proteasome for degradation in different cell lines, including MCF7 breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate how the substrate specificity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase can be reprogrammed to generate designer uAbs against difficult-to-drug targets, enabling a modular platform for remodeling the mammalian proteome.",

    "abstract": "Two-component signaling systems (TCSs) are comprised of a sensory histidine kinase and a response regulator protein. In response to environmental changes, sensor kinases directly phosphorylate their cognate response regulator to affect gene expression. Bacteria typically express multiple TCSs that are insulated from one another and regulate distinct physiological processes. There are certainly examples of cross-regulation between TCSs, but this phenomenon remains relatively unexplored. We have identified regulatory links between the ChvG-ChvI (ChvGI) and NtrY-NtrX (NtrYX) TCSs, which control important and often overlapping processes in -proteobacteria, including maintenance of the cell envelope. Deletion of chvG and chvI in Caulobacter crescentus limited growth in defined medium and a selection for genetic suppressors of this growth phenotype uncovered interactions among chvGI, ntrYX, and ntrZ, which encodes a previously uncharacterized periplasmic protein. Significant overlap in the experimentally-defined ChvI and NtrX transcriptional regulons provided support for the observed genetic connections between ntrYX and chvGI. Moreover, we present evidence that the growth defect of strains lacking chvGI is influenced by the phosphorylation state of NtrX and, to some extent, by levels of the TonB-dependent receptor ChvT. Measurements of NtrX phosphorylation in vivo indicated that NtrZ is an upstream regulator of NtrY, and that NtrY primarily functions as an NtrX phosphatase. We propose a model in which NtrZ functions in the periplasm to inhibit NtrY phosphatase activity; regulation of phosphorylated NtrX levels by NtrZ and NtrY provides a mechanism to modulate and balance expression of the NtrX and ChvI regulons under different growth conditions.\n\nImportanceTwo-component signaling systems (TCSs) enable bacteria to regulate gene expression in response to physiochemical changes in their environment. The ChvGI and NtrYX TCSs regulate diverse pathways associated with pathogenesis, growth, and cell envelope function in many -proteobacteria. We used Caulobacter crescentus as a model to investigate regulatory connections between ChvGI and NtrYX. Our work defined the ChvI transcriptional regulon in C. crescentus and revealed a genetic interaction between ChvGI and NtrYX, whereby modulation of NtrYX signaling affects the survival of cells lacking ChvGI. In addition, we identified NtrZ as a periplasmic inhibitor of NtrY phosphatase activity in vivo. Our work establishes C. crescentus as an excellent model to investigate multi-level regulatory connections between ChvGI and NtrYX in -proteobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerase I (Topo I) of Escherichia coli, encoded by topA, acts to relax negative supercoils in DNA. Topo I deficiency results in hypernegative supercoiling, formation of transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops), and DnaA- and oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR), but some uncertainty persists as to whether topA is essential for viability in E. coli and related enterobacteria. Here we show that several topA alleles, including {Delta}topA, confer lethality in derivatives of wild-type E. coli strain MG1655. Viability in absence of Topo I was restored with two perturbations, neither of which reversed the hypernegative supercoiling phenotype: (i) in a reduced-genome strain MDS42, or (ii) by an RNA polymerase (RNAP) mutation rpoB*35 that has been reported to alleviate the deleterious consequences of RNAP backtracking and transcription-replication conflicts. Four phenotypes related to cSDR were identified for topA mutants: (i) One of the topA alleles rescued {Delta}dnaA lethality; (ii) in dnaA+ derivatives, Topo I deficiency generated a characteristic copy number peak in the terminus region of the chromosome; (iii) topA was synthetically lethal with rnhA (encoding RNase HI, whose deficiency also confers cSDR); and (iv) topA rnhA synthetic lethality was itself rescued by {Delta}dnaA. We propose that the terminal lethal consequence of hypernegative DNA supercoiling in E. coli topA mutants is RNAP backtracking during transcription elongation and associated R-loop formation, which in turn lead to transcription-replication conflicts and to cSDR.\n\nImportanceIn all life forms, double helical DNA exists in a topologically supercoiled state. The enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I act, respectively, to introduce and to relax negative DNA supercoils in Escherichia coli. That gyrase deficiency leads to bacterial death is well established, but the essentiality of topoisomerase I for viability has been less certain. This study confirms that topoisomerase I is essential for E. coli viability, and suggests that in its absence aberrant chromosomal DNA replication and excessive transcription-replication conflicts occur that are responsible for lethality.",

    "abstract": "Fic domain-containing AMP transferases (fic AMPylases) are conserved enzymes that catalyze the covalent transfer of AMP to proteins. This post-translational modification regulates the function of several proteins, including the ER-resident chaperone Grp78/BiP. Here we introduce a mFICD AMPylase knock-out mouse model to study fic AMPylase function in vertebrates. We find that mFICD deficiency is well-tolerated in unstressed mice. We show that mFICD-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts are depleted of AMPylated proteins. mFICD deletion alters protein synthesis and secretion in splenocytes, including that of IgM and IL-1{beta}, without affecting the unfolded protein response. Finally, we demonstrate that older mFICD-/- mice show improved cognitive plasticity. Together, our results suggest a role for mFICD in adaptive immunity and neuronal plasticity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian buffy-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix aurita), one of the worlds most endangered primates, is threatened by anthropogenic hybridization with exotic, invasive marmoset species. As there are few genetic data available for C. aurita, we developed a PCR-free protocol with minimal technical requirements to rapidly generate genomic data with genomic skimming and portable nanopore sequencing. With this direct DNA sequencing approach, we successfully determined the complete mitogenome of a marmoset that we initially identified as C. aurita. The obtained nanopore-assembled sequence was highly concordant with a Sanger sequenced version of the same mitogenome. Phylogenetic analyses unexpectedly revealed that our specimen was a cryptic hybrid, with a C. aurita phenotype and C. penicillata mitogenome lineage. We also used publicly available mitogenome data to determine diversity estimates for C. aurita and three other marmoset species. Mitogenomics holds great potential to address deficiencies in genomic data for endangered, non-model species such as C. aurita. However, we discuss why mitogenomic approaches should be used in conjunction with other data for marmoset species identification. Finally, we discuss the utility and implications of our results and genomic skimming/nanopore approach for conservation and evolutionary studies of C. aurita and other marmosets.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte Immunoglobulin (Ig)-like Receptors (LILR) LILRB1 and LILRB2 play a pivotal role in maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the immune response through interaction with classical and non-classical Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules. Although both diversity and natural selection patterns over HLA genes have been extensively evaluated, little information is available concerning the genetic diversity and selection signatures on the LIRB1/2 regions. Therefore, we identified the LILRB1/2 genetic diversity using next-generation sequencing in a population sample comprising 528 healthy control individuals from Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We identified 58 LILRB1 Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), which gave rise to 13 haplotypes with at least 1% of frequency. For LILRB2, we identified 41 SNVs arranged into 11 haplotypes with frequencies above 1%. We found evidence of either positive or purifying selection on LILRB1/2 coding regions. Some residues in both proteins showed to be under the effect of positive selection, suggesting that amino acid replacements in these proteins resulted in beneficial functional changes. Finally, we have shown that allelic variation (six and five amino acid exchanges in LILRB1 and LILRB2, respectively) affects the structure and/or stability of both molecules. Nonetheless, LILRB2 has shown higher average stability, with no D1/D2 residue affecting protein structure. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that LILRB1 and LILRB2 are highly polymorphic and provide strong evidence supporting the directional selection regime hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Severe falciparum malaria has substantially affected human evolution. Genetic association studies of patients with clinically defined severe malaria and matched population controls have helped characterise human genetic susceptibility to severe malaria, but phenotypic imprecision compromises discovered associations. In areas of high malaria transmission the diagnosis of severe malaria in young children and, in particular, the distinction from bacterial sepsis, is imprecise. We developed a probabilistic diagnostic model of severe malaria using platelet and white count data. Under this model we re-analysed clinical and genetic data from 2,220 Kenyan children with clinically defined severe malaria and 3,940 population controls, adjusting for phenotype mis-labelling. Our model, validated by the distribution of sickle trait, estimated that approximately one third of cases did not have severe malaria. We propose a data-tilting approach for case-control studies with phenotype mis-labelling and show that this reduces false discovery rates and improves statistical power in genome-wide association studies.",

    "abstract": "Optimal selection of high-risk patients with stage II colon cancer is crucial to ensure clinical benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Here, we investigate the prognostic and predictive value of genomic intratumor heterogeneity and aneuploidy for disease recurrence. We combined SNP arrays, targeted next-generation sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization and inmunohistochemistry on a retrospective cohort of 84 untreated stage II colon cancer patients. We assessed the subclonality of copy-number alterations (CNAs) and mutations, CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration and their association with time to recurrence (TTR). Prognostic factors were included in machine learning analysis to evaluate their ability to predict individual relapse risk. Tumors from recurrent patients (N = 38) exhibited greater proportion of CNAs compared with non-recurrent (N = 46) (mean 31.3% vs. 23%, respectively; P = 0.014), which was confirmed in an independent cohort. Candidate chromosome-specific aberrations included the gain of the chromosome arm 13q (P = 0.02; HR, 2.67) and loss of heterozygosity at 17q22-q24.3 (P = 0.05; HR, 2.69), both associated with shorter TTR. CNA load positively correlated with intratumor heterogeneity (R = 0.52; P < 0.0001), indicating ongoing chromosomal instability. Consistently, subclonal copy-number heterogeneity was associated with elevated risk of relapse (P = 0.028; HR, 2.20), which we did not observe for subclonal mutations. The clinico-genomic model rated an area under the curve of 0.83, achieving a 10% incremental gain compared to clinicopathological markers. In conclusion, tumor aneuploidy and copy-number heterogeneity were predictive of a poor outcome in early-stage colon cancer, and improved discriminative performance in comparison to clinicopathological data.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a growing public health crisis that requires exigent and efficacious therapeutics. GPR171 is a promising therapeutic target that is widely expressed through the brain, including within the descending pain modulatory regions. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of the GPR171 agonist, MS15203, in its ability to alleviate chronic pain in male and female mice using a once-daily systemic dose (10mg/kg, i.p.) of MS15203 over the course of 5 days. We found that in our models of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), MS15203 did not reduce thermal hypersensitivity and allodynia, respectively, in female mice. On the other hand, MS15203 treatment decreased the duration of thermal hyper-sensitivity in CFA-treated male mice following 3 days of once-daily administration. MS15203 treatment also produced an improvement in allodynia in male mice, but not female mice, in neuropathic pain after 5 days of treatment. Gene expression of GPR171 and that of its endogenous ligand BigLEN, encoded by the gene PCSK1N, were unaltered within the periaqueductal gray in both male and female mice following inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, following neuropathic pain in male mice, the protein levels of GPR171 were decreased in the periaqueductal gray. Treatment with MS15203 then rescued the protein levels of GPR171 in the periaqueductal gray of these mice. Taken together, our results identify GPR171 as a GPCR that displays sexual dimorphism in alleviation of chronic pain. Further, our results suggest that GPR171 and MS15203 have demonstrable therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids have shown clinical promise as delivery vectors for gene therapy. However, the high prevalence of pre-existing immunity against natural capsids poses a challenge for widespread treatment. The generation of diverse capsids that are potentially more capable of immune evasion is challenging because introducing multiple mutations often breaks capsid assembly. Here we target a representative, immunologically relevant 28-amino-acid segment of the AAV2 capsid and show that a low-complexity Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) can interpolate in sequence space to produce diverse and novel capsids capable of packaging their own genomes. We first train the VAE on a 564-sample Multiple-Sequence Alignment (MSA) of dependo-parvoviruses, and then further augment this dataset by adding 22,704 samples from a deep mutational exploration (DME) on the target region. In both cases the VAE generated viable variants with many mutations, which we validated experimentally. We propose that this simple approach can be used to optimize and diversify other proteins, as well as other capsid traits of interest for gene delivery.",
