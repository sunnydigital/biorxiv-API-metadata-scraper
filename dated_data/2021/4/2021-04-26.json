    "abstract": "To make accurate perceptual decisions, the brain often combines information across sensory modalities. For instance, localizing objects by integrating their image and sound. However, the cortical substrates underlying this audiovisual integration remain uncertain. Here, we show that mouse frontal cortex combines auditory and visual evidence; that this combination is additive, mirroring behavior; and that it evolves with learning. Scanning optogenetic inactivation demonstrated that inactivating frontal cortex impaired choices based on either sensory modality. Recordings from >10,000 neurons indicated that after task learning, activity in frontal area MOs (secondary motor cortex) encodes an additive combination of visual and auditory signals, consistent with the mices behavioral strategy. An accumulator model applied to these sensory representations reproduced both the observed choices and reaction times. These results indicate that frontal cortex adapts through learning to combine evidence across sensory cortices, providing a signal that is transformed into a binary decision by a downstream accumulator.",

    "abstract": "Geraniol (GE), a plant-derived acyclic monoterpene, shows a wide variety of beneficial effects. Notably, recent studies have reported the potential sedative effects of GE in fish and rats. However, the mechanisms of GE in sedation remain elusive. Here, we found that GE reduced locomotion, relieved pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, altered the electroencephalogram (EEG), and facilitated general anesthesia in mice. Meanwhile, GE decreased c-Fos expression and suppressed the calcium activity in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT). Microinjection of GE into the PVT reduced locomotion and facilitated propofol-induced anesthesia. Furthermore, the electrophysiology results showed that GE-induced dramatic membrane hyperpolarization and suppressed the neuronal activity of PVT neurons, mainly by prolonging spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and inducing tonic inhibitory currents via GABAA receptors. Our study revealed that GE enhances inhibitory inputs to PVT neurons and induces sedation in mice. These findings provide a potential candidate for further development of sedatives and anesthetics.\n\nGraphic Summary\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/441289v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd8424org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee77caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@faab42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@101b921_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the large herpesvirus family is a very complex human{gamma} -herpesvirus. Its complexity with respect to viral gene regulation, its preferred latent life style and technical difficulties are major obstacles, which hinder efficient virus generation in vitro to mass-produce or establish recombinant wild-type EBV or mutant derivatives. To explore conditions optimizing and improving virus production, we established and tested an EBV gene library with 77 expression plasmids and a set of designed shRNAs. With this tool set we investigated the contributions of individual viral genes in the context of virus synthesis and virion functions. Engineered virus stocks were systematically analyzed with respect to physical and bioparticle concentration, virus titer and virus uptake by primary human B cells, EBVs target cells in vivo. To quantitate virus uptake by these cells, we developed a novel {beta}-lactamase-based assay that can monitor fusion events of the viral envelope with membranes of recipient cells at the level of single cells. Based on our findings, EBV does not encode a dominant regulator that governs virus production, but our results identified several EBV genes such as BALF4, BVLF1 and BKRF4, encoding a viral glycoprotein, a transcriptional regulator of late viral genes, and a possible tegument protein, respectively, that improve virus production regarding virus yield, virus composition and quality, and virus uptake by primary human B cells.\n\nImportanceFor more than 20 years HEK293 cells have been instrumental to produce virus stocks of recombinant EBV. The identification of this cell line as a source of infectious EB virions was unexpected because HEK293 cells are very distant from B cells and in particular plasma cells which produce EBV progeny in vivo. To our knowledge, no systematic analysis has addressed the fundamental question whether virus yield with respect to virus concentration, virion composition and functionality can be improved to produce recombinant EBV stocks in HEK293 cells. We tackled this question and analyzed 77 individual EBV genes for their possible contribution to virus yield. To analyze and compare different virus stocks we used established and developed novel assays to characterize important parameters of EB virions and their functions.",

We generated patient derived organoids as a novel diagnostic strategy and observed that PDX1188delC/188delC antral organoids convert to an intestinal phenotype, while intestinal organoids undergo gastric metaplasia with significant reduction in enteroendocrine cells. This prompted a re-examination of gastric and intestinal biopsies from both PDX1188delC/188delC patients, which recapitulated organoid phenotypes. Antral biopsies had increased parietal cells and lacked G-cells suggesting loss of antral identity. These patients will now be monitored for the progression of metaplasia.

    "abstract": "Long-term monoculture agriculture systems could lead to soil degradation and yield decline. The ways in which soil microbiotas interact with one another, particularly in response to long-term tea monoculture systems are currently unclear. In this study, through the comparison of three independent tea plantations across eastern China composed of varying stand ages (from 3 years to 90 years after conversion from forest), we found that long-term tea monoculture led to significant increases in soil total organic carbon (TOC) and microbial nitrogen (MBN). Additionally, the structure, function and co-occurrence network of soil microbial communities were investigated by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA genes. The pyrosequencing analysis revealed that structures and functions of soil bacterial communities were significantly affected by different stand ages of tea plantations, but sampling sites and land-use conversion (from forest to tea plantation) still outcompeted stand age to control the diversity and structure of soil bacterial communities. Further RDA analysis revealed that the C and N availability improvement in tea plantation soils led to variation of structure and function in soil microbial communities. Moreover, co-occurrence network analysis of soil bacterial communities also demonstrated that interactions among soil bacteria taxa were strengthened with the increasing stand age of respective tea stands. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of long-term monoculture stand age on soil nutrient dynamics and bacterial communities in tea production.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genetic control of sex determinism in teleost species is poorly understood. This is partly because of the diversity of sex determining mechanisms in this large group, including constitutive genes linked to sex chromosomes, polygenic constitutive mechanisms, environmental factors, hermaphroditism, and unisexuality. Here we use a de novo genome assembly of New Zealand silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus) together with whole genome sequencing to detect sexually divergent regions, identify candidate genes and develop molecular makers.\n\nResultsThe de novo assembly of an unsexed trevally (Trevally_v1) resulted in an assembly of 579.4 Mb in length, with a N50 of 25.2 Mb. Of the assembled scaffolds, 24 were of chromosome scale, ranging from 11 to 31 Mb. A total of 28416 genes were annotated after 12.8% of the assembly was masked with repetitive elements. Whole genome re-sequencing of 13 sexed trevally (7 males, 6 females) identified sexually divergent regions located on two scaffolds, including a 6 kb region at the proximal end of chromosome 21. Blast analyses revealed similarity between one region and the aromatase genes cyp19 (a1a/b). Males contained higher numbers of heterozygous variants in both regions, while females showed regions of very low read-depth, indicative of deletions. Molecular markers tested on 96 histologically-sexed fish (42 males, 54 females). Three markers amplified in absolute correspondence with sex.\n\nConclusionsThe higher number of heterozygous variants in males combined with deletions in females support a XY sex-determination model, indicating the trevally_v1 genome assembly was based on a male. This sex system contrasts with the ZW-type sex system documented in closely related species. Our results indicate a likely sex-determining function of the cyp19b-like gene, suggesting the molecular pathway of sex determination is somewhat conserved in this family. Our genomic resources will facilitate future comparative genomics works in teleost species, and enable improved insights into the varied sex determination pathways in this group of vertebrates. The sex marker will be a valuable resource for aquaculture breeding programmes, and for determining sex ratios and sex-specific impacts in wild fisheries stocks of this species.",

Isotopic labeling is an effective way to identify natural products that incorporate a specific precursor; however, this approach is limited by the availability of isotopically-enriched precursors. We used an inverse stable isotopic labeling approach to identify natural products by growing bacteria on a 13C-carbon source and then identifying 12C-precursor incorporation by mass spectrometry. We applied this approach to methylotrophs, ecologically important bacteria predicted to have significant yet underexplored biosynthetic potential. We demonstrate this method identifies N-acyl homoserine lactone quorum sensing signals produced by diverse methylotrophs grown on three different one-carbon compounds. We then apply this approach to simultaneously identify five uncharacterized signals produced by a methylotroph, and link these compounds to their synthases. We envision that this method can be used to identify other natural product classes synthesized by methylotrophs and other organisms that grow on relatively inexpensive 13C-carbon sources.",

    "abstract": "SummaryFabry disease is a lysosomal disease due to -galactosidase A (a-GalA) deficiency. Since 2001, Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been used as specific treatment of Fabry disease, with variable effects depending on patient gender and affected organs. In Fabry cells, the endososomal/lysosomal system is highly altered. Consequently, the exogenous enzyme may be mistargeted and trapped into intracellular vesicles instead of reaching the lysosomes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the processing of the exogenous enzyme. We used Fabry cells (cultured fibroblasts and podocyte cell line) to study the enzyme internalization and its effects on the catabolism of the main a-Gal A substrate, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), upon autophagy inhibition. The exogenous enzyme reaches the early endosome in a similar timeframe in Fabry and control cells, while its targeting to lysosomes is delayed in Fabry cells. Gb3 concentration is lowered upon therapeutic enzyme addition or wortmannin treatment with a synergetic effect. These findings illustrate the positive impact of autophagy inhibition on enzyme trafficking and processing, allowing the increase of functional enzyme rate within the lysosome. Given the high cost of ERT, a better understanding of the cellular fate of the exogenous enzyme may lead to improve its targeting to the lysosome.",

This larva can further transit into an anhydrobiotic state and survive harsh desiccation. We previously identified the genetic and biochemical pathways essential for survival -- but without an accompanying physical model, the mechanistic understanding of this amazing phenomenon will remain inadequate. Neither microscopic investigation of structural changes upon entry into anhydrobiosis nor the most basic quantitative characterization of material properties of living desiccated larvae, however, have been feasible, due to lack of appropriate techniques. Here, we employed optical diffraction tomography (ODT) to quantitatively assess the internal mass density distribution of living larvae in the reproductive and diapause stages. More importantly, ODT allowed for the first time physical analysis of desiccated dauer larvae: their mass density was significantly increased in the anhydrobiotic state. We also applied ODT on different mutants that are sensitive to desiccation. Remarkably, one of them displayed structural abnormalities in the anhydrobiotic stage that could not be observed either by conventional light or electron microscopy. Our advance opens a door to quantitatively assessing fine differences in material properties and structure necessary to fully understanding an organism on the verge of life and death.",

    "abstract": "The demonstration that spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS) can confer strong disease resistance bypassing the laborious and time-consuming transgenic expression of double-stranded (ds)RNA to induce gene silencing of pathogenic targets was groundbreaking. However, future field applications will require fundamental mechanistic knowledge on dsRNA uptake, processing, and its transfer. There is increasing evidence that extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate the transfer of transgene-derived small interfering (si)RNAs in host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) applications. Here, we examined the role of EVs regarding the translocation of sprayed dsRNA from barley (Hordeum vulgare) to the target fungus Fusarium graminearum. We found barley EVs with 156 nm in size containing predominantly 21 and 19 nucleotide (nt) siRNAs starting with a 5-terminal Adenine. Notably, barley EVs contain less siRNA compared to EVs isolated from transgenic HIGS Arabidopsis plants. Together our results further underpin mechanistic differences between HIGS and SIGS applications and a minor role of EVs in SIGS.",

    "abstract": "Iron is critical for host-pathogen interactions. While pathogens seek to scavenge iron to spread, the host aims at decreasing iron availability to reduce pathogen virulence. Thus, iron sensing and homeostasis are of particular importance to prevent host infection and part of nutritional immunity. While the link between iron homeostasis and immunity pathways is well established in plants, how iron levels are sensed and integrated with immune response pathways remain unknown. We identified a receptor kinase, SRF3 coordinating root growth, iron homeostasis and immunity pathways via regulation of callose synthase activity. These processes are modulated by iron levels and rely on SRF3 extracellular and kinase domain which tune its accumulation and partitioning at the cell surface. Mimicking bacterial elicitation with the flagellin peptide flg22 phenocopies SRF3 regulation upon low iron levels and subsequent SRF3-dependent responses. We propose that SRF3 is part of nutritional immunity responses involved in sensing external iron levels.",

What constraints contributed to the universal adoption of a triplet-codon, rather than quadruplet-codon, genetic code? Here, we investigate the tolerance of the E. coli genetic code to tRNA mutations that increase codon size. We found that tRNAs from all twenty canonical isoacceptor classes can be converted to functional quadruplet tRNAs (qtRNAs), many of which selectively incorporate a single amino acid in response to a specified four-base codon. However, efficient quadruplet codon translation often requires multiple tRNA mutations, potentially constraining evolution. Moreover, while tRNAs were largely amenable to quadruplet conversion, only nine of the twenty aminoacyl tRNA synthetases tolerate quadruplet anticodons. These constitute a functional and mutually orthogonal set, but one that sharply limits the chemical alphabet available to a nascent all-quadruplet code. Our results illuminate factors that led to selection and maintenance of triplet codons in primordial Earth and provide a blueprint for synthetic biologists to deliberately engineer an all-quadruplet expanded genetic code.",

The molecular pathways that allow GABAergic interneuron subtypes in the mammalian brain to recognize their postsynaptic partners remain largely unknown. The transmembrane glycoprotein Dystroglycan is localized to inhibitory synapses in pyramidal neurons, where it is required for the proper function of CCK+ interneurons. We show that deletion of Dystroglycan from pyramidal neurons selectively impairs CCK+ interneuron development during the first postnatal week. In the absence of postsynaptic Dystroglycan, presynaptic CCK+ interneurons fail to elaborate their axons and largely disappear from the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Bax deletion did not rescue CCK+ interneurons, suggesting that they are not eliminated by canonical apoptosis in Dystroglycan mutants. Rather, we observed an increase in CCK+ interneuron innervation of the striatum, suggesting that the remaining CCK+ interneurons re-directed their axons to neighboring areas where Dystroglycan expression remained intact. Together these findings identify Dystroglycan as a critical regulator of CCK+ interneuron development.",

    "abstract": "Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes develop in the bone marrow and migrate to the site of infection during inflammation. Upon recruitment, Ly6Chi monocytes can differentiate into dendritic cells or macrophages. According to the tissue environment they can also acquire different functions. Several studies have described pre-activation of Ly6Chi monocytes in the bone marrow during parasitic infection, but whether this process occurs during experimental visceral leishmaniasis and, if so, the mechanisms contributing to their activation are yet to be established. In wild type C57BL/6 (B6) mice infected with Leishmania donovani, the number of bone marrow Ly6Chi monocytes increased over time. Ly6Chi monocytes displayed a highly activated phenotype from 28 days to 5 months post infection (p.i), with >90% expressing MHCII and >20% expressing iNOS. In comparison, in B6.Rag2-/- mice <10% of bone marrow monocytes were MHCII+ at day 28 p.i., an activation deficiency that was reversed by adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells. Depletion of CD4+ T cells in B6 mice and the use of mixed bone marrow chimeras further indicated that monocyte activation was driven by IFN-{gamma} produced by CD4+ T cells. In B6.Il10-/- mice, L. donovani infection induced a faster but transient activation of bone marrow monocytes, which correlated with the magnitude of CD4+ T cell production of IFN-{gamma} and resolution of the infection. Under all of the above conditions, monocyte activation was associated with greater control of parasite load in the bone marrow. Through reinfection studies in B6.Il10-/- mice and drug (AmBisome) treatment of B6 mice, we also show the dependence of monocyte activation on parasite load. In summary, these data demonstrate that during L. donovani infection, Ly6Chi monocytes are primed in the bone marrow in a process driven by CD4+ T cells and whereby IFN-{gamma} promotes and IL-10 limits monocyte activation and that the presence of parasites/parasite antigen plays a crucial role in maintaining bone marrow monocyte activation.",

Here we visualized the subcellular location of viral particles formed during replication of Pseudomonas nucleus-forming jumbo phages and discovered that they assemble a unique structure inside cells we term phage bouquets. We show that after capsids complete DNA packaging at the surface of the phage nucleus, tails assemble and attach to the capsids, and these particles accumulate to form bouquets at specific subcellular locations. In these bouquets, the viral particles are arranged in a spherical pattern with tails oriented inward and the heads outwards. Localized at fixed distances on either side of the phage nucleus, bouquets grow in size and number over time as new phage particles are added. In the presence of mutations that cause the phage nucleus to be mispositioned away from its typical position at the midcell, bouquets still localize at the same fixed distance from the nucleus, suggesting an active mechanism for their formation and positioning. These results mark the discovery of a pathway for organizing mature viral particles inside bacteria and demonstrate that nucleus-forming jumbo phage, like most eukaryotic viruses, are highly spatially organized during all stages of their lytic cycle.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWClimate-smart land management practices that replace shallow-rooted annual crop systems with deeply-rooted perennial plants can contribute to soil carbon sequestration. However, deep soil carbon accrual may be influenced by active microbial biomass and their capacity to assimilate fresh carbon at depth. Incorporating active microbial biomass, dormancy and growth in microbially-explicit models can improve our ability to predict soils capacity to store carbon. But, so far, the microbial parameters that are needed for such modeling are poorly constrained, especially in deep soil layers. Here, we investigated whether a change in crop rooting depth affects microbial growth kinetics in deep soils compared to surface soils. We used a lab incubation experiment and growth kinetics model to estimate how microbial parameters vary along 240 cm of soil depth in profiles under shallow- (soy) and deeply-rooted plants (switchgrass) 11 years after plant cover conversion. We also assessed resource origin and availability (total organic carbon, 14C, dissolved organic carbon, specific UV absorbance, total nitrogen, total dissolved nitrogen) along the soil profiles to examine associations between soil chemical and biological parameters. Even though root biomass was higher and rooting depth was deeper under switchgrass than soy, resource availability and microbial growth parameters were generally similar between vegetation types. Instead, depth significantly influenced soil chemical and biological parameters. For example, resource availability, and total and relative active microbial biomass decreased with soil depth. Decreases in the relative active microbial biomass coincided with increased lag time (response time to external carbon inputs) along the soil profiles. Even at a depth of 210-240 cm, microbial communities were activated to grow by added resources within a day. Maximum specific growth rate decreased to a depth of 90 cm and then remained consistent in deeper layers. Our findings show that > 10 years of vegetation and rooting depth changes may not be long enough to alter microbial growth parameters, and suggest that at least a portion of the microbial community in deep soils can grow rapidly in response to added resources. Our study determined microbial growth parameters that can be used in microbially-explicit models to simulate carbon dynamics in deep soil layers.",

    "abstract": "Cattle ranching is the largest driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The rainforest- to-pasture conversion affects the methane cycle in upland soils, changing it from sink to source of atmospheric methane. However, it remains unknown if management practices could reduce the impact of land-use on methane cycling. In this work, we evaluated how pasture management can regulate the soil methane cycle either by maintaining continuous grass coverage on pasture soils, or by liming the soil to amend acidity. Methane fluxes from forest and pasture soils were evaluated in moisture-controlled greenhouse experiments with and without grass cover (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) or liming. In parallel, we assessed changes in the soil microbial community structure of both bare pasture soil as well as rhizosphere soil through high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and quantified the methane cycling microbiota by their respective marker genes related to methane generation (mcrA) or oxidation (pmoA). The experiments used soils from eastern and western Amazonia, and concurrent field studies allowed us to confirm greenhouse data. The presence of a grass cover not only increased methane uptake by up to 35% in pasture soils, but also reduced the abundance of the methane-producing community. In the grass rhizosphere this reduction was up to 10-fold. Methane-producing archaea belonged to the genera Methanosarcina sp., Methanocella sp., Methanobacterium sp., and Rice Cluster I. Further, we showed that liming compromised the capacity of forest and pasture soils to be a sink for methane, and instead converted formerly methane-consuming forest soils to become methane sources in only 40-80 days. Our results demonstrate that pasture management that maintains grass coverage can mitigate soil methane emissions, if compared to a bare pasture soil.",

    "abstract": "DNA viruses and retroviruses need to consume large quantities of deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) when replicating within infected cells. The human antiviral factor SAMHD1 takes advantage of this vulnerability in the viral life cycle, and inhibits viral replication by degrading dNTPs into their constituent deoxynucleosides and inorganic phosphate. In this study we report that bacteria employ a similar strategy to defend against phage infection. We found a family of defensive dCTP deaminase proteins that, in response to phage infection, convert dCTP into deoxy-uracil nucleotides. A second family of phage resistance genes encode dGTPase enzymes, which degrade dGTP into phosphate-free deoxy-guanosine (dG) and are distant homologs of the human SAMHD1. Our results show that the defensive proteins completely eliminate the specific deoxynucleotide (either dCTP or dGTP) from the nucleotide pool during phage infection, thus starving the phage of an essential DNA building block and halting its replication. Both defensive genes are found in a diverse set of bacterial species and are specifically enriched in Vibrio genomes. Our study demonstrates that manipulation of the deoxynucleotide pool is a potent antiviral strategy shared by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The enterovirus genus encompasses many clinically important human pathogens such as poliovirus, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, numbered enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. These viruses are the etiological agents of several human diseases, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease, neonatal sepsis, encephalitis, meningitis, paralysis and respiratory infections. There is an unmet need for antivirals to treat these diseases. The non-structural protein 2C is a AAA+ helicase and plays a key role in viral replication. As such, it is an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Several repurposing screens with FDA-approved drugs have identified 2C-targeting compounds such as fluoxetine and dibucaine, but the molecular basis of 2C inhibition has remained enigmatic. Here we present the 1.5 [A] resolution crystal structure of the soluble fragment of coxsackievirus B3 2C protein in complex with (S)-fluoxetine (SFX), which reveals a conserved, hydrophobic drug-binding pocket which is distal to the ATP binding site. To decipher the molecular mechanism of inhibition by fluoxetine and other 2C-targeting compounds, we engineered a soluble, hexameric and ATPase competent 2C protein. Using this system, we show that SFX, dibucaine, HBB and guanidine hydrochloride inhibit 2C ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, using cryo-EM analysis, we demonstrate that SFX and dibucaine lock 2C in a defined hexameric state, rationalizing their mode of inhibition and allowing us to generate the first reconstruction of the oligomeric complex. Taken together, these results provide important structural and mechanistic insights into 2C inhibition and provide a robust engineering strategy which can be used for structural, functional and drug-screening analysis of 2C proteins from current or future enteroviruses.",

While how PTIP recognizes 53BP1 is known, the molecular details of RIF1 recruitment to DNA damage sites remains undefined. Here, we report that RIF1 is a phosphopeptide-binding protein that directly interacts with three phosphorylated 53BP1 epitopes. The RIF1-binding sites on 53BP1 share an essential LxL motif followed by two closely apposed phosphorylated residues. Simultaneous mutation of these sites on 53BP1 abrogates RIF1 accumulation into ionizing radiation-induced foci, but surprisingly only fully compromises 53BP1-dependent DNA repair when an alternative mode of shieldin recruitment to DNA damage sites is also disabled. Intriguingly, this alternative mode of recruitment still depends on RIF1 but does not require its interaction with 53BP1. RIF1 therefore employs phosphopeptide recognition to promote DNA repair but also modifies shieldin action independently of 53BP1 binding.",

We characterized a set of 15 yeast MRPs in vivo and showed that 30% of them use internal mitochondrial targeting signals. We isolated a novel internal targeting signal from the conserved MRP Mrp17 (bS6). The Mrp17 targeting signal shares some properties as well as import components with conventional MTS-containing proteins but is not reliably predicted indicating that mitochondrial protein targeting is more versatile than expected. We hypothesize that internal targeting signals arose in MRPs when the N-terminus extension was constrained by ribosome assembly interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells are the most promising regenerative medicine tool for the treatment of various diseases, including liver disease, although the exact mechanism of their therapeutic action remains unclear. It was found that MSCs are captured by the lungs after systemic transplantation, quickly disappear, and are not detected at the site of injury, but at the same time exhibit an obvious therapeutic effect. Comparison of the MSC efficiency depending on the route of their administration may shed light on the mechanisms involved in the implementation of MSC therapeutic potential. In this work, we compared the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord MSCs (hUC-MSCs) administered systemically and intraperitoneally in the form of MSCs encapsulated in alginate capsules in a CCl4-induced model of liver cirrhosis in rats. Our study showed that both treatments resulted in liver recovery. MSC transplantation by two different routes led to a decrease in collagen deposition, the disappearance of the fibrous area by the 13th week, and normalization of the morphometric parameters of liver parenchyma cells. The expression of some genes (EGF, alpha SMA, GFAP) which is activated in liver injury, decreased to the level observed in negative control animals. However, a detailed study of liver recovery in dynamics showed that encapsulated MSCs led to faster normalization in several parameters of the liver tissue. Our results showed that human umbilical cord MSCs effectively exhibit their therapeutic properties when using both methods of transplantation, however, intraperitoneal administration of encapsulated MSCs accelerated the process of liver regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Testis differentiation is initiated when Sry in pre-Sertoli cells directs the gonad toward a male-specific fate. Sertoli cells are essential for testis development, but cell types within the interstitial compartment, such as immune and endothelial cells, are also critical for organ formation. Our previous work implicated macrophages in fetal testis morphogenesis, but little is known about genes underlying immune cell development during organogenesis. Here we examine the role of the immune-associated genes Mafb and Maf in mouse fetal gonad development, and we demonstrate that deletion of these genes leads to aberrant hematopoiesis manifested by supernumerary gonadal monocytes. Mafb;Maf double knockout embryos underwent initial gonadal sex determination normally, but exhibited testicular hypervascularization, testis cord formation defects, Leydig cell deficit, and a reduced number of germ cells. In general, Mafb and Maf alone were dispensable for gonad development; however, when both genes were deleted, we observed significant defects in testicular morphogenesis, indicating that Mafb and Maf work redundantly during testis differentiation. These results demonstrate previously unappreciated roles for Mafb and Maf in immune and vascular development and highlight the importance of interstitial cells in gonadal differentiation.\n\nSummary statementDeletion of Mafb and Maf genes leads to supernumerary monocytes in fetal mouse gonads, resulting in vascular, morphogenetic, and differentiation defects during testicular organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to understand the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic variation are becoming more and more frequent in molecular ecology. Such efforts often lead to the identification of candidate regions showing signals of association and/or selection. These regions may contain multiple genes and therefore validation of which genes are actually responsible for the signal is required. In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a large-effect locus for maturation timing, an ecologically important trait, occurs in a genomic region including two genes, vgll3 and akap11, but data for clearly determining which of the genes (or both) contribute to the association have been lacking. Here, we take advantage of natural recombination events detected between the two candidate genes in a salmon broodstock to reduce linkage disequilibrium at the locus, and thus enabling delineation of the influence of variation at these two genes on maturation timing. By rearing 5895 males to maturation age, of which 81% had recombinant vgll3/akap11 allelic combinations, we found that vgll3 SNP variation was strongly associated with maturation timing, whereas there was little or no association between akap11 SNP variation and maturation timing. These findings provide strong evidence supporting vgll3 as the primary candidate gene in the chromosome 25 locus for influencing maturation timing. This will help guide future research for understanding the genetic processes controlling maturation timing. This also exemplifies the utility of natural recombinants to more precisely map causal variation underlying ecologically important phenotypic diversity.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mitoUPR) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that responds to various insults to the mitochondria through transcriptional changes that restore mitochondrial homeostasis in order to facilitate cell survival. Gene expression changes resulting from the activation of the mitoUPR are mediated by the transcription factor ATFS-1/ATF-5. To further define the mechanisms through which the mitoUPR protects the cell during mitochondrial dysfunction, we characterized the role of ATFS-1 in responding to organismal stress. We found that activation of ATFS-1 is sufficient to cause upregulation of genes involved in multiple stress response pathways, including the DAF-16-mediated stress response pathway, the SKN-1-mediated oxidative stress response pathway, the HIF-mediated hypoxia response pathway, the p38-mediated innate immune response pathway, and antioxidant genes. Moreover, ATFS-1 is required for the upregulation of stress response genes after exposure to exogenous stressors, especially oxidative stress and bacterial pathogens. Constitutive activation of ATFS-1 increases resistance to multiple acute exogenous stressors, while disruption of atfs-1 decreases stress resistance. Although ATFS-1-dependent genes are upregulated in multiple long-lived mutants, constitutive activation of ATFS-1 in wild-type animals results in decreased lifespan. Overall, our work demonstrates that ATFS-1 serves a vital role in organismal survival of acute stresses through its ability to activate multiple stress response pathways, but that chronic ATFS-1 activation is detrimental for longevity.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial nanocompartments, also known as encapsulins, are an emerging class of protein-based  organelles found in bacteria and archaea. Encapsulins are virus-like icosahedral particles comprising a [~]25-50 nm shell surrounding a specific cargo enzyme. Compartmentalization is thought to create a unique chemical environment to facilitate catalysis and isolate toxic intermediates. Many questions regarding nanocompartment structure-function remain unanswered, including how shell symmetry dictates cargo loading and to what extent the shell facilitates enzymatic activity. Here, we explore these questions using the model T. maritima nanocompartment known to encapsulate a redox-active ferritin-like protein. Biochemical analysis revealed the encapsulin shell to possess a flavin binding site located at the interface between capsomere subunits, suggesting the shell may play a direct and active role in the function of the encapsulated cargo. Furthermore, we used cryoEM to show that cargo proteins use a form of symmetry-matching to facilitate encapsulation and define stoichiometry. In the case of the T. maritima encapsulin, the decameric cargo protein with 5-fold symmetry preferentially binds to the pentameric-axis of the icosahedral shell. Taken together, these observations suggest the shell is not simply a passive barrier--it also plays a significant role in the structure and function of the cargo enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Among the many health benefits Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) presents, anti-aging is of special interest (Shen, Jiang, Yang, Wang, & Zhu, 2017; Zhao & Luo, 2017). Reported to possess anti-aging effects, the CHM Rhodiola rosea L., known colloquially as the \"golden root\", has been widely incorporated in various drinks, daily supplements, and even cosmetics. This study investigates the effects of commercial R. rosea extracts and natural R. rosea roots on preventing UV-induced photoaging of the skin and correlates such effects with the composition of active ingredients in the extracts. To simulate the photoaging process, drug treated HaCaT cells were exposed to UVA and UVB radiation. The pharmacological anti-aging effects of R. rosea extracts were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively through confocal immunofluorescence images with {gamma}-H2A.X marker and telomerase activity assay (Telo TAGGG Telomerase PCR-ELISA). Preparatory thin layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography were performed to isolate and quantify active ingredients. Cultured HaCaT cells showed morphological change after exposure to both UVA (>15.0 J) and UVB (>2000 mJ). The photoaging of keratinocytes was rescued by pretreating cells with R. rosea extracts as well as salidroside and rosavin active ingredients (P < 0.05). R. rosea-treated cells were characterized by increased telomerase activity and fewer {gamma}-H2A.X foci compared to that of the control. Extracts with better preventative effects contained higher salidroside and rosavin content. The findings in this study reaffirm R. roseas efficacy as an anti-aging remedy and provide a basis for CHMs integration into the mainstream of global healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Massively parallel short read transcriptome sequencing has greatly expanded our knowledge of fusion genes which are drivers of tumor initiation and progression. In cancer, many fusions are also important diagnostic markers and targets for therapy. Long read transcriptome sequencing allows the full length of fusion transcripts to be discovered, however, this data has a high rate of errors and fusion finding algorithms designed for short reads do not work. While numerous fusion finding algorithms now exist for short read RNA sequencing data, there are few methods to detect fusions using third generation or long read sequencing data. Fusion finding in long read sequencing will allow the discovery of the full isoform structure of fusion genes.\n\nHere we present JAFFAL, a method to identify fusions from long-read transcriptome sequencing. We validated JAFFAL using simulation, cell line and patient data from Nanopore and PacBio. We show that fusions can be accurately detected in long read data with JAFFAL, providing better accuracy than other long read fusion finders and with similar performance as state-of-the-art methods applied to short read data. By comparing Nanopore transcriptome sequencing protocols we find that numerous chimeric molecules are generated during cDNA library preparation that are absent when RNA is sequenced directly. We demonstrate that JAFFAL enables fusions to be detected at the level of individual cells, when applied to long read single cell sequencing. Moreover, we demonstrate JAFFAL can identify fusions spanning three genes, highlighting the utility of long reads to characterise the transcriptional products of complex structural rearrangements with unprecedented resolution. JAFFAL is open source and available as part of the JAFFA package at https://github.com/Oshlack/JAFFA/wiki.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes TMPRSS2 receptor to enter target human cells and subsequently causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). TMPRSS2 belongs to the type II serine proteases of subfamily TMPRSS, which is characterized by the presence of the serine-protease domain. TMPRSS4 is another TMPRSS member, which has a domain architecture similar to TMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 have been shown to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their normal physiological roles have not been explored in detail. In this study, we analyzed the amino acid sequences and predicted 3D structures of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 to understand their functional aspects at the protein domain level. Our results suggest that these proteins are likely to have common functions based on their conserved domain organization. Furthermore, we show that the predicted 3D structure of their serine protease domain has significant similarity to that of plasminogen which dissolves blood clot, and of other blood coagulation related proteins. Additionally, molecular docking analyses of inhibitors of four blood coagulation and anticoagulation factors show the same high specificity to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 3D structures. Hence, our observations are consistent with the blood coagulopathy observed in COVID-19 patients and their predicted functions based on the sequence and structural analyses offer avenues to understand better and explore therapeutic approaches for this disease.",

    "abstract": "In order to infect a cell, enveloped viruses must first undergo membrane fusion, which proceeds through a hemifusion intermediate, followed by the formation of a fusion pore through which the viral genome is transferred to a target cell. Single-virus fusion studies to elucidate the dynamics of content mixing typically require extensive fluorescent labeling of viral contents. The labeling process must be optimized depending on the virus identity and strain and can potentially be perturbative to viral fusion behavior. Here, we introduce a single-virus assay where content-labeled vesicles are bound to unlabeled influenza A virus (IAV) to eliminate the problematic step of content-labeling virions. We use fluorescence microscopy to observe individual, pH-triggered content mixing and content loss events between IAV and target vesicles of varying cholesterol compositions. We show that target membrane cholesterol increases the efficiency of IAV content mixing and decreases the fraction of content mixing events that result in content loss. These results are consistent with previous findings that cholesterol stabilizes pore formation in IAV entry and limits leakage following pore formation. We also show that content loss due to hemagglutinin fusion peptide engagement with the target membrane is independent of composition. This approach is a promising strategy for studying the single-virus content mixing kinetics of other enveloped viruses.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTo replicate, enveloped viruses, like influenza A virus, must successfully deliver their contents to a host cell through viral membrane fusion. Most single-virus fusion assays require extensive fluorescent labeling of virions which can be perturbative to fusion kinetics. Here, we utilize content-labeled vesicles in a single-virus content mixing assay, which eliminates the need to fluorescently label virus contents. We use this assay to show that target membrane cholesterol increases the fraction of stable influenza virus content mixing events. This assay also enables the study of target membrane destabilization due to viral fusion peptide engagement.",

    "abstract": "Th17 cells protect mucosal barriers, but their aberrant activity can cause autoimmunity. Molecular networks dictating human Th17 function are largely unexplored, and this hinders disease-studies. Here, we investigated the roles of the AP-1 factors, FOSL1 and FOSL2, in inducing human Th17 responses. Transient knockdown and over-expression strategies found the two proteins to inhibit Th17-cell identity, while revealing a distinct cooperativity between their functions. Strikingly, FOSL1 plays different roles in human and mouse and FOSL-mediated Th17 regulation is opposed by the AP-1 factor, BATF. Genome-wide occupancy analysis demonstrated the co-localization of FOSL1, FOSL2 and BATF in the vicinity of key Th17 genes. The functional interplay among these factors is possibly governed by sharing interactions with a common set of lineage-associated proteins. We further discovered that the genomic binding sites of these factors harbour a large number of disease-linked SNPs, many of which alter the ability of a given factor to bind DNA. Our findings thus provide crucial insights into the transcriptional regulation of human Th17 function and associated pathologies.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYFOSL1- and FOSL2-mediated transcription during early human Th17 differentiation",

    "abstract": "Coordinated polarization of cells in the tissue plane, known as planar cell polarity (PCP), is associated with a signaling pathway critical for the control of morphogenetic processes. Although the segregation of PCP components to opposite cell borders is believed to play a critical role in this pathway, whether PCP derives from egg polarity or preexistent long-range gradient, or forms in response to a localized cue remains a challenging question. Here we investigate the Xenopus neural plate, a tissue that has been previously shown to exhibit PCP. By imaging Vangl2 and Prickle3, we show that PCP is progressively acquired in the neural plate and requires a signal from the posterior region of the embryo. Tissue transplantations indicated that PCP is triggered in the neural plate by a planar cue from the dorsal blastopore lip. The PCP cue did not depend on the orientation of the graft and was distinct from neural inducers. These observations suggest that neuroectodermal PCP is not instructed by a preexisting molecular gradient, but induced by a signal from the dorsal blastopore lip.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe Xenopus neural plate progressively acquires PCP in a posterior-to-anterior direction.\nC_LIO_LIThe dorsal blastopore lip is likely the source of the PCP-instructing signal for the Xenopus neural plate.\nC_LIO_LIThe PCP cue is distinct from neural inducers and has a planar mode of transmission.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genetic evidence indicates disrupted epigenetic regulation as a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, but the molecular mechanisms that drive this association are undetermined. EHMT1 is an epigenetic repressor that is causal for Kleefstra Syndrome (KS), a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) leading to ID, and is associated with schizophrenia. Here, we show that reduced EHMT1 activity decreases NRSF/REST protein leading to abnormal neuronal gene expression and progression of neurodevelopment in human iPSC. We further show that EHMT1 regulates NRSF/REST indirectly via repression of miRNA leading to aberrant neuronal gene regulation and neurodevelopment timing. Expression of a NRSF/REST mRNA that lacks the miRNA-binding sites restores neuronal gene regulation to EHMT1 deficient cells. Importantly, the EHMT1-regulated miRNA gene set with elevated expression is enriched for NRSF/REST regulators with an association for ID and schizophrenia. This reveals a molecular interaction between H3K9 dimethylation and NSRF/REST contributing to the aetiology of psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The switch between HIV latency and productive transcription is regulated by an auto-feedback mechanism initiated by the viral trans-activator Tat, which functions to recruit the host transcription elongation factor P-TEFb to proviral HIV. A heterodimeric complex of CDK9 and one of three cyclin T subunits, P-TEFb is expressed at vanishingly low levels in resting memory CD4+ T cells and cellular mechanisms controlling its availability are central to regulation of the emergence of HIV from latency. Using a well-characterized primary T-cell model of HIV latency alongside healthy donor memory CD4+ T cells, we characterized specific T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways that regulate the generation of transcriptionally active P-TEFb, defined as the coordinate expression of cyclin T1 and phospho-Ser175 CDK9. Protein kinase C (PKC) agonists, such as ingenol and prostratin, stimulated active P-TEFb expression and reactivated latent HIV with minimal cytotoxicity, even in the absence of intracellular calcium mobilization with an ionophore. Unexpectedly, inhibition-based experiments demonstrated that PKC agonists and TCR-mobilized diacylglycerol signal through MAP kinases ERK1/2 rather than through PKC to effect the reactivation of both P-TEFb and latent HIV. Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses revealed that of the four known isoforms of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP, RasGRP1 is by far the predominantly expressed diacylglycerol-dependent isoform in CD4+ T cells. RasGRP1 should therefore mediate the activation of ERK1/2 via Ras-Raf signaling upon TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge. Combined inhibition of the PI3K-mTORC2-AKT-mTORC1 pathway and the ERK1/2 activator MEK prior to TCR co-stimulation abrogated active P-TEFb expression and substantially suppressed latent HIV reactivation. Therefore, contrary to prevailing models, the coordinate reactivation of P-TEFb and latent HIV in primary T cells following either TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge is independent of PKC but rather involves two complementary signaling arms of the TCR cascade, namely, RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-mTORC2-AKT-mTORC1.\n\nAuthor SummaryDissecting the cellular pathways through which HIV emerges from latency is a key step in the development of therapeutically viable approaches for latency reversal and eventual clearance of persistent HIV in infected individuals. The essential host transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, a heterodimer of CDK9 kinase and a regulatory cyclin T subunit, is a critical mediator of the trans-activation of latent HIV. Availability of P-TEFb for proviral transcription is highly limited due to a posttranscriptional restriction in cyclin T1 expression and dephosphorylation of CDK9 on its activation loop. Using a well-characterized primary T-cell model of HIV latency alongside healthy donor memory CD4+ T cells, we have now defined the signaling pathways that are essential for the generation of transcriptionally active P-TEFb and, consequently, proviral reactivation. Crucial among these findings is the demonstration that protein kinase C (PKC) agonists signal through off-target activation of RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 to effect the reactivation of both P-TEFb and proviral HIV. Understanding these pathways should lead to the discovery of novel highly selective activators of P-TEFb to improve the efficiency of HIV reactivation in the memory T-cell population of virally suppressed individuals.",
