    "abstract": "Profiling of cis-regulatory elements (CREs, mostly promoters and enhancers) in single cells allows the interrogation of the cell-type and cell-state-specific contexts of gene regulation and genetic predisposition to diseases. Here we demonstrate single-cell RNA-5'end-sequencing (sc-end5-seq) methods can detect transcribed CREs (tCREs), enabling simultaneous quantification of gene expression and enhancer activities in a single assay at no extra cost. We showed enhancer RNAs can be detected using sc-end5-seq methods with either random or oligo(dT) priming. To analyze tCREs in single cells, we developed SCAFE (Single Cell Analysis of Five-prime Ends) to identify genuine tCREs and analyze their activities (https://github.com/chung-lab/scafe). As compared to accessible CRE (aCRE, based on chromatin accessibility), tCREs are more accurate in predicting CRE interactions by co-activity, more sensitive in detecting shifts in alternative promoter usage and more enriched in diseases heritability. Our results highlight additional dimensions within sc-end5-seq data which can be used for interrogating gene regulation and disease heritability.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity replication of the large RNA genome of coronaviruses (CoVs) is mediated by a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) in non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), which excises nucleotides including antiviral drugs mis-incorporated by the low-fidelity viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and has also been implicated in viral RNA recombination and resistance to innate immunity. Here we determined a 1.6-[A] resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ExoN in complex with its essential co-factor, nsp10. The structure shows a highly basic and concave surface flanking the active site, comprising several Lys residues of nsp14 and the N-terminal amino group of nsp10. Modeling suggests that this basic patch binds to the template strand of double-stranded RNA substrates to position the 3' end of the nascent strand in the ExoN active site, which is corroborated by mutational and computational analyses. Molecular dynamics simulations further show remarkable flexibility of multi-domain nsp14 and suggest that nsp10 stabilizes ExoN for substrate RNA-binding to support its exoribonuclease activity. Our high-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 ExoN-nsp10 complex serves as a platform for future development of anti-coronaviral drugs or strategies to attenuate the viral virulence.",

Anatomically matched 3D printed implants are becoming increasingly patient-specific; however the preoperative planning and design process requires several hours of manual effort from highly trained engineers and clinicians. Our work mitigates this problem by proposing algorithms for the automatic re-alignment of unhealthy anatomies, leading to more efficient, affordable, and scalable treatment solutions.\n\nMethodsOur solution combines global alignment techniques such as iterative closest points (ICP) with novel joint space refinement algorithms. The latter is achieved by a low dimensional characterization of the joint space, computed from the distribution of the distance between adjacent points in a joint.\n\nResultsExperimental validation is presented on real clinical data from human subjects. Compared with ground truth healthy anatomies, our algorithms can reduce misalignment errors by 22% in translation and 19% in rotation for the full foot-and-ankle and 37% in translation and 39% in rotation for the hind-foot only, achieving a performance comparable to expert technicians.\n\nConclusionOur methods and histogram-based metric allow for automatic and unsupervised alignment of anatomies, a major step toward a fully automated and data driven re-positioning, designing, and diagnosing tool.",

To support the development of automated locomotion mode recognition systems (i.e., high-level controllers), we designed an environment recognition system using computer vision and deep learning. We collected over 5.6 million images of indoor and outdoor real-world walking environments using a wearable camera system, of which ~923,000 images were annotated using a 12-class hierarchical labelling architecture (called the ExoNet database). We then trained and tested the EfficientNetB0 convolutional neural network, designed for efficiency using neural architecture search, to predict the different walking environments. Our environment recognition system achieved ~73% image classification accuracy. While these preliminary results benchmark Efficient-NetB0 on the ExoNet database, further research is needed to compare different image classification algorithms to develop an accurate and real-time environment-adaptive locomotion mode recognition system for robotic exoskeleton control.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for analyzing the variability in smooth, possibly nonlinear, functionals associated with a set of product production trajectories measured under different experimental conditions. The key challenge is to make meaningful inference on these parameters across different experimental conditions when only a limited number of measurements in time are collected for each treatment, and when there are only a few, or no, replicates available. For this purpose we adopt a modeling approach by representing the production trajectories in a B-spline basis, and develop a bootstrap-based inference procedure for the parameters of interest, also accounting for multiple comparisons. The methodology is applied to study two types of quantities of interest - \"time to harvest\" and \"maximal productivity\" in the context of an experiment on the production of certain recombinant proteins under laboratory conditions. We complement the findings by extensive numerical experiments that look into the effects of different types of bootstrap procedures and associated schemes for computing p-values for tests of hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Immune cells degrade internalized pathogens in phagosomes through sequential biochemical changes. The degradation must be fast enough for effective infection control. The presumption is that each phagosome degrades cargos autonomously with a distinct but stochastic kinetic rate. Here we report that the degradation kinetics of individual phagosomes is not stochastic but coupled to their intracellular motility. By engineering RotSensors that are optically anisotropic, magnetic responsive, and fluorogenic in response to degradation activities in phagosomes, we monitored cargo degradation kinetics in single phagosomes simultaneously with their translational and rotational dynamics. We show that phagosomes that move faster centripetally are more likely to encounter and fuse with lysosomes, thereby acidifying faster and degrading cargos more efficiently. The degradation rates increase nearly linearly with the translational and rotational velocities of phagosomes. Our results indicate that the centripetal motion of phagosomes functions as a clock for controlling the progression of cargo degradation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the clinical benefit of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) ultimately develop lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we identified thioesterase superfamily member 6 (THEM6) as a marker of ADT resistance in PCa. In patients, THEM6 expression correlates with progressive disease and is associated with poor survival. THEM6 deletion reduces in vivo tumour growth and restores castration sensitivity in orthograft models of CRPC. Mechanistically, THEM6 is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and controls lipid homeostasis by regulating intracellular levels of ether lipids. Consequently, THEM6 loss in CRPC cells significantly alters ER function, reducing de novo sterol biosynthesis and preventing lipid-mediated induction of ATF4. Finally, we show that THEM6 is required for the establishment of the MYC-induced stress response. Thus, similar to PCa, THEM6 loss significantly impairs tumorigenesis in the MYC-dependent subtype of triple negative breast cancer. Altogether, our results highlight THEM6 as a novel component of the treatment-induced stress response and a promising target for the treatment of CRPC and MYC-driven cancer.",

We benchmarked the method with extensive simulations, including a wide range of diversification histories and sampling heterogeneities that go well beyond the necessarily simplistic model assumptions. Applying BBB to 198 angiosperm families, we found that their fossil record is compatible with clade origins earlier than most contemporary palaeobotanical interpretations. In particular, we estimated with high probability that crown-angiosperms originated before the Cretaceous (> 145 Ma). Budd and colleagues2 critique our study, arguing that the BBB model is biased towards older estimates when fossil data are scarce or absent, that our underlying fossil dataset is unsound, that our clade age estimates are therefore biased by early diverging lineages that are underrepresented in the fossil record, and that pooling of fossil data for analysis at higher taxonomic ranks overcomes these biases. Here, we explore their points and perform new simulations to show that their critique has no merit.",

In order to cope up with ozone stress, plants exhibit a plethora of morphological, physiological and molecular changes. Various molecular studies have been performed and a variety of genes exhibiting expression in response to ozone stress have been identified. However, no existing database has been designed yet to present information on ozone stress responsive genes differentially expressed across different plant species. The lack of a curated database limits the research potential in the area and therefore a cohesive database should be designed as a data repository of the ozone responsive genes. OSRGD ver. 1.1 is a user friendly web interface to explore ozone stress specific transcriptome dataset of different plant species. It allows users to retrieve the ozone stress responsive gene data by keyword based search. Each entry upon keyword query contains detailed information about the specific species, its foliar injury symptoms, pattern of gene expression, and platform used for gene expression analysis with reference literature. This comprehensive biocuration will offer researchers a better biological insight into plants response to ozone stress which will focus on development of climate smart crops through crop breeding.",

    "abstract": "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is an immediate-early gene product that support neuroplastic changes important for cognitive function and memory formation. As a protein with homology to the retroviral Gag protein, a particular characteristic of Arc is its capacity to self-assemble into virus-like capsids that can package mRNAs and transfer those transcripts to other cells. Although a lot has been uncovered about the contributions of Arc to neuron biology and behavior, very little is known about how different functions of Arc are coordinately regulated both temporally and spatially in neurons. The answer to this question we hypothesized must involve the occurrence of different protein post-translational modifications acting to confer specificity. In this study, we used mass spectrometry and sequence prediction strategies to map novel Arc phosphorylation sites. Our approach led us to recognize serine 67 (S67) and threonine 278 (T278) as residues that can be modified by TNIK, which is a kinase abundantly expressed in neurons that shares many functional overlaps with Arc and has, along with its interacting proteins such as the NMDA receptor, been implicated as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, characterization of each residue using site-directed mutagenesis to create S67 and T278 mutant variants revealed that TNIK action at those amino acids can strongly influence Arcs subcellular distribution and self-assembly as capsids. Together, our findings reveal an unsuspected connection between Arc and TNIK. Better understanding of the interplay between these two proteins in neuronal cells could lead to new insights about apparition and progression of psychiatric disorders.",

To investigate the specific role of T cells in recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections we studied rhesus macaques that were depleted of either CD4+, CD8+ or both T cell subsets prior to infection. Peak virus loads were similar in all groups, but the resolution of virus in the T cell-depleted animals was slightly delayed compared to controls. The T cell-depleted groups developed virus-neutralizing antibody responses and also class-switched to IgG. When re-infected six weeks later, the T cell-depleted animals showed anamnestic immune responses characterized by rapid induction of high-titer virus-neutralizing antibodies, faster control of virus loads and reduced clinical signs. These results indicate that while T cells play a role in the recovery of rhesus macaques from acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, their depletion does not induce severe disease, and T cells do not account for the natural resistance of rhesus macaques to severe COVID-19. Neither primed CD4+ or CD8+ T cells appeared critical for immunoglobulin class switching, the development of immunological memory or protection from a second infection.",

    "abstract": "Lactate accumulation in the human gut is linked to a range of deleterious health impacts. However, lactate is consumed and converted to the beneficial short chain fatty acids butyrate and propionate by indigenous lactate-utilizing bacteria. To better understand the underlying genetic basis for lactate utilization, transcriptomic analysis was performed for two prominent lactate-utilizing species from the human gut, Anaerobutyricum soehngenii and Coprococcus catus, during growth on lactate, hexose sugar, or hexose plus lactate. In A. soehngenii L2-7, six genes of the lct cluster including NAD-independent D-lactate dehydrogenase (i-LDH) were co-ordinately upregulated during growth on equimolar D and L-lactate (DL-lactate). Upregulated genes included an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase related to butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which may play a role in transferring reducing equivalents between reduction of crotonyl-CoA and oxidation of lactate. Genes upregulated in C. catus GD/7 included a six-gene cluster (lap) encoding propionyl CoA-transferase, a putative lactoyl-CoA epimerase, lactoyl-CoA dehydratase and lactate permease, and two unlinked acyl-CoA dehydrogenase genes that are candidates for acryloyl-CoA reductase. An i-LDH homolog in C. catus is encoded by a separate, partial lct, gene cluster, but not upregulated on lactate. While C. catus converts three mols of DL-lactate via the acrylate pathway to two mols propionate and one mol acetate, some of the acetate can be re-used with additional lactate to produce butyrate. A key regulatory difference is that while glucose partially repressed lct cluster expression in A. soehngenii, there was no repression of lactate utilization genes by fructose in the non-glucose utilizer C. catus. This implies that bacteria such as C. catus might be more important in curtailing lactate accumulation in the gut.\n\nImpact statementLactate can be produced as a fermentation by-product by many gut bacteria but has the potential to perturb intestinal microbial communities by lowering luminal pH, and its accumulation has been linked to a range of deleterious health outcomes. Fortunately, in healthy individuals, lactate tends not to accumulate as it is consumed by cross-feeding lactate-utilizing bacteria, which can convert it into the beneficial short chain fatty acids butyrate and propionate. Lactate-utilizing gut bacteria are therefore promising candidates for potential development as novel probiotics. However, lactate-utilizers are taxonomically diverse, and the genes that underpin utilization of lactate by these specialized gut bacteria are not fully understood. In this study we used transcriptomics to compare gene expression profiles of Anaerobutyricum soehngenii and Coprococcus catus, two prominent lactate-utilizing species in the human gut, during growth on lactate alone, sugar alone, or sugar plus lactate. The results revealed strong upregulation of key, but distinct, gene clusters that appear to be responsible for lactate utilization by these, and other, gut bacterial species. Our results therefore increase mechanistic understanding of different lactate utilization pathways used by gut bacteria, which may help to inform selection of optimal lactate-utilizing species for development as novel therapeutics against colonic microbiota perturbations.\n\nData summaryNovel draft genomes generated for this study have been made available from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/) under BioProject number PRJNA701799.

    "abstract": "Investigating the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection is key to better understand COVID-19 immunity and pathogenesis. Infection, which involves both cell attachment and membrane fusion, relies on the ACE2 receptor that is paradoxically found at low levels in the respiratory tract, suggesting that additional mechanisms facilitating infection may exist. Here we show that C-type lectin receptors, DC-SIGN, L-SIGN and the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 1 (SIGLEC1) function as auxiliary receptors by enhancing ACE2-mediated infection and modulating the neutralizing activity of different classes of spike-specific antibodies. Antibodies to the N-terminal domain (NTD) or to the conserved proteoglycan site at the base of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), while poorly neutralizing infection of ACE2 over-expressing cells, effectively block lectin-facilitated infection. Conversely, antibodies to the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM), while potently neutralizing infection of ACE2 over-expressing cells, poorly neutralize infection of cells expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN and trigger fusogenic rearrangement of the spike promoting cell-to-cell fusion. Collectively, these findings identify a lectin-dependent pathway that enhances ACE2-dependent infection by SARS-CoV-2 and reveal distinct mechanisms of neutralization by different classes of spike-specific antibodies.",

    "abstract": "In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more severe outcomes are reported in males compared with females, including hospitalizations and deaths. Animal models can provide an opportunity to mechanistically interrogate causes of sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters (8-10 weeks of age) were inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 and euthanized at several time points during the acute (i.e., virus actively replicating) and recovery (i.e., after the infectious virus has been cleared) phases of infection. There was no mortality, but infected male hamsters experienced greater morbidity, losing a greater percentage of body mass, developing more extensive pneumonia as noted on chest computed tomography, and recovering more slowly than females. Treatment of male hamsters with estradiol did not alter pulmonary damage. Virus titers in respiratory tissues, including nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs, and pulmonary cytokine concentrations, including IFN{beta} and TNF, were comparable between the sexes. However, during the recovery phase of infection, females mounted two-fold greater IgM, IgG, and IgA responses against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (S-RBD) in both plasma and respiratory tissues. Female hamsters also had significantly greater IgG antibodies against whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and mutant S-RBDs, as well as virus neutralizing antibodies in plasma. The development of an animal model to study COVID-19 sex differences will allow for a greater mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 associated sex differences seen in the human population.\n\nImportanceMen experience more severe outcomes from COVID-19 than women. Golden Syrian hamsters were used to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of a human clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. After inoculation, male hamsters experienced greater sickness, developed more severe lung pathology, and recovered more slowly than females. Sex differences in disease could not be reversed by estradiol treatment in males and were not explained by either virus replication kinetics or the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. During the recovery period, antiviral antibody responses in the respiratory tract and plasma, including to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, were greater in females than male hamsters. Greater lung pathology during the acute phase combined with reduced antiviral antibody responses during the recovery phase of infection in males than females illustrate the utility of golden Syrian hamsters as a model to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine-induced immunity and protection.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryFollowing SARS-CoV-2 infection, male hamsters experience worse clinical disease and have lower antiviral antibody responses than females.",

Widespread resistance to fluoroquinolones and pyrazinamide makes it essential to identify new drug candidates and study their effects on current regimens for TB. TB47 is a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide with powerful synergistic in vitro and in vivo activities against mycobacteria, especially with clofazimine. Here, we investigated the bactericidal and sterilizing activities of novel oral regimens containing TB47 + clofazimine + linezolid, and the potential roles of levofloxacin and/or pyrazinamide in such drug combinations. Using a well-established mouse model, we assessed the effect of these regimens on bacterial burden in the lung during treatment and relapse (4 months after stopping treatment + immunosuppression). Our findings indicate that the TB47 + clofazimine + linezolid + pyrazinamide, with/without levofloxacin, regimens had fast-acting (4 months) sterilizing activity and no relapse was observed. When pyrazinamide was excluded from the regimen, treatment times were longer (5-6 months) to achieve sterilizing conditions. We propose that TB47 + clofazimine + linezolid can form a highly sterilizing block for use as an alternative pan-TB regimen.",

The water vole genomes were sequenced with Illumina and 10X Chromium plus Illumina sequencing, resulting in assemblies with ~1,600,000 and ~30,000 scaffolds respectively. The montane vole was assembled into ~13,000 scaffolds using Illumina sequencing also. In addition to the nuclear assemblies, mitochondrial genome assemblies were also performed for both species. We conducted a structural and functional annotation for the best water vole nuclear genome, which resulted in ~24,500 annotated genes, with 83% of these receiving functional annotations. Finally, we find that assembly quality statistics for our nuclear assemblies fall within the range of genomes previously published in the genus Microtus, making the water vole and montane vole genomes useful additions to currently available genomic resources.",

We discuss potential reasons for the observed differences in the drugs preferences for particular sites, including ketoprofen binding determinants in mammalian SAs and the effect of fatty acids on drug binding.

    "abstract": "The adaptation of weedy plants to herbicide is both a significant problem in agriculture and a model for the study of rapid adaptation under regimes of strong selection. Despite recent advances in our understanding of simple genetic changes that lead to resistance, a significant gap remains in our knowledge of resistance controlled by many loci and the evolutionary factors that influence the maintenance of resistance over time. Here, we perform a multi-level analysis involving whole genome sequencing and assembly, resequencing and gene expression analysis to both uncover putative loci involved in nontarget herbicide resistance and to examine evolutionary forces underlying the maintenance of resistance in natural populations. We found loci involved in herbicide detoxification, stress sensing, and alterations in the shikimate acid pathway to be under selection, and confirmed that detoxification is responsible for glyphosate resistance using a functional assay. Furthermore, we found interchromosomal linkage disequilibrium (ILD), most likely associated with epistatic selection, to influence NTSR loci found on separate chromosomes thus potentially mediating resistance through generations. Additionally, by combining the selection screen, differential expression and LD analysis, we identified fitness cost loci that are strongly linked to resistance alleles, indicating the role of genetic hitchhiking in maintaining the cost. Overall, our work strongly suggests that NTSR glyphosate resistance in I. purpurea is conferred by multiple genes which are maintained through generations via ILD, and that the fitness cost associated with resistance in this species is a by-product of genetic-hitchhiking.",

    "abstract": "While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains one of the most widespread and important methods in basic and clinical neuroscience, the data it produces--time series of brain volumes--continue to pose daunting analysis challenges. The current standard (\"mass univariate\") approach involves constructing a matrix of task regressors, fitting a separate general linear model at each volume pixel (\"voxel\"), computing test statistics for each model, and correcting for false positives post hoc using bootstrap or other resampling methods. Despite its simplicity, this approach has enjoyed great success over the last two decades due to: 1) its ability to produce effect maps highlighting brain regions whose activity significantly correlates with a given variable of interest; and 2) its modeling of experimental effects as separable and thus easily interpretable. However, this approach suffers from several well-known drawbacks, namely: inaccurate assumptions of linearity and noise Gaussianity; a limited ability to capture individual effects and variability; and difficulties in performing proper statistical testing secondary to independently fitting voxels. In this work, we adopt a different approach, modeling entire volumes directly in a manner that increases model flexibility while preserving interpretability. Specifically, we use a generalized additive model (GAM) in which the effects of each regressor remain separable, the product of a spatial map produced by a variational autoencoder and a (potentially nonlinear) gain modeled by a covariate-specific Gaussian Process. The result is a model that yields group-level effect maps comparable or superior to the ones obtained with standard fMRI analysis software while also producing single-subject effect maps capturing individual differences. This suggests that generative models with a decomposable structure might offer a more flexible alternative for the analysis of task-based fMRI data.",

How such representations arise and how they modulate natural behavior is poorly understood. The social behavior of weakly electric fish is relatively low-dimensional and easily reproduced in the laboratory. Here we show how electrosensory signals related to courtship and rivalry in Apteronotus leptorhynchus are represented in the preglomerular nucleus, the thalamic region exclusively connecting the midbrain with the pallium. We show that preglomerular cells convert their midbrain inputs into a mixed selectivity code that includes corollary discharge of outgoing communication signals. We discuss how the preglomerular pallial targets might use these inputs to control social behavior and determine dominance in male-male competition and female mate selection during courtship. Our results showcase the potential of the electrocommunication system as an accessible model for studying the neural substrates of social behavior and principles of multi-dimensional neural representation.",

Inactivation of Prmt5 in granulosa cells resulted in aberrant follicle development and female infertility. In Prmt5-knockout mice, follicle development was arrested with disorganized granulosa cells in which WT1 expression was dramatically reduced and the expression of steroidogenesis-related genes was significantly increased. The premature differentiated granulosa cells were detached from oocytes and follicle structure was disrupted. Mechanism studies revealed that Wt1 expression was regulated by PRMT5 at the protein level. PRMT5 facilitated IRES-dependent translation of Wt1 mRNA by methylating HnRNPA1. Moreover, the upregulation of steroidogenic genes in Prmt5-deficient granulosa cells was repressed by Wt1 overexpression. These results demonstrate PRMT5 participates in granulosa cell lineage maintenance by inducing Wt1 expression. Our study uncovers a new role of post-translational arginine methylation in granulosa cell differentiation and follicle development.",

However, attention has mostly been focused on crop species or a small number of  model systems. Information on gene expression during seed development is minimal for those angiosperm lineages whose origins predate the divergence of monocots and eudicots. In order to provide a new perspective on the early evolution of seed development in flowering plants, we sequenced transcriptomes of whole ovules and seeds from three key stages of reproductive development in the waterlily Nymphaea thermarum, an experimentally-tractable member of the Nymphaeales. We first explore general patterns of gene expression, beginning with mature ovules and continuing through fertilization into early- and mid-seed development. We then examine the expression of genes associated with DNA and histone methylation - processes known to be essential for development in distantly-related and structurally-divergent monocots and eudicots. Around 60% of transcripts putatively homologous to DNA and histone methylation modifiers are differentially expressed during seed development in N. thermarum, suggesting that the importance of dynamic epigenetic patterning during seed development dates to the earliest phases of angiosperm evolution. However, genes involved in establishing, maintaining, and removing methylation marks associated with genetic imprinting show a mix of conserved and unique expression patterns between N. thermarum and other flowering plants. Our data suggests that the regulation of imprinting has likely changed throughout angiosperm evolution, and furthermore identifies genes that merit further characterization in any angiosperm system.",

    "abstract": "Learning and decision-making are greatly influenced by the social context surrounding individuals. When navigating a complex social world, individuals must quickly ascertain where to gain important resources and which group members are useful sources of such information. Such dynamic behavioral processes require neural mechanisms that are flexible across contexts. Here we examined how the social context influences the learning response during a visual cue discrimination task and the neural activity patterns that underlie acquisition of this novel information. Using the cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, we show that learning of the task is faster in social groups than in a non-social context. We quantified the expression of Fos, an immediate-early gene, across candidate brain regions known to play a role in social behavior and learning, such as the putative teleost homologues of the mammalian hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and medial amygdala/BNST complex. We found that neural activity patterns differ between social and non-social contexts. Our results suggest that while the same brain regions may be involved in the learning of a discrimination task independent of social context, activity in each region encodes specific aspects of the task based on context.",

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that intervention strategies to curb antibiotic resistance cannot solely focus on human and veterinary medicine but must also consider environmental settings. While the environment clearly has a role in the transmission of resistant bacteria, it is less clear what role it plays in the emergence of novel types of resistance. It has been suggested that the environment constitutes an enormous recruitment ground for resistance genes to pathogens, but the extent to which this actually happens is unknown. In this study, we built a model framework for resistance emergence and used the available quantitative data on the relevant processes to identify the steps which are limiting the appearance of antibiotic resistance determinants in human or animal pathogens. We also assessed the effect of uncertainty in the available data on the model results. We found that in a majority of scenarios, the environment would only play a minor role in the emergence of novel resistance genes. However, the uncertainty around this role is enormous, highlighting an urgent need of more quantitative data to understand the role of the environment in antibiotic resistance development. Specifically, more data is most needed on the fitness costs of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) carriage, the degree of dispersal of resistant bacteria from the environment to humans, but also the rates of mobilization and horizontal transfer of ARGs. Quantitative data on these processes is instrumental to determine which processes that should be targeted for interventions to curb development and transmission of resistance.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration is critical for normal development, wound healing, and in tumor progression and metastasis. Border cells in the Drosophila ovary provide a genetically tractable model to identify molecular mechanisms that drive this important cell behavior. In an unbiased screen for defects in border cell migration in mosaic clones, we identified a mutation in the catsup gene. Catsup, the Drosophila ortholog of Zip7, is a large, multifunctional, transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which has been reported to negatively regulate catecholamine biosynthesis, to regulate Notch signaling, to function as a zinc transporter, and to limit ER stress. Here we report that catsup knockdown caused ER stress in border cells and that ectopic induction of ER stress was sufficient to block migration. Notch and EGFR trafficking were also disrupted. Wild type Catsup rescued the migration defect but point mutations known to disrupt the zinc ion transport of Zip7 did not. We conclude that migrating cells are particularly susceptible to defects in zinc transport and ER homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Prevailing COVID-19 vaccines are based on the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in Wuhan, China. The continuously evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2 resulting emergence of new variants raises the risk of immune absconds. During the last few months, several RBD (receptor-binding domain) variants have been reported to affect the vaccine efficacy considerably. Soon after reporting of a new double mutant variant (L452R & E484Q) in India, the country facing a deadlier second wave of infections which prompts researchers to suspects this variant to be accountable. To address the relevant concerns about this new variant affecting vaccine efficacy, we performed molecular simulation dynamics based structural analysis of spike protein of double mutant (L452R & E484Q) along with K417G variants and earlier reported RBD variants and found structural changes in RBD region after comparing with the wild type. Comparison of the binding affinity of the double mutant and earlier reported RBD variant for ACE2 (angiotensin 2 altered enzymes) receptor and CR3022 antibody with the wild-type strain revealed the lowest binding affinity of the double mutant for CR3022 among all other variants. These findings suggest that the newly emerged double mutant could significantly reduce the impact of the current vaccine which threatens the protective efficacy of current vaccine therapy.",
