    "abstract": "Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a widely used autologous treatment for tendon injuries in clinics, but clinical trials often produce conflicting results. Platelets (PLTs) are a major source of high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) that is gaining attention as a chemoattractant that can recruit stem cells to the wound area to enhance healing; however, the contribution of PLT HMGB1 in wounded tendon healing remains unexplored. This study investigated the effect of PLT HMGB1 within PRP to enhance healing in an acute patellar tendon injury model in PLT HMGB1 knockout (KO) mice and GFP mice. A window defect was created in the patellar tendons of both groups of mice, and wounds were treated with either saline, PRP isolated from PLT HMGB1 KO mice, or PRP isolated from GFP mice. Seven days post-treatment, animals were sacrificed and analyzed by gross inspection, histology, and immunostaining for characteristic signs of tendon healing and repair. Our results showed that in comparison to mice treated with PRP from PLT HMGB1-KO mice, wounds treated with PRP from GFP mice healed faster and exhibited a better organization in tendon structure. Mice treated with PRP from PLT HMGB1-KO mice produced tendon tissue with large premature wound areas and low cell densities. However, wounds of PLT HMGB1 KO mice showed better healing with PRP from HMGB1 KO mice compared to saline treatment. Moreover, wounds treated with PRP from GFP mice had increased extracellular HMGB1, decreased CD68, increased stem cell markers CD146 and CD73, and increased collagen III protein expression levels compared to those treated with PRP from PLT HMGB1 KO mice. Thus, PLT HMGB1 within PRP plays an important role in the healing of wounded tendon. Our findings also suggest that the efficacy of PRP treatment for tendon injuries in clinics may be affected by PLT HMGB1 within PRP preparations.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules are dynamic, reversible condensates composed of RNA and protein that assemble in response to a variety of stressors and are normally disassembled after stress is removed. Whereas the composition of stress granules and the mechanisms underlying their assembly have been extensively studied, far less is known about the mechanisms that govern disassembly. Impaired disassembly has been implicated in some diseases. Here we report that stress granule disassembly is context-dependent and, in the setting of heat shock, requires ubiquitination of G3BP1, the central protein within the stress granule RNA-protein network. Ubiquitinated G3BP1 interacts with the ER-resident protein FAF2, which engages the ubiquitin-dependent segregase p97/VCP. Targeting G3BP1 enables the stress granule-specific interaction network to fall below the percolation threshold for phase separation, which causes disassembly.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUbiquitination of G3BP1 mediates FAF2- and p97/VCP-dependent disassembly of heat-induced stress granules",

    "abstract": "Field pea (Pisum sativum L.), a cool-season legume crop, is known for poor heat tolerance. Our previous work identified PR11-2 and PR11-90 as heat tolerant and susceptible lines in a recombinant inbred population. CDC Amarillo, a Canadian elite pea variety, was considered as another heat tolerant variety based on its similar field performance as PR11-2. This study aimed to characterize the differential transcription. Plants of these three varieties were stressed for 3h at 38{degrees}C prior to self-pollination, and RNAs from heat stressed anthers and stipules on the same flowering node were extracted and sequenced via the Illumina NovaSeq platform for the characterization of heat responsive genes. In silico results were further validated by qPCR assay. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at log2 fold change, the three varieties shared 588 DEGs which were up-regulated and 220 genes which were down-regulated in anthers when subjected to heat treatment. In stipules, 879 DEGs (463/416 upregulation/downregulation) were consistent among varieties. The above heat-induced genes of the two plant organs were related to several biological processes i.e., response to heat, protein folding and DNA templated transcription. Ten gene ontology (GO) terms were over-represented in the consistently down-regulated DEGs of the two organs, and these terms were mainly related to cell wall macromolecule metabolism, lipid transport, lipid localization, and lipid metabolic processes. GO enrichment analysis on distinct DEGs of individual pea varieties suggested that heat affected biological processes were dynamic, and variety distinct responses provide insight into molecular mechanisms of heat-tolerance response. Several biological processes, e.g., cellular response to DNA damage stimulus in stipule, electron transport chain in anther that were only observed in heat induced PR11-2 and CDC Amarillo, and their relevance to field pea heat tolerance is worth further validation.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is the most widely reported vector-borne disease in the United States. 95% of human cases are reported in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Human cases typically occur in the spring and summer months when an infected nymph Ixodid tick takes a blood meal. Current federal surveillance strategies report data on an annual basis, leading to nearly a year lag in national data reporting. These lags in reporting make it difficult for public health agencies to assess and plan for the current burden of Lyme disease. Implementation of a nowcasting model, using historical data to predict current trends, provides a means for public health agencies to evaluate current Lyme disease burden and make timely priority-based budgeting decisions. The objective of this study was to develop and compare the performance of nowcasting models using free data from Google Trends and Centers of Disease Control and Prevention surveillance reports for Lyme Disease. We developed two sets of elastic net models for five regions of the United States first using monthly proportional hit data from 21 disease symptoms and tick related terms and second using monthly proportional hit data from all terms identified via Google correlate plus 21 disease symptom and vector terms. Elastic net models using the larger term list were highly accurate (Root Mean Square Error: 0.74, Mean Absolute Error: 0.52, R2: 0.97) for four of the five regions of the United States. Including these more environmental terms improved accuracy 1.33-fold while reducing error 0.5-fold compared to predictions from models using disease symptom and vector terms alone. Models using Google data similar to this could help local and state public health agencies accurately monitor Lyme disease burden during times of reporting lag from federal public health reporting agencies.",
