    "abstract": "The goal of precision oncology is to tailor treatment for patients individually using the genomic profile of their tumors. Pharmacogenomics datasets such as cancer cell lines are among the most valuable resources for drug sensitivity prediction, a crucial task of precision oncology. Machine learning methods have been employed to predict drug sensitivity based on the multiple omics data available for large panels of cancer cell lines. However, there are no comprehensive guidelines on how to properly train and validate such machine learning models for drug sensitivity prediction. In this paper, we introduce a set of guidelines for different aspects of training gene expression-based predictors using cell line datasets. These guidelines provide extensive analysis of the generalization of drug sensitivity predictors, and challenge many current practices in the community including the choice of training dataset and measure of drug sensitivity. Application of these guidelines in future studies will enable the development of more robust preclinical biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, the most prevalent type of RNA editing in metazoans, is carried out by adenosine deaminases (ADARs) in double-stranded RNA regions. Several computational approaches have been recently developed to identify A-to-I RNA editing sites from sequencing data, each addressing a particular issue. Here we present RESIC, an efficient pipeline that combines several approaches for the detection and classification of RNA editing sites. The pipeline can be used for all organisms and can use any number of RNA-sequencing datasets as input. RESIC provides 1. The detection of editing sites in both repetitive and non-repetitive genomic regions; 2. The identification of hyper-edited regions; 3. Optional exclusion of polymorphism sites to increase reliability, based on DNA, and ADAR-mutant RNA sequencing datasets, or SNP databases. We demonstrate the utility of RESIC by applying it to human, successfully overlapping and extending the list of known putative editing sites. We further tested changes in the patterns of A-to-I RNA editing, and RNA abundance of ADAR enzymes, following SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines. Our results suggest that upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to mock, the number of hyper editing sites is increased, and in agreement, the activity of ADAR1, which catalyzes hyper-editing, is enhanced. These results imply the involvement of A-to-I RNA editing in conceiving the unpredicted phenotype of COVID-19 disease. RESIC code is open-source and is easily extendable.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe healthcare profession has been long considered an excellent career choice. Pre-medical experience is documented to be important in shaping future medical landscape. In the wake of the pandemic, there has been intense media spotlight on the healthcare profession and change in academic environment, necessitating analyses of student experience. This project aims to assess change in undergraduate student interest in healthcare career using cross-sectional survey study.\n\nMethodsThe project was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Voluntary survey collected data on demographics, socioeconomics, media exposure, academic environment, and change in interest in a healthcare profession. Survey was distributed through the university undergraduate pre-health listserv. Total of 297 responses were obtained. Descriptive statistics including Fishers exact test were applied in the analysis.\n\nResultsMajority of the respondents were Asians (54.9%), second generation immigrants (52.2%), and female (73.4%). Large proportion of the respondents were negatively affected by the pandemic, with losing a job or internship personally (42.1%) or a family member or a friend (62.6%). Students had mixed response to online learning environment, with 27.3% of students noting no change, 40.4% students noting increased difficulty, and 32.3% students noting decreased difficulty of classes. During the pandemic, 47.5% of students noted increased interest in pursuing healthcare career. The change in interest in healthcare career was not associated with xdemographics, economic hardship, or online learning environment.\n\nDiscussionDespite the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, students showed strong interest in pursuing healthcare careers.",

Here, we use saliva to assess cortisol levels in a wild population of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), a gregarious carnivore living in complex social groups. We first describe a novel, non-invasive method of collecting saliva from juvenile hyenas and validate a salivary cortisol assay for use in this species. We then analyze over 260 saliva samples collected from nearly 70 juveniles to investigate the relationships between cortisol and temporal and social variables in these animals. We obtain evidence of a bimodal daily rhythm with salivary cortisol concentrations dropping around dawn and dusk, times at which cub activity levels are changing substantially. We also find that dominant littermates have lower cortisol than either subordinate littermates or singletons, but that cortisol does not vary with age, sex, or maternal social rank. Finally, we examine how social behaviors such as aggression or play affect salivary cortisol concentrations. We find that inflicting aggression on others was associated with lower cortisol concentrations. We hope that the detailed description of our methods provides wildlife researchers with the tools to measure salivary cortisol in other wild carnivores.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIWe validated methods for collecting and analyzing saliva from wild carnivores.\nC_LIO_LIWe documented a bimodal daily rhythm in juvenile spotted hyena salivary cortisol.\nC_LIO_LICortisol varied among juvenile hyenas based on litter size and intra-litter rank.\nC_LIO_LIInflicting aggression on others was associated with lower cortisol concentrations.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Swimming locomotion in aquatic vertebrates, such as fish and tadpoles, is expressed through orchestrated operations of central pattern generators. These parallel neuronal circuits are ubiquitously distributed and mutually coupled along the spinal cord to express undulation patterns accommodated to efferent and afferent inputs. While such sets of schemes have been shown in vertebrates, the evolutionary origin of those mechanisms along the chordate phylogeny remains unclear. Ascidians, representing a sister group of vertebrates, give rise to tadpole larvae that freely swim in seawater. In this study, we tried to locate the swimming pattern generator in larvae of the ascidian Ciona by examining locomotor ability of segmented body fragments. Our experiments demonstrated necessary and sufficient pattern generator activity in a short region ([~]10% of the body length as the longest estimation) including the trunk-tail junction but excluding most of the trunk and tail with major sensory apparatuses therein. Moreover, we found that these \"mid-piece\" body fragments express periodic tail beating bursts with [~]20-s intervals without any exogenous stimuli. Comparisons among temporal patterns of tail beating bursts expressed by the mid-piece fragments and by whole larvae placed under different sensory conditions suggested that the presence of parts other than the critical mid-piece had effects to shorten swimming burst intervals, especially in the dark, and also to expand the variance in burst durations. We propose that Ciona larvae perform swimming as modified representations of autonomous and periodic pattern generator drives, which operate locally in the region of the trunk-tail junction.\n\nSummary statementMid-piece fragments of tadpole larvae of the ascidian Ciona, lacking most of the anterior trunk and posterior tail, autonomously and periodically express tail beating bursts.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study determined the utility of intracranially-recorded spectral responses during naming tasks in predicting neuropsychological performance following epilepsy surgery. We recruited 65 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent preoperative neuropsychological assessment and intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) evaluated the baseline and postoperative language function. During extraoperative iEEG recording, we assigned patients to undergo auditory and picture naming tasks. Time-frequency analysis determined the spatiotemporal characteristics of naming-related amplitude modulations, including high gamma augmentation (HGA) at 70-110 Hz. We surgically removed the presumed epileptogenic zone based on the extent of iEEG and MRI abnormalities while maximally preserving the eloquent areas defined by electrical stimulation mapping (ESM). The multivariate regression model incorporating auditory naming-related HGA predicted the postoperative changes in Core Language Score (CLS) on CELF with r2 of 0.37 (p = 0.015) and in Expressive Language Index (ELI) with r2 of 0.32 (p = 0.047). Independently of the effects of epilepsy and neuroimaging profiles, higher HGA at the resected language-dominant hemispheric area predicted a more severe postoperative decline in CLS (p = 0.004) and ELI (p = 0.012). Conversely, the model incorporating picture naming-related HGA predicted the change in Receptive Language Index (RLI) with r2 of 0.50 (p < 0.001). Higher HGA independently predicted a more severe postoperative decline in RLI (p = 0.03). Ancillary regression analysis indicated that naming-related low gamma augmentation as well as alpha/beta attenuation likewise independently predicted a more severe CLS decline. The machine learning-based prediction model, referred to as the boosted tree ensemble model, suggested that naming-related HGA, among all spectral responses utilized as predictors, most strongly contributed to the improved prediction of patients showing a >5-point CLS decline (reflecting the lower 25 percentile among patients). We generated the model-based atlas visualizing sites, which, if resected, would lead to such a CLS decline. The auditory naming-based model predicted patients who developed the CLS decline with an accuracy of 0.80. The model indicated that virtual resection of an ESM-defined language site would have increased the relative risk of the CLS decline by 5.28 (95%CI: 3.47 to 8.02). Especially, that of an ESM-defined receptive language site would have maximized it to 15.90 (95%CI: 9.59-26.33). In summary, naming-related spectral responses predict objectively-measured neuropsychological outcome after epilepsy surgery. We have provided our prediction model as an open-source material, which will indicate the postoperative language function of future patients and facilitate external validation at tertiary epilepsy centers.",

However, tumor-associated macrophages are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous. Specific tumor-associated macrophage subsets might be endowed with antagonistic role on cancer progression and on the development of anti-tumor immunity. For instance, monocyte-derived TREM2+ tumor-associated macrophages have pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive functions. Here, we identify a discrete population of FOLR2+ tumor-associated macrophages positively correlating with patient survival in breast cancer. FOLR2+ macrophages are evolutionarily conserved across species and populate human and murine healthy mammary gland. Moreover, FOLR2+ macrophages co-localize with lymphoid aggregates containing CD8+ T cells in breast cancer and across ten other types of cancers.

Microbial populations offer a relatively convenient model system to study this question. In this context, an isogenic population of bacteria (E. coli, B. subtilis, and Pseudomonas) has been shown to lead to genetic diversification in the population, when propagated for a number of generations. This diversification is known to occur when the individuals in the population have access to two or more resources/environments, which are separated either temporally or spatially. Here, we report adaptive diversification in an isogenic population of yeast, S. cerevisiae, when propagated in an environment containing melibiose as the carbon source. The diversification is driven due to a public good, enzyme -galactosidase, leading to hydrolysis of melibiose into two distinct resources, glucose and galactose. The diversification is driven by a mutations at a single locus, in the GAL3 gene in the GAL/MEL regulon in the yeast.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has caused an unprecedented global health crisis. The SARS-CoV-2 spike, a surface-anchored trimeric class-I fusion-glycoprotein essential for viral entry, represents a key target for developing vaccines and therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-variants that facilitate virus spread and may affect vaccine efficacy highlights the need to identify novel antiviral strategies for COVID-19 therapy. Here we demonstrate that nitazoxanide, an antiprotozoal agent with recognized broad-spectrum antiviral activity, interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis, hampering its maturation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage. Engineering multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant-pseudoviruses and utilizing quantitative cell-cell fusion assays, we show that nitazoxanide-induced spike modifications hinder progeny virion infectivity as well as spike-driven pulmonary cell-cell fusion, a critical feature of COVID-19 pathology. Nitazoxanide, being equally effective against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-spike and different emerging variants, including the Delta variant of concern, may represent a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19 infections.",

Currently it is unclear if there also is a direct causal link between these diseases. To obtain first insights into a possible molecular relation between viral infections and the aggregation of -synuclein protein into amyloid fibrils characteristic for Parkinsons disease, we investigated the effect of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on -synuclein aggregation. We show, in test tube experiments, that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has no effect on -synuclein aggregation while SARS-CoV-2 N-protein considerably speeds up the aggregation process. We observe the formation of multi-protein complexes, and eventually amyloid fibrils. Microinjection of N-protein in SHSY-5Y cells disturbed the -synuclein proteostasis and increased cell death. Our results point toward direct interactions between the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and -synuclein as molecular basis for the observed coincidence between SARS-CoV-2 infections and Parkinsonism.",

In CD8+ T-cell, SOCS1 does not impact the proliferation but rather reduces survival and effector functions. By targeting SOCS1, both murine and human CD4+ T-cell antitumor adoptive therapies exhibit a restored intra-tumor accumulation, proliferation/survival, persistence and polyfunctionality, promoting long term rejection of established tumors.

    "abstract": "Identifying the epitope of an antibody is a key step in understanding its function and its potential as a therapeutic. It is well-established in the literature that sequence-based clonal clustering can identify antibodies with similar epitope complementarity. However, there is growing evidence that antibodies from markedly different lineages but with similar structures can engage the same epitope with near-identical binding modes. Here, we describe a novel computational method for epitope profiling based on structural modelling and clustering, and show how it can identify sequence-dissimilar antibodies that engage the same epitope. We start by searching for evidence of structural conservation across the latest solved SARS-CoV-2--binding antibody crystal structures. Despite the relatively small number of solved structures, we find numerous examples of sequence-diverse but structurally-similar coronavirus-binding antibodies engaging the same epitope. We therefore developed a high-throughput structural modeling and clustering method to identify functionally-similar antibodies across the set of thousands of coronavirus-binding antibody sequences in the Coronavirus Antibody Database (CoV-AbDab). In the resulting multiple-occupancy structural clusters, 92% bind to consistent domains based on CoV-AbDab metadata. Our approach functionally links antibodies with distinct genetic lineages, species origins, and coronavirus specificities. This indicates greater convergence exists in the immune responses to coronaviruses than would be suggested by sequence-based approaches. Our results show that applying structural analytics to large class-specific antibody databases will enable high confidence structure-function relationships to be drawn, yielding new opportunities to identify functional convergence hitherto missed by sequence-only analysis.",

    "abstract": "Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate immune sensors of pathogen infection and cellular damage that induce caspase-1 mediated inflammation upon activation. Although inflammation is protective, uncontrolled excessive inflammation can cause inflammatory diseases and can be detrimental, such as in COVID-19. However, the underlying mechanisms that control inflammasome activation are incompletely understood. Here we report that the leucine rich repeat (LRR) protein Ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1), which shares homology with LRRs of NLRP proteins, attenuates inflammasome activation. Deletion of RNH1 in macrophages increases IL-1{beta} production and caspase-1 activation for inflammasome stimuli. Mechanistically, RNH1 decreases pro-IL-1{beta} expression and induces proteasome-mediated caspase-1 degradation. Corroborating this, mouse models of monosodium urate (MSU)-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced endotoxemia, which are dependent on caspase-1, respectively show increased neutrophil infiltration and lethality in Rnh1-/- mice compared to WT mice. Furthermore, RNH1 protein levels are negatively correlated with inflammation and disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We propose that RNH1 is a new inflammasome regulator with relevance to COVID-19 severity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMultidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria are a major worldwide public health problem. In the last decades, resistance to last-resort antibiotics such as polymyxin B (PB) have been increasingly observed among these superbugs, compromising the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The present study aimed (i) to assess the ultrapure Cannabidiol (CBD) antibacterial activity against a broad diversity of Gram-negative (GN) and Gram-positive (GP) bacteria (44 different species, 95 strains), comprising standard strains and clinical isolates, and (ii) to investigate the antibacterial activity of the combination CBD + PB against GN bacteria, including chromosomal- and plasmid-acquired PB-resistant and intrinsically PB-resistant GNB. We evaluated CBD in vitro antibacterial activity using the standard broth microdilution method, and the antibacterial activity of the combination CBD + PB was screened using the standard broth microdilution and confirmed by checkerboard assay. CBD exhibited antibacterial activity against different GP bacterial species, lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-expressing GN diplococcus (GND) (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Moraxella catarrhalis), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The combination CBD + PB exhibited antibacterial activity against PB-resistant GNB (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae) as well as additive and/or synergistic effect against LOS-expressing GND. The antibacterial activity of the combination CBD + PB against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant (MCR-1) E. coli strains could be only demonstrated in the presence of phenylalanine-arginine-{beta}-naphthylamide (PA{beta}N). In conclusion, our results show promising translational potential of the combination CBD + PB against MDR and XDR GNB, including PB-resistant K. pneumoniae, highlighting its potential as a rescue treatment for life-threatening infections caused by these superbugs.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPromising combination of cannabidiol (CBD) + polymyxin B (PB) against superbugs (e.g., PB-resistant Gram-negative bacilli): Repurposing CBD",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have necessarily evolved a protective arsenal of proteins to contend with peroxides and other reactive oxygen species generated in aerobic environments. Listeria monocytogenes encounters an onslaught of peroxide both in the environment and during infection of the mammalian host, where it is the causative agent of the foodborne illness listeriosis. Despite the importance of peroxide for the immune response to bacterial infection, the strategy by which L. monocytogenes protects against peroxide toxicity has yet to be illuminated. Here, we investigated the expression and essentiality of all the peroxidase-encoding genes during L. monocytogenes growth in vitro and during infection of murine cells in tissue culture. We found that chdC and kat were required for aerobic growth in vitro, and fri and ahpA were each required for L. monocytogenes to survive acute peroxide stress. Despite increased expression of fri, ahpA, and kat during infection of macrophages, only fri proved necessary for cytosolic growth and intercellular spread. In contrast, the proteins encoded by lmo0367, lmo0983, tpx, lmo1609, and ohrA were dispensable for aerobic growth, acute peroxide detoxification, and infection. Together, our results provide insight into the multifaceted L. monocytogenes peroxide detoxification strategy and demonstrate that L. monocytogenes encodes a functionally diverse set of peroxidase enzymes.",

Adaptation to a given environment may select bacterial mutants that have reduced ability to adapt to new environments and changes in diet have been associated with alterations in microbiome taxon composition. We wanted to see the effect of diet change in linage composition and antimicrobial resistance profiles of numerically dominant E. coli. We subjected 50 chickens from an industrial operation (under corn-based diet supplemented with antimicrobials) to 2 antimicrobial-free diets; one based on corn and the other based on alfalfa. Fecal samples were obtained from all animals at arrival and after five weeks under different diets. Five E. coli colonies (from each sample) were subjected to genetic typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We observed high diversity and high turnover rate of numerically dominant E. coli strains from animals from both diet groups. We did not find differences in antimicrobial resistance profiles in isolates from different diet groups. Our results suggest that there is high diversity and high turnover rate of E. coli strains in the intestines regardless of the diet. Chicken intestines seemed to contain many E. coli lineages able to thrive in different substrates. The absence of differences in antimicrobial resistance among bacteria, from animals in different diets, may indicate that the carriage of antimicrobial resistance genes does not affect the bacterial ability to adapt to different substrates.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of effective vaccines and treatments, annual outbreaks of severe human haemorrhagic fever caused by arenaviruses, such as Lassa virus, continue to pose a significant human health threat. Understanding the balance of cellular factors that inhibit or promote arenavirus infection may have important implications for the development of effective antiviral strategies. Here, we identified the cell-intrinsic zinc transmembrane metalloprotease, ZMPSTE24, as a restriction factor against arenaviruses. Notably, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of ZMPSTE24 in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells increased arenavirus glycoprotein-mediated viral entry in pseudoparticle assays and live virus infection models. As a barrier to viral entry and replication, ZMPSTE24 may act as a downstream effector of interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) antiviral function; though through a yet poorly understood mechanism. Overexpression of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins did not restrict the entry of pseudoparticles carrying arenavirus envelope glycoproteins and live virus infection, yet depletion of IFITM protein expression enhanced virus entry and replication. Furthermore, gain-of-function studies revealed that IFITMs augment the antiviral activity of ZMPSTE24 against arenaviruses, suggesting a cooperative effect of viral restriction. We show that ZMPSTE24 and IFITMs affect the kinetics of cellular endocytosis, suggesting that perturbation of membrane structure and stability is likely the mechanism of ZMPSTE24-mediated restriction and cooperative ZMPSTE24-IFITM antiviral activity. Collectively, our findings define the role of ZMPSTE24 host restriction activity in the early stages of arenavirus infection. Moreover, we provide insight into the importance of cellular membrane integrity for productive fusion of arenaviruses and highlight a novel avenue for therapeutic development.\n\nAuthor SummaryIncreased human travel, virus genome evolution and expansion of the host rodent reservoir outside of endemic areas has contributed to increasing cases of the highly fatal arenaviral haemorrhagic disease, Lassa fever in Western Africa. These annual seasonal outbreaks present a serious global public health and socioeconomic burden, particularly in the absence of approved vaccines and antiviral countermeasures. Development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies against arenavirus infection is reliant on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of key host-virus interactions that antagonise or potentiate disease pathogenesis. We demonstrate the inhibition of arenavirus infection by the antiviral restriction factor ZMPSTE24 and describe a cooperative action with the innate immunity-stimulated family of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). This work adds to our understanding of the mechanism of ZMPSTE24 and IFITM-mediated restriction of enveloped viruses and importantly suggests that these proteins may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of arenavirus infections.",

While changes in Pol II occupancy were detected at only some genes in a Upf1-deficient (upf1{Delta}) strain, there is an increased Ser2 Pol II signal at all highly transcribed genes examined by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, upf1{Delta} cells are hypersensitive to the transcription elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil and display Pol II abnormalities suggestive of Pol II hyperphosphorylation. A significant proportion of the genes associated with Upf1 in wild-type conditions are also mis-regulated in upf1{Delta}.

    "abstract": "Inducing cardiac myocytes to proliferate is considered a potential therapy to target heart disease, however, modulating cardiac myocyte proliferation has proven to be a technical challenge. The Hippo pathway is a kinase signaling cascade that regulates cell proliferation during the growth of the heart. Inhibition of the Hippo pathway increases the activation of the transcription factors YAP/TAZ, which translocate to the nucleus and upregulate transcription of pro-proliferative genes. The Hippo pathway regulates the proliferation of cancer cells, pluripotent stem cells, and epithelial cells through a cell-cell contact-dependent manner, however it is unclear if cell density-dependent cell proliferation is a consistent feature in cardiac myocytes. Here, we used cultured human iPSC-derived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs) as a model system to investigate this concept. hiCMs have a comparable transcriptome to the immature cardiac myocytes that proliferate during heart development in vivo. Our data indicate that a dense syncytium of hiCMs can regain cell cycle activity and YAP expression and activity when plated sparsely or when density is reduced through wounding. We found that combining two small molecules, XMU-MP-1 and S1P, increased YAP activity and further enhanced proliferation of low-density hiCMs. Importantly, these compounds had no effect on hiCMs within a dense syncytium. These data add to a growing body of literature that link the Hippo pathway regulation with cardiac myocyte proliferation and demonstrate that regulation is restricted to cells with reduced contact inhibition.",

Tmem120a deficiency broadly suppresses lipid metabolism pathway gene expression and induces myogenic gene expression by repositioning genes, enhancers and miRNA-encoding loci between the nuclear periphery and interior. Tmem120a-/- mice, particularly females, exhibit a lipodystrophy syndrome similar to human familial partial lipodystrophy FPLD2, with profound insulin resistance and metabolic defects that manifests upon exposure to an obesogenic diet. Interestingly, similar genome organisation defects occurred in cells from FPLD2 patients that harbour nuclear envelope protein laminA mutations. Our data suggest TMEM120A may mediate/instigate novel categories of adipose tissue dysfunction across the adiposity spectrum and provide a new miRNA-based mechanism possibly driving the unexplained muscle hypertrophy in human lipodystrophy.",

    "abstract": "The blueprints for developing organs are preset at the early stages of embryogenesis. Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms are proposed to preset developmental trajectories. However, we reveal that the competence for future cardiac fate of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is preset in pluripotency by a specialized mRNA translation circuit controlled by RBPMS. RBPMS is recruited to active ribosomes in hESCs to control the translation of essential factors needed for cardiac commitment program, including WNT signaling. Consequently, RBPMS loss specifically and severely impedes cardiac mesoderm specification leading to patterning and morphogenesis defects in human cardiac organoids. Mechanistically, RBPMS specializes mRNA translation, selectively via 3UTR binding and globally by promoting translation initiation. Accordingly, RBPMS loss causes translation initiation defects highlighted by aberrant retention of the EIF3 complex and depletion of EIF5A from mRNAs, thereby abrogating ribosome recruitment. We reveal how future fate trajectories are preprogrammed during embryogenesis by specialized mRNA translation.\n\nTeaser: Cardiac fate competence is preprogrammed in pluripotency by specialized mRNA translation of factors initiating cardiogenesis",

    "abstract": "The spinal cord receives input from peripheral sensory neurons and controls motor output by regulating muscle innervating motor neurons. These functions are carried out by neural circuits comprising molecularly and physiologically distinct neuronal subtypes that are generated in a characteristic spatial-temporal arrangement from progenitors in the embryonic neural tube. The systematic mapping of gene expression in mouse embryos has provided insight into the diversity and complexity of cells in the neural tube. For human embryos, however, less information has been available. To address this, we used single cell mRNA sequencing to profile cervical and thoracic regions in four human embryos of Carnegie Stages (CS) CS12, CS14, CS17 and CS19 from Gestational Weeks (W) 4-7. In total we recovered the transcriptomes of 71,219 cells. Analysis of progenitor and neuronal populations from the neural tube, as well as cells of the peripheral nervous system, in dorsal root ganglia adjacent to the neural tube, identified dozens of distinct cell types and facilitated the reconstruction of the differentiation pathways of specific neuronal subtypes. Comparison with existing mouse datasets revealed the overall similarity of mouse and human neural tube development while highlighting specific features that differed between species. These data provide a catalogue of gene expression and cell type identity in the developing neural tube that will support future studies of sensory and motor control systems and can be explored at https://shiny.crick.ac.uk/scviewer/neuraltube/.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdequate cellular thymidylate (dTMP) pools are essential for preservation of nuclear and mitochondrial genome stability. Previous studies have indicated that disruption in dTMP synthesis in the nucleus leads to increased uracil misincorporation into DNA affecting genome stability. To date, the effects of impaired mitochondrial dTMP synthesis in non- transformed tissues have been understudied.\n\nObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the effects of decreased serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (Shmt2) expression and dietary folate deficiency on mitochondrial DNA integrity and mitochondrial function in mouse tissues.\n\nMethodsLiver mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and uracil content in liver mtDNA was measured in Shmt2+/- and Shmt2+/+ mice weaned onto either a folate-sufficient control diet (2 mg/kg folic acid, C) or a modified diet lacking folic acid (0 mg/kg folic acid, FD) for 7 wks. Shmt2+/- and Shmt2+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells) were cultured in defined culture medium containing either 0 or 25 nM folate to assess proliferative capacity and mitochondrial function.\n\nResultsShmt2+/- mice exhibited 48-67% reduction in SHMT2 protein levels in tissues. Interestingly, Shmt2+/- mice consuming the folate-sufficient C diet exhibited a 25% reduction in total folate in liver mitochondria. There was also a >20-fold increase in uracil in liver mtDNA in Shmt2+/- mice consuming the C diet, and dietary folate deficiency also increased uracil content in mouse liver mtDNA from both Shmt2+/+ and Shmt2+/- mice. Furthermore, decreased Shmt2 expression in MEF cells reduced cell proliferation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxygen consumption rate.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that Shmt2 heterozygosity and dietary folate deficiency impair mitochondrial dTMP synthesis, as evidenced by the increased uracil in mtDNA. In addition, Shmt2 heterozygosity impairs mitochondrial function in MEF cells. These findings suggest that elevated uracil in mtDNA may impair mitochondrial function.",

The SAM-II riboswitch is a class of riboswitches, that recognizes S-adenosyl methionine. It has been previously illustrated that the presence of Mg2+ ions stabilizes the pre-existing minor state of the riboswitch, which is structurally characterised by having a nucleated pseudoknot, leading to the increase of its probability. In this study, an analytical equilibrium model is developed to describe the impact of Mg2+ ions concentration on the folding of the SAM-II riboswitch, linking RNA folding and tertiary interactions energetics to ligand binding, and, hence enabling quantitative predictions. The method was used to study the role of the P1 helix sequence in determining the fraction of binding competent conformers of the SAM-II riboswitch, by simulating the Mg2+ titration curves of various mutants.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/439486v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19367ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8be5ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3fec6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab9d65_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Phase-separated structures enrich for specific partner proteins and exclude others. We have shown that the IDRs of metazoan DNA replication initiators drive DNA-dependent phase separation in vitro and chromosome binding in vivo, and that initiator condensates selectively recruit specific partner proteins. How initiator IDRs facilitate LLPS and maintain compositional specificity is unknown. Using D. melanogaster (Dm) Cdt1 as a model initiation factor, we show that phase separation results from a synergy between electrostatic DNA-bridging interactions and hydrophobic inter-IDR contacts. Both sets of interactions depend on sequence composition (but not sequence order), are resistant to 1,6- hexanediol, and do not depend on aromaticity. These findings demonstrate that distinct sets of interactions drive self-assembly and condensate specificity across different phase-separating systems and advance efforts to predict IDR LLPS propensity and specificity a priori.",

Knockdown of SLIT2 in mouse glioma cells and patient derived GBM xenografts reduced tumor growth and synergized with immunotherapy to prolong survival. Tumor cell SLIT2 knockdown inhibited macrophage invasion and promoted a cytotoxic gene expression profile, which improved tumor vessel function and enhanced efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Mechanistically, SLIT2 promoted microglia/macrophage chemotaxis and tumor-supportive polarization via ROBO1&2-mediated PI3K{gamma} activation. Macrophage Robo1&2 deletion and systemic SLIT2 trap delivery mimicked SLIT2 knockdown effects on tumor growth and the tumor microenvironment (TME), revealing SLIT2 signaling through macrophage ROBOs as a novel regulator of the GBM microenvironment and a potential immunotherapeutic target for brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "Targeting regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration is an emerging strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, the efficacy of this strategy in advanced prostate cancer remains unclear. Here, we describe the therapeutic efficacy of this strategy in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. We used dogs with naturally occurring prostate cancer to study the molecular mechanism underlying Treg infiltration into tumor tissues and the effect of anti-Treg treatment. We found that tumor-infiltrating Tregs were associated with poor prognosis in dogs bearing spontaneous prostate cancer. RNA sequencing and protein analyses showed that Treg infiltration was mediated by interaction between the tumor-producing chemokine, CCL17, and the receptor CCR4 expressed on Tregs. Dogs with advanced prostate cancer responded to mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4, with improved survival and low incidence of clinically relevant adverse events. Exploratory analyses showed urinary CCL17 concentration and BRAFV595E mutation to be independently predictive of the response to mogamulizumab. Analysis of a publicly available transcriptomic dataset of human prostate cancer showed that the CCL17/CCR4 axis correlated with the Treg marker, Foxp3. In silico survival analyses showed that high expression of CCL17 was associated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that tumor-infiltrating Tregs expressed CCR4 in human patients with prostate cancer. These findings suggest that anti-Treg treatment through the blocking of CCR4 is a promising therapeutic approach for advanced prostate cancer.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTargeting regulatory T cell infiltration by CCR4 blockade induces objective responses and improves survival in a canine model of prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the diversity of the scientific workforce is critical to achieving the mission of NIH: \"To seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.\" However, specific groups have historically been, and continue to be, underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce, especially academia. Career choice is a multi-factorial process that evolves over time; among all trainees, expressed interest in faculty research careers decreases over time in graduate school, but that trend is amplified in women and members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (Fuhrmann, Halme, OSullivan, & Lindstaedt, 2011; Gibbs, McGready, Bennett, & Griffin, 2014; C. Golde & Dore, 2004; Roach & Sauermann, 2017; Sauermann & Roach, 2012). Neuroscience as a discipline has characteristics that may exacerbate the overall trends seen in the life sciences, such as a greater growth in the number of awarded neuroscience PhDs than in other life sciences fields (US National Science Foundation, 2016b). This work was designed to investigate how career interest changes over time among recent neuroscience PhD graduates, and whether differences in career interests are associated with social identity (i.e. gender and race/ethnicity), experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training (e.g. relationship with advisor; feelings of belonging), and personal characteristics (e.g. confidence in ones potential to be an independent researcher). We report results from a survey of 1,479 PhD neuroscientists (including 16% underrepresented (UR) and 54% female scientists). We saw repeated evidence that individual preferences about careers in general, and academic careers specifically, predict current career interest. These statistically significant preferences mostly had medium to low effect size that varied by career type. These findings were mediated by social identity and experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training. Our findings highlight the important influence of the advisor in shaping a trainees career path, and the ways in which academic culture is perceived as unwelcoming or incongruent with the values or priorities of certain groups. For women, issues of work/life balance and structural issues of academia, and for UR women in particular, lower confidence in their ability to be an independent researcher, affected their interest in academia. Both women and UR men in our study report a lower importance of autonomy in their careers. UR respondents report feeling less like they were a part of the social and intellectual community. However, they have formed beneficial relationships with faculty outside their PhD institutions that, particularly for UR women, are associated with increased interest in academia. Our findings suggest several areas for positive growth, ways to change how we think about the impact of mentorship, and policy and programmatic interventions that extend beyond trying to change or \"fix\" the individual and instead recognize the systemic structures that influence career choices.",

In particular, the carbene transferase activity of C45 is enhanced when reactions are performed in aprotic, non-polar solvents such as hexane and toluene. Activity-solvent dependencies reveal that this activity boost is likely due to beneficial partitioning of the substrate into the beads from the organic phase. Furthermore, encapsulation facilitates enzyme recovery and recycling after the reaction.

    "abstract": "Computational models of the coagulation cascade are used for a wide range of applications in bio-medical engineering such as drug and bio-medical device developments. However, a lack of robustness of numerical models has been highlighted when studying clinically relevant scenarios. In order to develop more robust models, numerical simulations need to be confronted with realistic situations relevant to clinical practice. In this work, two well-established numerical representations of the coagulation cascade initiated by the intrinsic and extrinsic systems, respectively, were compared with thrombin generation assays considering realistic pathological conditions. Proper modifications were needed to align the in vitro and in silico data, namely; adapting initial conditions to the thrombin assay system, omitting reactions irrelevant to our case study, and improving the fitting of some reaction rates. The modified models were able to capture the experimental trends of thrombin generation for a range of concentrations of factors XII, XI, and VIII for cases in which the coagulation cascade is triggered through the extrinsic and intrinsic systems. Our work emphasizes that when existing coagulation cascade models are extrapolated to experimental settings for which they were not calibrated, careful adjustments must be made. We show that the two coagulation models used in this work can predict physiological conditions, but when studying pathological conditions, proper modifications are needed to improve the numerical results.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLoss of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) leads to progressive paralysis and death. Dysregulation of thousands of RNA molecules with roles in multiple cellular pathways hinders the identification of ALS-causing alterations over downstream changes secondary to the neurodegenerative process. How many and which of these pathological gene expression changes require therapeutic normalisation remains a fundamental question.\n\nMethodsHere, we investigated genome-wide RNA changes in C9ORF72-ALS patient-derived neurons and Drosophila, as well as upon neuroprotection taking advantage of our gene therapy approach which specifically inhibits the SRSF1-dependent nuclear export of pathological C9ORF72-repeat transcripts. This is a critical study to evaluate (i) the overall safety and efficacy of the partial depletion of SRSF1, a member of a protein family involved itself in gene expression, and (ii) a unique opportunity to identify neuroprotective RNA changes.\n\nResultsOur study demonstrates that manipulation of 362 transcripts out of 2,257 pathological changes in C9ORF72-ALS patient-derived neurons is sufficient to confer neuroprotection upon partial depletion of SRSF1. In particular, expression of 90 disease-altered transcripts is fully reverted upon neuroprotection leading to the characterisation of a human C9ORF72-ALS disease-modifying gene expression signature. These findings were further investigated in vivo in diseased and neuroprotected Drosophila transcriptomes, highlighting a list of 21 neuroprotective changes conserved with 16 human orthologues in patient-derived neurons. We also functionally validated the high therapeutic potential of one of these disease-modifying transcripts, demonstrating that inhibition of ALS-upregulated human KCNN1-3 (Drosophila SK) voltage-gated potassium channel orthologs mitigates degeneration of human motor neurons as well as Drosophila motor deficits.\n\nConclusionsStrikingly, manipulating the expression levels of a small proportion of RNAs is sufficient to induce a therapeutic effect, further indicating that the SRSF1-targeted gene therapy approach is safe in the above preclinical models as it does not disrupt globally gene expression. The efficacy of this intervention is also validated at genome-wide level with therapeutically-induced RNA changes involved in the vast majority of biological processes affected in C9ORF72-ALS. Finally, the identification of a characteristic signature with key RNA changes modified in both the disease state and upon neuroprotection also provides potential new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

Parasitoids were reared within a controlled laboratory setting.\n\nRESULTSTotal observed and actual parasitism rates of M. persicae varied considerably across regions, but less so on a field level. Overall, actual parasitism was on average 2.4 times higher than that observed in the field, with rates an average of 4-fold higher in South Australia. As crop growth stage progressed, the percentage of mummies observed increased. Percentage of parasitoids reared also increased with crop growth stage, averaging 3.4% during flowering and reaching 14.4% during podding/senescing. Although there was a greater diversity of reared parasitoid species at later crop growth stages, actual parasitism rate was unaffected by parasitoid species. Diaeretiella rapae was the most commonly reared parasitoid, increasing in abundance with crop growth stage.\n\nCONCLUSIONThese findings indicate that mummy counts alone do not provide a clear representation of parasitism within fields.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer is a key driver of the rise in multidrug resistance amongst bacterial pathogens. Bacterial defence systems per definition restrict the influx of foreign genetic material, and may therefore limit the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems are one of the most prevalent defences in bacteria, found in roughly half of bacterial genomes, but it has remained unclear if and how much they contribute to restricting the spread of antibiotic resistance. We analysed ~40,000 whole genomes comprising the full RefSeq dataset for 11 species of clinically important genera of human pathogens including Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. We modelled the association between CRISPR-Cas and indicators of horizontal gene transfer, and found that pathogens with a CRISPR-Cas system were less likely to carry antibiotic resistance genes than those lacking this defence system. Analysis of the mobile genetic elements targeted by CRISPR-Cas supports a model where this host defence system blocks important vectors of antibiotic resistance. These results suggest a potential \"immunocompromised\" state for multidrug-resistant strains that may be exploited in tailored interventions that rely on mobile genetic elements, such as phage or phagemids, to treat infections caused by bacterial pathogens.",

We recently uncovered that p62 function is riboregulated by the small non-coding vault RNA1-1. Here, we present detailed insight into the underlying mechanism. We show that the PB1 domain and adjacent linker region of p62 (aa 1-122) are necessary and sufficient for specific vault RNA1-1 binding, and identify lysine 7 and arginine 21 as key hinges for p62 riboregulation.

    "abstract": "IntroductionHigh intensity exercise is an increasingly popular mode of exercise to elicit similar or greater adaptive responses compared to traditional moderate intensity continuous exercise. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptive responses are still unclear. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare high and low intensity contractile stimulus on the Nrf2-mediated redox stress response in mouse skeletal muscle.\n\nMethodsAn intra-animal design was used to control for variations in individual responses to muscle stimulation by using a stimulated limb (STIM) and comparing to the contralateral unstimulated control limb (CON). High Intensity (HI - 100Hz), Low Intensity (LI - 50Hz), and Naive Control (NC - Mock stimulation vs CON) groups were used to compare these effects on Nrf2-ARE binding, Keap1 protein content, and downstream gene and protein expression of Nrf2 target genes.\n\nResultsMuscle stimulation significantly increased Nrf2-ARE binding in LI-STIM compared to LI-CON (p = 0.0098), while Nrf2-ARE binding was elevated in both HI-CON and HI-STIM compared to NC (p = 0.0007). The Nrf2-ARE results were mirrored in the downregulation of Keap1, where Keap1 expression in HI-CON and HI-STIM were both significantly lower than NC (p = 0.008) and decreased in LI-STIM compared to LI-CON (p = 0.015). In addition, stimulation increased NQO1 protein compared to contralateral control regardless of stimulation intensity (p = 0.019).\n\nConclusionsTaken together, these data suggest a systemic redox signaling exerkine is activating Nrf2-ARE binding and is intensity gated, where Nrf2-ARE activation in contralateral control limbs were only seen in the HI group. Other research in exercise induced Nrf2 signaling support the general finding that Nrf2 is activated in peripheral tissues in response to exercise, however the specific exerkine responsible for the systemic signaling effects is not known. Future work should aim to delineate these redox sensitive systemic signaling mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a multi-functional kinase with an essential role in mitophagy, the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria. More than 90 distinct mutations in TBK1 are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), including missense mutations that disrupt the ability of TBK1 to dimerize, associate with the mitophagy receptor optineurin (OPTN), auto-activate, or catalyze phosphorylation. We investigated how ALS-associated mutations in TBK1 affect Parkin-dependent mitophagy using imaging to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in clearing damaged mitochondria. Some mutations cause severe dysregulation of the pathway, while others induce limited disruption. Mutations that abolish either TBK1 dimerization or kinase activity were insufficient to fully inhibit mitophagy, while mutations that reduced both dimerization and kinase activity were more disruptive. Ultimately, both TBK1 recruitment and OPTN phosphorylation at S177 are necessary for engulfment of damaged mitochondra by autophagosomal membranes. Surprisingly, we find that ULK1 activity contributes to the phosphorylation of OPTN in the presense of either WT- or kinase inactive TBK1. In primary neurons, TBK1 mutants induce mitochondrial stress under basal conditions; network stress is exacerbated with further mitochondrial insult. Our study further refines the model for TBK1 function in mitophagy, demonstrating that some ALS-linked mutations likely contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing mitochondrial stress or inhibiting mitophagic flux. Other TBK1 mutations exhibited much less impact on mitophagy in our assays, suggesting that cell-type specific effects, cumulative damage, or alternative TBK1-dependent pathways such as innate immunity and inflammation also factor into the development of ALS in affected individuals.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMissense mutations in TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) have various biophysical and biochemical effects on the molecule, and are associated with the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). TBK1 plays an essential role in clearing damaged mitochondria. Here, we investigate the impact of 10 ALS-linked TBK1 mutations on the critical early stage of mitophagy. We find that both TBK1 recruitment and kinase activity contribute to the clearance of the damaged mitochondria. Furthermore, in neurons, expression of TBK1 mutants alone affects mitochondrial network health. Our investigation utilizes disease-linked mutations to further refine the current model of mitophagy, identifying crosstalk between the regulatory kinases TBK1 and ULK1, and providing new insights into the roles of TBK1 in neurodegenerative pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial matrix protease LONP1 is an essential part of the organellar protein quality control system. LONP1 has been shown to be involved in respiration control and apoptosis. Furthermore, a reduction in LONP1 level correlates with ageing processes. Up to now, the effects of a LONP1 defect were mostly studied by utilizing transient, siRNA-mediated knockdown approaches. We generated a new cellular model system for studying the impact of LONP1 on mitochondrial protein homeostasis by a CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic knockdown (gKD). These cells show a stable reduction of LONP1 along with a mild phenotype characterized by absent morphological differences and only small negative effects on mitochondrial functions under normal culture conditions. To assess the consequences of a permanent LONP1 depletion on the mitochondrial proteome, we analyzed the alterations of protein levels by quantitative mass spectrometry, demonstrating small adaptive changes, in particular concerning mitochondrial protein biogenesis. In an additional proteomic analysis, we determined the temperature-dependent aggregation behavior of mitochondrial proteins and its dependence on a reduction of LONP1 activity, demonstrating the important role of the protease for mitochondrial protein homeostasis in mammalian cells. We identified a significant number of mitochondrial proteins that are affected by LONP1 activity concerning their stress-induced solubility. Taken together, our results suggest a very good applicability of the LONP1 gKD cell line as a model system for human ageing processes.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms driving the prolonged meiotic prophase I are poorly understood. The RNA helicase YTHDC2 is critical for mitosis to meiosis transition, as YTHDC2-deficient mouse germ cells initiate meiosis but arrest with mixed characteristics of mitotic and meiotic cell types. However, YTHDC2 is also highly expressed in normal pachytene cells. Here we identify an essential role for YTHDC2 in meiotic progression. Specifically, we find that YTHDC2 deficiency causes microtubule-dependent telomere clustering and apoptosis at the pachytene stage of prophase I, and thus a failure to advance to the diplotene stage. Depletion of YTHDC2 results in a massively dysregulated transcriptome in pachytene cells, with a tendency toward upregulation of genes normally expressed in mitotic germ cells and downregulation of meiotic transcripts. Dysregulation does not correlate with the m6A status of RNAs and YTHDC2-bound mRNAs are enriched in genes upregulated in mutant germ cells, revealing that YTHDC2 primarily targets its substrate mRNAs for degradation. Finally, altered transcripts in YTHDC2-deficient pachytene cells encode microtubule network proteins and inhibition of microtubule polymerization disperses clustered telomeres. Together, our results demonstrate that YTHDC2 regulates the prolonged pachytene stage of prophase I by perpetuating a meiotic transcriptome and preventing changes in the microtubule network that could lead to aberrant telomere clustering.",

Here, we give a general formula to compute, from any matrix population model, the expected number of arbitrary kin (sisters, nieces, cousins, etc) of a focal individual ego, structured by the class of ego and of its kin. Central to our approach are classic but little-used tools known as genealogical matrices. Our method can be used to obtain both individual-based and population-wide metrics of kinship, as we illustrate. It also makes it possible to analyze the sensitivity of the kinship structure to the traits implemented in the model.",

In vivo and in vitro studies show that the primary role of complex formation is to inhibit GudBs activity as this enzyme is constitutively expressed including in glutamate-limiting conditions. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we elucidated the structure of the complex and the basis of GudBs inhibition.

Based on its mechanism of action, the light-induced and photosensitizer-mediated overproduction of reactive oxygen species in target cells, PDI is likely to generally inactivates microorganisms on plants irrespective of their pathogenicity. In order to prove this hypothesis we used next-generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial and fungal communities associated with leaf surfaces of Arabidopsis thaliana before and after the photodynamic treatment using the chlorine e6 derivative B17-0024 as photoactive compound and showed that this treatment reduced the microbial richness and altered the microbial community composition.

Using our DEAL system, we were able to perform topologically-defined protein-protein crosslinking, intramolecular stapling, and site-specific installation of fluorophores all inside living Escherichia coli cells, as well as study the DNA-binding properties of yeast Replication Protein A in vitro.

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is one of the most widely applied forms of adaptive immunotherapy. Both the detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects occurring after allo-HSCT are largely mediated by alloantigen-reactive donor T cells in the graft. Separating GVHD from GVL effects is a formidable challenge, and a greater understanding of donor T cell biology is required to accomplish the uncoupling of GVHD from GVL. Here, we tested a novel mouse model of {beta}-catenin (Cat-Tg) in an allo-HSCT model. Our data show that T cells from Cat-Tg mice did not cause GVHD. Surprisingly, Cat-Tg T cells maintained the GVL effect. Donor T cells from Cat-Tg mice exhibited significantly lower inflammatory cytokine production and reduced donor T cell proliferation, while upregulating cytotoxic mediators that resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing data revealed changes in the expression of over 150 genes for CD4, and over 250 genes for CD8+T cells involved in essential aspects of immune response and GVHD pathophysiology. Transgenic over-expression of human {beta}-catenin primarily affects CD8+ T cell phenotype. Altogether, our data suggest that {beta}-catenin is a druggable target for developing therapeutic strategies to reduce GVHD while preserving the beneficial GVL effects following allo-HSCT treatment.",

Serological studies, through providing evidence of past infection, can aid understanding of the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nObjectivesThis systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies in Europe was undertaken to inform public health strategies including vaccination, that aim to accelerate population immunity.\n\nMethodsWe searched the databases Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and grey literature sources for studies reporting seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Europe published between 01/12/2019 - 30/09/20. We provide a narrative synthesis of included studies. Studies were categorized into subgroups including healthcare workers (HCWs), community, outbreaks, pregnancy and children/school. Due to heterogeneity in other subgroups, we only performed a random effects meta-analysis of the seroprevalence amongst HCWs stratified by their country.\n\nResults109 studies were included spanning 17 European countries, that estimated the seroprevalence of SAR-CoV2 from samples obtained between November 2019 - August 2020. A total of 53/109 studies included HCWs with a reported seroprevalence among HCWs ranging from 0.7% to 45.3%, which did not differ significantly by country. In community studies significant heterogeneity was reported in the seroprevalence among different age groups and the majority of studies reported there was no significant difference by gender.\n\nConclusionThis review demonstrates a wide heterogeneity in reported seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between populations. Continued evaluation of seroprevalence is required to understand the impact of public health measures and inform interventions including vaccination programmes.",

    "abstract": "Experiences of parents and/or offspring are often assumed to affect the development of trait values in offspring because they provide information about the external environment, but it is currently unclear how information from different sources and times might combine to affect the information-states that provide the foundation for the patterns observed in empirical studies of developmental plasticity in response to environmental cues. We analyze Bayesian models designed to mimic fully-factorial experimental studies of within and transgenerational plasticity (TWP), in which parents, offspring, neither or both are exposed to cues from predators, to determine how different durations of cue exposure for parents and offspring, the devaluation of information from parents or the degradation of information from parents would affect offspring estimates of environmental states related to risk of predation at the end of such experiments. We show that the effects of different cue durations, the devaluation of information from parents, and the degradation of information from parents on offspring estimates are all expected to vary as a function of interactions with two other key parameters of information-based models of TWP: parental priors and the relative cue reliability in the different treatments. Our results suggest empiricists should expect to observe considerable variation across experimental studies of TWP based on simple principles of information-updating, without needing to invoke additional assumptions about costs, tradeoffs, development constraints, the fitness consequences of different trait values, or other factors.",

    "abstract": "Collagen is the major protein in the extracellular matrix and plays vital roles in tissue development and function. Collagen is also one of the most processed proteins in its biosynthesis. The most prominent post-translational modification (PTM) of collagen is the hydroxylation of Pro residues in the Y-position of the characteristic (Gly-Xaa-Yaa) repeating amino acid sequence of a collagen triple helix. Recent studies using mass-spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS sequencing (MS/MS) have revealed unexpected hydroxylation of Pro residues in the X-positions (X-Hyp). The newly identified X-Hyp residues appear to be highly heterogeneous in location and percent occupancy. In order to understand the dynamic nature of the new X-Hyps and their potential impact on applications of MS and MS/MS for collagen research, we sampled four different collagen samples using standard MS and MS/MS techniques. We found considerable variations in the degree of PTMs of the same collagen from different organisms and/or tissues. The rat tail tendon type I collagen is particularly variable in terms of both over-hydroxylation of Pro in the X-position and under-hydroxylation of Pro in the Y-position. In contrast, only a few unexpected PTMs in collagens type I and type III from human placenta were observed. The reproducibility of the different sequencing efforts of the same sample is also limited especially when the modified species are present at a low population, presumably due to the unpredictable nature of the ionization process. Additionally, despite the heterogeneous preparation and sourcing, collagen samples from commercial sources do not show elevated variations in PTMs compared to samples prepared from a single tissue and/or organism. These findings will contribute to the growing body of information regarding the PTMs of collagen by MS technology, and culminate to a more comprehensive understanding of the extent and the functional roles of the PTMs of collagen.\n\nAbbreviations pageBoth the single letter and the three letter abbreviations of an amino acid will be used with the following additions: Hyp or O stands for 4R-hydroxylated proline and 3Hyp stands for 3- hydroxylated proline.

The retinal image, Strehl ratio, and modulation transfer function (MTF) were compared between the ray-tracing and field-tracing optical simulation and confirmed by the results reported in an in vitro experiment using the same eye model.\n\nResultsThe retinal image showed interference fringes from target due to diffraction from the object in a field-tracing simulation. When compared with the experimental results, the field tracing represented the experimental results more precisely than ray tracing after passing over 400 {micro}m of the decentration and 4 degrees of the tilt of the IOLs. The MTF values showed similar results for the case of no IOL misalignment in both the field tracing and ray tracing. In the case of the 200-{micro}m decentration or 8-degree tilt of IOL, the field-traced MTF shows lower values than the ray-traced one.\n\nConclusionsThe field-tracing optical bench simulation is a reliable method to evaluate IOL performance according to the IOL misalignment. It can provide retinal image quality close to real by taking into account the wave nature of light, interference and diffraction to explain to patients having the IOL misalignment.",

We characterized RNLS expression in premalignant and malignant PDAC tissue and investigated whether plasma RNLS levels corresponded to clinical PDAC characteristics. RNLS immunohistochemistry was used to determine the presence and distribution of RNLS in normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, PDAC precursor lesions, and PDAC tissues. Associations between pretreatment plasma RNLS and PDAC clinical status were assessed in patients with varied clinical stages of PDAC and included tumor characteristics, surgical resection in locally advanced/borderline resectable PDAC, and overall survival. Data were retrospectively obtained and correlated using non-parametric analysis. Mild to no RNLS was detected by histochemistry in the normal pancreas in the absence of abdominal trauma. In chronic pancreatitis, RNLS immunoreactivity localized to peri-acinar spindle-shaped cells in some samples. It was also widely present in PDAC precursor lesions and PDAC tissue. Among 240 patients with PDAC, elevated plasma RNLS levels were associated with worse tumor characteristics, including greater angiolymphatic invasion (80.0% vs. 58.1%, p = 0.012) and greater node positive disease (76.5% vs. 56.5%, p = 0.024). Overall survival was worse in patients with high plasma RNLS levels with median follow-up of 27.70 months vs. 65.03 months (p < 0.001). RNLS levels also predicted whether patients with locally advanced/borderline resectable (LA/BR) PDAC underwent resection (AUC 0.674; 95%CI 0.42-0.82, p = 0.04). Overall tissue RNLS was increased in both premalignant and malignant PDAC tissues compared to normal pancreas. Elevated plasma RNLS levels were associated with advanced tumor characteristics, decreased overall survival, and reduced resectability in patients with LA/BR PDAC. These studies show that RNLS levels are increased in premalignant pancreatic tissues and that its levels in plasma correspond to the clinical behavior of PDAC.",

Morphological and biochemical analyses of mammoth lung and liver demonstrated that those soft tissues were preserved at the gross anatomical and histological levels. The ultrastructure of ECM components, namely a fibrillar structure with a collagen-characteristic pattern of cross-striation, was clearly visible with transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Type I and type IV collagens were detected by immunohistochemical observation. Quantitative amino acid analysis of liver and lung tissues of the baby mammoths indicated that collagenous protein is selectively preserved in these tissues as a main protein. Type I and type III collagens were detected as major components by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis after digestion with trypsin. These results indicate that the triple helical collagen molecule, which is resistant to proteinase digestion, has been preserved in the soft tissues of these frozen mammoths for 40,000 years.",

    "abstract": "The remodelling of flagella into attachment structures is a common and important event in the insect stages of the trypanosomatid life cycle. Among their hymenopteran hosts, Lotmaria passim and Crithidia mellificae can parasitize Apis mellifera, and as a result they might have a significant impact on honeybee health. However, there are details of their life cycle and the mechanisms underlying their pathogenicity in this host that remain unclear. Here we show that both L. passim promastigotes and C. mellificae choanomastigotes differentiate into haptomonad stage covering the ileum and rectum of honeybees. These haptomonad cells remain attached to the host surface via zonular hemidesmosome-like structures, as revealed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Hence, for the first time this work describes the haptomonad morphotype of these species and their hemidesmosome-like attachment in Apis mellifera, a key trait exploited by other trypanosomatid species to proliferate in the insect host hindgut.\n\nAuthor summaryIn recent years, the mortality of European Honeybees (Apis mellifera) has risen worldwide due to a variety of factors, including their infection by parasites. Former studies have linked the presence of several trypanosomatids species, being Lotmaria passim and Crithidia mellificae the most prevalent ones, with this increase in mortality. Although previous studies have shown that trypanosomatid infection reduces the lifespan of bees, there is little information regarding their development in the gut when honeybees become infected. Here, for the first time we describe the haptomonad morphotype of these two trypanosomatid species in A. mellifera. The most characteristic feature of haptomonads is the extensive remodelling of the flagellum and the formation of junctional complexes at the host gut wall. The presence of this morphotype in the honeybee hindgut increases our understanding of the life cycle of these species and their possible pathogenic mechanisms. We found that they can multiply while attached and that their disposition, covering the hindgut walls, could hinder host nutrient uptake and consequently, represent a pathogenic mechanism itself. This attachment could also be a key stage in the life-cycle to prevent the trypanosomatids leaving the host prematurely, ensuring transmission through infective morphotypes.",

Over the course of development, brain responses became more discretized into stable and coherent events and shifted earlier in time to anticipate upcoming perceived event transitions, measured behaviorally in an age-matched sample. However, hippocampal responses to event boundaries actually decreased with age, suggesting a shifting division of labor between episodic encoding processes and schematic event representations between the ages of 5 and 19.",

    "abstract": "SNCA, the first gene associated with Parkinsons disease, encodes the -synuclein (-syn) protein, the predominant component within pathological inclusions termed Lewy bodies (LBs). The presence of LBs is one of the classical hallmarks found in the brain of patients with Parkinsons disease, and LBs have also been observed in patients with other synucleinopathies. However, the study of -syn pathology in cells has relied largely on two-dimensional culture models, which typically lack the cellular diversity and complex spatial environment found in the brain. Here, to address this gap, we use 3D midbrain organoids (hMOs), differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients carrying a triplication of the SNCA gene and from CRISPR/Cas9 corrected isogenic control iPSCs. These hMOs recapitulate key features of -syn pathology observed in the brains of patients with synucleinopathies. In particular, we find that SNCA triplication hMOs express elevated levels of -syn and exhibit an age-dependent increase in -syn aggregation, manifested by the presence of both oligomeric and phosphorylated forms of -syn. These phosphorylated -syn aggregates were found in both neurons and glial cells and their time-dependent accumulation correlated with a selective reduction in dopaminergic neuron numbers. Thus, hMOs from patients carrying SNCA gene multiplication can reliably model key pathological features of Parkinsons disease and provide a powerful system to study the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Papua New Guinea is home to >10% of the worlds languages and rich and varied biocultural knowledge, but the future of this diversity remains unclear. We measured language skills of 6,190 students speaking 392 languages (5.5% of the global total) and modelled their future trends, using individual-level variables characterizing family language use, socio-economic conditions, students skills, and language traits. This approach showed that only 58% of the students, compared to 91% of their parents, were fluent in indigenous languages, while the trends in key drivers of language skills (language use at home, proportion of mixed-language families, urbanization, students traditional skills) predicted accelerating decline of fluency, to an estimated 26% in the next generation of students. Ethnobiological knowledge declined in close parallel with language skills. Varied medicinal plant uses known to the students speaking indigenous languages are replaced by a few, mostly non-native species for the students speaking English or Tok Pisin, the national lingua franca. Most (88%) students want to teach indigenous language to their children. While crucial for keeping languages alive, this intention faces powerful external pressures as key factors (education, cash economy, road networks, urbanization) associated with language attrition are valued in contemporary society.\n\nSignificance StatementAround the world, more than 7,000 languages are spoken, most of them by small populations of speakers in the tropics. Globalization puts small languages at a disadvantage, but our understanding of the drivers and rate of language loss remains incomplete. When we tested key factors causing language attrition among Papua New Guinean students speaking 392 different indigenous languages, we found an unexpectedly rapid decline in their language skills compared to their parents and predicted further acceleration of language loss in the next generation. Language attrition was accompanied by decline in the traditional knowledge of nature among the students, pointing to an uncertain future for languages and biocultural knowledge in the most linguistically diverse place on Earth.",

    "abstract": "In the vertebrate central nervous system, oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a specialized proteolipid rich membrane, to insulate and support axons. Individual oligodendrocytes wrap multiple axons with myelin sheaths of variable lengths and thicknesses. Myelin grows at the distal ends of oligodendrocyte processes and multiple lines of work have provided evidence that mRNAs and RNA binding proteins localize to myelin, together supporting a model where local translation controls myelin sheath growth. What signal transduction mechanisms could control this? One strong candidate is the Akt-mTOR pathway, a major cellular signaling hub that coordinates transcription, translation, metabolism, and cytoskeletal organization. Here, using zebrafish as a model system, we found that Akt-mTOR signaling promotes myelin sheath growth and stability during development. Through cell-specific manipulations to oligodendrocytes, we show that the Akt-mTOR pathway drives cap-dependent translation to promote myelination and that restoration of cap-dependent translation is sufficient to rescue myelin deficits in mTOR loss-of-function animals. Moreover, an mTOR-dependent translational regulator co-localized with mRNA encoding a canonically myelin-translated protein in vivo and bioinformatic investigation revealed numerous putative translational targets in the myelin transcriptome. Together, these data raise the possibility that Akt-mTOR signaling in nascent myelin sheaths promotes sheath growth via translation of myelin-resident mRNAs during development.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn the brain and spinal cord oligodendrocytes extend processes that tightly wrap axons with myelin, a protein and lipid rich membrane that increases electrical impulses and provides trophic support. Myelin membrane grows dramatically following initial axon wrapping in a process that demands protein and lipid synthesis. How protein and lipid synthesis is coordinated with the need for myelin to be generated in certain locations remains unknown. Our study reveals that the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway promotes myelin sheath growth by regulating protein translation. Because we found translational regulators of the Akt-mTOR pathway in myelin, our data raise the possibility Akt-mTOR activity regulates translation in myelin sheaths to deliver myelin on demand to the places it is needed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding speech in background noise is a difficult task. The tracking of speech rhythms such as the rate of syllables and words by cortical activity has emerged as a key neural mechanism for speech-in-noise comprehension. In particular, recent investigations have used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with the envelope of a speech signal to influence the cortical speech tracking, demonstrating that this type of stimulation modulates comprehension and therefore evidencing a functional role of the cortical tracking in speech processing. Cortical activity has been found to track the rhythms of a background speaker as well, but the functional significance of this neural response remains unclear. Here we employ a speech-comprehension task with a target speaker in the presence of a distractor voice to show that tACS with the speech envelope of the target voice as well as tACS with the envelope of the distractor speaker both modulate the comprehension of the target speech.\n\nBecause the envelope of the distractor speech does not carry information about the target speech stream, the modulation of speech comprehension through tACS with this envelope evidences that the cortical tracking of the background speaker affects the comprehension of the foreground speech signal. The phase dependency of the resulting modulation of speech comprehension is, however, opposite to that obtained from tACS with the envelope of the target speech signal. This suggests that the cortical tracking of the ignored speech stream and that of the attended speech stream may compete for neural resources.\n\nSignificance StatementLoud environments such as busy pubs or restaurants can make conversation difficult. However, they also allow us to eavesdrop into other conversations that occur in the background. In particular, we often notice when somebody else mentions our name, even if we have not been listening to that person. However, the neural mechanisms by which background speech is processed remain poorly understood. Here we employ transcranial alternating current stimulation, a technique through which neural activity in the cerebral cortex can be influenced, to show that cortical responses to rhythms in the distractor speech modulate the comprehension of the target speaker. Our results evidence that the cortical tracking of background speech rhythms plays a functional role in speech processing.",
