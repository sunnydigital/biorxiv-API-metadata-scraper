    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal gene expression patterns are governed to a large extent by the activity of enhancer elements, which engage in physical contacts with their target genes. Identification of enhancer-promoter (EP) links that are functional only in a specific subset of cell types is a key challenge in understanding gene regulation. We introduce CT-FOCS, a statistical inference method that uses linear mixed effect models to infer EP links that show marked activity only in a single or a small subset of cell types out of a large panel of probed cell types. Analyzing 808 samples from FANTOM5, covering 472 cell lines, primary cells, and tissues, CT-FOCS inferred such EP links more accurately than recent state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that strictly cell type-specific EP links are very uncommon in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "Daily temporal organisation of behavioural and physiological functions offers a fitness advantage for most animals. Optimized temporal niches are determined by an interplay between external environmental rhythms and internal circadian clocks. While daily light:dark cycles serve as a robust time cue (Zeitgeber) to synchronise circadian clocks, it is not clear how animals experiencing only weak environmental cues deal with this problem. Like humans, flies of the genus Drosophila originate in sub-Saharan Africa and spread North in Europe up to the polar circle where they experience extremely long days in the summer or even constant light (LL). LL is known to disrupt clock function, due to constant activation of the deep brain photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), which induces constant degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). Temperature cycles are able to overcome these arrhythmia inducing effects of LL, reinstating clock protein oscillations and rhythmic behaviour. We show here that for this to occur a recently evolved natural allele (ls-tim) of the timeless gene is required, whereby the presence of this allele within the central clock neurons is sufficient. The ls-tim allele encodes a longer, less-light sensitive form of TIM (L-TIM) in addition to the shorter (S-TIM) form, the only form encoded by the ancient s-tim allele. Only after blocking light-input by removing functional CRY, s-tim flies are able to synchronise molecular and behavioural rhythms to temperature cycles in LL. Additional removal of light input from the visual system results in a phase advance of molecular and behavioural rhythms, showing that the visual system contributes to temperature synchronization in LL. We show that ls-tim, but not s-tim flies can synchronise their behavioural activity to semi-natural LL and temperature cycle conditions reflecting long Northern Europe summer days, the season when Drosophila populations massively expand. Our observations suggest that this functional gain associated with ls-tim is driving the Northern spread of this allele by directional selection.",

    "abstract": "The leucine-rich repeat-containing family 8 member A (LRRC8A) is an essential subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). VRAC is critical for cell volume control, but its broader physiological functions remain under investigation. Recent studies in the field indicate that Lrrc8a disruption in brain astrocytes reduces neuronal excitability, impairs synaptic plasticity and memory, and protects against cerebral ischemia. In the present work, we generated the brain-wide conditional LRRC8A knock-out mice (LRRC8A bKO) using NestinCre-driven Lrrc8aflox/flox excision in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia. LRRC8A bKO animals were born close to the expected Mendelian ratio and developed without overt histological abnormalities, but, surprisingly, all died between 5 and 9 weeks of age with a seizure phenotype, which was confirmed by video and EEG recordings. Brain slice electrophysiology detected changes in the excitability of pyramidal cells and modified GABAergic inputs in the hippocampal CA1 region of LRRC8A bKO. LRRC8A-null hippocampi showed increased immunoreactivity of the astrocytic marker GFAP, indicating reactive astrogliosis. We also found decreased whole-brain protein levels of the GABA transporter GAT-1, the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and the astrocytic enzyme glutamine synthetase. Complementary HPLC assays identified reduction in the tissue levels of the glutamate and GABA precursor glutamine. Together, these findings suggest that VRAC provides vital control of brain excitability in mouse adolescence. VRAC deletion leads to a lethal phenotype involving progressive astrogliosis and dysregulation of astrocytic uptake and supply of amino acid neurotransmitters and their precursors.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics remain one of the most effective methods for controlling bacterial infection. However, the diverse impacts of antimicrobials on bacterial physiology and host immunity remain unclear. A comprehensive antibiotic screen revealed that disruption of thymidine synthesis in Firmicutes with anti-folate antibiotics promoted elevated levels of the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-AMP, and consequently induced host STING activation during infection. Extensive exposure to antibiotics targeting folate synthesis drives the emergence of thymidine-dependent Staphylococcus aureus SCVs (TD-SCVs). Respiratory infections with TD-SCVs are common among children with cystic fibrosis and are associated with worse clinical outcomes, although the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be defined. Our study reveals that TD-SCV isolates exhibited excessive c-di-AMP production and STING activation in a thymidine-dependent manner. Murine lung infection with TD-SCVs revealed STING-dependent elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to higher airway neutrophil infiltration and activation comparing to normal colony S. aureus and hemin-dependent SCV. Our results suggest the elevated inflammatory capacity of TD-SCVs contribute to their pathogenesis and revealed a new aspect of STING signaling in the airway by characterizing its role in neutrophil recruitment.",

    "abstract": "Child abuse (CA) is a strong predictor of psychopathologies and suicide, altering normal trajectories of brain development in areas closely linked to emotional responses such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Yet, the cellular underpinnings of these enduring effects are unclear. Childhood and adolescence are marked by the protracted formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which orchestrate the closure of developmental windows of cortical plasticity by regulating the functional integration of parvalbumin interneurons (PV) into neuronal circuits. Using well-characterized post-mortem brain samples, we show that a history of CA is specifically associated with increased densities and morphological complexity of WFL-labeled PNNs in the ventromedial PFC (BA11/12), possibly suggesting increased recruitment and maturation of PNNs. Through single-nucleus sequencing and fluorescent in-situ hybridization, we found that the expression of canonical components of PNNs is enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and that they are upregulated in CA victims. These correlational findings suggest that early-life adversity may lead to persistent patterns of maladaptive behaviors by reducing the neuroplasticity of cortical circuits through the enhancement of developmental OPC-mediated PNN formation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople in westernised countries spend most of their time indoors. A healthy human microbiome relies on the interaction with and exchange of microbes that takes place between the human body and its environment. For this reason, the built environment might represent a potent source of commensal microbes. Anaerobic microbes are of particular interest, as researchers have not yet sufficiently clarified how the human microbiome acquires oxygen-sensitive microbes, such as obligate or facultative anaerobes.\n\nMethodsWe sampled ten households and used propidium monoazide to assess the viability of the collected prokaryotes. We compared the microbiome profiles based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and confirmed our results by genetic and cultivation-based analyses.\n\nResultsQuantitative and qualitative analysis revealed that most of the microbial taxa are of human origin. Less than 25% of the prokaryotic signatures found in built environment (BE) samples originate from intact - and thus potentially living - cells, indicating that aerobic and stress resistant taxa display an apparent survival advantage. Although the dominant microbial fraction identified on the bathroom floors is composed of aerobes, we confirmed the presence of strictly anaerobic taxa, including methanogenic archaea, in PMA-treated samples. As methanogens are regarded as highly sensitive to aerobic conditions, oxygen-tolerance experiments were performed with human-associated isolates to validate their survival. These results show that these taxa have a limited but substantial ability to survive in the BE. We determined that human-associated methanogens can survive oxic conditions for at least 6 h.\n\nConclusionsThis study enabled us to collect strong evidence that supports the hypothesis that obligate anaerobic taxa can survive in the BE for a limited amount of time. This suggests that the BE serves as a potential source of anaerobic human commensals.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form a root endosymbiosis with many agronomically important crop species and both enhance the ability of their host to obtain nutrients from the soil and increase host tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors. However, AM fungal species differ in the benefits they provide to their host plants. Here, we examined the putative molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the physiological response of Medicago truncatula to either Rhizophagus irregularis or Glomus aggregatum, a high or a low benefit AM fungus, respectively. Colonization with R. irregularis led to higher growth and nutrient uptake benefits than the colonization with G. aggregatum. These benefits were linked to an elevated expression in the roots of genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis (NSP1, NSP2, CCD7, and MAX1a), mycorrhiza-induced phosphate (PT8), ammonium (AMT2;3), and nitrate (NPF4.12) transporters and the putative ammonium transporter NIP1;5. R. irregularis also stimulated the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in the shoot and the upregulation of the sugar transporters SWEET1.2, SWEET3.3 and SWEET 12 and the lipid biosynthesis gene RAM2 in the roots. In contrast, G. aggregatum induced the expression of biotic stress defense response genes in the shoots and several genes associated with abiotic stress in the roots. This suggests that either the host perceives colonization by G. aggregatum as a pathogen attack or that G. aggregatum can prime host defense responses. Our findings reveal novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the host plant response to colonization with high- and low-benefit arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbionts.",

    "abstract": "The amplitude of activation in brain resting state networks (RSNs), measured with resting-state functional MRI, is heritable and genetically correlated across RSNs, indicating pleiotropy. Recent univariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explored the genetic underpinnings of individual variation in RSN activity. Yet univariate genomic analyses do not describe the pleiotropic nature of RSNs. In this study we used a novel multivariate method called genomic SEM to model latent factors that capture the shared genomic influence on RSNs and to identify SNPs and genes driving this pleiotropy. Using summary statistics from GWAS of 21 RSNs reported in UK Biobank (N = 31,688), the genomic latent factor analysis was first conducted in a discovery sample (N = 21,081), and then tested in an independent sample from the same cohort (N = 10,607). In the discovery sample, we show that the genetic organization of RSNs can be best explained by two distinct but correlated genetic factors that divide multimodal association networks and sensory networks. Eleven of the 17 factor loadings were replicated in the independent sample. With the multivariate GWAS, we found and replicated nine independent SNPs associated with the joint architecture of RSNs. Further, by combining the discovery and replication samples, we discovered additional SNP and gene associations with the two factors of RSN amplitude. We conclude that modelling the genetic effects on brain function in a multivariate way is a powerful approach to learn more about the biological mechanisms involved in brain function.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the factors influencing 137Cs concentrations in freshwater salmonids is crucial for reviving inland fisheries in polluted regions. We studied seasonal variations of 137Cs concentration in charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) through uptake and metabolism in forested headwaters at Fukushima and Gunma sites. Charr consumed both terrestrial and aquatic animals, and terrestrial prey was predated more in summer at both sites. The 137Cs concentrations in litter, which is a dominant basal food resource of both forest and stream ecosystems, differed between forest and stream due to 137Cs leaching effect on litter submerged in streams. The concentration difference in both litter and prey was greater at Fukushima site than at Gunma site. The estimated prey 137Cs concentration at Fukushima site peaked in summer when terrestrial preys are most available, whereas it remained relatively constant at Gunma site because of the small difference of 137Cs concentrations in between terrestrial and aquatic preys. The specific metabolic rate of charr was commonly changed with stream water temperature, greatest in summer and lowest in winter at both sites. Because both prey 137Cs concentrations and specific metabolic rates peaked in summer, the combination of uptake and metabolism at Fukushima site largely negated seasonal 137Cs fluctuations in charr, whereas specific metabolic rate fluctuations could be the major determinant of charr 137Cs concentrations at Gunma site. Our results suggested that 137Cs concentrations in prey items, whose seasonality are varied due to initial 137Cs fallout volume, were expected to be an important determinant for 137Cs concentrations in charr.",

Plant-microbe symbioses such as the legume-rhizobium mutualism are ecologically and economically important, but distinct life history and dispersal mechanisms for these host and microbial partners, plus dynamic genome composition in bacteria, present challenges for understanding spatial genetic processes in these systems. Here we study the model rhizobium Ensifer meliloti using a hierarchically-structured sample of 191 strains from 21 sites in the native range and compare its population structure to that of its host plant Medicago truncatula. We find high local genomic variation and minimal isolation by distance across the rhizobium genome, particularly at the two symbiosis elements pSymA and pSymB, which have evolutionary histories and population structures that are similar to each other but distinct from both the chromosome and the host. While the chromosome displays weak isolation by distance, it is uncorrelated with hosts. Patterns of discordant population structure among elements with the bacterial genome has implications for bacterial adaptation to life in the soil versus symbiosis, while discordant population genetic structure of hosts and microbes might restrict local adaptation of species to each other and give rise to phenotypic mismatches in coevolutionary traits.",

We validate this approach by replicating classic N170 effects in neural responses, triggered by fixation onsets (fERPs). Importantly, our more natural stimulus paradigm yielded smaller variability between subjects than the classic setup.

    "abstract": "Rapid clonal expansion of antigen specific T cells is a fundamental feature of adaptive immune responses. It enables the outgrowth of an individual T cell into thousands of clonal descendants that diversify into short-lived effectors and long-lived memory cells. Clonal expansion is thought to be programmed upon priming of a single naive T cell and then executed by homogenously fast divisions of all of its descendants. However, the actual speed of cell divisions in such an emerging  T cell family has never been measured with single-cell resolution. Here, we utilize continuous live-cell imaging in vitro to track the division speed and genealogical connections of all descendants derived from a single naive CD8+ T cell throughout up to ten divisions of activation-induced proliferation. This comprehensive mapping of T cell family trees identifies a short burst phase, in which division speed is homogenously fast and maintained independent of external cytokine availability or continued T cell receptor stimulation. Thereafter, however, division speed diversifies and model-based computational analysis using a novel Bayesian inference framework for tree-structured data reveals a segregation into heritably fast and slow dividing branches. This diversification of division speed is preceded already during the burst phase by variable expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain. Later it is accompanied by selective expression of memory marker CD62L in slower dividing branches. Taken together, these data demonstrate that T cell clonal expansion is structured into subsequent burst and diversification phases the latter of which coincides with specification of memory vs. effector fate.\n\nSignificanceRapid clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells is a fundamental feature of adaptive immune responses.

We address a potential way for how WNTs specify the medial compartment by characterizing the expression of Porcupine (PORCN), an O-acyltransferase that is required for WNT secretion. We show PORCN expression across embryonic ages (E)12.5 - E14.5, E16.5, and postnatal day (P)1. Our results showed enriched PORCN in the medial domains during early stages of development, indicating that WNTs have a stronger influence on patterning of the medial compartment. PORCN was rapidly downregulated after E14.5, following the onset of sensory cell differentiation; residual expression remained in some hair cells and supporting cells. On E14.5 and E16.5, we also examined the spatial expression of Gsk3{beta}, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling to determine its potential role in radial patterning of the cochlea. Gsk3{beta} was broadly expressed across the radial axis of the epithelium; therefore, unlikely to control WNT-mediated medial specification. In conclusion, the spatial expression of PORCN enriches WNT secretion from the medial domains of the cochlea to influence the specification of cell fates in the medial sensory domain.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWnt ligands are broadly expressed during cochlear development.\nC_LIO_LIPORCN expression is highly dynamic during early cochlear development\nC_LIO_LIPORCN becomes restricted to the medial domains along the longitudinal axis.\nC_LIO_LIWnt medial specification is regulated at the level of WNT ligand secretion.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While the brain regions involved in action observation are relatively well documented in humans and primates, how these regions communicate to help understand and predict actions remains poorly understood. Traditional views emphasized a feed-forward architecture in which visual features are organized into increasingly complex representations that feed onto motor programs in parietal and then premotor cortices where the matching of observed actions upon the observers own motor programs contributes to action understanding. Predictive coding models place less emphasis on feed-forward connections and propose that feed-back connections from premotor regions back to parietal and visual neurons represent predictions about upcoming actions that can supersede visual inputs when actions become predictable, with visual input then merely representing prediction errors. Here we leverage the notion that feed-back connections target specific cortical layers to help adjudicate across these views. Specifically, we test whether observing sequences of hand actions in their natural order, which permits participants to predict upcoming actions, triggers more feed-back input to parietal regions than seeing the same actions in a scrambled sequence that hinders making predictions. Using submillimeter fMRI acquisition at 7T, we find that watching predictable sequences triggers more action-related activity (as measured using intersubject functional correlation) in the parietal cortical area PFt at depths receiving feed-back connections (layers III and V/VI) than watching the exact same actions in scrambled and hence unpredictable sequence. In addition, functional connectivity analysis performed using intersubject functional connectivity confirms that these increased action-related signals in PFt could originate from ventral premotor region BA44. This data showcases the utility of intersubject functional correlation in combination with 7T MRI to explore the architecture of social cognition under more naturalistic conditions, and provides evidence for models that emphasize the importance of feed-back connections in action prediction.",

    "abstract": "Early predator detection is a key component of the predator-prey arms race, and has driven the evolution of multiple animal hearing systems. Katydids (Insecta) have sophisticated ears, each consisting of paired tympana on each foreleg that receive sound directly externally, and internally via a narrowing ear canal through the acoustic spiracle. These ears are pressure-time difference receivers capable of sensitive and accurate directional hearing across a wide frequency range, despite the small size of katydids. Many katydid species have cuticular pinnae which form cavities around the outer tympanal surfaces, but their function is unknown. We investigated pinnal function in the katydid Copiphora gorgonensis by combining experimental biophysics and numerical modelling using 3D ear geometries. Results show that the pinnae in C. gorgonensis do not assist in directional hearing for specific call frequencies, but instead pinnae act as ultrasound detector devices. Pinnae induced large sound pressure gains that enhanced sound detection at high ultrasonic frequencies (> 60 kHz), matching the echolocation range of co-occurring insectivorous bats. Comparing pinnal mechanics of sympatric katydid species supports these findings, and suggests that pinnae evolved in katydids primarily for enhanced predator detection. Audiograms (both behavioural and neural) and tympanal cavity resonances obtained from living specimens corroborate our findings.",

    "abstract": "The Myb transcription factor plays critical roles in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Acquired genetic dysregulation of Myb, which plays a central role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene regulation, is involved in the etiology of a number of leukemias. Also, inherited non-coding variants of the Myb gene are a factor in susceptibility to many hematological conditions, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), but the mechanisms by which variations in Myb levels predispose to disease, including age-dependency in disease occurrence, are completely unknown. Here, we address these key points by showing that Myb insufficiency in mice leads in later life to MPN, myelodysplasia, and leukemia, mirroring the age profile of equivalent human diseases. This age-dependence is intrinsic to HSC, involving progressive accumulation of subtle changes. Interestingly, and linking to previous studies showing the importance of proteostasis to the maintenance of normal HSC, we observed altered proteosomal activity in young Myb-insufficient mice and later elevated ribosome activity. We propose that these alterations collectively cause an imbalance in proteostasis, potentially creating a cellular milieu favoring disease initiation by driver mutations.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum causes the most lethal form of malaria. Peroxide antimalarials based on artemisinin underpin the frontline treatments for malaria, but artemisinin resistance is rapidly spreading. Synthetic peroxide antimalarials, known as ozonides, are in clinical development and offer a potential alternative. Here, we used chemoproteomics to investigate the protein alkylation targets of artemisinin and ozonide probes, including an analogue of the ozonide clinical candidate, artefenomel. We greatly expanded the list of protein targets for peroxide antimalarials and identified significant enrichment of redox-related proteins for both artemisinins and ozonides. Disrupted redox homeostasis was confirmed by dynamic live imaging of the glutathione redox potential using a genetically encoded redox-sensitive fluorescence-based biosensor. Targeted LC-MS-based thiol metabolomics also confirmed changes in cellular thiol levels. This work shows that peroxide antimalarials disproportionately alkylate proteins involved in redox homeostasis and that disrupted redox processes are involved in the mechanism of action of these important antimalarials.\n\nImportanceThe frontline treatments for malaria are combination therapies based on the peroxide antimalarial, artemisinin. Concerningly, artemisinin resistance has emerged in malaria-endemic regions, and now poses a major threat to malaria treatment and eradication efforts. New medicines are urgently required to replace the artemisinins, and some of the most advanced candidates are the fully synthetic peroxide antimalarials, OZ277 (arterolane) and OZ439 (artefenomel). The mechanism of action of peroxide antimalarials involves the reductive activation of the peroxide bond by intra-parasitic haem, but there is no consensus regarding the specific protein targets of the resulting radical species for artemisinins and/or the ozonides. This study provides a comprehensive and unbiased chemoproteomic profile of over 400 target proteins, and confirms the specific impact of peroxide antimalarials on redox metabolism. The key role of redox targets is particularly relevant considering that the mechanism of artemisinin resistance appears to involve modulation of peroxide activation and redox homeostasis.",

We find that spike S1 is the focus of adaptive evolution, but also identify positively-selected mutations in other genes that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Adaptive changes in S1 accumulated rapidly, resulting in a remarkably high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence that is 2.5X greater than that observed in HA1 at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the rapid rollout of safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with their potential to escape therapeutic monoclonal antibodies emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parental nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited significant antiviral activity in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 significantly reduced viral load, lung pathology, and improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious. These data demonstrate that therapy with oral prodrugs of remdesivir can significantly improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Thus, GS-621763 supports the exploration of GS-441524 oral prodrugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing data concerning the structure of the adult nervous system in various Lophotrochozoa groups, the early events during the neurogenesis of rare and unique groups need clarification. Annelida are a diverse clade of Lophotrochozoa, and their representatives demonstrate a variety of body plans, lifestyles, and life cycles. Comparative data about the early development are available for Errantia, Sedentaria, Sipuncula and Palaeoannelida; however, our knowledge of Dinophiliformia is currently scarce. Representatives of Dinophiliformia are small interstitial worms combining unique morphological features of different Lophotrochozoan taxa and expressing paedomorphic traits. We describe in detail the early neurogenesis of two related species: Dimorphilus gyrociliatus and Dinophilus vorticoides, from the appearance of first nerve cells until the formation of an adult body plan. In both species, the first cells were detected at the anterior and posterior regions at the early trochophore stage and demonstrated positive reactions with pan-neuronal marker anti-acetylated tubulin only. Long fibers of early cells grow towards each other and form longitudinal bundles along which differentiating neurons later appear and send their processes. We propose that these early cells serve as pioneer neurons, forming a layout of the adult nervous system. The early anterior cell of D. vorticoides is transient and present during the short embryonic period, while early anterior and posterior cells in D. gyrociliatus are maintained throughout the whole lifespan of the species. During development, the growing processes of early cells form compact brain neuropile, paired ventral and lateral longitudinal bundles; unpaired medial longitudinal bundle; and commissures in the ventral hyposphere. Specific 5-HT- and FMRFa-immunopositive neurons differentiate adjacent to the ventral bundles and brain neuropile in the middle trochophore and late trochophore stages, i.e. after the main structures of the nervous system have already been established. Processes of 5-HT- and FMRFa-positive cells constitute a small proportion of the tubulin-immunopositive brain neuropile, ventral cords, and commissures in all developmental stages. No 5-HT- and FMRFa-positive cells similar to apical sensory cells of other Lophotrochozoa were detected. We conclude that: (i) like in Errantia and Sedentaria, Dinophiliformia neurogenesis starts from the peripheral cells, whose processes prefigure the forming adult nervous system, (ii) Dinophiliformia early cells are negative to 5-HT and FMRFa antibodies like Sedentaria pioneer cells.",

    "abstract": "Cells can sense and respond to mechanical forces in fibrous extracellular matrices (ECM) over distances much greater than their size. This phenomenon, termed long-range force transmission, is enabled by the realignment (buckling) of collagen fibers along directions where the forces are tensile (compressive). However, whether other key structural components of the ECM, in particular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), can affect the efficiency of cellular force transmission remains unclear. Here we developed a theoretical model of force transmission in collagen networks with interpenetrating GAGs, capturing the competition between tension-driven collagen-fiber alignment and the swelling pressure induced by GAGs. Using this model, we show that the swelling pressure provided by GAGs increases the stiffness of the collagen network by stretching the fibers in an isotropic manner. We found that the GAG-induced swelling pressure can help collagen fibers resist buckling as the cells exert contractile forces. This mechanism impedes the alignment of collagen fibers and decreases long-range cellular mechanical communication. We experimentally validated the theoretical predictions by comparing collagen fiber alignment between cellular spheroids cultured on collagen gels versus collagen-GAG co-gels. We found significantly less alignment of collagen in collagen-GAG co-gels, consistent with the prediction that GAGs can prevent collagen fiber alignment. The roles of GAGs in modulating force transmission uncovered in this work can be extended to understand pathological processes such as the formation of fibrotic scars and cancer metastasis, where cells communicate in the presence of abnormally high concentrations of GAGs.\n\nStatement of significanceGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are carbohydrates that are expressed ubiquitously in the human body and are among the key macromolecules that influence development, homeostasis, and pathology of native tissues. Abnormal accumulation of GAGs has been observed in metabolic disorders, solid tumors, and fibrotic tissues. Here we theoretically and experimentally show that tissue swelling caused by the highly polar nature of GAGs significantly affects the mechanical interactions between resident cells by altering the organization and alignment of the collagenous extracellular matrix. The roles of GAGs in modulating cellular force transmission revealed here can guide the design of biomaterial scaffolds in regenerative medicine and provides insights on the role of cell-cell communication in tumor progression and fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Coffee berry borer (CBB, Hypothenemus hampei Ferrari) is the most serious insect pest of coffee worldwide, yet little is known about its seasonal flight behavior or the effect that weather variables have on its activity. We sampled flying female CBB adults bi-weekly over a three-year period using red funnel traps baited with an alcohol lure at 14 commercial coffee farms on Hawaii Island to characterize seasonal phenology and the influence of five weather variables on flight activity. We captured almost 5 million Scolytid beetles during the sampling period, with 81-93% of the trap catch comprised of CBB. Of the captured non-target beetles, the majority were tropical nut borer, black twig borer and a species of Cryphalus. Two major flight events were consistent across all three years: an initial emergence from January-April that coincided with early fruit development and a second flight during the harvest season from September-December. A linear regression showed a moderate but significant negative relationship between elevation and total trap catch. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) revealed that mean daily air temperature has the most significant (positive) effect on CBB flight, with most flight events occurring between 20-26 {degrees}C. Mean daily solar radiation also had a significant positive effect, while maximum daily relative humidity negatively influenced flight at values above [~]94%. Flight was positively influenced by maximum daily wind speeds up to [~]2.5 m/s and cumulative rainfall up to 100 mm, after which activity declined. Our findings provide important insight into CBB flight patterns across a highly variable landscape and will serve as a starting point for the development of flight prediction models.",

    "abstract": "As researchers develop computational models of neural systems with increasing sophistication and scale, it is often the case that fully de novo model development is impractical and inefficient. Thus arises a critical need to quickly find, evaluate, re-use, and build upon models and model components developed by other researchers. We introduce the NeuroML Database (NeuroML-DB.org), which has been developed to address this need and to complement other model sharing resources. NeuroML-DB stores over 1,500 previously published models of ion channels, cells, and networks that have been translated to the modular NeuroML model description language. The database also provides reciprocal links to other neuroscience model databases (ModelDB, Open Source Brain) as well as access to the original model publications (PubMed). These links along with Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) search functionality provide deep integration with other neuroscience community modeling resources and greatly facilitate the task of finding suitable models for reuse.\n\nServing as an intermediate language, NeuroML and its tooling ecosystem enable efficient translation of models to other popular simulator formats. The modular nature also enables efficient analysis of a large number of models and inspection of their properties. Search capabilities of the database, together with web-based, programmable online interfaces, allow the community of researchers to rapidly assess stored model electrophysiology, morphology, and computational complexity properties. We use these capabilities to perform a database-scale analysis of neuron and ion channel models and describe a novel tetrahedral structure formed by cell model clusters in the space of model properties and features.\n\nAuthor SummaryComputational models of neurons and their circuits are increasingly used by neuroscience researchers as a tool to probe fundamental aspects of brain function. Here we describe a database of computational models of neurons and networks that makes it easier to evaluate and reuse these models. The models in the database are available in a standard format, called NeuroML, that makes it easier to extend and reuse the models in simulation studies using a wide range of simulation software platforms. The use of this standard format also makes it easier to characterize models in an automated way and analyze relationships across the features of simulated data from model simulations.\n\nStriking Image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459920v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (75K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4be5adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d3f138org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81b8e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9127bf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and consist of a network of coupled neurons, which are entrained to the environmental light-dark cycle. The phase coherence of the neurons is plastic and driven by the length of the day. With aging the capacity to behaviorally adapt to changes in the light regime reduces. The mechanisms underlying photoperiodic adaptation are largely unknown, but are important to unravel for the development of novel interventions to improve the quality of life of the elderly. We analyzed the neuronal synchronization of PER2::LUC protein expression in the SCN of young and old mice entrained to either long or short photoperiod and used the synchronization levels as input for a two-community noisy Kuramoto model. With the Kuramoto model we estimated the coupling strength between and within neuronal subpopulations. The model revealed that the coupling strength between and within subpopulations contributes to photoperiod induced changes in the phase relationship among neurons. We found that the SCN of young mice adapts in coupling strength over a large range, with low coupling strength in long photoperiod and higher coupling strength in short photoperiod. In aged mice we also found low coupling strength in long photoperiod, but strongly reduced capacity to reach high coupling strength in short photoperiod. The inability to respond with an increase in coupling strength shows that manipulation of photoperiod is not a suitable strategy to enhance clock function with aging. We conclude that the inability of aged mice to reach high coupling strength makes aged mice less capable to seasonal adaptation than young mice.\n\nAuthor SummaryCircadian clocks drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In mammals the clock resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN consist of a network of coupled neurons which are synchronized to produce a coherent rhythm. Due to plasticity of the network, seasonal adaptation to short winter days and long summer days occurs. Disturbances in circadian rhythmicity of the elderly have negative health effects, such as neurodegenerative diseases. With the rise in life expectancy this is becoming a major issue. In our paper, we used a model to compare the neuronal coupling in the SCN between young and old animals. We investigated whether exposure to short photoperiod can strengthen coupling among clock cells, and thereby clock function, in old animals. We observed that this is not possible, indicating that simple environmental manipulations are not an option. We suggest that receptor targeted interventions are required, setting the path for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Neurons can use different aspects of their spiking to simultaneously represent (multiplex) different features of a stimulus. For example, some pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) use the rate and timing of their spikes to respectively encode the intensity and frequency of vibrotactile stimuli. Doing so has several requirements. Because they fire at low rates, pyramidal neurons cannot entrain 1:1 with high-frequency (100-600 Hz) inputs and instead must skip (i.e. not respond to) some stimulus cycles. The proportion of skipped cycles must vary inversely with stimulus intensity for firing rate to encode stimulus intensity. Spikes must phase lock to the stimulus for spike times (intervals) to encode stimulus frequency but, in addition, skipping must occur irregularly to avoid aliasing. Using simulations and in vitro experiments in which S1 pyramidal neurons were stimulated with inputs emulating those induced by vibrotactile stimuli, we show that fewer cycles are skipped as stimulus intensity increases, as required for rate coding, and that physiological noise induces irregular skipping without disrupting phase locking, as required for temporal coding. This occurs because the reliability and precision of spikes evoked by small- amplitude, fast-onset signals are differentially sensitive to noise. Simulations confirmed that differences in stimulus intensity and frequency can be well discriminated based on differences in spike rate or timing, respectively, but only in the presence of noise. Our results show that multiplexed coding by S1 pyramidal neurons is facilitated rather than degraded by physiological levels of noise. In fact, multiplexing is optimal under physiologically noisy conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cation Chloride Cotransporters (CCCs) regulate intracellular chloride ion concentration ([Cl-]i) within neurons, which can reverse the direction of the neuronal response to the neurotransmitter GABA. Na+ K+ Cl- (NKCC) and K+ Cl- (KCC) cotransporters transport Cl- into or out of the cell, respectively. When NKCC activity dominates, the resulting high [Cl-]i can lead to an excitatory and depolarizing response of the neuron upon GABAA receptor opening, while KCC dominance has the opposite effect. This inhibitory-to-excitatory GABA switch has been linked to seasonal adaption of circadian clock function to changing day length, and its dysregulation is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy. Constant light normally disrupts circadian clock function and leads to arrhythmic behavior. Here, we demonstrate a function for KCC in regulating Drosophila locomotor activity and GABA responses in circadian clock neurons because alteration of KCC expression in circadian clock neurons elicits rhythmic behavior in constant light. We observed the same effects after downregulation of the Wnk and Fray kinases, which modulate CCC activity in a [Cl-]i-dependent manner. Patch-clamp recordings from clock neurons show that downregulation of KCC results in a more positive GABA reversal potential, while KCC overexpression has the opposite effect. Finally, KCC downregulation represses morning behavioral activity during long photoperiods, while downregulation of NKCC promotes morning activity. In summary, our results support a model in which the regulation of [Cl-]i by a KCC/NKCC/Wnk/Fray feedback loop determines the response of clock neurons to GABA, which is important for adjusting behavioral activity to constant light and long-day conditions.",

    "abstract": "Elevation of soluble wild-type (WT) tau occurs in synaptic compartments in Alzheimers disease. We addressed whether tau elevation affects synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held in brainstem slices. Whole-cell loading of WT human tau (h-tau) in presynaptic terminals at 10-20 {micro}M caused microtubule (MT) assembly and activity-dependent rundown of excitatory neurotransmission. Capacitance measurements revealed that the primary target of WT h-tau is vesicle endocytosis. Blocking MT assembly using nocodazole prevented tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. Immunofluorescence imaging analyses revealed that MT assembly by WT h-tau loading was associated with an increased bound fraction of the endocytic protein dynamin. A synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to dynamin-1-pleckstrin-homology domain inhibited MT-dynamin interaction and rescued tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. We conclude that elevation of presynaptic WT tau induces de novo assembly of MTs, thereby sequestering free dynamins. As a result, endocytosis and subsequent vesicle replenishment are impaired, causing activity-dependent rundown of neurotransmission.\n\nSignificance StatementWild-type human recombinant tau loaded in rodent presynaptic terminals inhibited vesicle endocytosis, thereby causing activity-dependent rundown of excitatory transmission. This endocytic block is caused by a sequestration of dynamin by excess microtubules newly assembled by tau and can be rescued by a peptide inhibiting the microtubules-dynamin interaction, or by the microtubule disassembler nocodazole. Thus, synaptic dysfunction can be induced by pathological increase of endogenous soluble tau in Alzheimer disease slice model.",

We demonstrate that contrast-sensitivity peaks in the afternoon accompanied by a four-fold increase in the average Shannon information transmitted from an active zone. This increase reflects higher synaptic gain, lower spontaneous \"noise\" and reduced variability of evoked responses. Simultaneously, an increase in the probability of multivesicular events with larger information content increases the efficiency of transmission (bits per vesicle) by factors of 1.5-2.7.

Understanding how receptors map to glomeruli is therefore critical to understanding olfaction.

Here we combined spatial sectioning along the anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes with target capture enrichment sequencing to overcome low-abundance target expression.

Additionally, we exploit tissue specific variability to characterize the number of cells present at the time of each tissues lineage commitment, ranging from approximately 20 cells in liver and whole blood tissues to 80 cells in brain tissues.

Binding of S protein to ACE2 causes internalization which activates local RAS. ACE2 is on the X chromosome and its expression is regulated by sex hormones. In this study, we defined ACE2 mRNA abundance and examined effects of S protein on ACE2 activity and/or angiotensin II (AngII) levels in pivotal tissues (lung, adipose) from male and female mice. In lung, ACE2 mRNA abundance was reduced following gonadectomy (GDX) of male and female mice and was higher in XX than XY mice of the Four Core Genotypes (FCG). Reductions in lung ACE2 mRNA abundance by GDX occurred in XX, but not XY FCG female mice. Lung mRNA abundance of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2, enzymes that shed cell surface ACE2 and facilitate viral cell entry, was reduced by GDX in male but not female mice. For comparison, adipose ACE2 mRNA abundance was higher in female than male mice and higher in XX than XY FCG mice. Adipose ADAM17 mRNA abundance was increased by GDX of male and female mice. S protein reduced ACE2 activity in alveolar type II epithelial cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Administration of S protein to male and female mice increased lung AngII levels and decreased adipose ACE2 activity in male but not female mice. These results demonstrate that sex differences in ACE2 expression levels may impact local RAS following S protein exposures.",

    "abstract": "Sperm chromatin is typically transformed by protamines into a compact and transcriptionally inactive state. Flowering plant sperm cells lack protamines, yet have small, transcriptionally active nuclei with chromatin condensed by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that a histone variant, H2B.8, mediates sperm chromatin and nuclear condensation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Loss of H2B.8 causes enlarged sperm nuclei with dispersed chromatin, whereas ectopic expression in somatic cells produces smaller nuclei with aggregated chromatin, demonstrating that H2B.8 is sufficient for chromatin condensation. H2B.8 aggregates transcriptionally inactive AT-rich chromatin into phase-separated condensates, thus achieving nuclear compaction without reducing transcription. H2B.8 also intermixes inactive AT-rich chromatin and GC-rich pericentromeric heterochromatin, altering higher-order chromatin architecture. Altogether, our results reveal a novel mechanism of nuclear compaction via global aggregation of unexpressed chromatin. We propose that H2B.8 is a flowering plant evolutionary innovation that achieves nuclear condensation compatible with active transcription.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=196 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/460326v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (56K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa7a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c6dd23org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0393borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cd8a62_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Bile acids (BAs) are molecules derived from cholesterol that are involved in dietary fat absorption. New evidence supports an additional role for BAs as regulators of brain function. Interestingly, sterols such as cholesterol interact with monoamine transporters (MAT), including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) which plays a key role in DA neurotransmission and reward circuitries in the brain. The present study explores interactions of the BA, obeticholic acid (OCA), with DAT and mechanistically defines the regulation of DAT activity via both electrophysiology and molecular modeling. We express murine DAT (mDAT) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and confirm that DA induces an inward current that reaches a steady-state at a negative membrane voltage. Next, we show that OCA triggers an inward current through DAT that is Na+ dependent and not regulated by intracellular calcium. OCA also inhibits the DAT-mediated Li+ leak current, a feature that parallels DA action and indicates direct binding to the transporter. Interestingly, OCA does not alter DA affinity nor the ability of DA to promote a DAT-mediated inward current, suggesting that the interaction of OCA with the transporter is non-competitive, in regard to DA. The current induced by OCA is transient in nature, returning to baseline in the continued presence of the BA. To understand the molecular mechanism of how OCA affects DAT electrical activity, we performed docking simulations. These simulations revealed two potential binding sites that provide important insights into the potential functional relevance of the OCA-DAT interaction. First, in the absence of DA, OCA binds DAT through interactions with D421, a residue normally involved in coordinating the binding of the Na+ ion to the Na2 binding site (Borre et al., 2014;Cheng and Bahar, 2015). Furthermore, we uncover a separate binding site for OCA on DAT, of equal potential functional impact, that is facilitated through the residues DAT R445 and D436. This binding may stabilize the inward-facing open (IFo) state by preventing the re-formation of the IF gating salt bridges, R60-D436 and R445-E428, that are required for DA transport. This study suggests that BAs may represent novel pharmacological tools to regulate DAT function, and possibly, associated behaviors.",

    "abstract": "BNT162b2-elicited human sera are known to neutralize the currently dominant Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. Here, we report the ability of 20 human sera, drawn 2 or 4 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2, to neutralize USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 bearing variant spikes from Delta plus (Delta-AY.1, Delta-AY.2), Delta-{Delta}144 (Delta with the Y144 deletion of the Alpha variant), Lambda, and B. 1.1.519 lineage viruses. Geometric mean plaque reduction neutralization titers against Delta-AY.1, Delta-AY.2, and Delta-{Delta}144 viruses are slightly lower than against USA-WA1/2020, but all sera neutralize the variant viruses to titers of [&ge;]80.\n\nNeutralization titers against Lambda and B. 1.1.519 variants and against USA-WA1/2020 are equivalent. The susceptibility of Delta plus, Lambda, and other variants to neutralization by the sera indicates that antigenic change has not led to virus escape from vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies and supports ongoing mass immunization with BNT162b2 to control the variants and to minimize the emergence of new variants.",

    "abstract": "Live oral vaccines have been explored for their protective efficacy against respiratory viruses, particularly for adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7. The potential of a live oral vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however, remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of live SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the gastrointestinal tract in rhesus macaques and its protective efficacy against intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Post-pyloric administration of SARS-CoV-2 by esophagogastroduodenoscopy resulted in limited virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract and minimal to no induction of mucosal antibody titers in rectal swabs, nasal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Low levels of serum neutralizing antibodies were induced and correlated with modestly diminished viral loads in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage following intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, our data show that post-pyloric inoculation of live SARS-CoV-2 is weakly immunogenic and confers partial protection against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 remains a global threat, despite the rapid deployment but limited coverage of multiple vaccines. Alternative vaccine strategies that have favorable manufacturing timelines, greater ease of distribution and improved coverage may offer significant public health benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. Live oral vaccines have the potential to address some of these limitations; however no studies have yet been conducted to assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live oral vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report that oral administration of live SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates may offer prophylactic benefits, but that formulation and route of administration will require further optimization.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the most significant public health threats in worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 usually have pneumonia concomitant with local inflammation and sometimes a cytokine storm. Specific components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus trigger lung inflammation, and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs exacerbates this process, although much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study of lung type II pneumocyte cells (A549) demonstrated that ORF7, an open reading frame (ORF) in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, induced the production of CCL2, a chemokine that promotes the chemotaxis of monocytes, and decreased the expression of IL-8, a chemokine that recruits neutrophils. A549 cells also had an increased level of IL-6. The results of our chemotaxis transwell assay suggested that ORF7 augmented monocyte infiltration and reduced the number of neutrophils. We conclude that the ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 may have specific effects on the immunological changes in tissues after infection. These results suggest that the functions of other ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 should also be comprehensively examined.",

    "abstract": "Development of efficient therapies for COVID-19 is the focus of intense research. The cytokine release syndrome was underlined as a culprit for severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a crucial role in human immune responses and elevated IL-6 plasma levels have been associated with the exacerbated COVID-19 pathology. Since non-structural protein 10 (NSP10) of SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated in the induction of IL-6, we designed Peptide (P)1, containing sequences corresponding to amino acids 68-96 of NSP10, and examined its effect on cultured human cells. Treatment with P1 strongly increased IL-6 secretion by the lung cancer cell line NCI-H1792 and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and revealed profound cytotoxic activity on Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment with P2, harbouring a mutation in the zinc knuckle motif of NSP10, caused no IL-6 induction and no cytotoxicity. Pre-treatment with plant-produced human anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-37b and IL-38 effectively mitigated the induction of IL-6 secretion. Our results suggest a role for the zinc knuckle motif of NSP10 in the onset of increased IL-6 plasma levels of COVID-19 patients and for IL-37b and IL-38 as therapeutics aimed at attenuating the cytokine release syndrome.",

NSP1 protein is associated with inhibiting host mRNA translation by binding to the small subunit of ribosome through its C-terminal region. Previously, we have shown the structural dynamics of NSP1 C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR) in different physiological environments. So, it would be very interesting to investigate the druggable compounds that could bind with NSP1-CTR. Here, in this article, we have performed the different spectroscopic technique-based binding assays of an anticancer drug Mitoxantrone dihydrochloride (MTX) against the NSP1-CTR. We have also performed molecular docking followed by computational simulations with two different forcefields up to one microsecond. Overall, our results have suggested good binding between NSP1-CTR and MTX and may have implications in developing therapeutic strategies targeting NSP1 protein of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of the root immune system in the interaction with rhizosphere microbes, the majority of genetic screens for immunity regulators have been performed in leaves. A previous screen identified 27 hsm (hormone-mediated suppression of MAMP-triggered immunity) mutants that are impaired in jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated suppression of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in roots. Here we characterized 16 of the hsm mutants that retain JA sensitivity and are potential negative regulators of root immunity. We found that the majority of hsm mutants show enhanced resistance to Fusarium, a root fungal pathogen; however, only a subset are more resistant to a foliar pathogen. Surprisingly, 12 of 16 hsm mutants are also impaired in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated suppression of PTI, suggesting a largely shared pathway between JA- and ABA-mediated immune suppression in roots. Although all hsm mutants are insensitive to JA-mediated suppression of root immunity, hsm4 shows hypersensitivity to JA-mediated root growth inhibition and JA-induced gene expression. Consistently, hsm4 is more resistant to leaf pathogens, suggesting that HSM4 is a negative regulator of both root and leaf immunity. Hsm4 was mapped to a mutation in a conserved ARM-repeat protein homologous to yeast SDA1, which has been reported to regulate 60S ribosome biogenesis. As translational reprogramming is a critical layer of immune regulation, this work suggests that AtSDA1 is a novel negative translational regulator of immunity. Additionally, a comprehensive characterization of all 16 hsm mutants provides a genetic toolkit to identify novel mechanisms that regulate root immunity.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome engineering technologies that can effectively and precisely perturb mammalian RNAs are needed to accelerate biological discovery and RNA therapeutics. However, the broad utility of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the design rules governing guide RNA activity as well as cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal validation experiments (https://www.RNAtargeting.org). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity and cytotoxicity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including human embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells, and neurons. Finally, our Cas13d guide efficiency model successfully generalized to DjCas13d, highlighting the utility of a comprehensive approach combining machine learning with ortholog discovery to advance RNA targeting in human cells.",

    "abstract": "To develop a universal strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and infection represents a central aim for effective COVID-19 therapy. The growing impact of emerging variants of concern increases the urgency for development of effective interventions. Since ACE2 is the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor and all tested variants bind to ACE2, some even at much increased affinity (see accompanying paper), we hypothesized that aerosol administration of clinical grade soluble human recombinant ACE2 (APN01) will neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the airways, limit spread of infection in the lung and mitigate lung damage caused by deregulated signaling in the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and Kinin pathways. Here we show that intranasal administration of APN01 in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection dramatically reduced weight loss and prevented animal death. As a prerequisite to a clinical trial, we evaluated both virus binding activity and enzymatic activity for cleavage of Ang II following aerosolization. We report successful aerosolization for APN01, retaining viral binding as well as catalytic RAS activity. Dose range-finding and IND-enabling repeat-dose aerosol toxicology testing were conducted in dogs. Twice daily aerosol administration for two weeks at the maximum feasible concentration revealed no notable toxicities. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers can now be initiated, with subsequent Phase II testing in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This strategy could be used to develop a viable and rapidly actionable therapy to prevent and treat COVID-19, against all current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPreclinical development and evaluation of aerosolized soluble recombinant human ACE2 (APN01) administered as a COVID-19 intervention is reported.",

This data captured goes beyond monolithic genetic sequences and towards circuit modularity and functional details, which are beneficial for analyzing circuit performance and establishing design automation techniques. However, the accessibility, visualisation and usability of design data (and metadata) have received relatively little attention to date. Here, we present a method to turn circuit designs into networks and showcase its potential to enhance the utility of design data. Since networks are dynamic structures, initial graphs can be interactively shaped into sub-networks of relevant information based on requirements such as abstraction, hierarchy and protein interactions. Additionally, several visual changes can be applied, such as colouring or clustering nodes based on types (e.g., genes or promoters), resulting in easier comprehension from a user perspective. This approach allows circuit designs to be coupled to other networks, such as metabolic pathways or implementation protocols captured in graph-like formats. Therefore, we advocate using networks to structure, access and improve synthetic biology information.",

    "abstract": "The cone-shaped mature HIV-1 capsid is the main orchestrator of early viral replication. After cytosolic entry, it transports the viral replication complex along microtubules towards the nucleus. While it was initially believed that the reverse transcribed genome is released from the capsid in the cytosol, recent observations indicate that a high amount of capsid protein (CA) remains associated with subviral complexes during import through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Observation of post-entry events via microscopic detection of HIV-1 CA is challenging, since epitope shielding limits immunodetection and the genetic fragility of CA hampers direct labeling approaches. Here, we present a minimally invasive strategy based on genetic code expansion and click chemistry that allows for site-directed fluorescent labeling of HIV-1 CA, while retaining virus morphology and infectivity. Thereby, we could directly visualize virions and subviral complexes using advanced microscopy, including nanoscopy and correlative imaging. Quantification of signal intensities of subviral complexes revealed an amount of CA associated with nuclear complexes in HeLa-derived cells and primary T cells consistent with a complete capsid and showed that treatment with the small molecule inhibitor PF74 did not result in capsid dissociation from nuclear complexes. Cone-shaped objects detected in the nucleus by electron tomography were clearly identified as capsid-derived structures by correlative microscopy. High-resolution imaging revealed dose-dependent clustering of nuclear capsids, suggesting that incoming particles may follow common entry routes.",

We developed a biochemical-isotopic model of methanogenesis by CO2 reduction, which predicts carbon and hydrogen isotopic fractionations, and clumped isotopologue distributions, as functions of the cells environment. We mechanistically explain multiple-isotopic patterns in laboratory and natural settings and show that such patterns constrain the in-situ energetics of methanogenesis. Combining our model with environmental data, we infer that in almost all marine environments and gas deposits, energy-limited methanogenesis operates close to chemical and isotopic equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Type IV pili (T4P) are important virulence factors involved in host attachment and other aspects of bacterial pathogenesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the T4P filament is polymerized from pilin subunits at the platform complex in the inner membrane (IM) and exits the outer membrane (OM) through the OM secretin channel. Although essential for T4P assembly and function, the OM secretin complexes can potentially impair the permeability barrier function of the OM and allow the entry of antibiotics and other toxic molecules. The mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria prevent secretin-mediated OM leakage is currently not well understood. Here, we report a discovery of SlkA and SlkB (PA5122 and PA5123) that prevent permeation of several classes of antibiotics through the secretin channel of Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pili. We found these periplasmic proteins interact with the OM secretin complex and prevent toxic molecules from entering through the channel when there is a problem in the assembly of the T4P IM subcomplexes or when docking between the OM and IM complexes is defective. Thus, our results indicate that the secretin channel-interacting proteins play an important role in maintaining the OM permeability barrier, suggesting they may be attractive targets for potentiators that sensitize Gram-negative pathogens to antibiotics that are normally ineffective at penetrating the OM.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arthropod-borne alphavirus and a serious threat to human health. Therefore, efforts toward elucidating how this virus causes disease and the molecular mechanisms underlying steps of the viral replication cycle are crucial. Using an in vivo transmission system that allows intra-host evolution, we identified an emerging CHIKV variant carrying a mutation in the E1 glycoprotein (V156A) in the serum of mice and saliva of mosquitoes. E1 V156A has since emerged in humans during an outbreak in Brazil, co-occurring with a second mutation, E1 K211T, suggesting an important role for these residues in CHIKV biology. Given the emergence of these variants, we hypothesized that they function to promote CHIKV infectivity and subsequent disease. Here, we show that E1 V156A and E1 K211T modulate virus attachment and fusion and impact binding to heparin, a homolog of heparan sulfate, a key entry factor on host cells. These variants also exhibit differential neutralization by anti-glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies, suggesting structural impacts on the particle that may be responsible for altered interactions at the host membrane. Finally, E1 V156A and E1 K211T exhibit increased titers in an adult arthritic mouse model and induce increased foot-swelling at the site of injection. Taken together, this work has revealed new roles for E1 where discrete regions of the glycoprotein are able to modulate cell attachment and swelling within the host.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlphaviruses represent a growing threat to human health worldwide. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has rapidly spread to new geographic regions in the last several decades, causing overwhelming outbreaks of disease, yet there are no approved therapeutics. The CHIKV glycoproteins are key determinants of CHIKV adaptation and virulence. In this study, we characterize the naturally emerging E1 glycoprotein variants, V156A and K211T. We demonstrate that E1 V156A and K211T function in virus attachment to cells, a role that until now has been only attributed to the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. We also demonstrate E1 V156A and K211T to increase foot-swelling in mice. Observing that these variants and other pathogenic variants occur at the E1-E1 inter-spike interface, we highlight this structurally important region as critical for multiple steps during CHIKV infection. Together, these studies further defines the function of E1 in CHIKV infection and can inform the development of therapeutic or preventative strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOlder adults are more susceptible to respiratory pathogens, several of which have been associated with an altered respiratory microbiota. Influenza-like illness (ILI), a disease caused by respiratory pathogens including but not exclusively by influenza virus, is a major health concern in this population. However, there is little information on changes in the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota of older adults associated with respiratory infections identified by/ reported as ILI, as well as its dynamics during recovery. Here, we compared the NP microbiota in older adults who presented with ILI (n= 240) to the NP microbiota in older adults not reporting an ILI event (n= 157) during the 2014-2015 influenza season. To investigate the dynamics of the microbiota from the acute phase to the recovery phase of the infection, participants reporting an ILI event were sampled at onset of infection (<72 hours), at 14 days and at 7-9 weeks after infection (recovery sample).\n\nResultsCross-sectional analysis of the microbiota at the different time-points showed no differences in alpha diversity between the groups. A small but significant effect of the ILI was observed on the microbiota community and structure when compared to controls and recovery samples. Furthermore, the NP microbiota exhibited inter-individual differences in dynamics from onset of ILI to recovery. Corynebacterium, one of the keystone species in the upper respiratory tract, was negatively associated with ILI and its abundance increased after recovery. Potential pathobionts such as Haemophilus, Porphyromonas and Gemella had higher abundances during acute-ILI. Stability and changes in the NP microbial community showed individual dynamics. Key core genera, Corynebacterium, Moraxella and Dolosigranulum exhibited higher inter-individual variability in acute-ILI, but showed comparable variability to controls after recovery. Participants in the ILI group with higher core microbiota abundances at the acute phase showed higher microbiota stability after recovery.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that acute-ILI is associated with small but significant alterations in the phylogenetic structure of the NP microbiota in older adults. The observed variation in the core microbiota suggests potential imbalances in the ecosystem, which could play a role in the recovery of the NP microbiota after an ILI event.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRecent technological developments have facilitated an expansion of microbiome-metabolome studies, in which a set of microbiome samples are assayed using both genomic and metabolomic technologies to characterize the composition of microbial taxa and the concentrations of various metabolites. A common goal of many of these studies is to identify microbial features (species or genes) that contribute to differences in metabolite levels across samples. Previous work indicated that integrating these datasets with reference knowledge on microbial metabolic capacities may enable more precise and confident inference of such microbe-metabolite links.\n\nResultsWe present MIMOSA2, an R package and web application for model-based integrative analysis of microbiome-metabolome datasets. MIMOSA2 uses reference databases to construct a community metabolic model based on microbiome data and uses this model to predict differences in metabolite levels across samples. These predictions are compared with metabolomics data to identify putative microbiome-governed metabolites and specific taxonomic contributors to metabolite variation. MIMOSA2 supports various input data types and can be customized to incorporate user-defined metabolic pathways. We demonstrate MIMOSA2s ability to identify ground truth microbial mechanisms in simulation datasets, and compare its results with experimentally inferred mechanisms in a dataset describing honeybee gut microbiota. Overall, MIMOSA2 combines reference databases, a validated statistical framework, and a user-friendly interface to facilitate modeling and evaluating relationships between members of the microbiota and their metabolic products.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationMIMOSA2 is implemented in R under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and is freely available as a web server and R package from www.borensteinlab.com/software_MIMOSA2.html.",

    "abstract": "The parasite Trypanosoma brucei grows as bloodstream forms in mammalian hosts, and as procyclic forms in tsetse flies. Trypanosome protein coding genes are arranged in polycistronic transcription units, so gene expression regulation depends heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms. The essential RNA-binding protein RBP10 is expressed only in mammalian-infective forms, where it targets procyclic-specific mRNAs for destruction. We show that developmental regulation of RBP10 expression is mediated by the exceptionally long 7.3 Kb 3-UTR of its mRNA. Different regulatory sequences that can independently enhance mRNA stability and translation in bloodstream forms, or destabilize and repress translation in procyclic forms, are scattered throughout the 3-UTR. The RNA-binding protein DRBD18 is implicated in the export of a subset of mRNAs from the nucleus in procyclic forms. We confirmed that in bloodstream forms, DRBD18 copurifies the outer ring of the nuclear pore, mRNA export proteins and exon junction complex proteins. Loss of DRBD18 in bloodstream forms caused accumulation of several shortened RBP10 mRNA isoforms, with loss of longer species, but RNAi targeting the essential export factor MEX67 did not cause such changes, demonstrating specificity. Long RBP10 mRNAs accumulated in the nucleus, while shorter ones reached the cytoplasm. We suggest that DRBD18 binds to processing signals in the RBP10 3-UTR, simultaneously preventing their use and recruiting mRNA export factors. DRBD18 depletion caused truncation of the 3-UTRs of more than 100 other mRNAs, suggesting that it has an important role in regulating use of alternative processing sites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlomerular disease, often manifesting as nephrotic syndrome (NS) with high proteinuria, can be refractory to standard treatment and is typically associated with hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypercoagulopathy. We hypothesized that the nuclear receptor PPAR{gamma} can be selectively modulated using a novel partial agonist, GQ-16, to gain therapeutic advantage over traditional PPAR{gamma} agonists (e.g. thiazolidinediones) for the treatment of glomerular disease.\n\nMethodsNephropathy was induced with puromycin amino-nucleoside (PAN) in Wistar rats and treated with Pioglitazone (Pio) or GQ-16. Plasma, serum, and urine chemistries were performed, and kidneys, glomeruli, liver, and white adipose tissue (WAT) were harvested. Lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression were measured in adipocytes.\n\nResultsPAN-induced proteinuria was significantly reduced with Pio to 64% of PAN-value. It was reduced robustly with GQ-16 to 81% of PAN, which was comparable to controls. While both GQ-16 and Pio restored glomerular Nphs1 and hepatic Pcsk9 expression and reduced hypercholesterolemia, GQ-16 also restored glomerular Nrf2, and reduced hypoalbuminemia and hypercoagulopathy. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis identified both common and distinct restored glomerular genes downstream of Pio and GQ-16. Pio but not GQ-16 significantly induced aP2 (fatty acid binding protein) in adipocytes and in WAT. Pio induced more lipid accumulation than GQ-16 in differentiated adipocytes. Both, Pio and GQ-16 induced insulin sensitizing adipokines in WAT with varying degrees.\n\nConclusionsSelective modulation of PPAR{gamma} by a partial agonist, GQ-16, is more advantageous than pioglitazone in reducing proteinuria and NS associated co-morbidities, while reducing the adipogenic side-effects conferred by traditional PPAR{gamma} full agonists.\n\nTranslational StatementThe authors have previously reported that type-II diabetes drugs, thiazolidinediones (PPAR{gamma} agonists), also provide beneficial effects in reducing podocyte and glomerular injury. However, these drugs are associated with adverse effects such as weight gain, and their effects on glomerular disease-associated features are largely unexplored. Their current findings demonstrate that PPAR{gamma} can be selectively modulated by its partial agonist, GQ-16, which reduces proteinuria and improves nephrotic syndrome (NS) with reduced side-effects typically conferred by thiazolidinediones. These findings not only deepen our molecular understanding of the role of PPAR{gamma} in glomerular disease and underscore the potential for partial agonists of PPAR{gamma}, such as GQ-16 as a treatment modality for NS, but also lend the possibility of its potential benefits in diabetic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial damage is a key feature of regulated cell death in neurons. In particular, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) has been proposed as a starting point for mitochondrial demise upon cellular stress. Potential mechanisms for MOMP presented in the literature include membrane pore formation by Bcl2-family proteins such as BID and BAX, oligomerization of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) and hetero-oligomer formation of these proteins. In our study, we demonstrate a direct interaction between the voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC1 and the pro-apoptotic protein BID in dying neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Binding of BID to VDAC1 affects anion conductance through VDAC1 and is associated with glutamate-induced cell death in cultured neurons and ischemic brain injury. In cultured neurons, reducing VDAC1 expression significantly attenuates BID-induced hallmarks of mitochondrial damage such as mitochondrial fission, declined mitochondrial respiration, increased ROS production, and mitochondrial membrane potential breakdown. Our data highlight a critical role for VDAC1 as a mitochondrial receptor for activated BID, thereby serving as a key decision point between life and death in neurons.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryVDAC1 interacts with BID to mediate mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and neuronal cell death.",

Despite its importance in shifting developmental control from primarily maternal stores in the oocyte to the embryo proper, we know little of the molecular events that initiate ZGA in vivo. Recent in vitro studies in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have revealed Developmental Pluripotency Associated 2 and 4 (Dppa2/4) as key regulators of ZGA-associated transcription. However, their roles in initiating ZGA in vivo remain unexplored. We reveal Dppa2/4 proteins are present in the nucleus at all stages of preimplantation development and associate with mitotic chromatin. We generated single and double maternal knockout mouse models to deplete maternal stores of Dppa2/4. Importantly, while fertile, Dppa2/4 maternal knockout mice had reduced litter sizes, indicating decreased offspring survival. Immunofluorescence and transcriptome analyses of 2-cell embryos revealed while ZGA took place there were subtle defects in embryos lacking maternal Dppa2/4. Strikingly, heterozygous offspring that inherited the null allele maternally had higher preweaning lethality than those that inherited the null allele paternally. Together our results show that while Dppa2/4 are dispensable for ZGA transcription, maternal stores have an important role in offspring survival, potentially via epigenetic priming of developmental genes.",

A greater understanding of genetic modifiers and the ways in which they interact with metabolic pathways could improve the ability to predict a patients risk for severe symptoms, as well as enhance the development of individualized therapeutic approaches. In this study we use the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to identify genetic variation influencing hyperglycemia associated with loss of Sirt1 function. Through analysis of individual candidate functions, physical interaction networks, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) we identify not only modifiers involved in canonical glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, but also genes important for neuronal signaling and the innate immune response.

    "abstract": "In Caenorhabditis elegans, germline injection of Cas9 complexes is reliably used to achieve genome editing through homology-directed repair of Cas9-generated DNA breaks. To prevent Cas9 from targeting repaired DNA, additional blocking mutations are often incorporated into homologous repair templates. Cas9 can be blocked either by mutating the PAM sequence that is essential for Cas9 activity or by mutating the guide sequence that targets Cas9 to a specific genomic location. However, it is unclear how many nucleotides within the guide sequence should be mutated, since Cas9 can recognize \"off-target\" sequences that are imperfectly paired to its guide. In this study, we examined whether single-nucleotide substitutions within the guide sequence are sufficient to block Cas9 and allow for efficient genome editing. We show that a single mismatch within the guide sequence effectively blocks Cas9 and allows for recovery of edited animals. Surprisingly, we found that a low rate of edited animals can be recovered without introducing any blocking mutations, suggesting a temporal block to Cas9 activity in C. elegans. Furthermore, we show that the maternal genome of hermaphrodite animals is preferentially edited over the paternal genome. We demonstrate that maternally provided haplotypes can be selected using balancer chromosomes and propose a method of mutant isolation that greatly reduces screening efforts post-injection. Collectively, our findings expand the repertoire of genome editing strategies in C. elegans and demonstrate that extraneous blocking mutations are not required to recover edited animals when the desired mutation is located within the guide sequence.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent human pathogen, infecting approximately 400 million individuals per year and causing symptomatic disease in approximately 100 million. A distinct feature of dengue is the increased risk for severe disease in some individuals with preexisting DENV-specific immunity. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which poorly-neutralizing IgG antibodies from a prior infection opsonize DENV to increase infection of Fc gamma receptor-bearing cells. While IgM and IgG are the most commonly studied DENV-reactive antibody isotypes, our group and others have described the induction of DENV-specific serum IgA responses during dengue. We hypothesized that monomeric IgA would be able to neutralize DENV without the possibility of ADE. To test this, we synthesized IgG and IgA versions of two different DENV-reactive monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that isotype-switching does not affect the antigen binding and neutralization properties of the two mAbs. We show that DENV-reactive IgG, but not IgA, mediates ADE in an Fc gamma receptor-positive K562 cells. Furthermore, we show that IgA potently antagonizes the ADE activity of IgG. These results suggest that levels of serum DENV-reactive IgA induced by DENV infection might regulate the overall ADE activity of DENV-immune plasma in vivo and warrants further study as a predictor of disease risk and/or therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Integrator has critical roles in noncoding RNA 3'-end processing as well as transcription attenuation of selected mRNAs. IntS11 is the endonuclease for RNA cleavage, as a part of the IntS4-IntS9-IntS11 complex (Integrator cleavage module, ICM). Our structure of the Drosophila ICM, determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 2.74 [A] resolution, unexpectedly revealed the stable association of an inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) molecule. The binding site is located in a highly electropositive pocket at an interface among all three subunits of ICM, 55 [A] away from the IntS11 active site and generally conserved in other ICMs. IP6 binding is also confirmed in human ICM. Mutations of residues in this binding site or disruption of IP6 biosynthesis significantly reduced Integrator assembly and activity in snRNA 3'-end processing. Our structural and functional studies reveal that Integrator is subject to intricate cellular control and IP6 is a critical regulator of Integrator assembly and function in Drosophila, humans, and likely other organisms.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of CRISPR/Cas9 as a programmable genome editing tool has been hindered by off-target DNA cleavage (Cong et al., 2013; Doudna, 2020; Fu et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2013). While analysis of such off-target editing events have enabled the development of Cas9 variants with greater discrimination against mismatches (Chen et al., 2017; Kleinstiver et al., 2016; Slaymaker et al., 2016), the underlying molecular mechanisms by which Cas9 rejects or accepts mismatches are poorly understood (Kim et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Slaymaker and Gaudelli, 2021). Here, we used kinetic analysis to guide cryo-EM structure determination of Cas9 at different stages of mismatch surveillance. We observe a distinct, previously undescribed linear conformation of the duplex formed between the guide RNA (gRNA) and DNA target strand (TS), that occurs in the presence of PAM-distal mismatches, preventing Cas9 activation. The canonical kinked gRNA:TS duplex is a prerequisite for Cas9 activation, acting as a structural scaffold to facilitate Cas9 conformational rearrangements necessary for DNA cleavage. We observe that highly tolerated PAM-distal mismatches achieve this kinked conformation through stabilization of a distorted duplex conformation via a flexible loop in the RuvC domain. Our results provide molecular insights into the underlying structural mechanisms that may facilitate off-target cleavage by Cas9 and provides a molecular blueprint for the design of next-generation high fidelity Cas9 variants that selectively reduce off-target DNA cleavage while retaining efficient cleavage of on-target DNA.",

    "abstract": "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread protein export apparatus found in Gram-negative bacteria. The majority of T6SSs deliver toxic effector proteins into competitor bacteria. Yet, the structure, function, and activation of many of these effectors remains poorly understood. Here, we present the structures of the T6SS effector RhsA from Pseudomonas protegens and its cognate T6SS spike protein, VgrG1, at 3.3 [A] resolution. The structures reveal that the rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeats of RhsA assemble into a closed anticlockwise {beta}-barrel spiral similar to that found in bacterial insecticidal Tc toxins and in metazoan teneurin proteins. We find that the C-terminal toxin domain of RhsA is autoproteolytically cleaved but remains inside the Rhs  cocoon where, with the exception of three ordered structural elements, most of the toxin is disordered. The N-terminal  plug domain is unique to T6SS Rhs proteins and resembles a champagne cork that seals the Rhs cocoon at one end while also mediating interactions with VgrG1. Interestingly, this domain is also autoproteolytically cleaved inside the cocoon but remains associated with it. We propose that mechanical force is required to remove the cleaved part of the plug, resulting in the release of the toxin domain as it is delivered into a susceptible bacterial cell by the T6SS.",

This approach was validated on simulated, synthetic, and authentic read sets from an oomycete, fungus, and plant. The approach was deployed to ascertain the genome status of multiple isolates of Bremia lactucae and Phytophthora infestans.\n\nAvailability and implementationVCFvariance.pl is a Perl script available at https://github.com/kfletcher88/VCFvariance.",

Distance restraints derived from paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) can facilitate the structure determination of large proteins and protein complexes. We herein present the site-directed labeling of the large oligomeric bacterial DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori with cysteine-reactive maleimide tags carrying either a nitroxide radical or a lanthanide ion. The success of the labeling reaction was followed by quantitative continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments performed on the nitroxide-labeled protein. PREs were extracted site-specifically from 2D and 3D solid-state NMR spectra. A good agreement with predicted PRE values, derived by computational modeling of nitroxide and Gd3+ tags in the low-resolution DnaB crystal structure, was found. Comparison of experimental PREs and model-predicted spin label-nucleus distances indicated that the size of the \"blind sphere\" around the paramagnetic center, in which NMR resonances are not detected, is slightly larger for Gd3+ (~14 [A]) than for nitroxide (~11 [A]) in 13C-detected 2D spectra of DnaB. We also present Gd3+-Gd3+ dipolar electron-electron resonance EPR experiments on DnaB supporting the conclusion that DnaB was present as a hexameric assembly.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol is a major component of the cell membrane and commonly regulates membrane protein function. Here, we investigate how cholesterol modulates the conformational equilibria and signaling of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) in reconstituted phospholipid bilayers. GTP hydrolysis assays show that cholesterol is a weak positive allosteric modulator of A2AR, as seen through enhanced basal signaling and a small decrease in agonist EC50. Fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance (19F NMR) spectroscopy suggests that this enhancement arises from an increase in the receptors active state populations and stronger G protein coupling. 19F NMR of fluorinated cholesterol analogs reveals transient and non-specific interactions with A2AR, indicating a lack of high-affinity binding sites or direct allosteric modulation. This is confirmed by computational analysis which suggests that cholesterol contacts confer a weak and possibly negative allosteric effect. The combined results suggest that the observed cholesterol allostery in A2AR is likely a result of indirect membrane effects through cholesterol-mediated changes in membrane properties, as shown by membrane fluidity measurements and high-pressure NMR.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a molecular tool with transformative genome editing capabilities. At the molecular level, an intricate allosteric signaling is critical for DNA cleavage, but its role in the specificity enhancement of the Cas9 endonuclease is poorly understood. Here, solution NMR is combined with multi-microsecond molecular dynamics and graph theory-derived models to probe the allosteric role of key enhancement specificity mutations. We show that the mutations responsible for increasing the specificity of Cas9 alter the allosteric structure of the catalytic HNH domain, impacting the signal transmission from the DNA recognition region to the catalytic sites for cleavage. Specifically, the K855A mutation strongly disrupts the HNH domain allosteric structure, exerting the highest perturbation on the signaling transfer, while K810A and K848A result in more moderate effects on the allosteric intercommunication. This differential perturbation of the allosteric signaling reflects the different capabilities of the single mutants to increase Cas9 specificity, with the mutation achieving the highest specificity also strongly perturbing the signaling transfer. These outcomes reveal that the allosteric regulation is critical for the specificity enhancement of the Cas9 enzyme, and are valuable to harness the signaling network to improve the systems specificity.",

APC/CCDC20 is inhibited by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which prevents premature separation of sister chromatids and aneuploidy in daughter cells. Although overexpression of CDC20 is common in many cancers, oncogenic mutations have never been identified in humans. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified heterozygous missense CDC20 variants (L151R and N331K) that segregate with cancer in two families. Characterization of these mutants showed they retain APC/C activation activity but show reduced binding to BUBR1, a component of the SAC. Expression of L151R and N331K promoted mitotic slippage in HeLa cells and primary skin fibroblasts derived from carriers. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate mice carrying N331K. Homozygous mice carrying N331K were non-viable, however, heterozygotes displayed accelerated oncogenicity in Myc-driven cancers. These findings highlight an unappreciated role for CDC20 variants as tumor promoting genes in humans.",

    "abstract": "The role of EGFR in lung cancer is well described with numerous activating mutations that result in phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target EGFR. While the role of the EGFR kinase in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is appreciated, control of EGFR signaling pathways through dephosphorylation by phosphatases is not as clear. In recent work we identified mutations in Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type H (Ptprh, also known as SAP-1) as being associated with elevated phosphorylation of EGFR in a mouse model of breast cancer. We have examined a series of tumors from this mouse model, revealing conserved V483M Ptprh mutations within the FVB background, but a series of varied mutations in other backgrounds. Despite the varied Ptprh mutations in other background strains, matched primary and metastatic tumors largely shared mutational profiles. Profiling the downstream events of Ptprh mutant tumors revealed AKT activation, suggesting a key target of PTPRH was EGFR tyrosine 1197. Given the role of EGFR in lung cancer, we explored TCGA data which revealed that a subset of PTPRH mutant tumors shared gene expression profiles with EGFR mutant tumors, but that EGFR mutations and PTPRH mutations were mutually exclusive. Generation of a PTPRH knockout NSCLC cell line resulted in Y1197 phosphorylation of EGFR, and a rescue with expression of wild type PTPRH returned EGFR phosphorylation to parental line values while a rescue with a D986A catalytically dead mutant PTPRH did not, demonstrating that PTPRH targets EGFR. As expected with active EGFR, the knockout of PTPRH was associated with increased growth rate. Moreover, a dose response curve illustrated that two human NSCLC lines that had naturally occurring PTPRH mutations responded to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. Injection of one of the NSCLC human lines into mice resulted in tumors, and Osimertinib treatment resulted in a reduction of tumor volume relative to vehicle controls. Consistent with prior literature from breast cancer, PTPRH mutation resulted in nuclear pEGFR as seen in immunohistochemistry, suggesting that there may also be a role for EGFR as a transcriptional co-factor. Other roles for PTPRH were explored through a receptor tyrosine kinase array, noting elevated phosphorylation of FGFR1. Knockout of PTPRH in NSCLC cell lines resulted in elevated phosphorylated FGFR1 relative to controls, indicating that PTPRH has a number of targets that may be aberrantly activated in NSCLC with mutations in PTPRH. Together these data suggest that mutations in PTPRH in NSCLC may result in clinically actionable alterations using existing therapies.",

    "abstract": "Predictive determinants of stochastic single-cell fates have been elusive, even for the well-studied mammalian cell cycle. What drives proliferation decisions of single cells at any given time? We monitored single-cell dynamics of the ERK and Akt pathways, critical cell cycle progression hubs and anti-cancer drug targets, and paired them to division events in the same single cells using the non-transformed MCF10A epithelial line. Following growth factor treatment, in cells that divide both ERK and Akt activities are significantly higher within the S-G2 time window ([~]8.5-40 hours). Such differences were much smaller in the pre-S-phase, restriction point window which is traditionally associated with ERK and Akt activity dependence, suggesting unappreciated roles for ERK and Akt in S through G2. Machine learning algorithms show that simple metrics of central tendency in this time window are most predictive for subsequent cell division; median ERK and Akt activities classify individual division events with an AUC=0.76. Surprisingly, ERK dynamics alone predict division in individual cells with an AUC=0.74, suggesting Akt activity dynamics contribute little to the decision driving cell division in this context. We also find that ERK and Akt activities are less correlated with each other in cells that divide. Network reconstruction experiments demonstrated that this correlation behavior was likely not due to crosstalk, as ERK and Akt do not interact in this context, in contrast to other transformed cell types. Overall, our findings support roles for ERK and Akt activity throughout the cell cycle as opposed to just before the restriction point, and suggest ERK activity dynamics are substantially more important than Akt activity dynamics for driving cell division in this non-transformed context. Single cell imaging along with machine learning algorithms provide a better basis to understand cell cycle progression on the single cell level.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is essential to microbial evolution1-4, and is involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance, antigenic variation, and adaptation to the host niche5-8. Yet quantifying the impact of homologous recombination on different gene classes, which is critical to understanding how selection acts on variation to shape species diversity and genome structure, remains challenging. This is largely due to the dynamic nature of bacterial genomes, whose high intraspecies genome content diversity9 and complex phylogenetic relationships10-12 present difficulties for inferring rates of recombination, particularly for rare genes. In this work, we apply a computationally efficient, non-phylogenetic approach13,14 to measure homologous recombination rates in the core and accessory genome (genes present in all strains and only a subset of strains, respectively) using >100,000 whole genome sequences from 12 microbial species. Our analysis suggests that even well-resolved sequence clusters sampled from global populations interact with overlapping gene pools, which has implications for the role of population structure in genome evolution. We show that in a majority of species, core genes have shorter coalescence times and higher recombination rates than accessory genes, and that gene frequency is often positively correlated with increased recombination. Our results provide a new line of population genomic evidence supporting the hypothesis that core genes are under strong, purifying selection15-17, and indicate that homologous recombination may play a key role in increasing the efficiency of selection in those parts of the genome most conserved within each species.",

    "abstract": "The effective treatment of patients diagnosed with drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) is highly dependent upon the ability to rapidly and accurately determine the antibiotic resistance/ susceptibility profile of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate(s) involved. Thus, as more and more clinical microbiology laboratories advance towards the routine use of DNA sequence-based diagnostics, it is imperative that their predictive functions extend beyond the well-known resistance-conferring mutations, in order to also encompass as many of the lower-frequency mutations as possible. However, in most cases, the fundamental experimental proof that links these uncommon mutations with phenotypic resistance is still lacking. One such example is the G878A polymorphism within the rrs gene encoding the 16s rRNA. We, and others, have identified this mutation within a small number of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, although prior to this study a consensus regarding exactly which aminoglycoside antibiotic(s) it conferred resistance toward seems not to have been reached. Here we have employed oligo-mediated recombineering to specifically introduce the G878A polymorphism into the rrs gene of M. bovis BCG - a species very closely related to M. tuberculosis - and demonstrate that it confers low-level resistance to streptomycin alone. In our hands, it does not confer cross-resistance towards amikacin, capreomycin, nor kanamycin. We also demonstrate that the rrsG878A mutation exerts a substantial fitness defect in vitro, that may at least in part explain why clinical M. tuberculosis isolates bearing this mutation appear to be quite rare. Overall, this study provides clarity to the resistance phenotype attributable to the rrsG878A mutation and is relevant to the future implementation of genomics-based diagnostics, as well as the clinical management of patients in situations where this particular polymorphism is encountered.",

    "abstract": "Artificial selection can be conducted at the community level in the laboratory through a differential propagation of the communities according to their level of expression of a targeted function (i.e. community phenotype). Working with communities instead of individuals as selection units brings in additional sources of variation in the considered phenotype that can arise through changes in community structure and influence the outcome of the artificial selection. These sources of variation could even be increased by manipulating species diversity. In this study, we wanted to assess the effect of manipulating initial community richness on artificial selection efficiency, defined as the change in the targeted function over time as compared to a control treatment without artificial selection. We applied artificial selection for a high productivity on synthetic bacterial communities varying for their initial richness level (from one to 16 strains). Our results showed that, overall, the communities that were artificially selected were 16% more productive than the control communities. Community richness positively influenced community productivity and metabolic capacities and was a strong determinant of the dynamics of community evolution. Our results suggested that community richness could influence artificial selection efficiency but a convergence of the community composition might have limited the effect of diversity on artificial selection efficiency. We propose that applying artificial selection on communities varying for their diversity could allow to find communities differing for their level of expression of a function but also for their responsiveness to artificial selection, provided that their initial composition is different enough.",

Here, 20 clade A PP2Cs family genes were identified in tuber mustard genome, including BjuABI1s, BjuABI2s, BjuAHG1s, BjuAHG3s, BjuHAB1, BjuHAB2s, BjuHAI1s, BjuHAI2s and BjuHAI3.

We also analyzed the expression pattern of clade A BjuPP2Cs under abiotic stresses (low temperature, NaCl and ABA) treatment, pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae treatment and different stages of stem swollen. The results suggested that clade A BjuPP2Cs regulated tuber mustard response to P. brassicae to mediate the formation of clubroot and might play roles in stem swelling and response to abiotic stresses.

    "abstract": "Allosteric communication between distant sites in proteins is central to nearly all biological regulation but still poorly characterised for most proteins, limiting conceptual understanding, biological engineering and allosteric drug development. Typically only a few allosteric sites are known in model proteins, but theoretical, evolutionary and some experimental studies suggest they may be much more widely distributed. An important reason why allostery remains poorly characterised is the lack of methods to systematically quantify long-range communication in diverse proteins. Here we address this shortcoming by developing a method that uses deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map the allosteric landscapes of protein interaction domains. The key concept of the approach is the use of  multidimensional mutagenesis: mutational effects are quantified for multiple molecular phenotypes--here binding and protein abundance--and in multiple genetic backgrounds. This is an efficient experimental design that allows the underlying causal biophysical effects of mutations to be accurately inferred en masse by fitting thermodynamic models using neural networks. We apply the approach to two of the most common human protein interaction domains, an SH3 domain and a PDZ domain, to produce the first global atlases of allosteric mutations for any proteins. Allosteric mutations are widely dispersed with extensive long-range tuning of binding affinity and a large mutational target space of network-altering  edgetic variants. Mutations are more likely to be allosteric closer to binding interfaces, at Glycines in secondary structure elements and at particular sites including a chain of residues connecting to an opposite surface in the PDZ domain. This general approach of quantifying mutational effects for multiple molecular phenotypes and in multiple genetic backgrounds should allow the energetic and allosteric landscapes of many proteins to be rapidly and comprehensively mapped.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria produce energy for cell function via adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and are regulated by a molecular 24h clock. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to reveal shifts in whole animal ATP production over 24h, showing a marked peak in the morning that declines around midday and remains low from then through to the following morning. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production has been shown previously to improve after long wavelength exposure, but apparently not at all times. Hence, to explore this further we exposed flies to 670nm at different times. Exposures between 08.00 and 11.00 resulted in a significant increase in ATP, while exposures at other times had no effect. Within the morning window, not all times were equally effective, however, 670nm exposure mid-morning when ATP production was maximal did not increase ATP, possibly because mitochondria lacked spare capacity at this time. Hence, in the morning there is a complex dynamic relationship between long wavelength light and mitochondria. Mitochondrial function and the influence of long wavelengths are conserved across species from fly to human, and determining the time points for light administration to improve function in ageing and disease is of key importance. Our data progress this search and reveal the outline of these times.",

    "abstract": "Leg movements during sleep occur in patients with sleep pathology and healthy individuals. Some (but not all) leg movements during sleep are related to cortical arousals which occur without conscious awareness of the patient but have a significant effect of sleep fragmentation. Detecting leg movements during sleep that are associated with cortical arousals can provide unique insight into the nature and quality of sleep in both health and disease. In this study, a novel leg movement monitor is used in conjunction with polysomnography to better understand the relationship between leg movement and electroencephalogram (EEG) defined cortical arousals. In an approach that we call neuro-extremity analysis, graph theoretic, directed connectivity metrics are used to interrogate the causal links between neural activity measured by EEG and leg movements measured by the sensors within the leg movement monitor. The leg movement monitor in this study utilizes novel capacitive displacement sensors, and a 9-axis inertial measurement unit to characterize leg and foot movements. First, the capacitive displacement measures more closely related to EEG-defined cortical arousals than inertial measurements. Second, the neuro-extremity analysis reveals a temporally evolving connectivity pattern that is consistent with a model of cortical arousals in which brainstem dysfunction leads to near-instantaneous leg movements and a delayed, filtered signal to the cortex. Neuro-extremity analysis reveals causal relationships between EEG and leg movement sensor time-series data that may aid researchers to better understand the pathophysiology of cortical arousals associated with leg movements during sleep.",

    "abstract": "The clinical heterogeneity of heart failure has challenged our understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms of this disease. In this respect, large-scale patient DNA sequencing studies have become an invaluable strategy for identifying potential genetic contributing factors. The complex aetiology of heart failure, however, also means that in vivo models are vital to understand the links between genetic perturbations and functional impacts. Traditional approaches (e.g. genetically-modified mice) are optimal for assessing small numbers of proposed target genes, but less practical when multiple targets are identified. The zebrafish, in contrast, offers great potential for higher throughput in vivo gene functional assessment to aid target prioritisation and support definitive studies undertaken in mice. Here we used whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics on human patient data to identify 3 genes (API5, HSPB7, and LMO2) suggestively associated with heart failure that were also predicted to play a broader role in disease aetiology. The role of these genes in cardiovascular system development and function was then further investigated using in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene mutation analysis in zebrafish. We observed multiple impacts in F0 knockout zebrafish embryos (crispants) following effective somatic mutation, including reductions in ventricle size, pericardial oedema, and chamber malformation. In the case of lmo2, there was also a significant impact on cardiovascular function as well as an expected reduction in erythropoiesis. The data generated from both the human in silico and zebrafish in vivo assessments undertaken supports roles for API5, HSPB7, and LMO2 in human cardiovascular disease and identifies them as potential drug targets for further investigation. The data presented also supports the use of human in silico genetic variant analysis, in combination with zebrafish crispant phenotyping, as a powerful approach for assessing gene function as part of an integrated multi-level drug target validation strategy.",

    "abstract": "Because different sampling techniques will provide different abundance values, it is currently difficult to compare results among many studies to form holistic understandings of how abundance influences ant ecology. Using three sampling methods in the same location we found pitfall traps best confirmed A. gracilipes presence recording the fewest zero values (9.1%), card counts were the least reliable (67.1%), and tuna lures were intermediate (30.1%). The abundance of A. gracilipes from card counts ranged from 0 to 20, in pitfall traps from 0 to 325, and the full range of tuna lure abundance scores (0-7) were sampled. We then determined the relationships between these three standard ant sampling techniques for the abundance of yellow crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes. Irrespective of the data transformation method, the strongest relationship was between pitfall traps and tuna lures, and the least strong was between pitfall traps and card counts. We then demonstrate the utility of this knowledge by analysing A. gracilipes abundance reported within published literature to show where the populations in those studies sit on an abundance spectrum. We also comment on insights into the relative utility of the three methods we used to determine A. gracilipes abundance among populations of varying abundance. Pitfall traps was the most reliable method to determine if the species was present at the sample level. Tuna lures were predominantly reliable for quantifying the presence of workers, but were limited by the number of workers that can gather around a spoonful of tuna. Card counts were the quickest method, but were seemingly only useful when A. gracilipes abundance is not low. Finally we discuss how environmental and biological variation needs to be accounted for in future studies to better standardise sampling protocols to help progress ecology as a precision science.",

    "abstract": "Giant kelp populations support productive and diverse coastal ecosystems in both hemispheres at temperate and subpolar latitudes but are vulnerable to changing climate conditions as well as direct human impacts. Observations of giant kelp forests are spatially and temporally patchy, with disproportionate coverage in the northern hemisphere, despite the size and comparable density of southern hemisphere kelp forests. Satellite imagery enables the mapping of existing and historical giant kelp populations in understudied regions, but automating the detection of giant kelp in large satellite datasets requires approaches that are robust to the optical complexity of the shallow, nearshore environment. We present and compare two approaches for automating the detection of giant kelp in satellite datasets: one based on crowd sourcing of satellite imagery classifications and another based on a decision tree paired with a spectral unmixing algorithm (automated using Google Earth Engine). Both approaches are applied to satellite imagery (Landsat) of the Falkland Islands or Islas Malvinas (FLK), an archipelago in the southern Atlantic Ocean that supports expansive giant kelp ecosystems. The performance of each method is evaluated by comparing the automated classifications with a subset of expert-annotated imagery cumulatively spanning over 2,700km of coastline. Using the remote sensing approaches evaluated herein, we present the first continuous timeseries of giant kelp observations in the FLK region using Landsat imagery spanning over three decades. We do not detect evidence of long-term change in the FLK region, although we observe a recent decline in total canopy area from 2017-2021. Using a nitrate model based on nearby ocean state measurements obtained from ships and incorporating satellite sea surface temperature products, we find that the area of giant kelp forests in the FLK region is positively correlated with the nitrate content observed during the prior year. Our results indicate that giant kelp classifications using citizen science are approximately consistent with classifications based on a state-of-the-art automated spectral approach. Despite differences in accuracy and sensitivity, both approaches find high interannual variability that impedes the detection of potential long-term changes in giant kelp canopy area, although recent canopy area declines are notable and should continue to be monitored carefully.",

The selected derivatives and/or analogues were prepared using established chemical procedures and their structures confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. Ovicidal activity of the pure compounds, derivatives, structural analogues and/or formulated blends was tested at 1, 10, 25 and 50 ppm on An. gambiae eggs..\n\nResultsEleven mono-substituted (3-7), di-substituted (8-10), tri-substituted (1-2) aromatic compounds were assayed for ovicidal activity against Anopheles gambiae eggs singly or as blends. Benzaldehyde (4) and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (9) were further converted into 2-hydroxy-1, 2-diphenylethanone (11), 1, 5-diphenylpenta-1, 4-diene-3-one (12) and 1, 5-bis (4-methoxyphenyl) penta-1, 4-diene-3-one (13) and evaluated for ovicidal activity individually or as blends. Of the thirteen compounds evaluated individually, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (1) exhibited the highest ovicidal activity at LC50 0.7075 ppm while anisole had the lowest activity at LC50 40.342 ppm. The derivatives exhibited moderate activity: 2-hydroxy-1, 2-diphenylethanone (LC50 10.599 ppm), 1, 5-diphenylpenta-1, 4-diene-3-one (LC50 9.019 ppm) and 1, 5-bis (4-methoxyphenyl) penta-1, 4-diene-3-one (LC50 15.642 ppm). The blends exhibited intriguingly high ovicidal efficacy with the mixture of benzaldehyde and phenol showing the highest (LC50 0.332 ppm) while phenol and anisole exhibited the lowest activity (LC50 9.9909 ppm).\n\nConclusionFrom the activity of the blends, it is evident that anisole is antagonistic to the efficacy of phenol and benzaldehyde. It is also apparent that aldehyde and hydroxyl groups, when directly attached to the phenyl ring, provide the critical structural characteristics that contribute to the ovicidal activity of the aromatic compounds.",

    "abstract": "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a monopartite begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae, is efficiently transmitted by the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, and causes serious economic losses to tomato crops around the world. TYLCV-infected tomato plants develop distinctive symptoms of yellowing and leaf upper cupping. In recent years, excellent progress has been made in the characterization of TYLCV C4 protein function as a pathogenetic determinant in experimental plants, including Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, molecular mechanism leading to disease symptom development in natural host plant tomato has yet to be characterized. The aim of the current study was to generate transgenic tomato plants expressing the TYLCV C4 gene and evaluate differential gene expression through comparative transcriptome analysis between the transgenic C4 plants and the transgenic green fluorescent protein (Gfp) gene control plants. Transgenic tomato plants expressing the TYLCV C4 developed phenotypes, including leaf upward cupping and yellowing that are similar the disease symptom expressed on tomato plants infected with TYLCV. In a total of 241 differentially expressed genes identified in the transcriptome analysis, a series of plant development-related genes, including transcription factors, glutaredoxins, protein kinases, R-genes and microRNA target genes, were significantly altered. These results provide further evidence to support the important function of the C4 protein in begomovirus pathogenicity. These transgenic tomato plants could serve as basic genetic materials for further characterization of plant receptors that are interacting with the TYLCV C4.",

The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of khat on cognitive functions and its correlation with serum electrolytes.\n\nMaterials and MethodsA total of 36 adult (7-8 weeks) wild-type male Swiss albino rats weighing between 213 and 229g were used in this study. The rats were received crude khat extract subchronically (kesc) (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg b.w), khat juice (khJ 2.5 mL/kg) and 2% tween 80 in distilled water (T80W- v/v, vehicle) and khat extract subacutely (kesa) (300 mg/kg). Spatial learning and memory were measured using Morris water maze model and serum electrolytes were measured using Cobas 6000. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 and Microsoft Excel.\n\nResultsSpatial learning was improved with trials across the groups, while average escape latency (s) and swim path-length (cm) of rats that received kesc 200 mg/kg (p<0.001 and p<0.001) and kesc 300 mg/kg (p<0.01 and p<0.001) was significantly greater than rats that received the vehicle. However, there was no significant difference in the latency between rats that received kesa 300mg/kg and vehicle (p>0.05). Thigmotaxis was significantly higher in rats that received all doses of khat extract (p<0.001). The time spent in the target quadrant in rats that received kesc 300 mg/kg was significantly reduced (p<0.05). Serum calcium level was inversely correlated with the escape latency (R=-0.417, p<0.05) in rats that received khat.\n\nConclusionskhat extract and juice administered subchronically, but not subacute administration, impaired learning and memory in rats and was associated with serum calcium reduction.

    "abstract": "Simplified nonlinear models of biological cells are widely used in computational electrophysiology. The models reproduce qualitatively many of the characteristics of various organs, such as the heart, brain, and intestine. In contrast to complex cellular ion-channel models, the simplified models usually contain a small number of variables and parameters, which facilitates nonlinear analysis and reduces computational load. In this paper, we consider pacemaking variants of the Aliev-Panfilov and Corrado two-variable excitable cell models. We conducted a numerical simulation study of these models and investigated the main nonlinear dynamic features of both isolated cells and 1D coupled pacemaker-excitable systems. Simulations of the 2D sinoatrial node and 3D intestine tissue as application examples of combined pacemaker-excitable systems demonstrated results similar to obtained previously. The uniform formulation for the conventional excitable cell models and proposed pacemaker models allows a convenient and easy implementation for the construction of personalized physiological models, inverse tissue modeling, and development of real-time simulation systems for various organs that contain both pacemaker and excitable cells.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a redox sensor, is vital for cellular redox homeostasis. We reported that transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Nrf2 (CaNrf2-TG) exhibit reductive stress (RS). In this study, we identified novel protein biomarkers for RS-induced cardiomyopathy using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomic analysis in heart tissues of TG (CaNrf2-TG) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice at 6-7 months of age (N= 4/group). A total of 1105 proteins were extracted from 22544 spectra. Of note, about 560 proteins were differentially expressed in TG vs. NTg hearts, indicating a global impact of RS on myocardial proteome. From a closer analysis of the proteome datasets, we identified over 32 proteins that were significantly altered in response to RS. Among these, 20 were upregulated and 12 were downregulated in the hearts of TG vs. NTg mice, suggesting that these proteins could be putative signatures of RS. Scaffold analysis revealed a clear distinction between TG vs NTg hearts. Of note, we observed several proteins with redox (#185; cysteine residues), NEM-adducts (#81), methionine-loss (#21) and acetylation (#1) modifications in TG vs. NTg hearts due to chronic RS. The majority of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that are significantly altered in RS mice were found to be involved in stress related pathways such as antioxidants, NADPH, protein quality control (PQC), etc. Interestingly, proteins that were involved in mitochondrial respiration, lipophagy and cardiac rhythm were dramatically decreased in TG hearts. Of note, we identified the glutathione family of proteins as the significantly changed subset of the proteome in TG heart. Surprisingly, our comparative analysis of NGS based transcriptome and TMT-proteome indicated [~]50% of the altered proteins in TG myocardium was found to be negatively correlated with their transcript levels. Modifications at cysteine/NEM-adducts (redox), methionine or lysine residues in multiple proteins in response to chronic RS might be associated with impaired PQC mechanisms, thus causing pathological cardiac remodeling.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=102 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/460105v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5974borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12fe043org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c6e17org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@efb153_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Growing microtubule ends provide platforms for the accumulation of plus-end tracking proteins that organize into comets of mixed protein composition. Using a reconstituted fission yeast system consisting of end-binding protein Mal3, kinesin Tea2 and cargo Tip1, we found that these proteins can be driven into liquid phase droplets both in solution and at microtubule ends under crowding conditions. In the absence of crowding agents, cryo-electron tomography revealed that motor-dependent comets consist of disordered networks where multivalent interactions appear to facilitate the non-stoichiometric accumulation of cargo Tip1. We dissected the contribution of two disordered protein regions in Mal3 and found that both are required for the ability to form droplets and Tip1 accumulation, while autonomous Mal3 comet formation only requires one of them. Using theoretical modeling, we explore possible mechanisms by which motor activity and multivalent interactions may lead to the observed enrichment of Tip1 at microtubule ends.",

    "abstract": "During the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), degradation of the extracellular matrix alters the biomechanical properties of cartilage, especially the compressive modulus. The mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is required for chondrocyte mechanotransduction However, how OA-mediated cartilage degradation influences TRPV4 signaling remains unknown. To determine if ATDC5 cells alter TRPV4-mediated calcium signaling and cell phenotype in response to softer substrates, we created PEGDA-RGDS hydrogels with Youngs moduli that simulated healthy (~350 kPa), OA (~175 kPa) and severe OA (~35 kPa) tissue. We found that softer substrates reduced the influx of calcium through TRPV4 when challenging chondrocytes with hypotonic swelling (HTS). Chondrocyte apoptosis also increased on the OA and severe OA gels due to elevated basal [Ca2+]i, which is attenuated with pharmacological agonism of TRPV4. Pharmacological agonism of TRPV4 rescued the expression of aggrecan and TRPV4 in chondrocytes cultured on OA gels and enhanced the type II collagen (col2) expression in cells on the normal and OA gels. These data suggest that the biomechanical properties of degraded cartilage alter TRPV4-mediated mechanotransduction in chondrocytes. Given that TRPV4 reduced apoptosis and improved the chondrogenic capacity of cells, TRPV4 stimulation could provide a potential therapeutic target in patients with early to moderate OA.",

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that GPR133 (ADGRD1), an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) whose canonical signaling raises cytosolic cAMP, is necessary for growth of glioblastoma (GBM) and is de novo expressed in GBM relative to normal brain tissue. We showed that dissociation of autoproteolytically generated N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF) of GPR133 at the plasma membrane promotes receptor activation and increases signaling. Toward developing biologics modulating GPR133 function, we tested antibodies against the N-terminus of GPR133 for effects on receptor signaling. Treatment of HEK293T cells overexpressing GPR133 with such antibodies increased cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of supernatants following antibody treatment revealed complexes of the antibodies with the autoproteolytically cleaved NTF of GPR133. Cells expressing a cleavage-deficient mutant GPR133 (H543R) did not respond to antibody stimulation, suggesting that the effect is cleavage-dependent. The antibody-mediated stimulation of wild-type GPR133, but not the cleavage-deficient H543R mutant, was reproducible in patient-derived GBM cells. These findings provide a paradigm for modulation of GPR133 function with biologics and support the hypothesis that NTF-CTF dissociation promotes receptor activation and signaling.",

    "abstract": "One of the major cellular mechanisms to ensure protein homeostasis is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. This pathway is typically triggered by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Here we describe activation of ER stress via protein aggregation in the cell nucleus. We find in the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) activation of ER stress due to the aggregation of the diseases-causing progerin protein at the nuclear envelope. The presence of nucleoplasmic protein aggregates is sensed and signaled to the ER lumen via immobilization and clustering of the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2, leading to activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). These results identify a nuclear trigger of ER stress and they provide insight into the molecular disease mechanisms of HGPS.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms are unicellular algae, characterized by silica cell walls. The silica elements are formed intracellularly in a membrane-bound silica deposition vesicle (SDV), and are exocytosed after completion. How diatoms maintain membrane homeostasis during the exocytosis of these large and rigid silica elements is a long-standing enigma. We studied membrane dynamics during cell wall formation and exocytosis in two model diatom species, using live-cell confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. Our results show that during the formation of the mineral phase it is in tight association with the SDV membranes, which are forming a precise mold of the delicate geometrical patterns. During exocytosis, the distal SDV membrane and the plasma membrane gradually detach from the mineral and disintegrate in the extracellular space, without any noticeable endocytic retrieval or extracellular repurposing. Within the cell, there is no evidence for the formation of a new plasma membrane, thus the proximal SDV membrane becomes the new barrier between the cell and its environment, and assumes the role of a new plasma membrane. These results provide direct structural observations of diatom silica exocytosis, and point to an extraordinary mechanism in which membrane homeostasis is maintained by discarding, rather than recycling, significant membrane patches.\n\nSignificance StatementExocytosis is a fundamental process for cell metabolism, communication, and growth. During exocytosis, an intracellular vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents. In classical exocytosis, where the exocytosed vesicles are much smaller than the cell, membrane homeostasis is maintained by recycling excess membranes back into the cell. However, an extreme case of exocytosis is the extrusion of large and rigid cell wall elements by unicellular marine algae. During this process, the cell needs to deal with a potential doubling of its plasma membrane. This study reports on a unique exocytosis mechanism used by these organisms, in which the cells cope with the geometrical and physical challenges of exocytosis by releasing a significant amount of membranes to the extracellular space.",

    "abstract": "Recent development of deep-learning methods has led to a breakthrough in the prediction accuracy of 3-dimensional protein structures. Extending these methods to protein pairs is expected to allow large-scale detection of protein-protein interactions and modeling protein complexes at the proteome level. We applied RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2, two of the latest deep-learning methods for structure predictions, to analyze coevolution of human proteins residing in mitochondria, an organelle of vital importance in many cellular processes including energy production, metabolism, cell death, and antiviral response. Variations in mitochondrial proteins have been linked to a plethora of human diseases and genetic conditions. RoseTTAFold, with high computational speed, was used to predict the coevolution of about 95% of mitochondrial protein pairs. Top-ranked pairs were further subject to the modeling of the complex structures by AlphaFold2, which also produced contact probability with high precision and in many cases consistent with RoseTTAFold. Most of the top ranked pairs with high contact probability were supported by known protein-protein interactions and/or similarities to experimental structural complexes. For high-scoring pairs without experimental complex structures, our coevolution analyses and structural models shed light on the details of their interfaces, including CHCHD4-AIFM1, MTERF3-TRUB2, FMC1-ATPAF2, ECSIT-NDUFAF1 and COQ7-COQ9, among others. We also identified novel PPIs (PYURF-NDUFAF5, LYRM1-MTRF1L and COA8-COX10) for several proteins without experimentally characterized interaction partners, leading to predictions of their molecular functions and the biological processes they are involved in.",
