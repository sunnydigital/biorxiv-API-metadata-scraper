    "abstract": "Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) tract conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common conditions associated with disordered bowel movements and significant pain. However, discussion of bowel habits is often regarded as taboo and public understanding of what exactly IBD, IBS and related conditions are, and how they impact the lives of those individuals with such conditions is poorly understood. To provide a platform for enhancing public engagement of chronic bowel conditions, a short film was made (Gut Reaction) examining the lives of four individuals with different bowel conditions and what scientists and clinicians are doing to help alleviate the pain experienced by such individuals. This film was then screened at a science festival where a pre- and post-film survey was conducted alongside follow up semi-structured interviews with a small subset of those who had expressed willingness to engage in such an interview. Although films have been used for public engagement and health campaigns, there is a lack of a robust evaluation of such methods. As such, there is no knowledge of impacts and outcomes, jeopardising funding of such projects. Overall, the pre- and post-film surveys demonstrated that the film had increased the attendees understanding of chronic bowel conditions, how they are treated, what research is on-going and the likelihood of discussing bowel conditions with friends and family. The follow-up interviews were analysed through the constant comparative coding process. The analysis revealed that participants have a strong belief that bowel conditions need to be part of normal conversations, and the understanding of such conditions, and the people who experience them, needs to be improved by society. Our participants hold that this is crucial for people who experience from such conditions, not least to be able to access help sooner and suffer less. Finally, our participants discussed two strategies to achieve this societal openness and tackle the sense of shame around these issues: one involving role models and the other the media. In summary, Gut Reaction appeared to have met its objectives of improving the viewers awareness and understanding of chronic bowel conditions, as well as removing some of the stigma and taboo that surround discussions about these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Gardnerella spp. can form biofilm and it has been suggested that failure of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis and recurrent vaginosis are linked to this property, however no specific mechanisms have been identified. Here, we performed broth microdilution assays to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of metronidazole for thirty-five Gardnerella isolates in one medium in which Gardnerella spp. grow primarily as biofilm and another in which growth is primarily planktonic. The MIC of isolates in the two conditions were highly correlated (R2= 0.69, p <0.001). No significant reduction in viable cell count of 7/9 isolates was observed when established biofilms were exposed to metronidazole at levels double the MIC. Subsequent measurements of metabolic activity in established biofilms formed by a larger collection of 31 isolates showed reduced metabolic activity following treatment with 128 g/ml of metronidazole relative to untreated controls in 27/31 cases. The amount of biofilm produced by Gardnerella isolates was not enhanced by metronidazole exposure, even at sub-MIC levels. Our results suggest that reduced metabolic activity in Gardnerella spp. growing in established biofilms may be a mechanism of protection from the bactericidal effects of metronidazole.",

    "abstract": "Human autosomal recessive mutations in the PINK1 gene are causal for Parkinsons disease (PD). PINK1 encodes a mitochondrial localised protein kinase that is a master-regulator of mitochondrial quality control pathways. Structural studies to date have elaborated the mechanism of how mutations located within the kinase domain disrupt PINK1 function, however, the molecular mechanism of PINK1 mutations located upstream and downstream of the kinase domain are unknown. We have employed mutagenesis studies of human PINK1 in cells to define the minimal region of PINK1, required for optimal ubiquitin phosphorylation, beginning at residue Ile111. Bioinformatic analysis of the region spanning Ile111 to the kinase domain and inspection of the AlphaFold human PINK1 structure model predicts a conserved N-terminal -helical domain extension (NTE domain) within this region corroborated by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) of recombinant insect PINK1 protein. The AlphaFold structure also predicts the NTE domain forms an intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal extension (CTE). Cell-based analysis of human PINK1 reveals that PD-associated mutations (e.g. Q126P), located within the NTE:CTE interface, markedly inhibit stabilization of PINK1; autophosphorylation at Serine228 (Ser228); and Ubiquitin Serine65 (Ser65) phosphorylation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that NTE domain mutants do not affect intrinsic catalytic kinase activity but do disrupt PINK1 stabilisation at the mitochondrial Translocase of outer membrane (TOM) complex. The clinical relevance of our findings is supported by the demonstration of defective stabilization and activation of endogenous PINK1 in human fibroblasts of a patient with early-onset PD due to homozygous PINK1 Q126P mutations. Overall, we define a functional role of the NTE:CTE interface towards PINK1 stabilisation and activation and show that loss of NTE:CTE interactions is a major mechanism of PINK1-associated mutations linked to PD.",

    "abstract": "Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), a class of membrane-less organelles in cells, are involved in multiple biological activities and are present throughout cells of adult organisms. Although the oocyte nucleus is an active region for the flux of multiple non-membranous organelles, PML-NBs have been predicted to be absent from oocytes. Here, we show that the deliberate assembly of PML-NBs during oocyte growth preferentially sequestered Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier (SUMO) protein from the nucleoplasm. SUMO not only was involved in the regulation of oocyte nuclear maturation but also was committed to the response, mediated by liquid droplet formation, to multiple stressors including nucleolar stress and proteotoxic stresses. Exogenous assembly of PML-NBs in the nucleus of oocytes affected the efficiency of the response of SUMO. These observations suggest that the PML-NB-free intranuclear milieu ensures that a reserve of SUMO remains available for emergent responses in oocyte development. This work demonstrated a benefit of the PML-NB-free intranuclear milieu, namely the ability to redirect the flux of SUMO otherwise needed to control PML-NB dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Assembly of ribosomal subunits occurs via parallel pathways, which accelerate the process and render it more robust. Nonetheless, in vitro analyses have also demonstrated that some assembly pathways are dead-ends, presumably due to rRNA misfolding. If and how these non-productive pathways are avoided during assembly in vivo remains unknown. Here we use a combination of biochemical, genetic, proteomic and structural analyses to demonstrate a role for assembly factors in biasing the folding landscape away from non-productive intermediates. By binding Rrp36, Rrp5 is prevented from forming a premature interaction with the platform, which leads to a dead-end intermediate, and a misassembled platform that is functionally defective. The DEAD-box ATPase Has1 separates Rrp5 and Rrp36, allowing Rrp5 to reposition to the platform, thereby promoting ribosome assembly and enabling rRNA processing. Thus, Rrp36 establishes an ATP-dependent regulatory point that ensures correct platform assembly by opening a new folding channel that avoids funnels to misfolding.",
