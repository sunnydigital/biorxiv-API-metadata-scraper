    "abstract": "Estimating the mutation rate, or equivalently effective population size, is a common task in population genetics. If recombination is low or high, optimal linear estimation methods are known and well understood. For intermediate recombination rates, the calculation of optimal estimators is more challenging. As an alternative to model-based estimation, neural networks and other machine learning tools could help to develop good estimators in these involved scenarios. However, if no benchmark is available it is difficult to assess how well suited these tools are for different applications in population genetics.\n\nHere we investigate feedforward neural networks for the estimation of the mutation rate based on the site frequency spectrum and compare their performance with model-based estimators. For this we use the model-based estimators introduced by Fu, Futschik et al., and Watterson that minimize the variance or mean square error for no and free recombination. We find that neural networks reproduce these estimators if provided with the appropriate features and training sets. Remarkably, using the model-based estimators to adjust the weights of the training data, only one hidden layer is necessary to obtain a single estimator that performs almost as well as model-based estimators for low and high recombination rates, and at the same time provides a superior estimation method for intermediate recombination rates. We apply the method to simulated data based on the human chromosome 2 recombination map, highlighting its robustness in a realistic setting where local recombination rates vary and/or are unknown.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the apicobasal polarity gene CRB1 lead to diverse retinal diseases, such as Leber congenital amaurosis, cone-rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa (with and without Coats-like vasculopathy), foveal retinoschisis, macular dystrophy, and pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy. Limited correlation between disease phenotypes and CRB1 alleles, and evidence that patients sharing the same alleles often present with different disease features, suggest that genetic modifiers contribute to clinical variation. Similarly, the retinal phenotype of mice bearing the Crb1 retinal degeneration 8 (rd8) allele varies with genetic background. Here, we initiated a sensitized chemical mutagenesis screen in B6.Cg-Crb1rd8/Pjn, a strain with a mild clinical presentation, to identify genetic modifiers that cause a more severe disease phenotype. Two models from this screen, Tvrm266 and Tvrm323, exhibited increased retinal dysplasia. Genetic mapping with high-throughput exome and candidate-gene sequencing identified causative mutations in Arhgef12 and Prkci, respectively. Epistasis analysis of both strains indicated that the increased dysplastic phenotype required homozygosity of the Crb1rd8 allele. Retinal dysplastic lesions in Tvrm266 mice were smaller and caused less photoreceptor degeneration than those in Tvrm323 mice, which developed an early, large diffuse lesion phenotype. In both models at one month of age, Muller glia and microglia mislocalization at dysplastic lesions was similar to that in B6.Cg-Crb1rd8/Pjn mice, while photoreceptor cell mislocalization was more extensive. External limiting membrane disruption was comparable in Tvrm266 and B6.Cg- Crb1rd8/Pjn mice but milder in Tvrm323 mice. Immunohistological analysis of mice at postnatal day 0 indicated a normal distribution of mitotic cells in Tvrm266 and Tvrm323 mice, suggesting normal early development. Aberrant electroretinography responses were observed in both models but functional decline was significant only in Tvrm323 mice. These results identify Arhgef12 and Prkci as modifier genes that differentially shape Crb1-associated retinal disease, which may be relevant to understanding clinical variability and underlying disease mechanisms.",

The aim of this study was to determine any possible metabolic commonalities of patients infected with disparate pathogens that cause fever. Three liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) datasets investigating the metabolic effects of malaria, leishmaniasis and Zika virus infection were used. The retention time (RT) drift between the datasets was determined using landmarks obtained from the standard reference mixtures generally used in the quality control of the LC-MS experiments. We used fitted Gaussian Process models (GPs) to perform a high level correction of the RT drift between the experiments, followed by standard peakset alignment between the samples with corrected RTs of the three LC-MS datasets. Statistical analysis, annotation and pathway analysis of the integrated peaksets were subsequently performed. Metabolic dysregulation patterns common across the datasets were identified, with kynurenine pathway being the most affected pathway between all three fever-associated datasets.",

    "abstract": "A mass extinction at the end of the Devonian is thought to have had a major influence on the evolution of actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), which comprise half of living vertebrates. This extinction appears to have acted as a bottleneck, paring the early diversity of the group to a handful of survivors. Coupled with increases in taxonomic and morphological diversity in the Carboniferous, this contributes to a model of explosive post-extinction radiation. However, most actinopterygians from within a ~20-million-year (Myr) window surrounding the extinction remain poorly known, contributing to uncertainty about these patterns. An exceptionally preserved fossil of a diminutive fish from 7 Myr before the extinction reveals unexpected anatomical features that suggest a very different story. This new fossil nests within a clade of post-Devonian species and, in an expanded phylogenetic analysis, draws multiple lineages of Carboniferous actinopterygians into the Devonian. This suggests cryptic but extensive lineage diversification in the latest Devonian, followed by more conspicuous feeding and locomotor structure diversification in the Carboniferous. Our revised model matches more complex patterns of divergence, survival, and diversification around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary in other vertebrate clades. It also fundamentally recalibrates the onset of diversification early in the history of this major radiation.",

New technologies, including superresolved nanoscopy and expansion microscopy, as well as new sample preparation techniques, are starting to revolutionize imaging of biopsy specimens. However, our previous approaches for simple and fast three-dimensional imaging of optically cleared samples are to date not compatible with formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, impeding application in clinical routine. Here we provide protocols that circumvent these limitations and allow for three dimensional STED and confocal imaging of FFPE kidney tissue with similar staining and image quality as compared to our previous approaches. This would increase the feasibility to implement these protocols in clinical routines, as FFPE is the gold standard method for storage of patient samples.",

    "abstract": "A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a machine learning algorithm, useful for generating a compressed and interpretable latent space. These representations have been generated from various biomedical data types and can be used to produce realistic-looking simulated data. However, standard vanilla VAEs suffer from entangled and uninformative latent spaces, which can be mitigated using other types of VAEs such as {beta}-VAE and MMD-VAE. In this project, we evaluated the ability of VAEs to learn cell morphology characteristics derived from cell images. We trained and evaluated these three VAE variants--Vanilla VAE, {beta}-VAE, and MMD-VAE--on cell morphology readouts and explored the generative capacity of each model to predict compound polypharmacology (the interactions of a drug with more than one target) using an approach called latent space arithmetic (LSA). To test the generalizability of the strategy, we also trained these VAEs using gene expression data of the same compound perturbations and found that gene expression provides complementary information. We found that the {beta}-VAE and MMD-VAE disentangle morphology signals and reveal a more interpretable latent space. We reliably simulated morphology and gene expression readouts from certain compounds thereby predicting cell states perturbed with compounds of known polypharmacology. Inferring cell state for specific drug mechanisms could aid researchers in developing and identifying targeted therapeutics and categorizing off-target effects in the future.",

    "abstract": "Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during post-learning sleep is known to enhance motor memory consolidation but the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. Here, we confirm the beneficial effect of auditory TMR on motor performance. At the neural level, TMR enhanced slow wave (SW) characteristics. Additionally, greater TMR-related phase-amplitude coupling between slow (0.5-2 Hz) and sigma (12-16 Hz) oscillations after the SW peak was related to higher TMR effect on performance. Importantly, sounds that were not associated to learning strengthened SW-sigma coupling at the SW trough and the increase in sigma power nested in the trough of the potential evoked by these unassociated sounds was related to the TMR benefit. Altogether, our data suggest that, depending on their precise temporal coordination during post learning sleep, slow and sigma oscillations play a crucial role in either memory reinstatement or protection against irrelevant information; two processes that critically contribute to motor memory consolidation.",

Here we show that the imagery pupillary light response correlates with objective measures of sensory imagery strength. Further, the trial-by-trial phenomenological vividness of visual imagery is tracked by the imagery pupillary light response. We also demonstrated that there was no evidence for an imagery pupillary light response in a group of individuals without visual imagery (aphantasia), however, they did show perceptual pupil light responses and pupil dilation with larger cognitive load.

    "abstract": "Speed-dependent interlimb coordination allows animals to maintain stable locomotion under different circumstances. We have previously demonstrated that a subset of spinal V3 neurons contributes to stable locomotion by mediating mutual excitation between left and right lumbar rhythm generators (RGs). Here, we expanded our investigation to the V3 neurons involved in ascending long propriospinal interactions (aLPNs). Using retrograde tracing, we revealed a subpopulation of lumbar V3 aLPNs with contralateral cervical projections. V3OFF mice, in which all V3 neurons were silenced, had a significantly reduced maximal locomotor speed, were unable to move using stable trot, gallop, or bound, and predominantly used lateral-sequence walk. To understand the functional roles of V3 aLPNs, we adapted our previous model of spinal circuitry controlling quadrupedal locomotion (Danner et al., 2017), by incorporating diagonal V3 aLPNs mediating inputs from each lumbar RG to the contralateral cervical RG. The updated model reproduces our experimental results and suggests that locally projecting V3 neurons, mediating left-right interactions within lumbar and cervical cords, promote left-right synchronization necessary for gallop and bound, whereas the V3 aLPNs promote synchronization between diagonal fore and hind RGs necessary for trot. The model proposes the organization of spinal circuits available for future experimental testing.",

Although, clinical immunity develops over time with repeated malaria episodes, disease tolerance is more rapidly acquired compared to protective immunity. It remains unclear, how pre-existing immune responses impacts the mechanism responsible for disease tolerance. Here, we investigated a cohort of returning travelers treated for acute symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, either infected for the first time, or with a previous history of malaria. Through repeated sampling over one year in a malaria free setting, we were able to study the acute and longitudinal effects of the infection. We combined comprehensive immune cell and plasma protein profiling with integrated and data driven analysis, describing the immune landscape from acute disease to one year after infection. We identified a strong association between pro-inflammatory signatures and {gamma}{delta} T cell expansion. The association was significantly impacted by previous exposure to malaria, resulting in a dampened pro-inflammatory response, which translated to reduced V{delta}2+ {gamma}{delta} T cell expansion compared to primary infected individuals. The dampened inflammatory signal was associated with early expansion of Fc{gamma}RIII+ monocytes and parasite-specific antibodies of IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes.\n\nOur data suggest that the interplay of Fc{gamma}RIII+ monocytes and a cytophilic parasite-specific IgG during the early blood stage infection lead to lower parasitemia and a dampened pro-inflammatory response with reduced {gamma}{delta} T cell expansion.

A sample of phytoplankton (micro+nano, pico-eukaryotes, pico-cyanobacteria), mixotrophic algae and heterotrophic bacteria was collected to determine abundances at each of four sampling dates. The clear and turbid systems showed similar, but not synchronized, patterns of daily DO% changes in relation to the controls (DO%v), after exposure to both single and combined formulations. Under glyphosate scenarios (GL, GH, ML and MH), the two types of systems showed similar DO%v but different microbial abundances, being associated to an increase in the micro+nano and pico-eukaryotic phytoplankton fractions for the clear system. In contrast, in the turbid system changes were associated with increased pico-cyanobacteria and decreased mixotrophic algae. Effects of 2,4-D were only observed in the turbid system, leading to decreased micro+nano phytoplankton abundances. Under the turbid scenario, the herbicide mixture at high concentration had a synergistic effect on DO%v and recovery was not detected by the end of the experiment. Our results revealed that herbicides inputs induced changes in phytoplankton abundances that leads to measurable DO variations.",

    "abstract": "Fertilization in angiosperms involves the germination of pollen on the stigma, followed by the extrusion of a pollen tube that elongates through the style and delivers two sperm cells to the embryo sac. Sexual selection could occur throughout this process when male gametophytes compete for fertilization. The strength of sexual selection during pollen competition should be affected by the number of genotypes deposited on the stigma. As increased self-fertilization reduces the number of mating partners, and the genetic diversity and heterozygosity of populations, it should thereby reduce the intensity of sexual selection during pollen competition. Despite the prevalence of mating system shifts, few studies have directly compared the molecular signatures of sexual selection during pollen competition in populations with different mating systems. Here we analyzed whole-genome sequences from natural populations of Arabis alpina, a species showing mating system variation across its distribution, to test whether shifts from cross- to self-fertilization result in molecular signatures consistent with sexual selection on genes involved in pollen competition. We found evidence for efficient purifying selection on genes expressed in vegetative pollen, and overall weaker selection on sperm-expressed genes. This pattern was robust when controlling for gene expression level and specificity. In agreement with the expectation that sexual selection intensifies under cross-fertilization, we found that the efficacy of purifying selection on male gametophyte-expressed genes was significantly stronger in genetically more diverse and outbred populations. Our results show that intra-sexual competition shapes the evolution of pollen-expressed genes, and that its strength fades with increasing self-fertilization rates.",

    "abstract": "Biguanides, including the worlds most commonly prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes, metformin, not only lower blood sugar, but also promote longevity in preclinical models. Epidemiologic studies in humans parallel these findings, indicating favorable effects of metformin on longevity and on reducing the incidence and morbidity associated with aging-related diseases. In spite of this promise, the full spectrum of molecular effectors responsible for these health benefits remains elusive. Through unbiased screening in C. elegans, we uncovered a role for genes necessary for ether lipid biosynthesis in the favorable effects of biguanides. We demonstrate that biguanides prompt lifespan extension by stimulating ether lipid biogenesis. Loss of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery also mitigates lifespan extension attributable to dietary restriction, target of rapamycin (TOR) inhibition, and mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition. A possible mechanistic explanation for this finding is that ether lipids are required for activation of longevity-promoting, metabolic stress defenses downstream of the conserved transcription factor Nrf2/skn-1. In alignment with these findings, overexpression of a single, key, ether lipid biosynthetic enzyme, fard-1/FAR1, is sufficient to promote lifespan extension. These findings illuminate the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery as a novel therapeutic target to promote healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "The gray short-tailed opossum is an established laboratory-bred marsupial model for biomedical research. It serves as a critical species for comparative genomics research, providing the pivotal phylogenetic outgroup for studies of derived vs. ancestral states of genomic/epigenomic characteristics for all eutherian mammal lineages. To characterize the current genetic profile of this laboratory marsupial, we examined 79 individuals from eight established laboratory strains. Double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) and whole-genome resequencing experiments were performed to investigate the genetic architecture in these strains. A total of 66,640 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. We analyzed SNP density, average heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, and population differentiation parameter Fst within and between the eight strains. Principal component and population structure analysis clearly resolve the strains at the level of their ancestral founder populations, and the genetic architecture of these strains correctly reflects their breeding history. We confirmed the successful establishment of the first inbred laboratory opossum strain LSD (inbreeding coefficient F > 0.99) and a nearly inbred strain FD2M1 (0.98 < F < 0.99), each derived from a different ancestral background. These strains are suitable for various experimental protocols requiring controlled genetic backgrounds and for intercrosses and backcrosses that can generate offspring with informative SNPs for studying a variety of genetic and epigenetic processes. Together with recent advances in reproductive manipulation and CRISPR/Cas9 techniques for M. domestica, the existence of distinctive inbred strains will enable genome editing on different genetic backgrounds, greatly expanding the utility of this marsupial model for biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Models estimate that up to 80% of all butterfly and moth species host vertically transmitted endosymbiotic microorganisms, which can affect the host fitness, metabolism, reproduction, population dynamics, and genetic diversity, among others. The supporting empirical data are however currently highly biased towards the generally more colourful butterflies, and include less information about moths. Additionally, studies of symbiotic partners of Lepidoptera predominantly focus on the common bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, while infections by other inherited microbial partners have more rarely been investigated. Here, we mine the whole genome sequence data of 47 species of Erebidae moths, with the aims to both inform on the diversity of symbionts potentially associated with this Lepidoptera group, and discuss the potential of metagenomic approaches to inform on their associated microbiome diversity. Based on the result of Kraken2 and MetaPhlAn2 analyses, we found clear evidence of the presence of Wolbachia in four species. Our result also suggests the presence of three other bacterial symbionts (Burkholderia spp., Sodalis spp. and Arsenophonus spp.), in three other moth species. Additionally, we recovered genomic material from bracovirus in about half of our samples. The detection of the latter, usually found in mutualistic association to braconid parasitoid wasps, may inform on host-parasite interactions that take place in the natural habitat of the Erebidae moths, suggesting either contamination with material from species of the host community network, or horizontal transfer of members of the microbiome between interacting species.",

Four psychrotolerant strains of Tulasnella albida isolated from Antarctica were tested and compared in their ability to synthesize silver nanoparticles. The four strains were capable of synthesizing silver nanoparticles with the addition of AgNO3 (final concentration of 0.5 mM), showing similar results under the same conditions: 28{degrees}C, 200 rpm, pH 9. Additionally, we registered the synthesis of nanoparticles at 6{degrees}C using biomass generated at the same temperature. For the characterization of synthesized nanoparticles, TEM and SEM microscopy analyses were performed. The images obtained showed the existence of spherically shaped silver nanoparticles with a log-normal size distribution centered at 2 nm diameter for 28{degrees}C. The largest ones showed a capping shell around them, appearing associated with the formation of small silver nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations of optical absorption based on core-shell Ag-Ag2O nanoparticles were used to characterize the experimental absorption spectra of silver nanoparticles colloids. This work contributes to expanding the studies and possible technological applications of psychrotolerant organisms in the industry, particularly in the green synthesis of nanoparticles at suboptimal conditions.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a model of immunotherapy treatment, namely the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The model takes into consideration a clinically relevant interaction network between multiple immune cells and compartments. A set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced to capture the connectivity between these variables and clinical presentation of the disease. Four subsets of the T1D patients and healthy controls that exhibit normal and high-level glucose consumption are evaluated. The results that obtained for mice, suggest that BCG treatment of the T1D patients that follow healthy eating habits normalizes glucose to levels observed in non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, glucose consumption profoundly influences disease progression. The stable equilibrium state with constant glucose levels is not attainable without repeated BCG treatment. This outcome suggests that immunotherapy may modulate molecular and cellular manifestations of the disease but it does not eliminate T1D. Of note, our data indicate that the BCG immunotherapy treatment may benefit healthy controls on a high-glucose diet. One may speculate the preventive BCG treatment to provide long-term health benefits in this specific cohort.\n\nAuthor summaryWe proposed a clinically relevant mathematical model of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) based immunotherapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment. The model shows that BCG treatment is able to delay the T1D effects and to provide long-term health benefits while it may modulate molecular and cellular manifestations of the disease but it does not eliminate T1D. The main advantage of the proposed model is the ability to personalize the treatment protocol according to the patients metabolism and diet.",

Here we observe an enrichment of transcription factor genes including HNF1B within PCa risk-associated regions. While focused on the 17q12/HNF1B locus, we find a strong eQTL for HNF1B and multiple potential causal variants involved in the regulation of HNF1B expression in PCa. An unbiased genome-wide co-expression analysis reveals PCa-specific somatic TMPRSS2-ERG fusion as a transcriptional mediator of this locus and the HNF1B eQTL signal is ERG fusion status dependent. We investigate the role of HNF1B and find its involvement in several pathways related to cell cycle progression and PCa severity. Furthermore, HNF1B interacts with TMPRSS2-ERG to co-occupy large proportion of genomic regions with a remarkable enrichment of additional PCa risk alleles. We finally show that HNF1B co-opts ERG fusion to mediate mechanistic and biological effects of the PCa risk-associated locus 17p13.3/VPS53/FAM57A/GEMIN4. Taken together, we report an extensive germline-somatic interaction between TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and genetic variations underpinning PCa risk association and progression.",

Consumer studies indicate that orange maize may be regarded as novel and preferred. This study identifies genes of relevance for grain carotenoid concentrations and kernel color, through simultaneous dissection of these traits in 10 families of the U.S. maize nested association mapping population that have yellow to orange grain. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified via joint-linkage analysis, with phenotypic variation explained for individual kernel color QTL ranging from 2.4 to 17.5%. These QTL were cross-analyzed with significant marker-trait associations in a genome-wide association study that utilized [~]27 million variants. Nine genes were identified: four encoding activities upstream of the core carotenoid pathway, one at the pathway branchpoint, three within the - or {beta}-pathway branches, and one encoding a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase. Of these, three exhibited significant pleiotropy between kernel color and one or more carotenoid traits. Kernel color exhibited moderate positive correlations with {beta}-branch and total carotenoids and negligible correlations with -branch carotenoids. These findings can be leveraged to simultaneously achieve desirable kernel color phenotypes and increase concentrations of provitamin A and other priority carotenoids.",

Defined subsets of neurons expressing Slc32a1 and Esr1 (Vgat+ Esr1+) were the most transcriptionally dynamic compared to other cell types throughout puberty. These cell type specific transcriptional progressions towards adulthood were bidirectionally controlled by the levels of circulating testosterone and estradiol. Selective deletion of Esr1 in Slc32a1-expressing cells in the MPOA prior to puberty arrested transcriptional progression and revealed a sexually dimorphic gene-regulatory network governed by Esr1. Deletion of Esr1 in Vgat+ cells prevented the development of mating behavior in both sexes. These analyses reveal both sexually common and dimorphic transcriptional progressions during puberty as well as their regulatory mechanisms, which have important implications towards understanding adaptative and maladaptive processes governing adolescent brain development.",

    "abstract": "Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is mainly present in the adipose tissue where it hydrolyses diacylglycerol. Although brain expression of HSL has been reported, its presence in different cellular compartments is uncertain, and its role in regulating brain lipid metabolism remains hitherto unexplored. We propose that HSL has a role in regulating the availability of bioactive lipids necessary for adequate neuronal function. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that dampening HSL activity leads to brain dysfunction. We found HSL protein and activity throughout all the mouse brain, localised in neurons and especially enriched in synapses. HSL null mice were then analysed using a battery of behavioural tests. Relative to wild-type littermates, HSL null mice showed impaired short- and long-term memory, but preserved exploratory behaviours. Molecular analysis of the cortex and hippocampus showed increased expression of genes involved in glucose utilization in the hippocampus but not cortex of HSL null mice compared to controls. Lipidomics analyses indicated an impact of HSL deletion on the profile of bioactive lipids, including endocannabinoids and eicosanoids that are known to modulate neuronal activity, cerebral blood blow and inflammation processes. Accordingly, mild increases in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggest low grade inflammation in HSL null mice compared to littermates. We conclude that HSL has a homeostatic role in maintaining pools of lipids that are needed for brain function. It remains to be tested, however, whether the recruitment of HSL for the synthesis of these lipids occurs during increased neuronal activity, or whether HSL participates in neuroinflammatory responses.",

These stimuli were chosen to each strongly and selectively excite a single PN type to saturating firing rates, facilitating a rigorous assessment of the selectivity of olfactory plasticity for PNs directly excited by overrepresented stimuli. Unexpectedly, we found that chronic exposure to three such odors did not result in decreased PN sensitivity, but rather mildly increased responses to weak stimuli in most PN types. Odor-evoked PN activity in response to stronger stimuli was mostly unaffected by odor experience. When present, plasticity was observed broadly in multiple PN types and thus was not selective for PNs receiving direct input from the chronically active ORNs. We further investigated the DL5 olfactory coding channel and found that chronic odor-mediated excitation of its input ORNs did not affect PN intrinsic properties, local inhibitory innervation, ORN responses, or ORN-PN synaptic strength; however, broad-acting lateral excitation evoked by some odors was increased. These results show that PN odor coding is only mildly affected by strong persistent activation of a single olfactory input, highlighting the stability of early stages of insect olfactory processing to significant perturbations in the sensory environment.",

We find that CA2 encodes specific neural representations of novel social odors that are further refined during associative odor-reward learning. Optogenetic silencing of CA2 impairs the formation of reward associations. Furthermore, CA2 population activity represents odors in a geometry that enables abstract representations of social versus non-social odors. Thus, CA2 distinguishes multiple forms of olfactory stimuli to enhance the learning of social odors and associations, which are poised to serve as substrates of social memory.",

    "abstract": "Recently, highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.618 were identified in India with mutations within the spike proteins. The spike protein of Kappa contains four mutations E154K, L452R, E484Q and P681R, and Delta contains L452R, T478K and P681R, while B.1.618 spike harbors mutations {Delta}145-146 and E484K. However, it remains unknown whether these variants have altered in their entry efficiency, host tropism, and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies as well as entry inhibitors. In this study, we found that Kappa, Delta or B.1.618 spike uses human ACE2 with no or slightly increased efficiency, while gains a significantly increased binding affinity with mouse, marmoset and koala ACE2 orthologs, which exhibits limited binding with WT spike. Furthermore, the P618R mutation leads to enhanced spike cleavage, which could facilitate viral entry. In addition, Kappa, Delta and B.1.618 exhibits a reduced sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent sera owning to the mutation of E484Q, T478K, {Delta}145-146 or E484K, but remains sensitive to entry inhibitors-ACE2-lg decoy receptor. Collectively, our study revealed that enhanced human and mouse ACE2 receptor engagement, increased spike cleavage and reduced sensitivity to neutralization antibodies of Kappa, Delta and B.1.618 may contribute to the rapid spread of these variants and expanded host range. Furthermore, our result also highlighted that ACE2-lg could be developed as broad-spectrum antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease characterized by strong induction of inflammatory cytokines, progressive lung inflammation and potentially multi-organ dysfunction. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating that both S protein and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles do not trigger extracellular TLRs, including TLR4. Ectopic expression of ACE2 in DCs led to efficient infection by SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced type I IFN and cytokine responses, which was inhibited by antibodies against ACE2. These data strongly suggest that not extracellular TLRs but intracellular viral sensors are key players in sensing SARS-CoV-2. These data imply that SARS-CoV-2 escapes direct sensing by TLRs, which might underlie the lack of efficient immunity to SARS-CoV-2 early during infection.\n\nAuthor summaryThe immune system needs to recognize pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 to initiate antiviral immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for inducing antiviral immunity and are therefore equipped with both extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors to sense pathogens. However, it is unknown if and how SARS-CoV-2 activates DCs. Recent research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by extracellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We have previously shown that DCs do not express ACE2, and are therefore not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that DCs do not become activated by exposure to viral Spike proteins or SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. These findings suggest that TLR4 and other extracellular TLRs do not sense SARS-CoV-2. Next, we expressed ACE2 in DCs and SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected these ACE2-positive DCs. Notably, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced an antiviral immune response. Thus, our study suggests that infection of DCs is required for induction of immunity, and thus that intracellular viral sensors rather than extracellular TLRs are important in sensing SARS-CoV-2. Lack of sensing by extracellular TLRs might be an escape mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and could contribute to the aberrant immune responses observed during COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Zoonotic spillover of animal viruses into human populations is a continuous and increasing public health risk. SARS-CoV-2 highlights the global impact emergence events can have. Considering the history and diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially in bats, SARS-CoV-2 will likely not be the last to spillover from animals into human populations.\n\nWe sampled and tested wildlife in the central African country Cameroon to determine which CoVs are circulating and how they relate to previously detected human and animal CoVs. We collected animal and ecological data at sampling locations and used family-level consensus PCR combined with amplicon sequencing for virus detection.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2018, samples were collected from 6,580 animals of several different orders. CoV RNA was detected in 175 bats, a civet, and a shrew. The CoV RNAs detected in the bats represented 17 different genetic clusters, coinciding with alpha (n=8) and beta (n=9) CoVs. Sequences resembling human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) were found in 40 Hipposideridae bats. Phylogenetic analyses place the human derived HCoV-229E isolates closest to those from camels in terms of the S and N genes, but closest to isolates from bats for the E, M, and RdRp genes. The CoV RNA positivity rate in bats varied significantly (p<0.001) between the wet (8.2%) and dry season (4.5%). Most sampled species accordingly had a wet season high and dry season low, while for some the opposite was found.\n\nEight of the suspected CoV species of which we detected RNA appear to be entirely novel CoV species, which suggests that CoV diversity in African wildlife is still rather poorly understood. The detection of multiple different variants of HCoV-229E-like viruses supports the bat reservoir hypothesis for this virus, with the phylogenetic results casting some doubt on camels as an intermediate host. The findings also support the previously proposed influence of ecological factors on CoV circulation, indicating a high level of underlying complexity to the viral ecology. These results indicate the importance of investing in surveillance activities among wild animals to detect all potential threats as well as sentinel surveillance among exposed humans to determine emerging threats.",

Here we explore this phenomenon in Muller glia, which are specialized radial astroglia that are the predominant glial type of the vertebrate retina. Muller glia extend fine filopodia-like processes into retinal synaptic layers, in similar fashion to brain astrocytes and radial glia which exhibit perisynaptic processes. Using two-photon volumetric imaging, we found that during the second postnatal week, Muller glial processes were highly dynamic, with rapid extensions and retractions that were mediated by cytoskeletal rearrangements. During this same stage of development, retinal waves led to increases in cytosolic calcium within Muller glial lateral processes and stalks. These comprised distinct calcium compartments, distinguished by variable participation in waves, timing, and sensitivity to an M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. However, we found that motility of lateral processes was unaffected by the presence of pharmacological agents that enhanced or blocked wave-associated calcium transients. Finally, we found that mice lacking normal cholinergic waves in the first postnatal week also exhibited normal Muller glial process morphology. Hence, outgrowth of Muller glial lateral processes into synaptic layers is determined by factors that are independent of neuronal activity.",

However, we still lack an effective framework for identifying these species from the available metagenomic data without the notoriously difficult step of reconstructing the detailed network of inter-specific interactions. Here we propose a top-down identification framework, which detects keystones by their total influence on the rest of the species. Our method does not assume pairwise interactions or any specific underlying dynamics and is appropriate to both perturbation experiments and metagenomic cross-sectional surveys. When applied to real metagenomic data of the human gastrointestinal microbiome, we detect a set of candidate keystones and find that they are often part of a keystone module - multiple candidate keystones species with correlated occurrence. The keystones analysis of single-time-point cross-sectional data is also later verified by evaluation of two-time-points longitudinal sampling. Our framework represents a necessary advancement towards the reliable identification of these key players of complex, real-world microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Significant alterations in signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory programs together represent major hallmarks of many cancers. These, among all, include the reactivation of stemness, which is registered by the expression of pathways that are active in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we assembled gene sets that reflect the stemness and proliferation signatures and used them to analyze a large panel of RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Consortium in order to specifically assess the expression of stemness-related and proliferation-related genes across a collection of different tumor types. We introduced a metric that captures the collective similarity of the expression profile of a tumor to that of ESCs, which showed that stemness and proliferation signatures vary greatly between different tumor types. We also observed a high degree of intertumoral heterogeneity in the expression of stemness- and proliferation-related genes, which was associated with increased hazard ratios in a fraction of tumors and mirrored by high intratumoral heterogeneity across cancer cells in single cell RNA-seq datasets. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of stemness signatures is highly heterogeneous and cannot be used as a universal determinant of cancer. This calls into question the universal validity of diagnostic tests that are based on stem cell markers.\n\nAuthor summaryCancer is a deadly human disease which is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. Stemness, or the expression of stem cell markers, has been identified as a key feature for cancer progression and in many cases correlates with patient survival. In this work, we reanalyzed a large cohort of cancers from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) collection and single-cell cancer data, and found that the degree of stemness reactivation varies greatly between different tumor types, between different tumors of the same type, and also different cells within a tumor. The observed stemness heterogeneity implies that the expression of stemness markers cannot be used as a universal determinant of cancer and calls into question the validity of stemness-based tests that are frequently used for cancer diagnostics.",

We developed a systematic approach to align genomic signals to multiple locations simultaneously by expanding the dimensionality of the genomic-coordinate space. We analyzed transcription in human and uncovered a complex dependence on the relative position of neighboring transcription start sites (TSSs) that is consistently conserved among cell types. The dependence ranges from enhancement to suppression of transcription depending on the relative distances to the TSSs, their intragenic position, and the transcriptional activity of the gene. Our results reveal a conserved hierarchy of alternative TSS usage within a previously unrecognized level of genomic organization and provide a general methodology to analyze complex functional relationships among multiple types of DNA elements.",

It is designed for both very large and very small datasets. XSTREME is similar to the MEME-ChIP tool, but expands upon its capabilities in several ways. Like MEME-ChIP, XSTREME performs two types of de novo motif discovery, and also performs motif enrichment analysis of the input sequences using databases of known motifs. Unlike MEME-ChIP, which ranks motifs based on their enrichment in the centers of the input sequences, XSTREME uses enrichment anywhere in the sequences for this purpose. Consequently, XSTREME is more appropriate for motif-based analysis of sequences regardless of how the motifs are distributed within the sequences. XSTREME uses the MEME and STREME algorithms for motif discovery, and the recently developed SEA algorithm for motif enrichment analysis. The interactive HTML output produced by XSTREME includes highly accurate motif significance estimates, plots of the positional distribution of each motif, and histograms of the number of motif matches in each sequences. XSTREME is easy to use via its web server at https://meme-suite.org, and is fully integrated with the widely-used MEME Suite of sequence analysis tools, which can be freely downloaded at the same web site for non-commercial use.",

    "abstract": "Peptide docking can be perceived as a subproblem of protein-protein docking. However, due to the short length and flexible nature of peptides, many do not adopt one defined conformation prior to binding. Therefore, to tackle a peptide docking problem, not only the relative orientation between the two partners, but also the bound conformation of the peptide needs to be modeled. Traditional peptide-centered approaches use information about the peptide sequence to generate a representative conformer ensemble, which can then be rigid body docked to the receptor. Alternatively, one may look at this problem from the viewpoint of the receptor, namely that the protein surface defines the peptide bound conformation.We present PatchMAN (Patch-Motif AligNments), a novel peptide docking approach which uses structural motifs to map the receptor surface with backbone scaffolds extracted from protein structures. On a non-redundant set of protein-peptide complexes, starting from free receptor structures, PatchMAN successfully models and identifies near-native peptide-protein complexes in 62% / 81% within 2.5[A] / 5[A] RMSD, with corresponding sampling in 81% / 100% of the cases, outperforming other approaches. PatchMAN leverages the observation that structural units of peptides with their binding pocket can be found not only within interfaces, but also within monomers. We show that the conformation of the bound peptide is sampled based on the structural context of the receptor only, without taking into account any sequence information. Beyond peptide docking, this approach opens exciting new avenues to study principles of peptide-protein association, and to the design of new peptide binders.",

    "abstract": "Herbaceous peony is an important cut-flower plant cultivated across the world, but its short vase life substantially restricts the economic value of this crop. It is well established that endogenous hormones regulate the senescing process, but the molecular mechanism of them in flower senescence is still unclear. Here, we isolated a MYB transcription factor gene PlMYB308 from herbaceous peony flowers. Transcript abundance of PlMYB308 was strongly up-regulated in senescing petals. Silencing of PlMYB308 resulted in delayed peony flower senescence, and dramatically increased gibberellin (GA) but reduced ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) levels in petals. Ectopic overexpression of PlMYB308 in tobacco accelerated flower senescence, and reduced GA but increased ethylene and ABA accumulation. Correspondingly, biosynthetic genes of ethylene, ABA, and GA showed variable expression levels in petals after silencing or overexpression of PlMYB308. A dual-luciferase assay showed that PlMYB308 specifically bound to the PlACO1 promoter. High expression levels of PlMYB308 were accompanied by low petal anthocyanin accumulation in senescing petals. A further bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay revealed an interaction between PlMYB308 and PlbHLH33, which was supposed to inhibit the anthocyanin biosynthesis. Taken together, our results suggest that the PlMYB308-PlACO1 and PlMYB308-PlbHLH33 regulatory checkpoints perhaps positively and negatively operate the production of ethylene and anthocyanin, respectively, and thus contribute to the senescence with impaired pigmentation in herbaceous peony flowers.",

However, the most advanced optical architectures are typically custom-made and require complex alignment procedures, as well as daily maintenance by properly trained personnel for optimal performance. Here, we describe a hybrid system we constructed to overcome these disadvantages by modifying a commercial upright microscope. We show that our multimodal imaging platform can be used to seamlessly perform two-photon STED, wavelength mixing and label-free microscopy in both ex vivo and in vivo samples. The system is highly stable and endowed with remote alignment hardware that ensures simplified operability for non-expert users. This optical architecture is an important step forward towards a wider practical applicability of non-linear optics to bioimaging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDietary high fructose (HFr) is a known metabolic disruptor contributing to development of obesity and diabetes in Western societies. Initial molecular changes from exposure to HFr on liver metabolism may be essential to understand the perturbations leading to insulin resistance and abnormalities in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. We studied vervet monkeys (Clorocebus aethiops sabaeus) fed a HFr (n=5) or chow diet (n=5) for 6 weeks, and obtained clinical measures of liver function, blood insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides. In addition, we performed untargeted global transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analyses on liver biopsies to determine the molecular impact of a HFr diet on coordinated pathways and networks that differed by diet.\n\nResultsWe show that integration of omics data sets improved statistical significance for some pathways and networks, and decreased significance for others, suggesting that multiple omics datasets enhance confidence in relevant pathway and network identification. Specifically, we found that sirtuin signaling and a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) regulatory network were significantly altered in hepatic response to HFr. Integration of metabolomics and miRNAs data further strengthened our findings.\n\nConclusionsOur integrated analysis of three types of omics data with pathway and regulatory network analysis demonstrates the usefulness of this approach for discovery of molecular networks central to a biological response. In addition, metabolites aspartic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), protein ATG3, and genes ATG7, HMGCS2 link sirtuin signaling and the PPARA network suggesting molecular mechanisms for altered hepatic gluconeogenesis from consumption of a HFr diet.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering high-level cognitive representations of categories such as faces is an elusive goal that has been frequently sought using reverse correlation, a technique employed in fields ranging from neurophysiology to cognitive psychology. In reverse correlation, subjects are asked to make perceptual judgments (e.g., \"do you see a face?\") about richly varying stimuli (e.g., white noise), and observed responses are then regressed against stimuli to yield reconstructions of the underlying cognitive representation. However, many thousands of stimulus-response pairs are frequently required, which severely limits the breadth of studies that are feasible using this powerful method. Techniques that are currently employed to improve efficiency, such as filtering the reconstruction, nevertheless bias the outcome. Here, we show that an advanced signal processing technique for improving sampling efficiency - compressive sensing - is directly compatible with reverse correlation. A trio of simulations are performed to demonstrate that compressive sensing can reduce the required stimulus-response pairs by up to 90% without biasing the reconstruction or can retrospectively improve the accuracy of the reconstructions on existing data. This work concludes by outlining the potential of compressive sensing to improve representation reconstruction throughout the field of neuroscience and beyond.\n\nSignificance StatementUncovering cognitive representations is an elusive goal that is increasingly pursued using the reverse correlation method, wherein human subjects make judgments about vague stimuli.

    "abstract": "In humans, sleep spindles are 10-16 Hz oscillations lasting approximately 0.5-2 s. Spindles, along with cortical slow oscillations, facilitate memory consolidation by enabling synaptic plasticity. Early recordings of spindles at the scalp found anterior channels had overall slower frequency than central-posterior channels. This robust, topographical finding led to dichotomizing spindles as  slow versus  fast, modelled as two distinct spindle generators in frontal versus posterior cortex. Using a large dataset of intracranial sEEG recordings (n=20, 365 bipolar recordings), we show that the difference in spindle frequency between frontal and parietal channels is comparable to the variability in spindle frequency within the course of individual spindles, across different spindles recorded by a given site, and across sites within a given region. Thus, fast and slow spindles only capture average differences that obscure a much larger underlying overlap in frequency. Furthermore, differences in mean frequency are only one of several ways that spindles differ. For example, compared to parietal, frontal spindles are smaller, tend to occur after parietal when both are engaged, and show a larger decrease in frequency within-spindles. However, frontal and parietal spindles are similar in being longer, less variable, and more widespread than occipital, temporal, and Rolandic spindles. These characteristics are accentuated in spindles which are highly phase-locked to posterior hippocampal spindles. We propose that rather than a strict parietal-fast/frontal-slow dichotomy, spindles differ continuously and quasi-independently in multiple dimensions, with variability due about equally to within-spindle, within-region and between-region factors.\n\nSignificance StatementSleep spindles are 10-16 Hz neural oscillations generated by cortico-thalamic circuits that promote memory consolidation. Spindles are often dichotomized into slow-anterior and fast-posterior categories for cognitive and clinical studies. Here, we show that the anterior-posterior difference in spindle frequency is comparable to that observed between different cycles of individual spindles, between spindles from a given site, or from different sites within a region. Further, we show that spindles vary on other dimensions such as duration, amplitude, spread, primacy and consistency, and that these multiple dimensions vary continuously and largely independently across cortical regions. These findings suggest that multiple continuous variables rather than a strict frequency dichotomy may be more useful biomarkers for memory consolidation or psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exhibit an increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric comorbities (e.g., apathy) relative to their seronegative counterparts. Given the profound functional consequences associated with apathy, conceptualizing the multidimensional neuropsychiatric syndrome, and associated neural mechanisms, following chronic HIV-1 viral protein exposure remains a critical need. HIV-1 associated apathy was examined by quantifying goal-directed behaviors, indexed using voluntary wheel running, during the diurnal and nocturnal cycle. Apathetic behaviors in the HIV-1 Tg rat were characterized by a profound decrease in the number of running bouts during both the diurnal and nocturnal cycle, supporting a prominent deficit in the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors. Additionally, HIV-1 Tg animals exhibited a decreased reinforcing efficacy of voluntary wheel running during the nocturnal cycle. Following the completion of voluntary wheel running, synaptic dysfunction in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was examined as a potential neural mechanism underlying HIV-1 associated apathy. HIV-1 Tg animals displayed prominent synaptic dysfunction in MSNs of the NAc, characterized by decreased synaptic connectivity and a population shift towards an immature dendritic spine phenotype relative to control animals. Synaptic dysfunction accounted for 42.0% to 68.5% of the variance in the number of running bouts affording a key neural mechanism underlying the self-initiation of spontaneous behaviors. The establishment of a fundamental neural mechanism underlying apathy affords a key target for the development of novel therapeutics and cure strategies for affective alterations associated with HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of the relationship between cellular function and molecular composition holds a key to next-generational therapeutics but requires measurement of all types of molecules in cells. Developments in sequencing enabled semi-routine measurement of single-cell genomes and transcriptomes, but analytical tools are scarce for detecting diverse proteins in tissue-embedded cells. To bridge this gap for neuroscience research, we report the integration of patch-clamp electrophysiology with subcellular shot-gun proteomics by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Recording of electrical activity permitted identification of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Ca. 20-50% of the neuronal soma content, containing an estimated 100 pg of total protein, was aspirated into the patch pipette filled with ammonium bicarbonate. About ~1 pg of somal protein, or ~0.25% of the total cellular proteome, was analyzed on a custom-built capillary electrophoresis (CE) high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS). A series of experiments were conducted to systematically enhance detection sensitivity through refinements in sample processing and detection, allowing us to quantify ~275 different proteins from somal aspirate-equivalent protein digests. From single neurons, patch-clamp proteomics of the soma quantified 91, 80, and 95 different proteins from 3 different dopaminergic neurons, or 157 proteins in total. Quantification revealed detectable proteomic differences between the somal protein samples. Analysis of canonical knowledge predicted rich interaction networks between the proteins. The integration of patch-clamp electrophysiology with subcellular CE-HRMS proteomics expands the analytical toolbox of neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged lymphopenia represents a major clinical problem after cytoreductive therapies such as chemotherapy and the conditioning required for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), contributing toward the risk of infections and malignant relapse. Restoration of T cell immunity is dependent on tissue regeneration in the thymus, the primary site of T cell development; although the capacity of the thymus to repair itself diminishes over lifespan. However, although boosting thymic function and T cell reconstitution is of considerable clinical importance, there are currently no approved therapies for treating lymphopenia. Here we found that Zinc (Zn), is critically important for both normal T cell development as well as repair after acute damage. Accumulated Zn in thymocytes during development was released into the extracellular milieu after HCT conditioning, where it triggered regeneration by stimulating endothelial cell-production of BMP4 via the cell surface receptor GPR39. Dietary supplementation of Zn was sufficient to promote thymic function in a mouse model of allogeneic HCT, including enhancing the number of recent thymic emigrants in circulation; although direct targeting of GPR39 with a small molecule agonist enhanced thymic function without the need for prior Zn accumulation in thymocytes. Together, these findings not only define an important pathway underlying tissue regeneration, but also offer an innovative preclinical approach to treat lymphopenia in HCT recipients.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIThymocytes release zinc after HCT conditioning is sensed by GPR39 and promotes epithelial repair\nC_LIO_LIPharmacologic stimulation of GPR39 promotes T cell reconstitution after HCT\nC_LI",

The disease does not have a cure yet, as there are still many aspects of this complex disorder that are not fully understood. While mathematical models can shed light on some of these aspects, to date there are few such models that can be used to better understand the disease. As a first step in the mechanistic understanding of RA, in this study we introduce a new hybrid mathematical modelling framework that describes pannus formation in a small proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. We perform numerical simulations with this new model, to investigate the impact of different levels of immune cells (macrophages and fibroblasts) on the degradation of bone and cartilage. Since many model parameters are unknown and cannot be estimated due to a lack of experiments, we also perform a sensitivity analysis of model outputs to various model parameters (single parameters or combinations of parameters). Finally, we discuss how our model could be applied to investigate current treatments for RA, for example, methotrexate, TNF-inhibitors or tocilizumab, which can impact different model parameters.",

To address this need, over the years a number of different approaches have been used to generate NF-{kappa}B reporter mice, which can be broadly subdivided into bioluminescence- and fluorescence-based systems. While the former enables whole-body visualization of the activation status of NF-{kappa}B, the latter have the potential to allow the analysis of NF-{kappa}B activity at single cell level.

    "abstract": "In the classic Chemoaffinity theory, the retinotectal axon projection is thought to use pairs of orthogonal signalling gradients in the retina to specify the eventual location of synapses made on the surface of the tectum/superior colliculus. Similar orthogonal gradients in the tectum provide a coordinate system which allows the axons to match their prespecified destination with the correct location. Although the Ephrins have been shown to guide axons toward their destination, there has yet to emerge a complete account of the local interactions which halt the axonal growth cones in the correct locations to recreate the topography of the retinal cells. The model of Simpson and Goodhill (2011) provides an account of the basic topographic arrangement of cells on the tectum, as well as reproducing well known surgical and genetic manipulation experiments. However, it suffers from the absence of a local chemotactic guidance mechanism. Instead, each agent in their model is given instantaneous knowledge of the vector that would move it toward its pre specified destination. In addition to the globally supervised chemoaffinity term, Simpson and Goodhill (2011) introduced a competitive interaction for space between growth cone agents and a receptor-ligand axon-axon interaction in order to account for the full set of experimental manipulations. Here, we propose the replacement of the chemoaffinity term with a gradient following model consisting of axonal growth cone agents which carry receptor molecule expression determined by their somas location of origin on the retina. Growth cones move on the simulated tectum guided by two pairs of opposing, orthogonal signalling molecules representing the Ephrin ligands. We show that with only the chemoaffinity term and a receptor-ligand based axon-axon interaction term (meaning that all growth cone interactions are by receptor-ligand signalling), a full range of experimental manipulations to the retinotectal system can be reproduced. Furthermore, we show that the observation that competition is not and essential requirement for axons to find their way (Gosse et al., 2008) is also accounted for by the model, due to the opposing influences of signalling gradient pairs. Finally, we demonstrate that, assuming exponentially varying receptor expression in the retina, ligand expression should either be exponential if the receptor-ligand signal induces repulsion (i.e. gradient descent) or logarithmic if the signal induces attraction (gradient ascent). Thus, we find that a model analogous to the one we presented in James et al. (2020) that accounts for murine barrel patterning is also a candidate mechanism for the arrangement of the more continuous retinotectal system.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution mass spectrometry techniques are widely used in the environmental sciences to characterize natural organic matter and, when utilizing these instruments, researchers must make multiple decisions regarding sample pre-treatment and the instrument ionization mode. To identify how these choices alter organic matter characterization and resulting conclusions, we analyzed a collection of 17 riverine samples from East River, CO (USA) under four PPL-based Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) treatment and electrospray ionization polarity (e.g., positive and negative) combinations: SPE (+), SPE (-), non-SPE (-), and non-SPE (+). The greatest number of formula assignments were achieved with SPE-treated samples due to the removal of compounds that could interfere with ionization. Furthermore, the SPE (-) treatment captured the most formulas across the widest chemical compound diversity. In addition to a reduced number of assigned formulas, the non-SPE datasets resulted in altered thermodynamic interpretations that could cascade into incomplete assumptions about the availability of organic matter pools for microbial heterotrophic respiration. Thus, we infer that the SPE (-) treatment is the best single method for characterizing environmental organic matter pools unless the focus is on lipid-like compounds, in which case we recommend a combination of SPE (-) and SPE (+) to adequately characterize these molecules.\n\nSynopsisWe provide data-driven sample treatment and ionization mode recommendations to researchers who aim to use high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize environmental organic matter.\n\nAbstract Art O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Theory predicts that when different barriers to gene flow become coincident, their joint effects enhance reproductive isolation and genomic divergence beyond their individual effects, but empirical tests of this  coupling hypothesis are rare. Here, we analyze patterns of gene exchange among populations of European corn borer moths that vary in the number of acting barriers, allowing for comparisons of genomic variation when barrier traits or loci are in coincident or independent states. We find that divergence is mainly restricted to barrier loci when populations differ by a single barrier, whereas the coincidence of temporal and behavioral barriers is associated with divergence of two chromosomes harboring barrier loci. Furthermore, differentiation at temporal barrier loci increases in the presence of behavioral divergence and differentiation at behavioral barrier loci increases in the presence of temporal divergence. Our results demonstrate how the joint action of coincident barrier effects leads to levels of genomic differentiation that far exceed those of single barriers acting alone, consistent with theory arguing that coupling allows indirect selection to combine with direct selection and thereby lead to a stronger overall barrier to gene flow. Thus, the state of barriers - independent or coupled - strongly influences the accumulation of genomic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "A cavernous hemangioma, well-known as vascular malformation, is present at birth, grows proportionately with the child, and does not undergo regression. Although a cavernous hemangioma has well-defined histopathological characteristics, its origin and formation remain unknown. In the present study, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity of cavernous hemangioma using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The main contribution of this study is the discovery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that cause tumour formation in cavernous hemangioma and we propose that these MSCs may be abnormally differentiated or incompletely differentiated from epiblast stem cells.\n\nOther new findings include the responsive ACKR1 positive endothelial cell (ACKR1+EC) and BTNL9 positive endothelial cell (BTNL9+EC) and the BTNL9-caused checkpoint blockade enhanced by the CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling. The activated CD8+T and NK cells may highly express CCL5 for their infiltration in cavernous hemangiomas, independent on the tumor cell-derived CCL5-IFNG-CXCL9 pathway. The highly co-expression of CXCR4 and GZMB suggested that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) function for anti-tumour as CD8+T cells in cavernous hemangiomas. The oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in the TME of cavernous hemangiomas may play an important role as a signalling molecular in the immune responses. Notably, we propose that oxLDL induces the oxLDL-OLR1-NLRP3 pathway by over-expression of OLR1 in M1-like macrophages, whereas oxLDL induces the oxLDL-SRs-C1q (SRs are genes encoding scavenger receptors of oxLDL except OLR1) pathway by over-expression of other scavenger receptors in M2-like macrophages.\n\nThe present study revealed the origin of cavernous hemangiomas and discovered marker genes, cell types and molecular mechanisms associated with the origin, formation, progression, diagnosis or therapy of cavernous hemangiomas. The information from the present study makes important contributions to the understanding of cavernous hemangioma formation and progression and facilitates the development of gold standard for molecular diagnosis and effective drugs for treatment.",

    "abstract": "Due to the widespread access to, and implementation of, combination antiretroviral therapy, individuals perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are living into adolescence and adulthood. Perinatally infected adolescents living with HIV-1 (pALHIV) are plagued by progressive, chronic neurocognitive impairments; the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these deficits, however, remains understudied. A longitudinal experimental design from postnatal day (PD) 30 to PD 180 was utilized to establish the development of pyramidal neurons, and associated dendritic spines, from layers II-III of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Three putative neuroinflammatory markers (i.e., IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF-) were evaluated early in development (i.e., PD 30) as a potential mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunction in the mPFC. Constitutive expression of HIV-1 viral proteins induced prominent neurodevelopmental alterations, independent of biological sex, in pyramidal neurons from layers II-III of the mPFC. Specifically, HIV-1 transgenic rats exhibited prominent deficits in dendritic and synaptic pruning, a developmental decrease in synaptic connectivity, and an age-related decline in synaptic efficacy. Examination of dendritic spine morphology revealed an age-related population shift towards a more immature dendritic spine phenotype in HIV-1 transgenic animals. There was no compelling evidence for neuroinflammation in the mPFC during early development. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying chronic neurocognitive impairments in pALHIV may afford a key target for innovative therapeutics and cure strategies; an urgent need given the growing population of pALHIV.",

    "abstract": "Host-microbiome interactions and the microbial community have broad impact in human health and diseases. Most microbiome based studies are performed at the genome level based on next-generation sequencing techniques, but metaproteomics is emerging as a powerful technique to study microbiome functional activity by characterizing the complex and dynamic composition of microbial proteins. We conducted a large-scale survey of human gut microbiome metaproteomic data to identify generalist species that are ubiquitously expressed across all samples and specialists that are highly expressed in a small subset of samples associated with a certain phenotype. We were able to utilize the metaproteomic mass spectrometry data to reveal the protein landscapes of these species, which enables the characterization of the expression levels of proteins of different functions and underlying regulatory mechanisms, such as operons. Finally, we were able to recover a large number of open reading frames (ORFs) with spectral support, which were missed by de novo protein-coding gene predictors. We showed that a majority of the rescued ORFs overlapped with de novo predicted proteincoding genes, but on opposite strands or on different frames. Together, these demonstrate applications of metaproteomics for the characterization of important gut bacterial species. Results are available for public access at https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/GutBac.\n\nAuthor summaryMany reference genomes for studying human gut microbiome are available, but knowledge about how microbial organisms work is limited. Identification of proteins at individual species or community level provides direct insight into the functionality of microbial organisms. By analyzing more than a thousand metaproteomics datasets, we examined protein landscapes of more than two thousands of microbial species that may be important to human health and diseases. This work demonstrated new applications of metaproteomic datasets for studying individual genomes. We made the analysis results available through the GutBac website, which we believe will become a resource for studying microbial species important for human health and diseases.",

    "abstract": "The main aim of this study was to determine sex differences in central and peripheral fatigue produced by a sustained isometric exercise of ankle plantar flexors in healthy young adults. Ten males and fourteen females performed a sustained isometric ankle exercise until task failure. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque (plantarflexion), voluntary activation level (using the twitch interpolation technique), and twitch contractile properties (twitch peak torque, twitch half relaxation time, and low frequency fatigue index) were measured before, immediately after, and throughout a recovery period (1, 2, 5, and 10 min) following the exercise protocol in order to characterize neuromuscular fatigue. Fatigue had a significant effect (p [&le;] 0.05) on all dependent variables. Other than for the maximal voluntary contraction torque, where males showed a greater fatigue-related decrease than females, males and females showed generally similar changes with fatigue. Altogether, our findings indicate no major differences in central or peripheral fatigue mechanisms between males and females to explain a somewhat greater fatigability in males.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic labeling is a widely used tool to investigate different aspects of pre-mRNA splicing and RNA turnover. The labeling technology takes advantage of native cellular machineries where a nucleotide analog is readily taken up and incorporated into nascent RNA. One such analog is 4-thiouridine (4sU). Previous studies demonstrated that the uptake of 4sU at elevated concentrations (>50{micro}M) and extended exposure led to inhibition of rRNA synthesis and processing, presumably induced by changes in RNA secondary structure. Thus, it is possible that 4sU incorporation may also interfere with splicing efficiency. To test this hypothesis, we carried out splicing analyses of pre-mRNA substrates with varying levels of 4sU incorporation (0-100%). We demonstrate that increased incorporation of 4sU into pre-mRNAs decreased splicing efficiency. The overall impact of 4sU labeling on pre-mRNA splicing efficiency negatively correlates with the strength of splice site signals such as the 3 and the 5 splice sites. Introns with weaker splice sites are more affected by the presence of 4sU. We also show that transcription by T7 polymerase and pre-mRNA degradation kinetics were impacted at the highest levels of 4sU incorporation. Increased incorporation of 4sU caused elevated levels of abortive transcripts, and fully labeled pre-mRNA is more stable than its uridine-only counterpart. Cell culture experiments show that a small number of alternative splicing events were modestly, but statistically significantly influenced by metabolic labeling with 4sU at concentrations considered to be tolerable (40 {micro}M). We conclude that at high 4sU incorporation rates small, but noticeable changes in pre-mRNA splicing can be detected when splice sites deviate from consensus. Given these potential 4sU artifacts, we suggest that appropriate controls for metabolic labeling experiments need to be included in future labeling experiments.",

    "abstract": "MERRA/Max provides a feature selection approach to dimensionality reduction that enables direct use of global climate model outputs in ecological niche modeling. The system accomplishes this reduction through a Monte Carlo optimization in which many independent MaxEnt runs, operating on a species occurrence file and a small set of randomly selected variables in a large collection of variables, converge on an estimate of the top contributing predictors in the larger collection. These top predictors can be viewed as potential candidates in the variable selection step of the ecological niche modeling process. MERRA/Maxs Monte Carlo algorithm operates on files stored in the underlying filesystem, making it scalable to large data sets. Its software components can run as parallel processes in a high-performance cloud computing environment to yield near real-time performance. In tests using Cassins Sparrow (Peucaea cassinii) as the target species, MERRA/Max selected a set of predictors from Worldclims Bioclim collection of 19 environmental variables that have been shown to be important determinants of the species bioclimatic niche. It also selected biologically and ecologically meaningful predictors from a more diverse set of 86 environmental variables derived from NASAs Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis, an output product of the Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS-5) modeling system. We believe these results point to a technological approach that could expand the use global climate model outputs in ecological niche modeling, streamline the modeling process, and, eventually, enable automated bioclimatic modeling as a practical, readily accessible, low-cost, commercial cloud service.",
