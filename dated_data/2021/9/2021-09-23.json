    "abstract": "The purpose of our study is to understand the role of the Ralbp1 gene in oxidative stress (OS), mitochondrial dysfunction and cognition in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. The Ralbp1 gene encodes the 76 kDa protein Rlip (aka RLIP76). Previous studies have revealed its role in OS-related cancer. However, Rlip is transcriptionally regulated by EP300, a CREB-binding protein that is important for synaptic plasticity in the brain. Rlip functions as a stress-responsive/protective transporter of glutathione conjugates (GS-E) and xenobiotic toxins. OS causes rapid cellular accumulation of Rlip and its translocation from a tubulin-bound complex to the plasma membrane, mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore, Rlip may play an important role in maintaining cognitive function in the face of OS-related injury. This study is aimed to determine whether Rlip deficiency in mice is associated with AD-like cognitive and mitochondrial dysfunction. Brain tissue obtained from cohorts of wildtype and Rlip+/- mice were analyzed for OS markers, expression of genes that regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion, and synaptic integrity. We also examined mitochondrial ultrastructure in mouse brains obtained from these mice and further analyzed the impact of Rlip deficiency on gene networks of AD, aging, inhibition of stress-activated gene expression, mitochondrial function, and CREB signaling. Our studies revealed a significant increase in the levels of OS markers and alterations in the expression of genes and proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and synapses in brain tissues of these mice. Furthermore, we compared the cognitive function of wildtype and Rlip+/- mice. Behavioral, basic motor and sensory function tests in Rlip+/- mice revealed cognitive decline, similar to AD. Gene network analysis indicated dysregulation of stress-activated gene expression, mitochondrial function, and CREB signaling genes in the Rlip+/- mouse liver. Our results suggest that the Rlip deficiency-associated increase in OS and mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to the development of OS-related AD processes. Therefore, the restoration of Rlip activity and endogenous cytoprotective mechanisms by pharmacological interventions is a novel approach to protect against AD.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies on emotion regulation identified a set of brain regions specialized for generating and controlling affect. Researchers generally agree that when up- and down-regulating emotion, control regions in the prefrontal cortex turn up or down activity in affect-generating areas. However, the assumption that turning up and down emotions produces opposite effects in the same affect-generating regions is untested. We call this assumption the  affective dial hypothesis. Our study tested this hypothesis by examining the overlap between the sets of regions activated during up-regulation and those deactivated during down-regulation in a large number of participants (N=105). We found that up- and down-regulation both recruit regulatory regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus but act on distinct affect-generating regions. While up-regulation increases BOLD signal in regions associated with emotion such as the amygdala, anterior insula, striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in regions associated with sympathetic vascular activity such as periventricular white matter, down-regulation decreases signal in regions receiving interoceptive input such as the posterior insula and postcentral gyrus. These findings indicate that up- and down-regulation do not generally exert opposing effects on the same affect-generating regions. Instead, they target different brain circuits.\n\nSignificance StatementMany contexts require modulating ones own emotions. Identifying the brain areas implementing these regulatory processes should advance understanding emotional disorders and designing potential interventions. The emotion regulation field has an implicit assumption we call the affective dial hypothesis: that both emotion up- and down-regulation modulate the same emotion-generating brain areas. Countering the hypothesis, our findings indicate that up- and down-modulating emotions target different brain areas. Thus, the mechanisms underlying emotion regulation differ more than previously appreciated for up- versus down-regulation. In addition to their theoretical importance, these findings are critical for researchers attempting to target activity in particular brain regions during an emotion regulation intervention.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viral infections in early-life are linked to the development of chronic lung diseases that persist into adulthood. The aim of this study was to develop a mouse model of early-life respiratory viral infection that would lead to impaired lung function in adulthood. BALB/c pups were infected at seven days of life with one of the following respiratory viruses: influenza A/Mem/1/71 \"M71\", influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 \"PR8\" or attenuated mengovirus \"Mengo\". Lung function and airways responsiveness (AHR) to methacholine were assessed seven weeks later, using the forced oscillation technique, and data were compared between male and female mice. PR8 infection was associated with significantly increased responsiveness to methacholine (for airway resistance, tissue damping, tissue elastance and hystersivity) for both sexes. M71 infection resulted in less severe responses especially in adult males. Early-life Mengo infection led to significantly higher responsiveness to MCh for males only (for airway resistance and tissue damping), suggesting sex dependant effects in lung function parameters measured. In summary, we have established a murine model where respiratory viral infection on day seven of life leads to AHR in adulthood. Importantly, the model recapitulates key variations in susceptibility related to sex and nature of viral pathogen that have previously been observed in human epidemiological studies. Our findings reveal new insights into the early origins of AHR and provide a tractable model system for future studies to unlock the mechanisms that determine pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMultiple stressors can interactively affect the population of organisms; however, the process by which they affect recruitment efficiency remains unclear for empirical populations. Recruitment efficiency can be regulated at multiple stages of life, particularly in organisms with complex life cycles. Understanding the interactive effects of multiple stressors on recruitment efficiency and determining the bottleneck life stages is imperative for species conservation.\nC_LIO_LIThe proportion of <20-year-old juveniles of the endangered freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera togakushiensis, which has an obligate parasitic larval stage, was investigated in 24 rivers from eastern Hokkaido, northern Japan to reveal the influence of nutrients, fine sediment, and their combined effects on juvenile recruitment efficiency. The following indices for recruitment at adult, parasitic, and post-parasitic juvenile stages were obtained from 11 of these rivers: gravid female density, glochidia density (the number of glochidia infections per stream area), and juvenile survival rate. This study explored the bottleneck stages of recruitment efficiency and the interactive effects of the two stressors on these stages.\nC_LIO_LITwenty-four population status assessments determined that the proportion of juveniles ranged from 0.00 to 0.53, and juveniles were absent from four rivers. The results showed that the parasitic and post-parasitic juvenile stages were bottlenecks for recruitment efficiency. Juvenile survival rates had a more significant positive effect on recruitment efficiency in rivers with a high glochidia density. Juvenile survival rate was decreased by the synergistic interaction of nutrients and fine sediment, although factors limiting glochidia density were not found.\nC_LIO_LIThe nutrient concentration of rivers in the study region was well explained by the proportion of agricultural land cover and urban areas in the watersheds, but no relationship was detected between fine sediment abundance and land use.\nC_LIO_LIThis study suggests that nutrient management at a catchment scale can be effective for re-establishing the recruitment of M. togakushiensis, particularly in rivers with a high content of fine sediments. The results also emphasise the importance of considering both parasitic and post-parasitic juvenile stages of mussels to maximise the positive effects of stressor mitigation.\nC_LI",

To verify protein genes differentially expressed in LCG, we performed PRM validation on three candidate proteins (ALB, SDC1 and ITGB4) in CT-LCG and FT-LCG.

We further established that fibrin was targeted by degradative fibroblasts through the secretion of fibrinolytic matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase, two types of serine protease. Finally, we demonstrated that besides aprotinin, specific targeting of fibrinolytic MMPs and urokinase led to cell-laden GAF stability for at least several days.

    "abstract": "For more than 25 years, the amyloid hypothesis-the paradigm that amyloid is the primary cause of Alzheimers disease-has dominated the Alzheimers community. Now, increasing evidence suggests that tissue atrophy and cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease are more closely linked to the amount and location of misfolded tau protein than to amyloid plaques. However, the precise correlation between tau pathology and tissue atrophy remains unknown. Here we integrate multiphysics modeling and Bayesian inference to create personalized tau-atrophy models using longitudinal clinical images from the the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. For each subject, we infer three personalized parameters, the tau misfolding rate, the tau transport coefficient, and the tau-induced atrophy rate from four consecutive annual tau positron emission tomography scans and structural magnetic resonance images. Strikingly, the tau-induced atrophy coefficient of 0.13/year (95% CI: 0.097-0.189) was fairly consistent across all subjects suggesting a strong correlation between tau pathology and tissue atrophy. Our personalized whole brain atrophy rates of 0.68-1.68%/year (95% CI: 0.5-2.0) are elevated compared to healthy subjects and agree well with the atrophy rates of 1-3%/year reported for Alzheimers patients in the literature. Once comprehensively calibrated with a larger set of longitudinal images, our model has the potential to serve as a diagnostic and predictive tool to estimate future atrophy progression from clinical tau images on a personalized basis.",

    "abstract": "The properties of random Boolean networks as models of gene regulation have been investigated extensively by the statistical physics community. In the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the reconstruction and analysis of Boolean models of biological networks. In such models, neither network topology nor Boolean functions (or logical update rules) should be expected to be random. In this contribution, we focus on biologically meaningful types of Boolean functions, and perform a systematic study of their preponderance in gene regulatory networks. By applying the k[P] classification based on number of inputs k and bias P of functions, we find that most Boolean functions astonishingly have odd bias in a reference biological dataset of 2687 functions compiled from published models. Subsequently, we are able to explain this observation along with the enrichment of read-once functions (RoFs) and its subset, nested canalyzing functions (NCFs), in the reference dataset in terms of two complexity measures: Boolean complexity based on string lengths in formal logic which is yet unexplored in the biological context, and the average sensitivity. Minimizing the Boolean complexity naturally sifts out a subset of odd-biased Boolean functions which happen to be the RoFs. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that NCFs minimize not only the Boolean complexity, but also the average sensitivity in their k[P] set.",

    "abstract": "Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor that is both a drug of abuse and an FDA-approved anesthetic used off-label for treatment-resistant depression. Despite its growing clinical use for depression and pain, the relationships between the acute dissociative and affective effects of ketamine that contribute to its abuse liability and therapeutic potential, along with the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, are not well established. To address this need, we have implemented a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, within-subjects mechanistic trial. Healthy adult subjects undergo infusion with two fixed doses of subanesthetic racemic intravenous (IV) ketamine and placebo and their acute responses are assessed with self-report questionnaires, behavioral measures, hormone levels, and neuroimaging. As planned in our analysis strategy, we present interim results for the first 7 subjects of our study, focusing on dissociative and affective states and resting functional brain coupling signatures of these states. The first key finding was that ketamine induced dose-dependent increases in dissociation and related intoxication. Ketamine also altered affective states, reducing emotional insensitivity but increasing stress assessed by cortisol. Second, ketamine had an effect on altering brain connectivity, particularly for specific connections between regions of the reward and negative affect circuits and involving thalamic sub-regions. Third, regarding brain-response associations, ketamine-induced increases in amygdala-anteroventral thalamus coupling were correlated with greater dissociation and intoxication, whereas decreases in the coupling of the anteromedial thalamus and posterior parietal thalamus were correlated with increased sensory aspects of reward responsiveness. Additional specific correlations were observed between affective measures relevant to reward responsiveness or its absence and drug-altered changes in localized functional connections involving the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and thalamic sub-regions. We also discovered a consistent profile of negative associations between ketamine altered connectivity involving the NAcc and specific thalamic sub-regions and effects of anxiety. Further, drug-altered increases in the coupling of the amygdala and anteroventral thalamus were associated with increases in cortisol, an indicator of biochemical stress. The findings highlight the utility of integrating self-reports, objective measures, and functional neuroimaging to disentangle the brain states underlying specific acute responses induced by ketamine. With the likely continued expansion of FDA indications for ketamine, understanding acute responses and underlying neural mechanisms is important for maximizing the therapeutic potential of ketamine while minimizing the risk of promoting misuse or abuse of this substance.",

These effectors induce cell death on wheat cultivars carrying dominant susceptibility genes in an inverse gene-for-gene manner. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning these interactions and resulting cell death remain unclear. Here, we used a yeast-two-hybrid library approach to identify wheat proteins that interact with the necrotrophic effector ToxA. Using this strategy, we identified an interaction between ToxA and a wheat transmembrane NDR/HIN1-like protein (TaNHL10) and confirmed the interaction using in-planta co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy co-localization analysis. We showed that the C-terminus of TaNHL10 is extracellular whilst the N-terminus was localized in the cytoplasm. Further analyses using yeast-two-hybrid and confocal microscopy co-localization showed that ToxA interacts with the C-terminal LEA2 extracellular domain of TaNHL10. Random mutagenesis was then used to identify a ToxA mutant, ToxAN109D, which was unable to interact with TaNHL10 in yeast-two-hybrid assays. Subsequent heterologous expression and purification of ToxAN109D in Nicotiania benthamiana revealed that the mutated protein was unable to induce necrosis on Tsn1-dominant wheat cultivars confirming that the interaction of ToxA with TaNHL10 is required to induce cell death. Collectively, these data advance our understanding on how ToxA induces cell death during infection and further highlights the importance of host cell surface interactions in necrotrophic pathosystems.",

    "abstract": "Billions of years of evolution have produced only slight variations in the standard genetic code, and the number and identity of proteinogenic amino acids have remained mostly consistent throughout all three domains of life. These observations suggest a certain rigidity of the genetic code and prompt musings as to the origin and evolution of the code. Here we conducted an adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to push the limits of the code restriction, by evolving Escherichia coli to fully replace tryptophan, thought to be the latest addition to the genetic code, with the analog L-{beta}-(thieno[3,2-b]pyrrolyl)alanine ([3,2]Tpa). We identified an overshooting of the stress response system to be the main inhibiting factor for limiting ancestral growth upon exposure to {beta}-(thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole ([3,2]Tp), a metabolic precursor of [3,2]Tpa, and Trp limitation. During the ALE, E. coli was able to \"calm down\" its stress response machinery, thereby restoring growth. In particular, the inactivation of RpoS itself, the master regulon of the general stress response, was a key event during the adaptation. Knocking out the rpoS gene in the ancestral background independent of other changes conferred growth on [3,2]Tp. Our results add additional evidence that frozen regulatory constraints rather than a rigid protein translation apparatus are Lifes gatekeepers of the canonical amino acid repertoire. This information will not only enable us to design enhanced synthetic amino acid incorporation systems but may also shed light on a general biological mechanism trapping organismal configurations in a status quo.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe (apparent) rigidity of the genetic code, as well as its universality, have long since ushered explorations into expanding the code with synthetic, new-to-nature building blocks and testing its boundaries. While nowadays even proteome-wide incorporation of synthetic amino acids has been reported on several occasions1-3, little is known about the underlying mechanisms.\n\nWe here report ALE with auxotrophic E. coli that yielded successful proteome-wide replacement of Trp by its synthetic analog [3,2]Tpa accompanied with the selection for loss of RpoS4 function. Such laboratory domestication of bacteria by the acquisition of rpoS mitigation mutations is beneficial not only to overcome the stress of nutrient (Trp) starvation but also to evolve the paths to use environmental xenobiotics (e.g. [3,2]Tp) as essential nutrients for growth.\n\nWe pose that regulatory constraints rather than a rigid and conserved protein translation apparatus are Lifes gatekeepers of the canonical amino acid repertoire (at least where close structural analogs are concerned). Our findings contribute a step towards understanding possible environmental causes of genetic changes and their relationship to evolution.\n\nOur evolved strain affords a platform for homogenous protein labeling with [3,2]Tpa as well as for the production of biomolecules5, which are challenging to synthesize chemically. Top-down synthetic biology will also benefit greatly from breaking through the boundaries of the frozen bacterial genetic code, as this will enable us to begin creating synthetic cells capable to utilize an expanded range of substrates essential for life.",

    "abstract": "CAR T cell therapy has transformed clinical care and management of patients with certain hematological cancers. However, it remains unclear whether the success of CAR T cell therapy relies solely on CAR T cell engagement with tumor antigen, or if it also requires the stimulation of an individual patients endogenous T cell response. Here, we performed combined analysis of longitudinal, single cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing on glioblastoma tumors, peripheral blood (PB), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a patient with recurrent multifocal glioblastoma that underwent a remarkable response followed by recurrence on IL13RA2-targeted CAR T cell therapy (Brown et al. 2016). Single cell analysis of a tumor resected prior to CAR T cell therapy revealed the existence of an inflamed tumor microenvironment including a CD8+ cytotoxic, clonally expanded and antigen specific T cell population that disappeared in the recurrent setting. Longitudinal tracking of T cell receptors uncovered distinct T cell dynamics classes in the CSF during CAR T cell therapy. These included T cell clones with transient dynamics, representing intraventricular CAR T cell delivery and endogenous T cell recruitment from the PB into the CSF; and a group of T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, that tracked with clonally expanded tumor resident T cells and whose dynamics contracted concomitantly with tumor volume. Our results suggest the existence of an endogenous T cell population that was invigorated by intraventricular CAR T cell infusions, and combined with the therapy to produce a complete response.",

    "abstract": "Viruses infecting marine prokaryotes have large impacts on the diversity and dynamics of their hosts. Model systems suggest viral infection is frequency-dependent and constrained by the virus-host encounter rate. However, it is unclear whether the frequency-dependent infection is pervasive among the abundant prokaryotic populations with different growth strategies (i.e. r-strategy and K-strategy). To address this question, we performed a comparison of prokaryotic and viral communities using 16S rRNA amplicon and virome sequencing based on samples collected monthly for two years at a Japanese coastal site, Osaka Bay. Concurrent seasonal shifts observed in prokaryotic and viral community dynamics indicated that abundances of viruses correlated with that of their predicted host phyla (or classes). Co-occurrence network analysis between abundant prokaryotes and viruses revealed 6 423 co-occurring pairs, suggesting a tight coupling of host and viral abundances and their \"one to many\" correspondence. Although dominant K-strategist like species, such as SAR11, showed few co-occurring viruses, a fast succession of their viruses suggests viruses infecting these populations changed continuously. Our results suggest the frequency-dependent viral infection prevailed in coastal marine prokaryotes regardless of host taxa and growth strategy.",

GAC is a promising target for the development of GAS vaccines. In this study, employing chemical, compositional, and NMR methods, we show that GAC is attached to peptidoglycan via glucosamine 1-phosphate. This structural feature makes the GAC-peptidoglycan linkage highly sensitive to cleavage by nitrous acid and resistant to mild acid conditions. Using this characteristic of the GAS cell wall, we identify PplD as a protein required for deacetylation of linkage N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). X-ray structural analysis indicates that PplD performs catalysis via a modified acid/base mechanism. Genetic surveys in silico together with functional analysis indicate that PplD homologs deacetylate the polysaccharide linkage in many streptococcal species. We further demonstrate that introduction of positive charges to the cell wall by GlcNAc deacetylation protects GAS against host cationic antimicrobial proteins.",

    "abstract": "Spirochetal pathogens such as the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, encode an abundance of lipoproteins; however, due in part to their evolutionary distance from more well-studied bacteria such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, very few spirochetal lipoproteins have assigned functions. Indeed, B. burgdorferi devotes almost 8% of its genome to lipoprotein genes and interacts with its environment primarily through the production of at least eighty surface-exposed lipoproteins throughout its tick vector-vertebrate host lifecycle (57). Several B. burgdorferi lipoproteins have been shown to serve diverse roles, such as cellular adherence or immune evasion, but the functions for most B. burgdorferi surface lipoproteins remain unknown. In this study, we developed a B. burgdorferi lipoproteome screening platform utilizing intact spirochetes that enables the identification of previously unrecognized host interactions. As spirochetal survival in the bloodstream is essential for dissemination, we targeted our screen to C1, the first component of the classical (antibody-mediated) complement pathway. We identified two high-affinity C1 interactions by the paralogous lipoproteins, ErpB and ErpQ. Using biochemical, microbiological, and biophysical approaches, we demonstrated that ErpB and ErpQ inhibit the activated forms of the C1 proteases, C1r and C1s, and represent a new mechanistic class of C1 inhibitors that protect the spirochete from antibody-mediated complement killing by allosteric regulation. In addition to identifying a novel mode of complement inhibition, our study establishes a lipoproteome screening methodology as a discovery platform for identifying direct host-pathogen interactions that are central to the pathogenesis of spirochetes, such as the Lyme disease agent.\n\nSignificance StatementSpirochetal pathogens encode an abundance of lipoproteins that can provide a critical interface with the host environment. For example, Borrelia burgdorferi, the model species for spirochetal biology, must survive an enzootic life cycle defined by fluctuations between vector (tick) and vertebrate host. While B. burgdorferi expresses over eighty surface lipoproteins-- many of which likely contribute to host survival--the B. burgdorferi lipoproteome is poorly characterized. Here, we generated a platform to rapidly identify targets of B. burgdorferi surface lipoproteins and identified two orthologs that allosterically inhibit complement C1 subcomponents, conferring resistance to classical complement killing. This work expands our understanding of complement evasion mechanisms and points towards a discovery approach for identifying host-pathogen interactions that are central to spirochete pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms are key to sustaining core ecosystem processes across terrestrial Antarctica but they are rarely considered in conservation frameworks. Whilst greater advocacy has been made towards the inclusion of microbial data in this context, there is still a need for better tools to quantify multispecies responses to environmental change. Here, we extend the scope of Gradient Forest modelling beyond macroorganisms and small datasets to the comprehensive polar soil microbiome encompassing >17, 000 sequence variants for bacteria, micro-eukarya and archaea throughout the hyperarid Vestfold Hills of Eastern Antarctica. Quantification of microbial diversity against 79 physiochemical variables revealed that whilst rank-order importance differed, predictors were broadly consistent between domains, with greatest sharing occurring between bacteria and micro-eukarya. Moisture was identified as the most robust predictor for shaping the regional soil microbiome, with highest compositional turnover or \"splits\" occurring within the 10 - 12 % moisture content range. Often the most responsive taxa were rarer lineages of bacteria and micro-eukarya with phototrophic and nutrient-cycling capacities such as Cyanobacteria (up to 61.81 % predictive capacity), Chlorophyta (62.17 %) and Ochrophyta (57.81 %). These taxa groups are thus at greater risk of biodiversity loss or gain to projected climate trajectories, which will inevitably disturb current ecosystem dynamics. Better understanding of these threshold tipping points will positively aid conservation efforts across Eastern Antarctica. Furthermore, the successful implementation of an improved Gradient Forest model also presents an exciting opportunity to broaden its use on microbial systems globally.",

Ongoing remediation efforts using microbial and engineered PET hydrolyzing enzymes (PETases) are hindered by slow depolymerization activities. Here, we report the optimized reaction conditions that leveraged the PETase hydrolase activity 2 to 3.8-fold in the presence of high NaCl concentrations. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were applied to model salt-dependent conformational changes of the PETase enzyme bound to a 3-unit PET polymer. MDS demonstrated that PETase interaction with flanking polymer units exhibited a striking structural disparity at low and high salt concentrations. At low salt concentrations, flanking polymer units displayed significant bending. In contrast, flanking units extended at high salt concentrations, thus residues D206, H237, and S160 of the catalytic triad positioned in close vicinity of the scissile ester bond of the polymer substrate. The resulting high salt-specific enzyme/substrate geometry can potentially facilitate hydrolysis. We theorized that a salt-dependent conformational switch could attenuate the enzyme to a broad range of natural and artificial polymers consumed as carbon sources. Altogether, new knowledge may advance the engineering of PET hydrolase enzymes and benefit bioconversion programs.",

PCC 6803 open reading frame slr0201shows high sequence similarity to the C subunit of a group of unusual succinate dehydrogenases found in some archaeal species. Slr0201 was originally annotated as HdrB, the B subunit of heterodisulfide reductase, but appears to be SdhC instead. This protein was overexpressed in E. coli by cloning the PCR-derived slr0201 open reading frame into a pET16b-based expression vector. The overproduced Slr0201 accumulated predominantly in inclusion bodies with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa. The protein contained at least one [2Fe-2S] cluster based on UV-visible absorbance and CD spectra and EPR spectroscopy, in conjunction with stoichiometric analysis of protein-bound iron and sulfur content. Redox titration showed a midpoint potential (Em) of + 17 mV at pH 7.0, which is consistent with Slr0201 serving a role in transferring electrons between succinate and plastoquinone. Slr0201 was also overproduced in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by introducing an additional, His-tagged slr0201 into the Synechocystis genome replacing psbA3, creating the slr0201+-His overexpression strain. Immunoblot analysis shows that Slr0201 is membrane-associated in the wild type. However, in the Slr0201+-His strain, immunoreaction occurred in both the membrane and soluble fractions, possibly as a consequence of processing near the N-terminus. The results obtained with Slr0201 are discussed in the light of one of the cyanobacterial SdhB subunits, which shares redox commonalities with archaeal SdhB.",

Approaches based on CRISPR technology have been broadly adopted and there is growing interest in the generation of massively parallel edited cell libraries. Comparing the libraries generated by these varying approaches is challenging and researchers lack a common framework for defining and assessing the characteristics of these libraries. Here we describe a framework for evaluating massively parallel libraries of edited genomes based on established methods for sampling complex populations. We define specific attributes and metrics that are informative for describing a complex cell library and provide examples for estimating these values. We also connect this analysis to generic phenotyping approaches, using either pooled (typically via a selection assay) or isolate (often referred to as screening) phenotyping approaches. We approach this from the context of creating massively parallel, precisely edited libraries with one edit per cell, though the approach holds for other types of modifications, including libraries containing multiple edits per cell (combinatorial editing). This framework is a critical component for evaluating and comparing new technologies as well as understanding how a massively parallel edited cell library will perform in a given phenotyping approach.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG) is O-acetylated by bacteria to resist killing by host lysozyme. During PG turnover, however, deacetylation is a prerequisite for glycan strand hydrolysis by lytic transglycosylases. Ape1, a de-O-acetylase from Campylobacter jejuni, is a bi-modular protein composed of an SGNH hydrolase domain and a CBM35 domain. The conserved Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad in the SGNH hydrolase domain confers enzymatic activity. The PG binding mode and function of the CBM35 domain in de-O-acetylation remained unclear. In this paper, we present a 1.8 [A] resolution crystal structure of a complex between acetate and Ape1. An active site cleft is formed at the interface of the two domains and two large loops from the CBM35 domain form part of the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in these loops coupled with activity assays using p-nitrophenol acetate indicate the CBM35 loops are required for full catalytic efficiency. Molecular docking of a model O-acetylated hexasaccharide PG substrate to Ape1 using HADDOCK suggests the interaction is formed by the active cleft and the saccharide motif of PG. Together, we propose that the active cleft of Ape1 diverges from other SGNH hydrolase members by using the CBM35 loops to assist catalysis. The concave Ape1 active cleft may accommodate the long glycan strands for selecting PG substrates to regulate subsequent biological events.",

Using Nanopore Tweezers we observed the small, fast steps taken by single RecQ helicases as they step along and unwind DNA at ultrahigh spatiotemporal resolution. By directly measuring conformational substates of RecQ we determine the coupling between helicase domain motions and chemical reactions that together produce forward motion along the DNA. Application of assisting and opposing forces shows that RecQ has a highly asymmetric energy landscape that reduces its sensitivity to opposing mechanical forces that could be encountered in vivo by molecular roadblocks such as DNA bound proteins.

    "abstract": "BackgroundInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is established to drive pathological sequelae in organ systems outside the intestine, including the central nervous system (CNS). Many patients exhibit cognitive deficits, particularly during disease flare. The connection between colonic inflammation and neuroinflammation remains unclear and characterization of the neuroinflammatory phenotype in the brain during colitis is ill-defined.\n\nMethodsTransgenic mice expressing a bioluminescent reporter of active caspase-1 were treated with 2% Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) for 7 days to induce acute colitis, and colonic, systemic and neuroinflammation were assessed. In some experiments, mice were prophylactically treated with paquinimod (ABR-215757) to inhibit S100A9 inflammatory signaling. As a positive control for peripheral-induced neuroinflammation, mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colonic, systemic and brain inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured by cytokine bead array (CBA) and Proteome profiler mouse cytokine array. Bioluminescence was quantified in the brain and caspase activation was confirmed by immunoblot. Immune cell infiltration into the CNS was measured by flow cytometry, while light sheet microscopy was used to monitor changes in resident microglia localization in intact brains during DSS or LPS-induced neuroinflammation. RNA sequencing was performed to identify transcriptomic changes occurring in the CNS of DSS-treated mice. Expression of inflammatory biomarkers were quantified in the brain and serum by qRT-PCR, ELISA and WB.\n\nResultsDSS-treated mice exhibited clinical hallmarks of colitis, including weight loss, colonic shortening and inflammation in the colon. We also detected a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines in the serum and brain, as well as caspase and microglia activation in the brain of mice with ongoing colitis. RNA sequencing of brains isolated from DSS-treated mice revealed differential expression of genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This inflammatory phenotype was similar to the signature detected in LPS-treated mice, albeit less robust and transient, as inflammatory gene expression returned to baseline following cessation of DSS. Pharmacological inhibition of S100A9, one of the transcripts identified by RNA sequencing, attenuated colitis severity and systemic and neuroinflammation.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that local inflammation in the colon drives systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, and this can be ameliorated by inhibition of the S100 alarmin, S100A9.",

    "abstract": "The hospital-acquired pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii possesses a complex cell envelope that is key to its multidrug resistance and virulence. The bacterium, however, lacks many canonical enzymes that build the envelope in model organisms. Instead, A. baumannii contains a number of poorly annotated proteins that may allow alternative mechanisms of envelope biogenesis. We demonstrated previously that one of these unusual proteins, ElsL, is required for cell elongation and for withstanding antibiotics that attack the septal cell wall. Curiously, ElsL is composed of a leaderless YkuD-family domain usually found in secreted, cell-wall-modifying L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs). Here, we show that, rather than being an LDT, ElsL is actually a new class of cytoplasmic L,D-carboxypeptidase (LDC) that provides a critical step in cell-wall recycling previously thought to be missing from A. baumannii. Absence of ElsL impairs cell wall integrity, elongation, and intrinsic resistance due to buildup of murein tetrapeptide precursors, toxicity of which is bypassed by preventing muropeptide recycling. Multiple pathways in the cell become sites of vulnerability when ElsL is inactivated, including L,D-crosslink formation, cell division, and outer membrane lipid homoeostasis, reflecting its pleiotropic influence on cell envelope physiology. We thus reveal a novel class of cell-wall-recycling LDC critical to growth and homeostasis of A. baumannii and likely many other bacteria.\n\nImportanceTo grow efficiently, resist antibiotics, and control the immune response, bacteria recycle parts of their cell wall. A key step in the typical recycling pathway is the reuse of cell wall peptides by an enzyme known as an LDC. Acinetobacter baumannii, an \"urgent-threat\" pathogen causing drug-resistant sepsis in hospitals, was previously thought to lack this enzymatic activity due to absence of a known LDC homolog. Here, we show that A. baumannii possesses this activity in the form of an enzyme class not previously associated with cell wall recycling. Absence of this protein intoxicates and weakens the A. baumannii cell envelope in multiple ways due to the accumulation of dead-end intermediates. Several other organisms of importance to health and disease encode homologs of the A. baumannii enzyme. This work thus reveals an unappreciated mechanism of cell wall recycling, manipulation of which may contribute to enhanced treatments targeting the bacterial envelope.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear Factor 90 (NF90) is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein involved in a multitude of different cellular mechanisms such as transcription, translation, viral infection and mRNA stability. Recent data suggest that NF90 might influence the abundance of target mRNAs in the cytoplasm through miRNA- and Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-dependent activity. Here, we identified the interactome of NF90 in the cytoplasm, which revealed several components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and associated factors. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction of NF90 with the RISC-associated RNA helicase, Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), and other proteins involved in RISC-mediated silencing, including Ago2. Furthermore, NF90 association with MOV10 and Ago2 was found to be RNA-dependent. Glycerol gradient sedimentation of NF90 immune complexes indicates that these proteins occur in the same protein complex. At target RNAs predicted to bind both NF90 and MOV10 in their 3 UTRs, NF90 association was increased upon loss of MOV10 and vice versa, suggesting that the two proteins may compete for the binding of common target mRNAs. Interestingly, loss of NF90 led to an increase in association of Ago2 as well as a decrease in the abundance of the target mRNA. Similarly, during hypoxia, the binding of Ago2 to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA increased after loss of NF90, while the level of VEGF mRNA decreased. These findings suggest a role for NF90 in the regulation of RISC-mediated silencing which stabilizes target mRNAs, such as VEGF, during cancer-induced hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) plays important roles in wound healing. The activity of TGF-{beta} is initiated upon binding of the growth factor to extracellular domains of its receptors. We sought to facilitate activation by clustering these extracellular domains. To do so, we used a known peptide that binds to TGF-{beta} receptors without diminishing their affinity for TGF-{beta}. We conjugated this peptide to a collagen-mimetic peptide that can anneal to damaged collagen in a wound bed. We find that the conjugate enhances collagen deposition and wound closure in mice in a manner consistent with the clustering of TGF-{beta} receptors. This strategy provides a means to upregulate the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway without adding exogenous TGF-{beta} and could inspire means to treat severe wounds.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/461420v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a0c248org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@332b3forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c3533org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a8b75a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Disrupted proteome homeostasis (proteostasis) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been a major focus of research in the past two decades. Yet the exact processes that normally maintain proteostasis, but that are uniquely disturbed in motor neurons expressing diverse genetic mutations, remain to be established. Obtaining a better understanding of proteostasis disruption in association with different ALS-causing mutations will improve our understanding of ALS pathophysiology and may identify novel therapeutic targets and strategies for ALS patients. Here we describe the development and use of a novel high-content analysis (HCA) assay to investigate proteostasis disturbances caused by the expression of ALS-causing gene variants. This assay involves the use of conformationally-destabilised mutants of firefly luciferase (Fluc) to examine protein folding/re-folding capacity in NSC-34 cells expressing ALS-associated mutations in the genes encoding superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1A4V) and cyclin F (CCNFS621G). We demonstrate that these Fluc isoforms can be used in high-throughput format to report on reductions in the activity of the chaperone network that result from the expression of SOD1A4V, providing multiplexed information at single-cell resolution. In addition to SOD1A4V and CCNFS621G, NSC-34 models of ALS-associated TDP-43, FUS, UBQLN2, OPTN, VCP and VAPB mutants were generated that could be screened using this assay in future work. For ALS-associated mutant proteins that do cause reductions in protein quality control capacity, such as SOD1A4V, this assay has potential to be applied in drug screening studies to identify candidate compounds that can ameliorate this deficiency.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=163 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/461468v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3a6c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@697319org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1038930org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@123eb5b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIDestabilised firefly luciferase (Fluc) mutants can be used in high-content analysis (HCA) assay format\nC_LIO_LIFluc HCA assay enables information-rich reporting on chaperone network activity in cell models of ALS\nC_LIO_LIExpression of SOD1A4V reduces chaperone network activity in NSC-34 cells\nC_LI",

Sliding clamps are opened and installed onto DNA by clamp loader AAA+ ATPase complexes. However, how a clamp loader opens and closes the sliding clamp around DNA is still unknown. Here, we describe structures of the S. cerevisiae clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) bound to its cognate sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) en route to successful loading. RFC first binds to PCNA in a dynamic, closed conformation that blocks both ATPase activity and DNA binding. RFC then opens the PCNA ring through a large-scale  crab-claw expansion of both RFC and PCNA that explains how RFC prefers initial binding of PCNA over DNA. Next, the open RFC:PCNA complex binds DNA and interrogates the primer-template junction using a surprising base-flipping mechanism. Our structures indicate that initial PCNA opening and subsequent closure around DNA do not require ATP hydrolysis, but are driven by binding energy. ATP hydrolysis, which is necessary for RFC release, is triggered by interactions with both PCNA and DNA, explaining RFCs switch-like ATPase activity. Our work reveals how a AAA+ machine undergoes dramatic conformational changes for achieving binding preference and substrate remodeling.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellum is a complex, self-assembling macromolecular machine that powers bacterial motility. It plays diverse roles in bacterial virulence, including aiding in colonization and dissemination during infection. The flagellum consists of a filamentous structure protruding from the cell, and the basal body, a large assembly that spans the cell envelope. The basal body is comprised of over 10 different proteins, forming several concentric ring structures, termed the M- S- L- P- and C-rings, respectively. In particular, the MS rings are formed by a single protein FliF, which consists of two trans-membrane helices anchoring it to the inner membrane and surrounding a large periplasmic domain. Assembly of the MS ring, through oligomerization of FliF, is one of the first steps of basal body assembly.\n\nPrevious computational analysis had shown that the periplasmic region of FliF consists of three structurally similar domains, termed Ring-Building Motif (RBM)1, RBM2 and RBM3. The structure of the MS-ring has been reported recently, and unexpectedly shown that these three domains adopt different symmetries, with RBM3 having a 34-mer stoichiometry, while RBM2 adopts two distinct positions in the complex, including a 23-mer ring. This observation raises some important question on the assembly of the MS ring, and the formation of this symmetry mis-match within a single protein. In this study, we analyze the oligomerization of the individual RBM domains in isolation, in the Salmonella typhimurium FliF orthologue. We demonstrate that the periplasmic domain of FliF assembles into the MS ring, in the absence of the trans-membrane helices. We also report that the RBM2 and RBM3 domains oligomerize into ring structures, but not RBM1. Intriguingly, we observe that a construct encompassing RBM1 and RBM2 is monomeric, suggesting that RBM1 interacts with RBM2, and inhibits its oligomerization. However, this inhibition is lifted by the addition of RBM3. Collectively, this data suggests a mechanism for the controlled assembly of the MS ring.",

    "abstract": "The lack of detailed insight into the structure of aggregates formed by the huntingtin protein has hampered efforts to develop therapeutics and diagnostics targeting pathology formation in the brain of patients with Huntingtons disease. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the structural properties of in vitro generated fibrils from exon1 of the huntingtin protein by electron cryo-microscopy and single-particle analysis. We show that wildtype and mutant exon1 of the huntingtin protein form non-helical fibrils with a polygultamine amyloid core composed of {beta}-hairpins with unique characteristics that have not been previously observed with other amyloid filaments. The stacks of {beta}-hairpins form long planar {beta}- sheets (protofilaments) with variable stacking angle and occasional out-of-register state of individual {beta}-hairpins. These features and the propensity of protofilament to undergo lateral association results in a high degree of fibril polymorphism, including fibrils composed of varying numbers of protofilaments. Our results also represent the first direct observation of how the flanking domains are organized around the polyglutamine core of the fibril and provide insight into how they might affect huntingtin fibril structure, polymorphism, and stacking of {beta}-hairpins within its core structure. Removal of the first 17 amino acids at the N-terminus resulted in surprising intra-fibril structural heterogeneity and reduced fibrils propensity to lateral associations. Overall, this work provides valuable insights that could guide future mechanistic studies to elucidate the sequence and structural determinants of huntingtin aggregation, as well as cryo-EM and structural studies of fibrils derived from huntingtin proteins and other disease-associated polyglutamine-containing proteins.",

    "abstract": "Understanding regulation of MAPT splicing is important to the etiology of many nerurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), in which different tau isoforms accumulate in pathologic inclusions. MAPT, the gene encoding the tau protein, undergoes complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing to generate six isoforms. Tauopathies can be categorized by the presence of tau aggregates containing either 3 (3R) or 4 (4R) microtubule binding domain repeats (determined by inclusion/exclusion of exon 10), but the role of the N terminal domain of the protein, determined by inclusion/exclusion of exons 2 and 3 has been less well studied. Using an unbiased correlational screen in human brain tissue, we observed coordination of MAPT exons 2 and 10 splicing. Expression of exon 2 splicing regulators and subsequently exon 2 inclusion are differentially disrupted in PSP and AD brain, resulting in the accumulation of 1N4R isoforms in PSP and 0N isoforms in AD temporal cortex. Furthermore, we identified different N-terminal isoforms of tau present in neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites and tufted astrocytes, indicating a role for differential N-terminal splicing in the development of disparate tau neuropathologies. We conclude that N-terminal splicing and combinatorial regulation with exon 10 inclusion/exclusion is likely to be important to our understanding of tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "Invertebrate axons and small caliber axons in mammalian peripheral nerves are unmyelinated but still ensheathed by glia. How this type of ensheathment is controlled and its roles in supporting neuronal function remain unclear. Here we use Drosophila wrapping glia, which ensheathe peripheral axons to study the function and development of non-myelinating ensheathment. We developed a new SplitGal4 intersectional driver to target wrapping glia for genetic ablation and found that loss of wrapping glia severely impaired larval locomotor behavior. We performed an in vivo RNAi screen in Drosophila to identify glial genes required for axon ensheathment during development and identified the conserved receptor tyrosine kinase Discoidin domain receptor (Ddr). In larval peripheral nerves, loss of Ddr resulted in severely reduced ensheathment of axons. We found a strong dominant genetic interaction between Ddr and the fly type XV/XVIII collagen Multiplexin (Mp), suggesting Ddr functions a collagen receptor to drive wrapping of axons during development. Surprisingly, despite severe impairment of ensheathment, the residual wrapping in Ddr mutants was sufficient to support basic circuit function during larval stages. In adult nerves, loss of Ddr from glia decreased long-term survival of sensory neurons and significantly reduced axon caliber in an identifiable neuron without overtly affecting ensheathment. Our data establish a crucial role for non-myelinating glia in peripheral nerve development and function across the lifespan, and identify Ddr as a key regulator of axon-glia interactions during ensheathment and nerve growth.",

    "abstract": "Satellite glia are the major glial cells in sympathetic ganglia, enveloping neuronal cell bodies. Despite this intimate association, how satellite glia contribute to sympathetic functions remain unclear. Here, we show that satellite glia are critical for metabolism, survival, and activity of sympathetic neurons and modulate autonomic behaviors in mice. Adult ablation of satellite glia results in impaired mTOR signaling, soma atrophy, reduced noradrenergic enzymes, and loss of sympathetic neurons. However, persisting neurons have elevated activity, and satellite glia-ablated mice show increased pupil dilation and heart rate, indicative of enhanced sympathetic tone. Satellite glia-specific deletion of Kir4.1, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, largely recapitulates the cellular defects observed in glia-ablated mice, suggesting that satellite glia act in part via extracellular K+ buffering. These findings highlight neuron-satellite glia as functional units in regulating sympathetic output, with implications for disorders linked to sympathetic hyper-activity such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension.",

Here, we demonstrate that tobramycin increases the abundance of two 5' tRNA-fMet halves in outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) secreted by P. aeruginosa and that the 5' tRNA-fMet halves reduce IL-8 secretion by CF bronchial epithelial cells (CF-HBECs). In mouse lung, the 5' tRNA-fMet halves attenuate KC secretion and neutrophil recruitment. We also report that the 5' tRNA-fMet halves suppress pro-inflammatory network gene expression by an Argonaut 2 (AGO2)-mediated gene silencing mechanism, thereby reducing IL-8 secretion in CF-HBECs. Moreover, tobramycin reduces the IL-8 concentration and neutrophil content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pwCF. Thus, we conclude that tobramycin improves lung function in part by reducing chronic inflammation and neutrophil-mediated lung damage in pwCF.",

Treatment with memantine and vitamin D can protect cortical axons from exposure to amyloid-{beta} and glutamate toxicity, suggesting this combination may mitigate altered gait in AD.\n\nObjectiveInvestigate the effects of vitamin D deprivation and subsequent treatment with memantine and vitamin D enrichment on gait performance in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.\n\nMethodsMale APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were split into four groups (n=14 each) at 2.5 months of age. A control group was fed a standard diet throughout while the other three groups started a vitamin D-deficient diet at month 6. The VitD- group remained on this deficient diet for the rest of the study. At month 9, the remaining two groups began treatment with either memantine alone or memantine combined with 10 IU/g of vitamin D. Gait performance was assessed at months 6, 9, 12, and 15.\n\nResultsVitamin D deprivation led to a 13% increase in hind stride width by month 15 (p<0.001). Examination of the treatment groups at month 15 revealed that mice treated with memantine alone still showed an increase in hind stride width compared to controls (p<0.01), while mice treated with memantine and vitamin D did not (p=0.21).\n\nConclusionVitamin D deprivation led to impaired postural control in the APPswe/PS1dE9 model. Treatment with memantine and vitamin D, but not memantine alone, prevented this impairment. Future work should explore the potential for treatments incorporating vitamin D supplementation to improve gait in people with AD.",

    "abstract": "Biological processes are highly dynamic and are regulated by genes that connect with one and another, forming regulatory circuits and networks. Understanding how gene regulatory circuits operate dynamically requires monitoring the expression of multiple genes in the same cell. However, it is limited by the relatively few distinguishable fluorescent proteins. Here, we developed a multiplexed real-time transcriptional imaging method based on two RNA stem-loop binding proteins, and employed it to analyze the temporal dynamics of synthetic gene circuits. By incorporating different ratios of MS2 and PP7 stem-loops, we were able to monitor the real-time nascent transcriptional activities of up to five genes in the same cell using only two fluorescent proteins. Applying this multiplexing capability to synthetic linear or branched gene regulatory cascades revealed that propagation of transcriptional dynamics is enhanced by non-stationary dynamics and is dictated by the slowest regulatory branch in the presence of combinatorial regulation. Mathematical modeling provided further insight into temporal multi-gene interactions and helped to understand potential challenges in regulatory inference using snapshot single-cell data. Ratiometric multiplexing should scale exponentially with additional labelling channels, providing a way to track the dynamics of larger circuits.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial persisters are non-growing cells that are highly tolerant to bactericidal antibiotics. However, this tolerance is reversible and not mediated by heritable genetic changes. Lon, an ATP-dependent protease, has repeatedly been shown to play a critical role in fluoroquinolone persistence. Although lon deletion ({Delta}lon) is thought to kill persister cells via accumulation of the cell division inhibitor protein SulA, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be elucidated. Here, we show that Lon is an important regulatory protein for the resuscitation of the fluoroquinolone persisters in Escherichia coli, and lon deletion impairs the ability of persister cells to form colonies during recovery, without killing these cells, through a sulA- and ftsZ-dependent mechanism. Notably, this observed non-culturable state of antibiotic-tolerant {Delta}lon cells is transient, as environmental conditions, such as starvation, can restore their culturability. Our data further indicate that starvation-induced SulA degradation or expression of Lon during recovery facilitates Z-ring formation in {Delta}lon persisters. Calculating the ratio of the cell length (L in {micro}m) to the number of Z-rings (Z) for each ofloxacin-treated intact cell analyzed has revealed a strong correlation between persister resuscitation and calculated L/Z values, which represents a potential biomarker for {Delta}lon persisters that are transitioning to the normal cell state under the conditions studied here.",

    "abstract": "The second and third waves of COVID-19 pandemic have largely been driven by the surge of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). These VOC have rapidly spread through multiple geographies being enabled by high transmission rates and/or high viral load compared to the original parent strain. Consequently, the altered phenotypes of these VOC have posed greater challenges to diagnostic and clinical management of COVID-19. Despite considerable progress being made on vaccine roll out, practicing proper hand hygiene has been advocated as a consistent precautionary intervention as more virulent VOC continue to emerge and spread across geographies.\n\nTwo variants of concern, namely beta and delta, have recently been shown to escape antibody-mediated neutralization by virtue of acquired mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein which binds to the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In this report we have empirically determined the efficacy of a range of personal care formulations in inactivating the beta and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. High titres of these variants were exposed to marketed personal care formulations from Unilever under standard in-vitro suspension test-based conditions relevant to end-user habits. All the formulations demonstrated greater than 99.9% reduction in viral infective titres. The rate of inactivation by these products were comparable to that of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus tested under the same conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that well-designed personal care formulations when tested under consumer-centric conditions, and with proven efficacy against the parent strain of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be effective against extant and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. This is through their broad-spectrum mode of action (disruption of lipid bilayer of the host-derived viral envelope, denaturation of envelop and nucleocapsid proteins, and disruption of genome) which is independent of the escape mutations that facilitate immune evasion or enhanced transmissibility.",

Reaching them need to understand the nature of gene action and quantifying the heterosis and inbreeding depression.

Beside the water treatment and genotype effects, the genetic effects of general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability and their interactions with water treatment were significant for all traits. Water deficit stress decreased all traits in both F1 and F2 generations except for essential oil content which were significantly increased due to water deficit stress. Under water deficit stress, a non-additive gene action nature was predominant in F1 generation while an additive gene action nature was more important in F2 generation for all the traits except fruit yield under severe water deficit stress. There was a positive high heterosis for the traits examined in some hybrids. Also, in F2 generation even after inbreeding depression, some promising populations displayed appropriate mean performance. These show that the parents used for crossing had rich gene pool for studied traits.

For instance, such measures can reliably distinguish healthy awake from asleep subjects and vegetative state patients. However, this line of research has never explored the dynamics of conscious level during normal wakefulness. Being able to capture meaningful differences in conscious level during wakefulness may provide a vital new insight into the nature of consciousness, by demonstrating what biological, behavioural and cognitive factors relate to such differences. Here we take advantage of a large MEG and fMRI dataset of healthy adults, to examine within-subject conscious level fluctuations during resting state and tasks, by using a range of complexity measures. We first establish the validity of this approach in both neuroimaging domains by relating neural complexity measures to pre-existing techniques for capturing transitions of consciousness from full wakefulness into drowsiness and the earliest stages of sleep, finding decreased complexity as participants become increasingly drowsy. We further demonstrate that neural complexity measures in both MEG and fMRI change both within and between tasks, and relate to performance on an executive task, with higher complexity associated with better performance and faster reaction times. This approach provides a powerful new route to further explore the cognitive and neural underpinnings of consciousness.",

Leveraging this hypothesis, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have assisted in both the interpretation and discovery of additional genes associated with complex traits. However, existing methods for conducting TWAS do not take full advantage of the intra-individual correlation inherently present in multi-context expression studies and do not properly adjust for multiple testing across contexts. We developed CONTENT-- a computationally efficient method with proper cross-context false discovery correction that leverages correlation structure across contexts to improve power and generate context-specific and context-shared components of expression. We applied CONTENT to bulk multi-tissue and single-cell RNA-seq data sets and show that CONTENT leads to a 42% (bulk) and 110% (single cell) increase in the number of genetically predicted genes relative to previous approaches. Interestingly, we find the context-specific component of expression comprises 30% of heritability in tissue-level bulk data and 75% in single-cell data, consistent with cell type heterogeneity in bulk tissue. In the context of TWAS, CONTENT increased the number of gene-phenotype associations discovered by over 47% relative to previous methods across 22 complex traits.",

    "abstract": "The genomic drivers of immune exclusion in colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) remain poorly understood. Chromosomal instability (CIN), resulting in aneuploidy and genomic rearrangements, is the central pathway of mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer pathogenesis; however, it is unknown whether CIN impacts the outcomes of patients with limited spread of CRCLM treated with curative intent cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery. Herein, we examined the relationship between CIN and the molecular subtypes of CRCLM, immune signaling, treatment sensitivity, and patient outcomes in three independent CRCLM patient cohorts. We established that a previously developed 70-gene CIN signature (CIN70) is a reliable measure of CIN, encompassing features of both aneuploidy and cellular proliferation. We demonstrated that tumors with the canonical subtype of CRCLM exhibit elevated levels of CIN and aneuploidy. Genomically unstable tumors were associated with an immune-depleted tumor microenvironment, and patients with genomically unstable tumors were at increased risk for disease progression in adverse metastatic sites, resulting in poor progression-free and overall survival. However, high-CIN tumors were particularly susceptible to DNA-damaging chemotherapies, including topoisomerase inhibitors, as well as radiation therapy. Treatment with genotoxic agents depleted CIN-rich cell populations, which resulted in a concomitant increase in intratumoral CD8+ T-cells in patients with primary rectal, breast, and bladder cancer. Taken together, we propose a mechanistic explanation for why cytotoxic chemotherapy can augment anti-tumor immunity and improve outcomes in patients with genomically unstable cancers.",
