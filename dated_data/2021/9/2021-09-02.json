    "abstract": "Recent lineage tracing analyses revealed multipotent progenitors (MPP) to be major functional contributors to steady-state hematopoiesis (1-6). However, we are still lacking a precise resolution of myeloid differentiation trajectories and cellular heterogeneity in MPPs. Here, we found that myeloid-biased MPP3 (2, 3) are functionally and molecularly heterogeneous, with a distinct subset of myeloid-primed secretory cells with high endoplasmic reticulum (ER) volume and Fc{gamma}R expression. We show that Fc{gamma}R+/ERhigh MPP3 are a transitional population for rapid production of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP), which directly amplify myelopoiesis through inflammation-triggered secretion of cytokines in the local bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Our results identify a novel regulatory function for a subset of secretory MPP3 that controls myeloid differentiation through lineage-priming and cytokine production, and act as a self-reinforcing amplification compartment in stress and disease conditions.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA secretory subset of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors augment myelopoiesis in stress and diseases conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plants form commensal associations with soil microorganisms, creating a root microbiome that provides benefits to the host including protection against pathogens. While bacteria can inhibit pathogens through production of antimicrobial compounds in vitro, it is largely unknown how microbiota contribute to pathogen protection in planta. We developed a gnotobiotic model system consisting of Arabidopsis thaliana, and an opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas sp. N2C3, to identify mechanisms that determine the outcome of plant-pathogen-microbiome interactions in the rhizosphere. We screened 25 phylogenetically diverse Pseudomonas strains for their ability to protect against N2C3 and found that commensal strains closely related to N2C3 were more likely to protect against pathogenesis. We used a comparative genomics approach to identify unique genes in the protective strains that revealed no genes that correlate with protection, suggesting that variable regulation of components of the core Pseudomonas genome may contribute to pathogen protection. We found that commensal colonization level was highly predictive of protection and so tested deletions in genes previously shown to be required for Arabidopsis rhizosphere colonization. We identified a response regulator colR that is required for Pseudomonas protection from N2C3 and fitness in competition with N2C3 indicating that competitive exclusion may contribute to pathogen protection. We found that Pseudomonas WCS365 also protects against the agricultural pathogen Pseudomonas fuscovaginae SE-1, the causal agent of bacterial sheath brown rot of rice. This work establishes a gnotobiotic model to uncover mechanisms by which members of the microbiome can protect hosts from pathogens and informs our understanding of the use of beneficial strains for microbiome engineering in dysbiotic soil systems.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold represent a transformative advance for predicting protein structure. They are able to make very high-quality predictions given a high-quality alignment of the protein sequence with related proteins. These predictions are now readily available via the AlphaFold database of predicted structures and AlphaFold/RoseTTAfold Colaboratory notebooks for custom predictions. However, predictions for some species tend to be lower confidence than model organisms. This includes Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum: important unicellular eukaryotic human parasites in an early-branching eukaryotic lineage. The cause appears to be due to poor sampling of this branch of life in the protein sequences databases used for the AlphaFold database and ColabFold. Here, by comprehensively gathering openly available protein sequence data for species from this lineage, significant improvements to AlphaFold2 protein structure prediction over the AlphaFold database and ColabFold are demonstrated. This is made available as an easy-to-use tool for the parasitology community in the form of Colaboratory notebooks for generating multiple sequence alignments and AlphaFold2 predictions of protein structure for Trypanosoma, Leishmania and related species.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of bacterial populations during infections can be influenced by various factors including available nutrients, the immune system, and competing microbes, rendering it difficult to identify the specific forces that select on evolved traits. The genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the airway of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), for example, have revealed commonly mutated genes, but which phenotypes led to their prevalence is often uncertain. Here, we focus on effects of nutritional components of the CF airway on genetic adaptations by P. aeruginosa grown in either well-mixed (planktonic) or biofilm-associated conditions. After only 80 generations of experimental evolution in a simple medium with glucose, lactate, and amino acids, all planktonic populations diversified into lineages with mutated genes common to CF infections: morA, encoding a regulator of biofilm formation, or lasR, encoding a quorum sensing regulator that modulates the expression of virulence factors. Although mutated quorum sensing is often thought to be selected in vivo due to altered virulence phenotypes or social cheating, isolates with lasR mutations demonstrated increased fitness when grown alone and outcompeted the ancestral PA14 strain. Nonsynonymous SNPs in morA increased fitness in a nutrient concentration-dependent manner during planktonic growth and surprisingly also increased biofilm production. Populations propagated in biofilm conditions also acquired mutations in loci associated with chronic infections, including lasR and cyclic-di-GMP regulators roeA and wspF. These findings demonstrate that nutrient conditions and biofilm selection are alone sufficient to select mutants with problematic clinical phenotypes including increased biofilm and altered quorum sensing.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa produces dangerous chronic infections that are known for their rapid diversification and recalcitrance to treatment. We performed evolution experiments to identify adaptations selected by two specific aspects of the CF respiratory environment: nutrient levels and surface attachment. Propagation of P. aeruginosa in nutrients present within the CF airway was alone sufficient to drive diversification into subpopulations with identical mutations in regulators of biofilm and quorum sensing to those arising during infection. Thus, the adaptation of opportunistic pathogens to nutrients found in the host may select mutants with phenotypes that complicate treatment and clearance of infection.",

LOEO and thymol showed antibacterial activity from 904 g/mL and 200 g/mL, respectively. {gamma}-Terpinene did not show activity any concentration tested. LOEO showed hemolysis at concentration of 3000 g/mL and thymol at 100 g/mL. LOEO and thymol showed cytotoxicity in the evaluated cell lines at 250 g/mL and 100 g/mL, respectively. These compounds have a moderate cytotoxicity so its considered necessary to study alternatives to reduce the in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/458771v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12a1b81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@173b4cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16306a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@49fa26_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ability of Candida albicans, an important human fungal pathogen, to develop filamentous forms is a crucial determinant for host invasion and virulence. Filamentation is triggered by different host environmental cues. Hypoxia, the dominant conditions that C. albicans encounters inside the human host, promote filamentation, however, the contributing mechanisms remain poorly characterized.\n\nMethodsWe performed a quantitative analysis of gene deletion mutants from different collections of protein kinases and transcriptional regulators in C. albicans to identify specific modulators of the hypoxic filamentation. We used genome-wide transcriptional profiling (Microarrays) and promoter occupancy (ChIP-chip) to characterize regulons of two transcription factors that were associated with the hypoxic filamentation. Genetic interactions were also used to assess functional relationships among the newly identified modulators of hypoxic filamentation and the well-known C. albicans core morphogenetic regulators.\n\nResultsOur genetic screen uncovered two transcription factors, Ahr1 and Tye7, that act as prominent regulators of C. albicans filamentation specifically under hypoxia. Both ahr1 and tye7 mutants exhibited a hyperfilamentous phenotype specifically under an oxygen-depleted environment suggesting that these transcription factors act as negative regulators of hypoxic filamentation. By combining microarray and ChIP-chip data, we have characterized the set of genes that are directly modulated by Ahr1 and Tye7. We found that both Ahr1 and Tye7 modulate a different set of genes and biological processes. Our genetic epistasis analysis supports our genomic finding and suggests that Ahr1 and Tye7 act independently to modulate hyphal growth in response to hypoxia. Furthermore, our genetic interaction experiments uncovered that Ahr1 and Tye7 repress the hypoxic filamentation growth via the Efg1 and Ras1/Cyr1 pathways, respectively.\n\nConclusionIn sum, this investigation represents an informative resource toward the understanding of how hypoxia, the predominant condition inside the host, shapes the invasive filamentous growth of C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "Facing the abundance and diversity of phages, bacteria have developed multiple anti-phage mechanisms. In the past three years, the number of known anti-phage mechanisms has been expanded by at least 5-fold rendering our view of prokaryotic immunity obsolete. Most anti-phage systems have been studied as standalone mechanisms, however many examples demonstrate strains encode not one but several anti-viral mechanisms. How these different systems integrate into an anti-viral arsenal at the strain level remains to be elucidated. Much could be learned from establishing fundamental description of features such as the number and diversity of anti-phage systems encoded in a given genome. To address this question, we developed DefenseFinder, a tool that automatically detects known anti-phage systems in prokaryotic genomes. We applied DefenseFinder to >20 000 fully sequenced genomes, generating a systematic and quantitative view of the anti-viral arsenal of prokaryotes. We show prokaryotic genomes encode on average five anti-phage systems from three different families of systems. This number varies drastically from one strain to another and is influenced by the genome size and the number of prophages encoded. Distributions of different systems are also very heterogenous with some systems being enriched in prophages and in specific clades. Finally, we provide a detailed comparison of the anti-viral arsenal of 15 common bacterial species, revealing drastic differences in anti-viral strategies. Overall, our work provides a free and open-source software, available as a command line tool or, on a webserver. It allows the rapid detection of anti-phage systems, enables a comprehensive description of the anti-viral arsenal of prokaryotes and paves the way for large scale genomics study in the field of anti-phage defense.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mandates a better understanding of cross-protection between variants after vaccination or infection, but studies directly evaluating such cross-protection are lacking. Here we report that immunization with different variant spikes elicits distinct neutralizing kinetics and magnitudes against other SARS-CoV-2 variants. After immunizing hamsters with wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 bearing variant spikes from Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Epsilon, the animals developed faster and greater neutralization activities against homologous SARS-CoV-2 variants than heterologous variants, including Delta. The rank of neutralizing titers against different heterologous variants varied, depending on the immunized variant spikes. The differences in neutralizing titers between homologous and heterologous variants were as large as 62-, 15-, and 9.7-fold at days 14, 28, and 45 post-immunization, respectively. Nevertheless, all immunized hamsters were protected from challenges with all SARS-CoV-2 variants, including those exhibiting the lowest neutralizing antibody titers.

    "abstract": "In many organisms, sensory abilities develop and evolve according to the changing demands of navigating, foraging and communication across different environments and life stages. Teleost fish inhabit heterogeneous light environments and exhibit a large diversity in visual system properties among species. Cichlids are a classic example of this diversity, generated by different tuning mechanisms that involve both genetic factors and phenotypic plasticity. Here, we document the developmental progression of visual pigment gene expression in Lake Victoria cichlids and test if these patterns are influenced by variation in light conditions. We reared two sister species of Pundamilia to adulthood in two distinct visual conditions that resemble the two light environments that they naturally inhabit in Lake Victoria. We also included interspecific first-generation hybrids. We then quantified (using RT-qPCR) the expression of the four Pundamilia opsins (SWS2B, SWS2A, RH2A and LWS) at 14 time points. We find that opsin expression profiles progress from shorter-wavelength sensitive opsins to longer-wavelength sensitive opsins with increasing age, in both species and their hybrids. The developmental trajectories of opsin expression also responded plastically to the visual conditions. Finally, we found subtle differences between reciprocal hybrids, possibly indicating parental effects and warranting further investigation. Developmental and environmental plasticity in opsin expression may provide an important stepping stone in the evolution of cichlid visual system diversity.\n\nResearch highlightsIn Lake Victoria cichlid fish, expression levels of opsin genes (encoding visual pigments) differ between developmental stages and between experimental light treatments. This plasticity may contribute to the evolution of cichlid visual system diversity.",

    "abstract": "Nucleomoprhs are remnants of secondary endosymbiotic events between two eukaryote cells wherein the endosymbiont has retained its eukaryotic nucleus. Nucleomorphs have evolved at least twice independently, in chlorarachniophytes and cryptophytes, yet they have converged on a remarkably similar genomic architecture, characterized by the most extreme compression and miniaturization among all known eukaryotic genomes. Previous computational studies have suggested that nucleomorph chromatin likely exhibits a number of divergent features. In this work, we provide the first maps of open chromatin, active transcription, and three-dimensional organization for the nucleomorph genome of the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans. We find that the B. natans nucleomorph genome exists in a highly accessible state, akin to that of ribosomal DNA in some other eukaryotes, and that it is highly transcribed over its entire length, with few signs of polymerase pausing at transcription start sites (TSSs). At the same time, most nucleomorph TSSs show very strong nucleosome positioning. Chromosome conformation (Hi-C) maps reveal that nucleomorph chromosomes interact with one other at their telomeric regions, and show the relative contact frequencies between the multiple genomic compartments of distinct origin that B. natans cells contain.",

In this study, we assess structural and biochemical aspects of viral fitness for these two variants using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), ACE2-binding and antibody neutralization analyses. Both variants demonstrate escape of antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain, an important immune hotspot for neutralizing epitopes. Compared to wild-type and Kappa lineages, Delta variant spike proteins show modest increase in ACE2 affinity, likely due to enhanced electrostatic complementarity at the RBD-ACE2 interface, which we characterize by cryo-EM. Unexpectedly, Kappa variant spike trimers form a novel head-to-head dimer-of-trimers assembly, which we demonstrate is a result of the E484Q mutation. The combination of increased antibody escape and enhanced ACE2 binding provides an explanation, in part, for the rapid global dominance of the Delta variant.",

Therefore, it is necessary to determine the content of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin in juvenile tress to accelerate forest breeding programs. The aim of this study was to identify chemical differences between apical and basal stem of Capirona and Bolaina to develop models for estimating the chemical composition using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. FTIR-ATR spectra were obtained from 150 samples for each specie that were 1.8 year-old. The results showed significant differences between the apical and basal stem for each species in terms of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin content. This variability was useful to build partial least squares (PLS) models from the FTIR spectra and they were evaluated by root mean squared error of predictions (RMSEP) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Lignin content was efficiently predicted in Capirona (RMSEP = 0.48, RPD > 2) and Bolaina (RMSEP = 0.81, RPD > 2). In Capirona, the predictive power of cellulose, hemicellulose and holocellulose models (0.68 < RMSEP < 2.06, 1.60 < RPD < 1.96) were high enough to predict wood chemical composition. In Bolaina, model for cellulose attained an excellent predictive power (RMSEP = 1.82, RPD = 6.14) while models for hemicellulose and holocellulose attained a good predictive power (RPD > 2.0). This study showed that FTIR-ATR together with PLS is a reliable method to determine the wood chemical composition in juvenile trees of Capirona and Bolaina.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) represent important gene therapy vectors with several approved clinical applications and numerous more in clinical trials. Genome packaging is an essential step in the bioprocessing of AAVs and needs to be tightly monitored to ensure the proper delivery of transgenes and the production of effective drugs. Current methods to monitor genome packaging have limited sensitivity, a high demand on labour, and struggle to distinguish between packaging of the intended genome or unwanted side-products. Here we show that Orbitrap based charge detection mass spectrometry allows the ultra-sensitive quantification of all these different AAV bioprocessing products. A protocol is presented that allows the quantification of genome packed AAV preparations in under half an hour, requiring only micro-liter quantities of typical AAV preparations with ~1013 viral genome copies per millilitre. The method quickly assesses the integrity and amount of genome packed AAV particles to support AAV bioprocessing and characterization of this rapidly emerging class of advanced drug therapies.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that the intrinsic property of nucleosome arrays to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro is responsible for chromatin domain organization in vivo. However, understanding nucleosomal LLPS has been hindered by the challenge to characterize the structure of resulting heterogeneous condensates. We used cryo-electron tomography and deep learning-based 3D reconstruction/segmentation to determine the molecular organization of condensates at various stages of LLPS. We show that nucleosomal LLPS involves a two-step process: a spinodal decomposition process yielding irregular condensates, followed by their unfavorable conversion into more compact, spherical nuclei that grow into larger spherical aggregates through accretion of spinodal material or by fusion with other spherical condensates. Histone H1 catalyzes more than 10-fold the spinodal-to-spherical conversion. We propose that this transition involves exposure of nucleosome hydrophobic surfaces resulting in modified inter-nucleosome interactions. These results suggest a physical mechanism by which chromatin may transition from interphase to metaphase structures.",

    "abstract": "Super resolution techniques are an excellent alternative to wide field microscopy, providing high resolution also in (typically fragile) biological sample. Among the various super resolution techniques, Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) improve resolution by employing multiple illumination patterns to be deconvolved with a dedicated software. In the case of blind SIM techniques, unknown patterns, such as speckles, are used, thus providing super resolved images, nearly unaffected by aberrations with a simplified experimental setup. Scattering Assisted Imaging, a special blind SIM technique, exploits an illumination PSF (speckle grains size), smaller than the collection PSF (defined by the collection objectives), to surpass the typical SIM resolution enhancement. However, if SAI is used, it is very difficult to extract the resolution enhancement from a priori considerations. In this paper we propose a protocol and experimental setup for the resolution measurement, demonstrating the resolution enhancement for different collection PSF values.",

    "abstract": "Early predator detection is a key component of the predator-prey arms race, and has driven the evolution of multiple animal hearing systems. Katydids (Insecta) have sophisticated ears, each consisting of paired tympana on each foreleg that receive sound directly externally, and internally via a narrowing ear canal through the acoustic spiracle. These ears are pressure-time difference receivers capable of sensitive and accurate directional hearing across a wide frequency range, despite the small size of katydids. Many katydid species have cuticular pinnae which form cavities around the outer tympanal surfaces, but their function is unknown. We investigated pinnal function in the katydid Copiphora gorgonensis by combining experimental biophysics and numerical modelling using 3D ear geometries. Results show that the pinnae in C. gorgonensis do not assist in directional hearing for specific call frequencies, but instead pinnae act as ultrasound detector devices. Pinnae induced large sound pressure gains that enhanced sound detection at high ultrasonic frequencies (> 60 kHz), matching the echolocation range of co-occurring insectivorous bats. Comparing pinnal mechanics of sympatric katydid species supports these findings, and suggests that pinnae evolved in katydids primarily for enhanced predator detection. Audiograms (both behavioural and neural) and tympanal cavity resonances obtained from living specimens corroborate our findings.",

We identified horizontal mitochondrial transfer as a mechanism that enhances tumorigenesis in glioblastoma. This transfer occurs primarily from brain-resident cells, including astrocytes, and can be appreciated in vitro and in vivo through intercellular connections between GBM cells and non-malignant host cells. The acquisition of astrocyte mitochondria drives an overall enhancement of mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic capacity, while increasing glioblastoma cell self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial transfer augments the tumorigenic capacity of glioblastoma cells and reveals a previously unknown cell-cell communication mechanism that drives tumor growth.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryMitochondrial transfer from astrocytes to glioblastoma alters metabolic profile and enhances the tumor-initiation capacity.",

    "abstract": "Applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology often make use of soluble proteins, but there are many potential advantages to anchoring enzymes to a stable substrate, including stability and the possibility for substrate channeling. To avoid the necessity of protein purification and chemical immobilization, there has been growing interest in bio-assembly of protein-containing nanoparticles, exploiting the self-assembly of viral capsid proteins or other proteins that form polyhedral structures. But these nanoparticle are limited in size which constrains the packaging and the accessibility of the proteins. The axoneme, the insoluble protein core of the eukaryotic flagellum or cilium, is a highly ordered protein structure that can be several microns in length, orders of magnitude larger than other types of nanoparticles. We show that when proteins of interest are fused to specific axonemal proteins and expressed in living cells, they become incorporated into linear arrays which have the advantages of high protein loading capacity, high stability, and single-step purification with retention of biomass. The arrays can be isolated as membrane enclosed vesicle or as exposed protein arrays. The approach is demonstrated for both fluorescent proteins and enzymes, and in the latter case it is found that incorporation into axoneme arrays provides increased stability for the enzyme.",

Cpl1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signaling for its impact on infectivity.

This immunomodulatory capacity holds therapeutic potential, yet a definitional immunophenotype for enumeration and prospective isolation of B cells capable of IL-10 production remains elusive. We therefore applied mass cytometry to simultaneously quantify cytokine production and immunophenotype in human peripheral B cells across a range of stimulatory conditions and timepoints. While multiple B cell subsets produced IL-10, no phenotype uniquely identified IL-10+ B cells and a significant portion of IL-10+ B cells co-expressed the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF. Despite this heterogeneity, we found operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients had a unique enrichment of IL-10+, but not TNF+ or IL-6+, B cells as compared to transplant recipients receiving immunosuppression. Thus, human IL-10-producing B cells constitute an induced, transient state arising from a diversity of B cell subsets that may contribute to maintenance of immune homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The Lujo virus (LUJV) belongs to the Old World (OW) genus Mammarenavirus (family Arenaviridae); it is categorized as a biosafety level (BSL) 4 agent. Currently, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs or vaccines specifically for LUJV or other pathogenic OW mammarenaviruses. Here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library was conducted using pseudotype viruses bearing LUJV envelope glycoprotein (GPC) to identify inhibitors of LUJV entry. Three hit compounds, trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine, were identified as LUJV entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. Mechanistic studies revealed that trametinib inhibited LUJV GPC-mediated membrane fusion by targeting C410 (located in the transmembrane (TM) domain), while manidipine and lercanidipine inhibited LUJV entry by acting as calcium channel blockers. Meanwhile, all three hits extended their antiviral spectra to the entry of other pathogenic mammarenaviruses. Furthermore, all three could inhibit the authentic prototype mammarenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and could prevent infection at the micromolar level. This study shows that trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine are candidates for LUJV therapy, and highlights the critical role of calcium in LUJV infection. The presented findings reinforce the notion that the key residue(s) located in the TM domain of GPC provide an entry-targeted platform for designing mammarenavirus inhibitors.\n\nIMPORTANCETo date, only one LUJV outbreak has been recorded; it occurred in 2008 and resulted in a fatality rate of 80% (4/5 cases). Pathogenesis studies and therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed. Repurposing approved drugs can accelerate the development of drug design and facilitate the understanding of infectious mechanisms. Here, three compounds, trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine, were identified as entry inhibitors against LUJV. Studying the underling mechanisms revealed that a key residue (C410) in LUJV GPC modulates its sensitivity/resistance to trametinib and demonstrated the critical role of calcium in LUJV infection.",

    "abstract": "Some strains of the inherited bacterium Wolbachia have been shown to be effective at reducing the transmission of dengue and other positive-sense RNA viruses by Aedes aegypti in both laboratory and field settings and are being deployed for dengue control. The degree of virus inhibition varies between Wolbachia strains; density and tissue tropism can contribute to these differences but there are also indications that this is not the only factor involved: for example, strains wAu and wAlbA are maintained at similar densities but only wAu produces strong dengue inhibition. We previously reported perturbations in lipid transport dynamics, including sequestration of cholesterol in lipid droplets, with strains wMel / wMelPop in Ae. aegypti. Here we show that strain wAu does not produce the same cholesterol sequestration phenotype despite displaying strong virus inhibition and moreover, in contrast to wMel, wAu antiviral activity was not rescued by cyclodextrin treatment. To further investigate the cellular basis underlying these differences, proteomic analysis of midguts was carried out on Ae. aegypti lines and revealed that wAu-carrying midguts showed a distinct proteome when compared to Wolbachia-free, wMel- or wAlbA-carrying midguts, in particular with respect to lipid transport and metabolism. The data suggest a possible role for perturbed RNA processing pathways in wAu virus inhibition. Together these results indicate that wAu shows unique features in its inhibition of arboviruses compared to previously characterized Wolbachia strains.\n\nAuthor SummaryWolbachia endosymbionts can block transmission of dengue virus by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and Wolbachia release programs for dengue control are now being undertaken in several countries. Understanding the mechanisms of Wolbachia-mediated antiviral activity is important for maximizing the efficacy of this control approach. Using functional and proteomic analyses, this study indicates that different strains of Wolbachia perturb cellular functions in diverse ways and display different antiviral profiles. These differences raise the possibility that Wolbachia strain switching could be used to counteract viral escape mutations, should they arise and threaten the efficacy of dengue control programmes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTriatomine bugs are the blood feeding insect vectors transmitting Chagas disease to humans, a neglected tropical disease that affects over 8 million people, mainly in Latin America. The behavioral responses to host cues and bug signals in Rhodnius prolixus are state dependent, i.e., they vary as a function of post-ecdysis age. At the molecular level, these changes in behavior are probably due to a modulation of peripheral and central processes. In the present study, we report a significant modulation of the expression of a large set of sensory-related genes. Results were generated by means of antennal transcriptomes of 5th instar larvae along the first week (days 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8) after ecdysis sequenced using the Illumina platform.\n\nResultsAge induced significant changes in transcript abundance were established in more than 6,120 genes (54,7 % of 11,186 genes expressed) in the R. prolixus antenna. This was especially true between the first two days after ecdysis when more than 2,500 genes had their expression significantly altered. In contrast, expression profiles were almost identical between day 6 and 8, with only a few genes showing significant modulation of their expression. A total of 86 sensory receptors, odorant carriers and odorant degrading enzymes were significantly modulated across age points and clustered into three distinct expression profiles.\n\nConclusionsThe set of sensory genes whose expression increased with age (profile 3) may include candidates underlying the increased responsiveness to host cues shown by R. prolixus during the first days after molting. For the first time, we describe the maturation process undergone at the molecular level by the peripheral sensory system is described in an hemimetabolous insect.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplications (WGDs) have long been considered the causal mechanism underlying the dramatic increase in vertebrate morphological complexity relative to invertebrates. This is due to the retention and neo-functionalization of paralogues generated during these events, evolving new regulatory circuits, and ultimately morphological novelty. Nonetheless, an alternative hypothesis suggests that behind the retention of most paralogues is not neo-functionalization, but instead the degree of the inter-connectivity of the intended gene product, as well as the mode of the WGD itself. Here, we explore both the causes and consequences of WGD by examining the distribution, expression, and molecular evolution of microRNAs (miRNAs) in both gnathostome vertebrates as well as chelicerate arthropods. We find that although the number of miRNA paralogues tracks the number of WGDs experienced within the lineage, few of these paralogues experienced changes to the seed sequence, and thus are functionally equivalent relative to their mRNA targets. Nonetheless, the paralogues generated by the gnathostome 2R allotetraploidization event are retained in higher numbers on one sub-genome relative the second, with the miRNAs found on the preferred set of paralogons showing both higher expression of mature miRNA transcripts and slower molecular evolution of the precursor miRNA sequences. Importantly, WGDs do not result in the creation of miRNA novelty, nor do WGDs correlate to increases in complexity. Instead, it is the number of miRNA seed sequences in the genome itself that not only better correlate to instances in complexification, but also mechanistically explain why complexity increases when new miRNA families are established.",

    "abstract": "Hevea brasiliensis (the rubber tree) is a well-known species with high economic value, and it is the primary source of natural rubber globally. Increasing demand for furniture and related industries has made rubberwood production as important as latex production. Molecular markers such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) are widely used for Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) which can be detected in large quantity by transcriptome sequencing. MAS is thought to be a useful method for the development of new rubberwood clones for its shorter breeding cycle compared to a conventional breeding procedure. In this study we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on four H. brasiliensis clones (RRIM 712, RRIM 2025, RRIM 3001 and PB 314) from three tissues including bark, latex and leaf samples to identify SSRs and SNPs associated with wood-formation related genes. The RNA sequencing using the Illumina NextSeq 500 v2 platform, generated 1,697,491,922 raw reads. A total of 101,269 transcripts over 400 bp in size were obtained and similarity search of the non-redundant (nr) protein database returned 83,748 (83%) positive BLASTx hits. The transcriptome analysis was annotated using the NCBI NR (National Center for Biotechnology Information Non-Redundant), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Differential expression analysis between later-timber rubber clone and non-later-timber rubber clone on wood-formation related genes, showed genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) were highly up-regulated in a latex-timber rubber clone. In total, about 3,210,629 SNPs and 14,956 SSRs were detected with 1,786 SNPs and 31 SSRs were found for wood-formation biosynthesis of H. brasilensis from 11 lignin and cellulose gene toolboxes. After filtering and primer selection, 103 SNPs and 18 SSR markers were successfully amplified and could be useful as molecular tool for marker assisted breeding to produce new timber rubber clones.",

Here, we leveraged spatiotemporal information on 966 RNA-seq cardiac samples and performed an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis detecting eQTLs considering both eGenes and eIsoforms. We identified 2,578 eQTLs associated with a specific developmental stage-, tissue- and/or cell type. Colocalization between eQTL and GWAS signals of five cardiac traits identified variants with high posterior probabilities for being causal in 210 GWAS loci. Pulse pressure GWAS loci were enriched for colocalization with fetal- and smooth muscle- eQTLs; pulse rate with adult- and cardiac muscle- eQTLs; and atrial fibrillation with cardiac muscle- eQTLs. Fine mapping identified 79 credible sets with five or fewer SNPs, of which 15 were associated with spatiotemporal eQTLs. Our study shows that many cardiac GWAS variants impact traits and disease in a developmental stage-, tissue- and/or cell type-specific fashion.",

    "abstract": "Common neurological disorders, like Alzheimers disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and autism, display profound sex differences in prevalence and clinical presentation. However, sex differences in the brain with health and disease are often overlooked in experimental models. Sex effects originate, either directly or indirectly, from hormonal or sex chromosomal mechanisms. To delineate the contributions of genetic sex (XX v. XY) versus gonadal sex (ovaries v. testes) to the epigenomic regulation of hippocampal sex differences, we use the Four Core Genotypes (FCG) mouse model to uncouple chromosomal and gonadal sex. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of [~]12-month-old FCG mice hippocampi, revealed genomic context-specific regulatory effects of genotypic and gonadal sex on X- and autosome-encoded gene expression and DNA modification patterns. X-chromosomal epigenomic patterns, classically associated with X-inactivation, were established almost entirely by genotypic sex, independent of gonadal sex. Differences in X-chromosome methylation were primarily localized to gene regulatory regions including promoters, CpG islands, CTCF binding sites, and active/poised chromatin, with an inverse relationship between methylation and gene expression. Whereas, autosomal gene expression demonstrated regulation by both genotypic and gonadal sex, particularly in immune processes. These data demonstrate an important regulatory role of sex chromosomes, independent of gonadal sex, on sex-biased hippocampal transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles. Future studies will need to further interrogate specific CNS cell types, identify the mechanisms by which sex chromosomes regulate autosomes, and differentiate organizational from activational hormonal effects.",

    "abstract": "Hedgehog (Hh) signaling ligands undergo carboxy terminal sterylation through specialized autoprocessing, called cholesterolysis. Sterylation is brought about intramolecularly in a single turn-over by an enzymatic domain, called HhC. HhC is found in precursor Hh proteins only. Through cholesterolysis, HhC is cleaved from the precursor. Attempts to identify molecules that inhibit intramolecular cleavage/sterylation activity of HhC have resulted in antagonists that bind HhC irreversibly through covalent mechanisms, as is commonplace for protein autoprocessing inhibitors. Here we report an exception to the \"irreversibility rule\" for protein autoprocessing inhibition. Using a FRET-based activity assay for HhC, we screened a focused library of sterol-like analogs for HhC cholesterolysis inhibitors. We identified and validated four structurally related noncovalent inhibitors, which were then used for SAR studies. The most effective derivative, tBT-HBT, binds HhC reversibly with an IC50 of 300 nM. An allosteric binding site for tBT-HBT, encompassing interactions from the two subdomains of HhC, is suggested by kinetic analysis, mutagenesis studies, and photoaffinity labeling. A striking resemblance is found between the inhibitors described here and a family of noncovalent, allosteric activators of HhC, which we described previously. The inhibitor/activator duality appears to be mediated by the same allosteric site, which displays sensitivity to subtle differences in the structure of a heterocycle substituent on the effector molecule.",

Given its overexpression at sites of inflammation in a wide range of diseases marked by increasingly oxidative cellular environment, a comprehensive structural understanding of how cellular redox conditions may impact the structure and function of MIF is necessary. We used solution NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to investigate structural and dynamic signatures of MIF under varied solution redox conditions. Our results indicate that the MIF structure is modified and becomes increasingly dynamic in an oxidative environment, which may be a means to alter the MIF functional response in a redox-dependent manner. We identified latent allosteric sites within MIF that are redox-sensitive and mutational analysis reveals that loss of redox-responsive residues attenuates activation of the coreceptor CD74. Leveraging sites of redox-sensitivity therefore reveals an avenue to modulate MIF function in its \"disease state\" via structure-based drug design.",

    "abstract": "Salmonid fish raised in hatcheries often have lower fitness (number of returning adult offspring) than wild fish when both spawn in the wild. Body size at release from hatcheries is positively correlated with survival at sea. So one explanation for reduced fitness is that hatcheries inadvertently select for trait values that enhance growth rate under the unnatural environment of a hatchery, but that are maladaptive in the wild environment. A simple prediction of this hypothesis is that juveniles of hatchery origin should grow more quickly than fish of wild origin under hatchery conditions, but should have lower survival under wild conditions. We tested that hypothesis using multiple full sibling families of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that were spawned using either two wild parents (WxW) or two first-generation hatchery (HxH) parents. Offspring from all the families were grown together under hatchery conditions and under semi-natural conditions in artificial streams. HxH families grew significantly faster in the hatchery, but had significantly lower survival in the streams. That we see this tradeoff after only a single generation of selection suggests that the traits involved are under very strong selection. We also considered one possible alteration to the hatchery environment that might reduce the intensity of selection among families in size at release. Here we tested whether reducing the fat content of hatchery feed would reduce the variance among families in body size. Although fish raised under a low-fat diet were slightly smaller, the variation among families in final size was unchanged. Thus, there is no evidence that reducing the fat content of hatchery feed would reduce the opportunity for selection among families on size at release.",

Monocytes are considered one of the earliest blood cell types to be infected by ZIKV. As a first line defence, monocytes are crucial components in innate immunity and host responses and may impact viral pathogenesis in humans. Previous studies have shown that ZIKV infection can activate inflammasomes and induce proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes. In this report, we showed that ZIKV carried out a productive infection, which lead to cell death in human and murine monocytic cells. In addition to the presence of cleaved caspase-3, indicating that apoptosis was involved, we identified the cleaved caspase-1 and gasdemin D (GSDMD) as well as increased secretion of IL-1{beta} and IL-18, suggesting that the inflammasome was activated that may lead to pyroptosis in infected monocytes. The pyroptosis was NLRP3-dependent and could be suppressed in the monocytes treated with shRNA to target and knockdown caspase-1, or an inhibited for caspase-1, indicating that the pyroptosis was triggered via a canonical approach. Our findings in this study demonstrate a concomitant occurrence of apoptosis and pyroptosis in ZIKV-infected monocytes, with multiple mechanisms involved in the cell death, which may have potentially significant impacts on viral pathogenesis in humans.",

A proposed solution is that they might use the transitional probability between adjacent syllables, which drops at word boundaries. Here, we tested the limits of this mechanism by increasing the size of the word-unit to 4 syllables, and its automaticity by testing asleep neonates. Using markers of statistical learning in neonates EEG, compared to adult behavioral performances in the same task, we confirmed that statistical learning is automatic enough to be efficient even in sleeping neonates. But we also revealed that: 1) Successfully tracking transition probabilities in a sequence is not sufficient to segment it 2) Prosodic cues, as subtle as subliminal pauses, enable to recover segmenting capacities 3) Adults and neonates capacities are remarkably similar despite the difference of maturation and expertise. Finally, we observed that learning increased the similarity of neural responses across infants, providing a new neural marker to monitor learning. Thus, from birth, infants are equipped with adult-like tools, allowing to extract small coherent word-like units within auditory streams, based on the combination of statistical analyses and prosodic cues.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization and subsequent genetic introgression are now known to be common features of the histories of many species, including our own. Following hybridization, selection often purges introgressed DNA genome-wide. While mate choice can prevent hybridization in the first place, it is also known to play an important role in post-zygotic selection against hybrids, and thus the purging of introgressed DNA. However, this role is usually thought of as a direct one: a mating preference for conspecifics reduces the sexual fitness of hybrids, reducing the transmission of introgressed ancestry. Here, we explore a second, indirect role of mate choice as a barrier to gene flow. Under assortative mating, parents covary in their ancestry, causing ancestry to be \"bundled\" in their offspring and later generations. This bundling effect increases ancestry variance in the population, enhancing the efficiency with which post-zygotic selection purges introgressed DNA. Using whole-genome simulations, we show that the bundling effect can comprise a substantial portion of mate choices overall effect as a post-zygotic barrier to gene flow, and that it is driven by ancestry covariances between and within maternally and paternally inherited genomes. We derive a simple method for estimating the impact of the bundling effect from standard measures of assortative mating. Applying this method to data from a diverse set of hybrid zones, we find that the bundling effect increases the purging of introgressed DNA by between 1.2-fold (in a baboon system with weak assortative mating) and 14-fold (in a swordtail system with strong assortative mating). Thus, the bundling effect of mate choice contributes substantially to the genetic isolation of species.",

The neural substrate of a schema emerges within a low-dimensional subspace of population activity; its reuse in new problems facilitates learning by limiting connection weight changes. Our work highlights the weight-driven modifications of the vector field, which determines the population trajectory of a recurrent network and behavior.
