    "abstract": "In C4 plants, the enzymatic machinery underpinning photosynthesis can vary, with, for example, three distinct C4 acid decarboxylases being used to release CO2 in the vicinity of RuBisCO. For decades, these decarboxylases have been used to classify C4 species into three biochemical sub-types. However, more recently the notion that C4 species mix and match C4 acid decarboxylases has increased in popularity and, as a consequence, the validity of specific biochemical sub-types has been questioned. Using five species from the grass tribe Paniceae, we show that, while in some species transcripts encoding multiple C4 acid decarboxylases accumulate, in others, transcript abundance and enzyme activity is almost entirely from one decarboxylase. In addition, the development of a bundle sheath isolation procedure for a close C3 species in the Paniceae enables the preliminary exploration of C4 sub-type evolution.",

    "abstract": "Memory formation involves the synchronous firing of neurons in task-relevant networks, with recent models postulating that a decrease in low frequency oscillatory activity underlies successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, to date, this relationship has been investigated primarily with face and image stimuli; considerably less is known about the oscillatory correlates of complex rule learning, as in language. Further, recent work has shown that non-oscillatory (1/f) activity is functionally relevant to cognition, yet its interaction with oscillatory activity during complex rule learning remains unknown. Using spectral decomposition and power-law exponent estimation of human EEG data (17 females, 18 males), we show for the first time that 1/f and oscillatory activity jointly influence the learning of word order rules of a miniature artificial language system. Flexible word order rules were associated with a steeper 1/f slope, while fixed word order rules were associated with a shallower slope. We also show that increased theta and alpha power predicts fixed relative to flexible word order rule learning and behavioural performance. Together, these results suggest that 1/f activity plays an important role in higher-order cognition, including language processing, and that grammar learning is modulated by different word order permutations, which manifest in distinct oscillatory profiles.",

    "abstract": "Benign melanocytic nevi frequently emerge when an acquired BRAFV600E mutation triggers unchecked proliferation and subsequent arrest in melanocytes. Recent observations have challenged the role of oncogene-induced senescence in melanocytic nevus formation, necessitating investigations into alternative mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of proliferation arrest in nevi. We compared the transcriptomes of melanocytes from healthy human skin, nevi, and melanomas arisen from nevi and identified a set of microRNAs as highly expressed nevus-enriched transcripts. Two of these microRNAs - MIR211-5p and MIR328-3p - induced mitotic failure, genome duplication and proliferation arrest in human melanocytes through convergent targeting of AURKB. We demonstrate that BRAFV600E induces a similar proliferation arrest in primary human melanocytes that is both reversible and conditional. Specifically, BRAFV600E expression stimulates either arrest or proliferation depending on the differentiation state of the melanocyte. We report genome duplication in human melanocytic nevi, reciprocal expression of AURKB and microRNAs in nevi and melanomas, and rescue of arrested human nevus cells with AURKB expression. Together, our data describe an alternative molecular mechanism for melanocytic nevus formation that is congruent with both experimental and clinical observations.",

    "abstract": "Fracture healing is regulated by mechanical loading. Understanding the underlying mechanisms during the different healing phases is required for targeted mechanical intervention therapies. Here, the influence of individualized cyclic mechanical loading on the remodelling phase of fracture healing was assessed in a mouse femur defect model. After bridging of the defect, a loading group (n=10) received individualized cyclic mechanical loading (8-16 N, 10 Hz, 5 min, 3x/week) based on computed strain distribution in the callus using animal-specific real-time micro-finite element analysis. Controls (n=10) received 0 N treatment at the same post-operative time-points. By registration of consecutive scans, structural and dynamic callus morphometric parameters were followed in three callus sub-volumes and the adjacent cortex showing that the remodelling phase of fracture healing is highly responsive to cyclic mechanical loading with changes in dynamic parameters leading to significantly larger callus formation and mineralization. Loading-mediated maintenance of callus remodelling was associated with distinct effects on Wnt-signalling-associated molecular targets Sclerostin and RANKL in callus sub-regions and the adjacent cortex. Given these distinct local protein expression patterns induced by cyclic mechanical loading, the femur defect loading model with individualized load application seems suitable to understand the local spatio-temporal mechano-molecular regulation of the different fracture healing phases.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSResilience can be defined as the capacity of animals to cope with short-term perturbations in their environment and return rapidly to their pre-challenge status. In a perspective of precision livestock farming, it is key to create informative indicators for general resilience and therefore incorporate this concept in breeding goals. In the modern swine breeding industry, new technologies such as automatic feeding system are increasingly common and can be used to capture useful data to monitor animal phenotypes such as feed efficiency. This automatic and longitudinal data collection integrated with mathematical modelling has a great potential to determine accurate resilience indicators, for example by measuring the deviation from expected production levels over a period of time.\n\nResultsThis work aimed at developing a modelling approach for facilitating the quantification of pig resilience during the fattening period, from approximately 34 kg to 105 kg of body weight. A total of 13 093 pigs, belonging to three different genetic lines were monitored (Pietrain, Pietrain NN and Duroc) since 2015, and body weight measures registered (approximately 11.1 million of weightings) with automatic feeding systems. We used the Gompertz model and linear interpolation on body weight data to quantify individual deviations from expected production, thereby creating a resilience index (ABC). The estimated heritabilities of ABC are low but not zero from 0.03 to 0.04 ({+/-} 0.01) depending on the breed.\n\nConclusionsOur model-based approach can be useful to quantify pig responses to perturbations using exclusively the growth curves and should contribute to the genetic improvement of resilience of fattening pigs by providing a resilience index.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of reductive cues from the photosynthetic electron transport chain to redox-regulated proteins plays a crucial role in activating chloroplast metabolism. However, deciphering the role of their counterbalanced oxidative signals is challenging due to monitoring difficulties. Here, we demonstrate the light-depended redox modification of chloroplast-targeted 2-Cys peroxiredoxins and introduce peroxiredoxin-based biosensors to monitor photosynthetically-derived oxidative signals. By employing a set of genetically encoded biosensors, we show the induction of oxidative signals under habitual light intensities and their inverse relationship with NADPH levels, unraveling the combined activity of reducing and oxidizing signals in fine-tuning chloroplast metabolism. A faster increase in carbon assimilation rates during photosynthesis induction phase was measured in plants deficient in 2-Cys peroxiredoxins compared to wild-type, suggesting the involvement of oxidative signals in attenuating photosynthesis under variable light environments. We suggest that oxidative signals measured by peroxiredoxin-based biosensors reflect the limitation to photosynthesis imposed by the redox regulatory system.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA genetically encoded biosensor unmasked the dominant role of photosynthetically-derived oxidative signals under habitual conditions.",

    "abstract": "Most methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction are based on sequence alignments; they infer phylogenies from substitutions that may have occurred at the aligned sequence positions. Gaps in alignments are usually not employed as phylogenetic signal. In this paper, we explore an alignment-free approach that uses insertions and deletions (indels) as an additional source of information for phylogeny inference. For a set of four or more input sequences, we generate so-called quartet blocks of four putative homologous segments each. For pairs of such quartet blocks involving the same four sequences, we compare the distances between the two blocks in these sequences, to obtain hints about indels that may have happened between the blocks since the respective four sequences have evolved from their last common ancestor. A prototype implementation is presented to infer phylogenetic trees from these data, using a quartet-tree approach or, alternatively, under the maximum-parsimony paradigm. This approach should not be regarded as an alternative to established methods, but rather as a complementary source of phylogenetic information. Interestingly, however, our software is able to produce phylogenetic trees from putative indels alone that are comparable to trees obtained with existing alignment-free methods.",

We use data from 67 patients who underwent both standard DWI-MRI and VERDICT MRI and rely on correlation analysis and mean squared error to quantitatively evaluate the quality of the synthetic VERDICT maps. Quantitative results show that the mean values of tumour areas in the synthetic and the real VERDICT maps were strongly correlated while qualitative results indicate that our method can generate realistic VERDICT maps that could supplement mp-MRI assessment for better diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "During mycoparasitism, a fungus--the host--is parasitized by another fungus--the mycoparasite. The genetic underpinnings of these relationships have been best characterized in ascomycete fungi. However, within basidiomycete fungi, there are rare instances of mushroom-forming species parasitizing the reproductive structures, or sporocarps, of other mushroom-forming species, which have been rarely investigated on a genetic level. One of the most enigmatic of these occurs between Entoloma abortivum and species of Armillaria, where hyphae of E. abortivum are hypothesized to disrupt the development of Armillaria sporocarps, resulting in the formation of carpophoroids. However, it remains unknown whether carpophoroids are the direct result of a mycoparasitic relationship. To address the nature of this unique interaction, we analyzed gene expression of field-collected Armillaria and E. abortivum sporocarps and carpophoroids. Transcripts in the carpophoroids are primarily from E. abortivum, supporting the hypothesis that this species is parasitizing Armillaria. Most notably, we identified differentially upregulated E. abortivum {beta}-trefoil-type lectins in the carpophoroid, which we hypothesize bind to Armillaria cell wall galactomannoproteins, thereby mediating recognition between the mycoparasite and the host. The most differentially upregulated E. abortivum transcripts in the carpophoroid code for oxalate decarboxylases--enzymes that degrade oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is a virulence factor in many plant pathogens, including Armillaria species, however, E. abortivum has evolved a sophisticated strategy to overcome this defense mechanism. The number of gene models and genes that code for carbohydrate-active enzymes in the E. abortivum transcriptome were reduced compared to other closely related species, perhaps as a result of the specialized nature of this interaction.\n\nIMPORTANCEBy studying fungi that parasitize other fungi, we can understand the basic biology of these unique interactions. Studies focused on the genetic mechanisms regulating mycoparasitism between host and parasite have thus far concentrated on a single fungal lineage within the Ascomycota. The work presented here expands our understanding of mycoparasitic relationships to the Basidiomycota and represents the first transcriptomic study to our knowledge that examines fungal-fungal relationships in their natural setting. The results presented here suggest that even distantly related mycoparasites utilize similar mechanisms to parasitize their host. Given that species of the mushroom-forming pathogen Armillaria cause plant root-rot diseases in many agroecosystems, an enhanced understanding of this interaction may contribute to better control of these diseases through biocontrol applications.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton account for >45% of global primary production, and have an enormous impact on aquatic food webs and on the entire Earth System. Their members are found among prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) and multiple eukaryotic lineages containing chloroplasts. Phytoplankton communities are generally studied by PCR amplification of bacterial (16S), nuclear (18S) or chloroplastic (16S) rRNA marker genes from DNA extracted from environmental samples. However, our appreciation of phytoplankton abundance or biomass is limited by PCR-amplification biases, rRNA gene copy number variations across taxa, and the fact that rRNA genes do not provide insights into metabolic traits such as photosynthesis. In addition, rRNA marker genes fail to capture both cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes simultaneously. Here, we targeted the photosynthetic gene psbO from metagenomes to circumvent these limitations: the method is PCR-free, and the gene is universally and exclusively present in photosynthetic prokaryotes and eukaryotes, mainly in one copy per genome. We applied and validated this new strategy with the Tara Oceans datasets, and showed improved correlations with flow cytometry and microscopy than when based on rRNA genes. Furthermore, we revealed unexpected features of the ecology of these organisms, such as the high abundance of picocyanobacterial aggregates and symbionts in the ocean, and the decrease in relative abundance of phototrophs towards the larger size classes of marine dinoflagellates. To facilitate the incorporation of psbO in molecular-based surveys, we compiled a curated database of >18,000 unique sequences. Overall, psbO appears to be a promising new gene marker for molecular-based evaluations of entire phytoplankton communities.",

    "abstract": "When conditions change, unicellular organisms rewire their metabolism to sustain cell maintenance and cellular growth. Such rewiring may be understood as resource re-allocation under cellular constraints. Eukaryal cells contain metabolically active organelles such as mitochondria, competing for cytosolic space and resources, and the nature of the relevant cellular constraints remain to be determined for such cells. Here we developed a comprehensive metabolic model of the yeast cell, based on its full metabolic reaction network extended with protein synthesis and degradation reactions (16304 reactions in total). The model predicts metabolic fluxes and corresponding protein expression by constraining compartment-specific protein pools and maximising growth rate. Comparing model predictions with quantitative experimental data revealed that under glucose limitation, a mitochondrial constraint limits growth at the onset of ethanol formation - known as the Crabtree effect. Under sugar excess, however, a constraint on total cytosolic volume dictates overflow metabolism. Our comprehensive model thus identifies condition-dependent and compartment-specific constraints that can explain metabolic strategies and protein expression profiles from growth rate optimization, providing a framework to understand metabolic adaptation in eukaryal cells.",

    "abstract": "The salivary gland can be permanently impaired by radiation treatment for head and neck cancers. Efforts at tissue regeneration have focused on saliva-producing acinar cells. However, myoepithelial cells are also critical to gland function, but mechanisms that regulate their differentiation are poorly defined. To study myoepithelial differentiation, we employed mSG-PAC1 murine salivary gland epithelial cells. We demonstrate that mSG-PAC1 spheroids exhibit phenotypic plasticity between pro-acinar and myoepithelial cell fates. Increased expression of pro-acinar/acinar or myoepithelial RNAs was identified from spheroids cultured under different media conditions by microarray followed by gene-set enrichment analysis. Spheroids cultured with different medium components expressed proteins typical of either acinar or myoepithelial cells, as detected by immunocytochemistry. We demonstrate that the pattern of TAZ expression in the epithelial compartment of the differentiating murine salivary gland correlates with the expression of the myoepithelial marker alpha-SMA, as is the case for TAZ expression in mSG-PAC1 spheroids. Our analysis also indicates that YAP/TAZ target genes are upregulated together with myoepithelial markers. Importantly, siRNA targeting of TAZ expression in mSG-PAC1 spheroids diminished the expression of myoepithelial markers. Our results in this in vitro cell model implicate TAZ signaling in myoepithelial differentiation.",

By processing gene expression data we show that, in general, for the vectors defining the centers of cloud samples: 1. The closest tumor to a given normal state is its respective tumor, 2. Two normal states define quasi-orthogonal directions, 3. A tumor may have a projection onto its corresponding normal state, but it is quasi-orthogonal to all others and 4. The cancer manifold is roughly obtained by translating the normal tissue manifold along an orthogonal direction defined by the cancer projection axis.",

    "abstract": "The nucleoporin ELYS, encoded by AHCTF1, is a large multifunctional protein with essential roles in nuclear pore assembly and mitosis. Using a zebrafish model of hepatocellular carcinoma, in which the expression of an inducible mutant kras transgene (krasG12V) drives hepatocyte-specific hyperplasia and liver enlargement, we show that reducing ahctf1 gene dosage by 50% markedly shrinks tumour burden, while non-hyperplastic tissues are unaffected. We demonstrate that ahctf1 heterozygosity impairs nuclear pore formation, mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation, leading to DNA damage and activation of TP53-dependent and independent mechanisms of cell death and cell cycle arrest. This selective vulnerability of cancer cells to mild disruption of Elys function uncovers a novel synthetic lethal interaction between ahctf1 and kras mutations that could be exploited therapeutically. Heterozygous expression of both ahctf1 and ranbp2, or treatment of heterozygous ahctf1 larvae with the nucleocytoplasmic transport inhibitor, Selinexor, completely blocked krasG12V-driven hepatocyte hyperplasia, revealing promising avenues for combinatorial treatments.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have increasingly pointed to microRNAs (miRNAs) as the agent of GRN (gene regulatory network) stabilization as well as developmental canalization against constant but small environmental perturbations. Since the complete removal of miRNAs is lethal, we construct a Dicer-1 knockdown line (dcr-1 KD) in Drosophila that modestly reduces all miRNAs. We hypothesize that flies with modest miRNA reductions will gradually deviate from the developmental norm, resulting in late-stage failures such as shortened longevity. In the optimal culture condition, the survival to adulthood is indeed normal in the dcr-1 KD line but, importantly, adult longevity is reduced by [~] 90%. When flies are stressed by high temperature, dcr-1 KD induces lethality earlier in late pupation and, as the perturbations are shifted earlier, the affected stages are shifted correspondingly. We further show that the developmental failure is associated with GRN aberration in the larval stages even before phenotypic aberrations become observable. Hence, in late stages of development with deviations piling up, GRN would be increasingly in need of stabilization. In conclusion, miRNAs appear to be the genomes solution to weak but constant environmental perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Lack of oxygen (hypoxia and anoxia) is detrimental to cell function and survival and underlies many disease conditions. Hence, metazoans have evolved mechanisms to adapt to low oxygen. One such mechanism, metabolic suppression, decreases the cellular demand for oxygen by downregulating ATP-demanding processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptation are poorly understood. Here, we report on the role of ndrg1a in hypoxia adaptation of the anoxia-tolerant zebrafish embryo. ndrg1a is expressed in the kidney and ionocytes, cell types that use large amounts of ATP to maintain ion homeostasis. ndrg1a mutants are viable and develop normally when raised under normal oxygen. However, their survival and kidney function is reduced relative to WT embryos following exposure to prolonged anoxia. We further demonstrate that Ndrg1a binds to the energy-demanding sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) pump under anoxia and is required for its degradation, which may preserve ATP in the kidney and ionocytes and contribute to energy homeostasis. Lastly, we show that sodium azide treatment, which increased lactate levels, was sufficient to trigger NKA degradation in an Ndrg1a-dependent manner. These findings support a model whereby Ndrg1a is essential for hypoxia adaptation and functions downstream of lactate signaling to induce NKA degradation, a process known to conserve cellular energy.",

    "abstract": "A standard view of human language processing is that comprehenders build richly structured mental representations of natural language utterances, word by word, using computationally costly memory operations supported by domain-general working memory resources. However, three core claims of this view have been questioned, with some prior work arguing that (1) rich word-by-word structure building is not a core function of the language comprehension system, (2) apparent working memory costs are underlyingly driven by word predictability (surprisal), and/or (3) language comprehension relies primarily on domain-general rather than domain-specific working memory resources. In this work, we simultaneously evaluate all three of these claims using naturalistic comprehension in fMRI. In each participant, we functionally localize (a) a language-selective network and (b) a  multiple-demand network that supports working memory across domains, and we analyze the responses in these two networks of interest during naturalistic story listening with respect to a range of theory-driven predictors of working memory demand under rigorous surprisal controls. Results show robust surprisal-independent effects of word-by-word memory demand in the language network and no effect of working memory demand in the multiple demand network. Our findings thus support the view that language comprehension (1) entails word-by-word structure building using (2) computationally intensive memory operations that are not explained by surprisal. However, these results challenge (3) the domain-generality of the resources that support these operations, instead indicating that working memory operations for language comprehension are carried out by the same neural resources that store linguistic knowledge.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study uses fMRI to investigate signatures of working memory (WM) demand during naturalistic story listening, using a broad range of theoretically motivated estimates of WM demand. Results support a strong effect of WM demand in language-selective brain regions but no effect of WM demand in \"multiple demand\" regions that have previously been associated with WM in non-linguistic domains. We further show evidence that WM effects in language regions are distinct from effects of word predictability. Our findings support a core role for WM in incremental language processing, using WM resources that are specialized for language.",

    "abstract": "15% of colorectal cancers (CRC) cells exhibit a mucin hypersecretory phenotype, which is suggested to provide resistance to immune surveillance and chemotherapy. We now formally show that colorectal cancer cells build a barrier to chemotherapeutics by increasing mucins secretion. We show that low levels of KChIP3, a negative regulator of mucin secretion (Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018), is a risk factor for CRC patients relapse in subset of untreated tumours. Our results also reveal that cells depleted of KChIP3 are four times more resistant (measured as cell viability and DNA damage) to chemotherapeutics 5-Fluorouracil plus Irinotecan (5-FU+iri.) compared to control cells, whereas KChIP3 overexpressing cells are 10 times more sensitive to killing by chemotherapeutics. Similar increase in tumour cell death is observed upon chemical inhibition of mucin secretion by the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) blockers (Mitrovic et al., 2013). Finally, sensitivity of CRC patient-derived organoids to 5-FU+iri increases 40-fold upon mucin secretion inhibition. Reducing mucin secretion thus provides a means to control chemoresistance of mucinous colorectal cancer cells and other mucinous tumours.",

    "abstract": "The dynein-2 motor complex drives retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT), playing a pivotal role in the assembly and functions of cilia. However, the mechanisms that regulate dynein-2 motility remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the Caenorhabditis elegans WDR60 homolog (WDR-60) and dissect the roles of this intermediate chain using genome editing and live imaging of endogenous dynein-2/IFT components. We find that loss of WDR-60 impairs dynein-2 recruitment to cilia and its incorporation onto anterograde IFT trains, reducing the availability of the retrograde motor at the ciliary tip. Consistently, we show that less dynein-2 motors power WDR-60-deficient retrograde IFT trains, which move at reduced velocities and fail to exit cilia, accumulating on the distal side of the transition zone. Remarkably, disrupting the transition zones NPHP module almost fully restores ciliary exit of underpowered retrograde trains in wdr-60 mutants. This work establishes WDR-60 as a major contributor to IFT and the NPHP module as a roadblock to dynein-2 passage through the transition zone.",

We here report on the discovery that in C. elegans oocytes, actomyosin cortex activation is supported by the emergence of thousands of short-lived protein condensates rich in F-actin, N-WASP, and ARP2/3 that form an active micro-emulsion. A phase portrait analysis of the dynamics of individual cortical condensates reveals that condensates initially grow, and then switch to disassembly before dissolving completely. We find that in contrast to condensate growth via diffusion, the growth dynamics of cortical condensates are chemically driven. Remarkably, the associated chemical reactions obey mass action kinetics despite governing both composition and size. We suggest that the resultant condensate dynamic instability suppresses coarsening of the active micro-emulsion, ensures reaction kinetics that are independent of condensate size, and prevents runaway F-actin nucleation during the formation of the first cortical actin meshwork.",

    "abstract": "Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance and manipulation of information no longer accessible in the visual world. Previous research has identified spatial WM representations in activation patterns in visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. In natural vision, the period between the encoding of information into WM and the time when it is used to guide behavior (the delay period) is rarely \"empty\", as is the case in most of the above laboratory experiments. In naturalistic conditions, eye movements, movement of the individual, and events in the environment result in visual signals which may overwrite or impair the fidelity of WM representations, especially in early sensory cortices. Here, we evaluated the extent to which a brief, irrelevant interrupting visual stimulus presented during a spatial WM delay period impaired behavioral performance and WM representation fidelity assayed using an image reconstruction technique (inverted encoding model). On each trial, participants (both sexes) viewed two target dots and were immediately post-cued to remember the precise spatial position of one dot. On 50% of trials, a brief interrupter stimulus appeared. While we observed strong transient univariate visual responses to the distracter stimulus, we saw no change in reconstructed neural WM representations under distraction, nor a change in behavioral performance on a continuous recall task. This suggests that spatial WM representations may be particularly robust to interference from incoming task-irrelevant visual information, perhaps related to their role in guiding movements.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function pathogenic missense KCNT1 variants are associated with several developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). With few exceptions, patients are heterozygous and there is a paucity of mechanistic information about how pathogenic variants increase KNa1.1 channel activity and the behaviour of heterotetrameric channels comprising both wild-type (WT) and variant subunits. To better understand these, we selected a range of variants across the DEE spectrum, involving mutations in different protein domains and studied their functional properties. Whole-cell electrophysiology was used to characterise homomeric and heteromeric KNa1.1 channel assemblies carrying DEE-causing variants in the presence and absence of 10 mM intracellular sodium. Voltage-dependent activation of homomeric variant KNa1.1 assemblies were more hyperpolarised than WT KNa1.1 and, unlike WT KNa1.1, exhibited voltage-dependent activation in the absence of intracellular sodium. Heteromeric channels formed by co-expression of WT and variant KNa1.1 had activation kinetics intermediate of homomeric WT and variant KNa1.1 channels, with residual sodium-independent activity. In general, WT and variant KNa1.1 activation followed a single exponential, with time constants unaffected by voltage or sodium. Mutating the threonine in the KNa1.1 selectivity filter disrupted voltage-dependent activation, but sodium-dependence remained intact. Our findings suggest that KNa1.1 gating involves a sodium-dependent activation gate that modulates a voltage-dependent selectivity filter gate. Collectively, all DEE-associated KNa1.1 mutations lowered the energetic barrier for sodium-dependent activation, but some also had direct effects on selectivity filter gating. Destabilisation of the inactivated unliganded channel conformation can explain how DEE-causing amino acid substitutions in diverse regions of the channel structure all cause gain-of-function.",

These data can potentially reconstruct subcellular organization and dynamics, as well as measure disease-linked changes. However, computational methods that can derive quantitative information from such massive datasets are currently lacking. Here we present data analysis and algorithms that are broadly applicable to reveal local binding and trafficking interactions and organization of dynamic sub-cellular sites. We applied this analysis to the endoplasmic reticulum and neuronal membrane. The method is based on spatio-temporal time window segmentation that explores data at multiple levels and detects the architecture and boundaries of high density regions in areas that are hundreds of nanometers. By statistical analysis of a large number of datapoints, the present method allows measurements of nano-region stability. By connecting highly dense regions, we reconstructed the network topology of the ER, as well as molecular flow redistribution, and the local space explored by trajectories. Segmenting trajectories at appropriate scales extracts confined trajectories, allowing quantification of dynamic interactions between lysosomes and the ER. A final step of the method reveals the motion of trajectories relative to the ensemble, allowing reconstruction of dynamics in normal ER and the atlastin-null mutant. Our approach allows users to track previously inaccessible large scale dynamics at high resolution from massive datasets. The SPtsAnalysis algorithm is available as an ImageJ plugin that can be applied by users to large datasets of overlapping trajectories and offer a standard of SPTs metrics.",

    "abstract": "Brain organoid research is advancing, but generation of organoids with proper axis formation, which could lead to spatially ordered structures for complex brain structure and function, still remains a challenge. Axis formation and related spatial cell organization in the CNS are initiated by the symmetry breaking during the early embryo development. It has been demonstrated that the geometrically confined culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be used to induce symmetry breaking and regionalized cell differentiation. In this study, we generated a polarized spinal cord organoid with a self-organized dorsoventral (DV) organization, using 2D cell patterning by geometric confinement. Initially, the application of caudalization signals to hPSCs promoted the regionalized cell differentiation along the radial axis and sprouting-like protrusion morphogenesis in cell colonies confined to ECM protein micropatterns. Detachment of colonies turned them into extended spinal cord-like organoids which maintained center- and edge-derived two poles. Further analyses including single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analysis unveiled that these organoids contained rich repertoire of developing spinal cord cells and exhibited the spatially ordered DV domain formation along the long axis without external organizing signals. Modulation of BMP and Shh signaling can control the extent of DV coverage in organoids following the principles of embryo patterning. Our study provides a simple, and precisely controllable method to generate spatially-ordered organoids for understanding of biological principles of cell patterning and axis formation during neural development.",

    "abstract": "Lysosome-related organelles play evolutionarily conserved roles in zinc storage, but mechanisms that control zinc flow in and out are not well understood. In C. elegans intestinal cells, the CDF-2 transporter stores zinc in these organelles during excess. Here we identify ZIPT-2.3 as the transporter that releases zinc during deficiency. The expression levels of CDF-2 and ZIPT-2.3 are reciprocally regulated in zinc excess and deficiency, establishing a fundamental mechanism of homeostasis. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrated these organelles are composed of a spherical acidified compartment and a hemispherical expansion compartment. The expansion compartment inflates during zinc excess and deficiency by vesicle fusion delivering zinc transporters. These results identify an unexpected structural feature of lysosome-related organelles that facilitates rapid transitions in the composition of zinc transporters to mediate homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p53 is situated in the midst of a complex network that is activated in response to cellular stress. An unresolved question is how p53 activates its myriad target genes in response to the severity of the stress signal and consequently coordinates the functional outcome in a timely manner. We have previously shown that DNA torsional flexibility distinguishes among p53 response elements (REs). Here we calculated the flexibility of over 200 p53 REs. By connecting functional pathways of p53-dependent genes to the calculated flexibility of their REs, we show that genes belonging to pathways activated rapidly upon stress (e.g., cell-cycle arrest, energy metabolism and innate immunity) contain REs that are significantly more flexible relative to REs of genes involved in pathways that need to be more strictly regulated or are activated later in the response to stress (e.g., intrinsic apoptosis and p53 negative regulation). The global structural properties of several p53 REs belonging to the different pathways were experimentally validated. Additionally, reporter gene expression driven by flexible p53 REs occurred at lower p53 levels and with faster rates than expression from rigid REs. Moreover, analysis of published endogenous mRNA levels of p53 target genes as a function of the flexibility of their REs support our hypothesis. Overall, we demonstrate that DNA flexibility of p53 REs contributes significantly to the timely expression of p53 target genes and thereby plays an important role in cell-faith decisions in the p53 circuity.",

    "abstract": "Feedforward inhibitory circuits are key contributors to the complex interplay between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Little is known about the function of feedforward inhibition in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Using in vivo two-photon targeted patch clamping and calcium imaging in mice, we find that odors evoke strong excitation in two classes of interneurons - neurogliaform (NG) cells and horizontal (HZ) cells - that provide feedforward inhibition in layer 1 of the piriform cortex. NG cells fire much earlier than HZ cells following odor onset, a difference that can be attributed to the faster odor-driven excitatory synaptic drive that NG cells receive from the olfactory bulb. As a consequence, NG cells strongly but transiently inhibit odor-evoked excitation in layer 2 principal cells, whereas HZ cells provide more diffuse and prolonged feedforward inhibition. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in the operation of inhibition in the piriform cortex.",

A large proportion of the population are identified as potential S. aureus carriers yet we only partially understand the repertoire of genetic factors that promote long-term nasal colonization. Here we present a novel murine model of nasopharyngeal colonization that requires a low S. aureus inoculum and is amenable to experimental evolution approaches. We used this model to experimentally evolve S. aureus using successive passages in the nasopharynx to identify those genetic loci under selection. After 3 cycles of colonization, mutations were identified in mannitol, sorbitol, arginine, nitrite and lactate metabolism genes promoting key pathways in nasal colonization. Stress responses were identified as being under selective pressure, with mutations in DNA repair genes including dnaJ and recF and key stress response genes clpL, rpoB and ahpF. Peptidoglycan synthesis pathway genes also revealed mutations indicating potential selection for alteration of the cell surface. The infection model used here is versatile to assist decolonization and persistence studies.",

Combinations of respiratory inhibitors can have synergistic or synthetic lethal interactions suggesting that regimens with multiple bioenergetic inhibitors will drastically shorten treatment times. However, realizing this potential is hampered by a lack of on-target inhibitors and a poor understanding of which inhibitor combinations have the strongest interactions. To overcome these limitations, we have used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to characterize the consequences of transcriptionally inhibiting individual respiratory complexes and identify bioenergetic complexes that when simultaneously inhibited result in cell death. In this study, we identified known and novel synthetic lethal interactions and demonstrate how the engineering of CRISPRi-guide sequences can be used to further explore networks of interacting gene pairs. These results provide fundamental insights into the functions of and interactions between bioenergetic complexes and the utility of CRISPRi in designing drug combinations.",

    "abstract": "During hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, blood borne fungi must invade the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels to infect the deep tissues. Although Candida albicans, which forms hyphae, readily invades endothelial cells, other medically important species of Candida are poorly invasive in standard in vitro assays. Here, we show that Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei can bind to vitronectin and high molecular weight kininogen present in human serum. Acting as bridging molecules, vitronectin and kininogen bind to v integrins and the globular C1q receptor (gC1qR), inducing human endothelial cells to endocytose the fungus. This mechanism of endothelial cell invasion is poorly supported by mouse endothelial cells, but can be restored when mouse endothelial cells are engineered to express human gC1qR or v integrin. Overall, these data indicate that bridging molecule-mediated endocytosis is a common pathogenic strategy used by many medically important Candida spp. to invade human vascular endothelial cells.\n\nSignificanceThe invasion of vascular endothelial cells is a key step in the pathogenesis of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. How species of Candida other than C. albicans invade endothelial cells is poorly understood because these fungi are weakly invasive in serum-free media. Here, we demonstrate that C. glabrata and other Candida spp. bind to the serum proteins kininogen and vitronectin, which act as bridging molecules and mediate the adherence and endocytosis of the organisms by endothelial cells. These serum proteins induce endocytosis when they interact with the globular C1q receptor and v integrins on human, but not mouse endothelial cells. Thus, bridging molecule-mediated endocytosis is a common mechanism by which medically important Candida spp. invade human endothelial cells.",

The carboxyl-terminus encodes a serine/arginine-rich (RS) region and a putative RNA recognition motif, however potential RNA-processing role(s) have remained elusive for the past 20 years. Here, we show that the RS domain of human PGC-1 directly interacts with RNA and the nuclear RNA export factor NXF1. Inducible depletion of endogenous PGC-1 and expression of RNAi-resistant RS-deleted PGC-1 further demonstrate that the RNA-binding activity is required for nuclear export of co-activated transcripts and mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, a quantitative proteomics approach confirmed PGC-1-dependent RNA transport and mitochondrial-related functions, identifying also novel mRNA nuclear export targets in age-related telomere maintenance. Discovering a novel function for a major cellular homeostasis regulator provides new directions to further elucidate the roles of PGC-1 in gene expression, metabolic disorders, ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4A -- a DEAD-box RNA-binding protein -- plays an essential role in translation initiation. Two mammalian eIF4A paralogs, eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, have been assumed to be redundant because of their high homology, and the difference in their functions has been poorly understood. Here, we show that eIF4A1, but not eIF4A2, enhances translational repression during the inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), an essential kinase complex controlling cell proliferation. RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-Seq) of the two eIF4A paralogs revealed that eIF4A1 preferentially binds to mRNAs containing terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, whose translation is rapidly repressed upon mTOR inhibition. This biased interaction depends on a La-related RNA-binding protein, LARP1. Ribosome profiling revealed that the deletion of EIF4A1, but not EIF4A2, rendered the translation of TOP mRNAs resistant to mTOR inactivation. Moreover, eIF4A1 enhances the affinity between TOP mRNAs and LARP1 and thus ensures stronger translation repression upon mTORC1 inhibition. Our data show that the distinct protein interactions of these highly homologous translation factor paralogs shape protein synthesis during mTORC1 inhibition and provide a unique example of the repressive role of a universal translation activator.",

    "abstract": "Drug-inducible suicide systems may help to minimize risks of cellular therapies due to the tumor forming potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Recent research challenged the usefulness of such systems since rare drug-resistant subclones were observed that showed elimination or silencing of the transgene.\n\nWe have introduced a drug-inducible Caspase9 suicide system (iCASP9) into the AAVS1 safe harbor locus of hiPSCs. In these cells, apoptosis could be efficiently induced in vitro. In mice, drug treatment generally led to rapid elimination of teratomas, but individual animals subsequently formed tumor tissue from monoallelic iCASP9 hiPSCs. Very rare drug-resistant subclones of monoallelic iCASP9 hiPSCs appeared in vitro with frequencies of ~ 3x10-8. Transgene elimination, presumably via Loss of Heterozygosity (LoH), or methylation of the CAG promoter but not methylation of the O_SCPLOWPPPC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP1C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWRC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP12C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWCC_SCPLOW locus were identified as underlying mechanisms. In contrast, we never observed any escapees from biallelic iCASP9 hiPSCs, even after treatment of up to 0.8 billion hiPSCs.\n\nIn conclusion, biallelic integration of an iCASP9 system in the AAVS1 locus may substantially contribute to the safety level of iPSC-based therapies, which should be calculated by relating clonal escapee frequencies to the cell number in tumors of a size that is readily detectable during routine screening procedures.",

Current hypotheses suggest that herbivore consumption and impact on plants should scale positively with plant resource availability. However, depending on the effect of resources on plant quantity and quality, herbivore impact may vary with different types of resources. We test four alternative hypotheses for the relationship between plant biomass, herbivore impact on plant biomass, and plant resource gradients, each based on how resources might affect plant abundance and quality to herbivores. We measured plant biomass for four non-consecutive years in a long-term grazing exclosure experiment in the Serengeti National Park that includes seven sites that vary substantially in rainfall and soil and plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our data supported the hypothesis that herbivore impact is controlled by plant quality, in this case driven by plant P, as herbivore effects on biomass decreased with higher rainfall but increased with greater plant P, but not N content. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to indicate that wild mammalian herbivory is associated with P availability rather than N. Our results suggest that P, in addition to water and N, may play a more important role in driving trophic interactions in terrestrial systems than previously realized.",

    "abstract": "Inflammaging, characterized by an increase in low-grade chronic inflammation with age, is a hallmark of aging and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases, including chronic liver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because necroptosis is a cell death pathway that induces inflammation through the release of DAMPs, we tested the hypothesis that age-associated increase in necroptosis contributes to chronic inflammation in aging liver. Phosphorylation of MLKL and MLKL-oligomers, markers of necroptosis, as well as phosphorylation of RIPK3 and RIPK1 were significantly upregulated in the livers of old mice relative to young mice and this increase occurred in the later half of life (i.e., after 18 months of age). Markers of M1 macrophages, expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL6 and IL-1{beta}), and markers of fibrosis were significantly upregulated in the liver with age and the change in necroptosis paralleled the changes in inflammation and fibrosis. Hepatocytes and liver macrophages isolated from old mice showed elevated levels of necroptosis markers as well as increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines relative to young mice. Short term treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s), reduced necroptosis, markers of M1 macrophages, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and markers of fibrosis in the livers of old mice. Thus, our data show for the first time that liver aging is associated with increased necroptosis and necroptosis contributes to chronic inflammation in the liver, which in turn appears to contribute to liver fibrosis and possibly CLD.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/460953v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15ab761org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd7336org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d6e3bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10159eb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Sequence variation in related proteins is an important characteristic that modulates activity and selectivity. An example of a protein family with a large degree of sequence variation is that of bacterial sortases, which are cysteine transpeptidases on the surface of gram-positive bacteria. Class A sortases are responsible for attachment of diverse proteins to the cell wall to facilitate environmental adaption and interaction. These enzymes are also used in protein engineering applications for sortase-mediated ligations (SML) or sortagging of protein targets. We previously investigated SrtA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, identifying a number of putative {beta}7-{beta}8 loop-mediated interactions that affected in vitro enzyme function. We identified residues that contributed to the ability of S. pneumoniae SrtA to recognize several amino acids at the P1 position of the substrate motif, underlined in LPXTG, in contrast to the strict P1 Gly recognition of SrtA from Staphylococcus aureus. However, motivated by the lack of a structural model for the active, monomeric form of S. pneumoniae SrtA, here, we expanded our studies to other Streptococcus SrtA proteins. We solved the first monomeric structure of S. agalactiae SrtA which includes the C-terminus, and three others of {beta}7-{beta}8 loop chimeras from S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae SrtA. These structures and accompanying biochemical data support our previously identified {beta}7-{beta}8 loop-mediated interactions and provide additional insight into their role in Class A sortase substrate selectivity. We argue that a greater understanding of individual SrtA sequence and structural determinants of target selectivity can facilitate the design or discovery of improved sortagging tools.",

These structures, consisting of several layers of lipidic compartments enveloped in a dome-shaped outer lipid bilayer, emerged as a result of spontaneous shape transformation of lipid agglomerates deposited on thin film aluminum surfaces. Collective protocell structures were observed to be mechanically more stable compared to isolated spherical compartments. We show that the model colonies encapsulate DNA and accommodate non-enzymatic, strand displacement DNA reactions. The membrane envelope is able to disassemble and expose individual daughter protocells, which can migrate and attach via nano-tethers to distant surface locations, while maintaining their encapsulated contents. Some colonies feature  exo-compartments, which spontaneously extend out of the enveloping bilayer, internalize DNA, and merge again with the superstructure. A continuum elastohydrodynamic theory that we developed reveals that the subcompartment formation must be governed by attractive van der Waals (vdW) interactions between the membrane and surface. The balance between membrane bending and vdW interactions yields a critical length scale of 273 nm, above which the membrane invaginations can form subcompartments. The findings support our hypotheses that in extension of the  lipid world hypothesis, protocells may have existed in the form of colonies, potentially benefiting from the increased mechanical stability provided by a superstructure.",

    "abstract": "Yeasts are important plant-associated organisms that can modulate host immunity to either promote or prevent disease. Mechanisms of plant-yeast interactions, specifically of yeast perception by the plant innate immune system, remain unknown. Progress has been hindered by the scarcity of yeast species associated with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). We have previously isolated Taphrina strain M11 from wild Arabidopsis in the field. Taphrina are poorly studied dimorphic yeast-like fungi that are plant pathogens, often producing plant hormones and causing tumour-like and leaf deformation symptoms on their hosts. Here we characterize the interaction of M11 with Arabidopsis. Infection of Arabidopsis with the birch pathogen T. betulina, used as a non-host control, shows early HR, enhanced ROS accumulation, and limitation of growth, demonstrating that Arabidopsis had immunity against non-adapted yeasts. M11 triggered limited cell death, an attenuated ROS response, and grew in planta, as well as subtle but clear leaf deformation symptoms, demonstrating it is pathogenic. Hormone responsive promoter-reporter analysis demonstrated activation of cytokinin signalling during infection. Mutant infection assays indicate jasmonate and ethylene were required for immunity against M11. Analysis of the Taphrina M11 genome was used to mine evidence for yeast specific PAMPs which may underlie host immune responses against yeast-like fungi.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and effective therapeutic interventions are lacking. Here, we harness an integrative, network medicine approach to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for AF. We hypothesize that the use of an unbiased method for prioritizing AF drugs using patient transcriptomics data can help to identify alternative therapeutic strategies and mechanism-of-action for these drugs. To achieve this, we first characterized the molecular networks specific to AF by incorporating transcriptomic data of left atrial tissue. We quantified the network proximity of genes differentially expressed in AF to drug targets to identify putative drugs for repurposing. We identified nine high-confidence drug candidates that were validated using enrichment analysis of drug-gene signatures in human cell lines. We identified metformin for the potential treatment of AF and validated its use in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial-like cardiomyocytes. We identified AF-specific dysregulated networks enriched in cardiac metabolism, ion transport, and immune pathways that were improved following metformin treatment. In summary, this study utilized network-based approaches for rapid identification of drugs that may be repurposed for AF treatment and validated metformin as a candidate drug using a robust human atrial cell model.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular calcium dynamics in spontaneously active cells such as neurons or astrocytes is an information-rich readout of the physiological state of the cell. Methods for deriving mechanistic information from biological time courses, as well as for algorithmically extracting cellular activity time courses from imaging data, have significantly advanced in recent years but been mostly applied to neuronal data. At the same time, the role for astrocytes, a type of glial brain cells, in cognition and psychiatric diseases remains poorly understood. Using calcium imaging, computer vision, and Bayesian kinetic inference, we analyze calcium dynamics in primary astrocytes derived from control or Df1/+ mice, a model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome). Inference of highest-likelihood molecular kinetic characteristics from the intracellular calcium time courses pinpoints a significant change in the activity of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Applying a SERCA inhibitor to the control cells reproduces the differences detected in the deletion-bearing cells. Our work identifies for the first time the molecular changes driving the calcium kinetics in 22q11.2 deletion model astrocytes. We conclude that Bayesian kinetic inference is a useful tool for mechanistic dissection of a complex cellular phenotype, calcium dynamics, in glial cells. This method has the potential to facilitate formulation of specific hypotheses concerning the underlying molecular mechanisms, prioritization of experiments testing such hypotheses, and, in the future, individualized functional molecular diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Temporal filters, the ability of postsynaptic neurons to preferentially select certain presynaptic input patterns over others, have been shown to be associated with the notion of information filtering and coding of sensory inputs. Short-term plasticity (depression and facilitation; STP) has been proposed to be an important player in the generation of temporal filters. We carry out a systematic modeling, analysis and computational study to understand how characteristic postsynaptic (low-, high- and band-pass) temporal filters are generated in response to periodic presynaptic spike trains in the presence STP. We investi-gate how the dynamic properties of these filters depend on the interplay of a hierarchy of processes, including the arrival of the presynaptic spikes, the activation of STP, its effect on the excitatory synaptic connection efficacy, and the response of the postsynaptic cell. These mechanisms involve the inter-play of a collection of time scales that operate at the single-event level (roughly, during each presynaptic interspike-interval) and control the long-term development of the temporal filters over multiple presynaptic events. These time scales are generated at the levels of the presynaptic cell (captured by the presynaptic interspike-intervals), short-term depression and facilitation, synaptic dynamics and the post-synaptic cellular currents. We develop mathematical tools to link the single-event time scales with the time scales governing the long-term dynamics of the resulting temporal filters for a relatively simple model where depression and facilitation interact at the level of the synaptic efficacy change. We extend our results and tools to account for more complex models. These include multiple STP time scales and non-periodic presynaptic inputs. The results and ideas we develop have implications for the understanding of the generation of temporal filters in complex networks for which the simple feedforward network we investigate here is a building block.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis by ribosomes is critically important for gene expression in all cells. The ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are marked by numerous chemical modifications. An abundant group of rRNA modifications, present in all domains of life, is 2-O-methylation guided by box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) which are part of small ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs). Although 2-O-methylations are required for proper production of ribosomes, the mechanisms by which these modifications contribute to translation have remained elusive. Here, we show that a change in box C/D snoRNP biogenesis in actively growing yeast cells results in the production of hypo 2-O-methylated ribosomes with distinct translational properties. Using RiboMeth-Seq for the quantitative analysis of 2-O methylations, we identify site-specific perturbations of the rRNA 2-O-methylation pattern and uncover sites that are not required for ribosome production under normal conditions. Characterization of the hypo 2-O-methylated ribosomes reveals significant translational fidelity defects including frameshifting and near-cognate start codon selection. Using rRNA structural probing, we show that hypo 2-O-methylation affects the inherent dynamics of the ribosomal subunits and impacts the binding of translation factor eIF1 thereby causing translational defects. Our data reveal an unforeseen spectrum of 2-O-methylation heterogeneity in yeast rRNA and suggest a significant role for rRNA 2-O-methylation in regulating cellular translation by controlling ribosome dynamics and ligand binding.",

To enhance its clinical effectiveness and prevent nephrotoxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of trough concentrations is recommended.\n\nInitial vancomycin dosing regimens are determined based on patient characteristics such as age, body weight, and renal function, and dosing strategies to achieve therapeutic concentration windows at initial TDM have been extensively studied. Although numerous dosing nomograms for specific populations have been developed, no comprehensive strategy exists for individually tailoring initial dosing regimens; therefore, decision making regarding initial dosing largely depends on each clinicians experience and expertise.\n\nIn this study, we applied a machine-learning (ML) approach to integrate clinician knowledge into a predictive model for initial vancomycin dosing. A dataset of vancomycin initial dose plans defined by pharmacists experienced in vancomycin TDM (i.e., experts) was used to build the ML model. The target trough concentration was attained at comparable rates with the model- and expert-recommended dosing regimens, suggesting that the ML model successfully incorporated the experts knowledge. The predictive model developed here will contribute to improved decision making for initial vancomycin dosing and early attainment of therapeutic windows.",

    "abstract": "Iron is essential to key biological processes of all living organisms. Proper iron levels must be maintained to meet biological needs and prevent toxicity. Given the central role played by the hormone hepcidin in systemic iron homeostasis, extensive research has sought to identify regulators of its expression. Diverse evidence shows the gut to be an essential sensor and regulator of iron homeostasis, independently of other known hepcidin regulators, including bone marrow signals. Here we identify gut-derived serotonin as a key physiological factor in hepcidin regulation. In response to hypoxia, serotonin synthesized and secreted by enterochromaffin cells can act beyond the gut to repress hepcidin expression in the liver, through a 5-HT2B receptor-dependent pathway. Bone marrow transplant experiments clearly indicate the gut is responsible for hepcidin repression. This regulatory system appears to be conserved in humans: a significant negative correlation exists between hepcidin and serotonin levels in the serum of healthy individuals. Our findings imply hepcidin regulation by serotonin is a physiological process, and modulation of the gut serotonergic system may have broad therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Humans allocate visual working memory (WM) resource according to behavioral relevance, resulting in more precise memories for more important items. Theoretically, items may be maintained by feature-tuned neural populations, where the relative gain of the populations encoding each item determines precision. To test this hypothesis, we compared the amplitudes of delay-period activity in the different parts of retinotopic maps representing each of several WM items, predicting amplitude would track with behavioral priority. Using fMRI, we scanned participants while they remembered the location of multiple items over a WM delay, then reported the location of one probed item using a memory-guided saccade. Importantly, items were not equally probable to be probed (0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0), which was indicated with a pre-cue. We analyzed fMRI activity in ten visual field maps in occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex known to be important for visual WM. In early visual cortex, but not association cortex, the amplitude of BOLD activation within voxels corresponding to the retinotopic location of visual WM items increased with the priority of the item. Interestingly, these results were contrasted with a common finding that higher-level brain regions had greater delay-period activity, demonstrating a dissociation between the absolute amount of activity in a brain area, and the activity of different spatially-selective populations within it. These results suggest that the distribution of WM resources according to priority sculpts the relative gains of neural populations that encode items, offering a neural mechanism for how prioritization impacts memory precision.",

As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a well-known neurotoxin that functions as a defense substance for toxic puffers. Several behavioral studies reported that TTX attracts toxic puffers belonging to the genus Takifugu. Although our electrophysiological and behavioral studies showed that a TTX analog, 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX, acts as an olfactory chemoattractant for grass puffers (T. alboplumbeus), it is unclear whether toxic puffers are commonly attracted to 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX, and which types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) detect 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX.\n\nHere we investigated whether the green spotted puffer (Dichotomyctere nigroviridis), a phylogenetically different species from the grass puffer, is attracted to 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX. Administration of 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX attracted green spotted puffers, but TTX or vehicle did not. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of the olfactory epithelium exposed to 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX with an antibody against phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), a neuronal activity marker, labeled oval cells with apical invagination. These oval cells were also labeled by the antibody against S100, a specific marker of crypt OSNs. Thus, our results suggest that 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX acts as an olfactory chemoattractant that is detected by crypt-type OSNs in the olfactory epithelium of green spotted puffers. Toxic puffers may use 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX as an olfactory chemoattractant involved in reproduction and parental care or as an olfactory cue of TTX-bearing organisms for effective toxification.\n\nSummary statementBehavioral and immunohistochemical experiments suggest that an almost nontoxic TTX analog, 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX, acts as an olfactory chemoattractant for green spotted puffers, and crypt-type olfactory sensory neurons detect it.",

    "abstract": "The information that the brain transmits from one region to another is often viewed through the lens of firing rates. However, if the output neurons could vary the timing of their spikes with respect to each other, then through synchronization they could highlight information that may be critical for control of behavior. In the cerebellum, the computations that are performed by the cerebellar cortex are conveyed to the nuclei via inhibition. Yet, synchronous activity entrains nucleus neurons, making them fire. Does the cerebellar cortex rely on spike synchrony within populations of Purkinje cells (P-cells) to convey information to the nucleus? We recorded from multiple P-cells while marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and organized them into populations that shared a complex spike response to error. Before movement onset, P-cells transmitted information via a rate code: the simple spike firing rates predicted the direction and velocity of the impending saccade. However, during the saccade, the spikes became temporally aligned within the population, signaling when to stop the movement. Thus, the cerebellar cortex relies on spike synchronization within a population of P-cells, not individual firing rates, to convey to the nucleus when to stop a movement.",

    "abstract": "What features are important for circuit robustness? Reciprocal inhibition is a building block in many circuits. We used dynamic clamp to create reciprocally inhibitory circuits from pharmacologically isolated neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion by injecting artificial synaptic (ISyn) and hyperpolarization-activated inward (IH) currents. There are two mechanisms of antiphase oscillations in these circuits: \"escape\" and \"release\". In release, the active neuron primarily controls the off/on transitions. In escape, the inhibited neuron controls the transitions. We characterized the robustness of escape and release circuits to alterations in circuit parameters, temperature, and neuromodulation. We found that escape circuits rely on tight correlations between synaptic and H conductances to generate bursting but are resilient to temperature increase. Release circuits are robust to variations in synaptic and H conductances but fragile to temperature increase. The modulatory current (IMI) restores oscillations in release circuits but has little effect in escape circuits. Thus, the same perturbation can have dramatically different effects depending on the circuits mechanism of operation that may not be observable from basal circuit activity.",

    "abstract": "Barrier epithelial organs face the constant challenge of sealing the interior body from the external environment while simultaneously replacing the cells that contact this environment. These replacement cells--the progeny of basal stem cells--are born without apical, barrier-forming structures such as a protective, lumen-facing membrane and occluding junctions. How stem cell progeny acquire these structures to become part of the barrier is unknown. Here we use Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), Correlative Light-Electron Microscopy (CLEM), and volumetric imaging of live and fixed organs to investigate progenitor integration in the intestinal epithelium of adult Drosophila. We find that stem cell daughters gestate their future lumenal-apical membrane beneath a transient, basal niche formed by an umbrella-shaped occluding junction that shelters the growing cell and adheres it to mature neighbor cells. The umbrella junction both targets formation of a deep, microvilli-lined, apical invagination and closes it off from the contents of the gut lumen. When the growing cell is sufficiently mature, the umbrella junction retracts to expose this Pre-Assembled Apical Compartment (PAAC) to the gut lumen, thus incorporating the new cell into the intestinal barrier. When we block umbrella junctions, stem cell daughters grow and attempt to differentiate but fail to integrate; when we block cell growth, no umbrella junctions form and daughters arrest in early differentiation. Thus, stem cell progeny build new barrier structures in the shelter of a transient niche, where they are protected from lumenal insults until they are prepared to withstand them. By coordinating this dynamic junctional niche with progenitor cell differentiation, a physiologically active epithelial organ incorporates new cells while upholding integrity of its barrier.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic interactions change with environmental context. Measuring these context-dependent effects in hosts and symbionts is critical to determining the nature of symbiotic interactions. We investigated context-dependence in the symbiosis between social amoeba hosts and their inedible Paraburkholderia bacterial symbionts, where the context is the abundance of host food bacteria. Paraburkholderia have been shown to harm hosts dispersed to food-rich environments, but aid hosts dispersed to food-poor environments by allowing hosts to carry food bacteria. Through measuring symbiont density and host spore production, we show that this food context matters in three other ways. First, it matters for symbionts, who suffer a greater cost from competition with food bacteria in the food-rich context. Second, it matters for host-symbiont conflict, changing how symbiont density negatively impacts host spore production. Third, data-based simulations show that symbiosis often provides a long-term fitness advantage for hosts after rounds of growth and dispersal in variable food-contexts, especially when conditions are harsh with little food. These results show how food context can have many consequences for the Dictyostelium-Paraburkholderia symbiosis and that both sides can frequently benefit.\n\nImpact StatementMany organisms form symbiotic relationships with other species. These symbioses often exhibit context-dependence, where the sign or magnitude of one partners effect on the other will change in different environments. Context-dependent effects make it difficult to assign interactions to categories like mutualisms or antagonisms because they involve both benefits and costs depending on the environment. However, in some cases, accounting for context-dependence can clarify an interaction so that it more easily fits a mutualism or antagonism. We investigated context-dependence using the symbiosis between Dictyostelium discoideum and two symbiotic Paraburkholderia species. In this symbiosis, Paraburkholderia bacteria allow hosts to carry food bacteria to food-poor contexts, where hosts rarely survive without food, but reduce host fitness in the more hospitable food-rich contexts. The effect of food context on Paraburkholderia symbionts is unknown. We show that Paraburkholderia symbionts are also affected by this context, through facing reduced competition after being dispersed by hosts to food-poor contexts. We also identify a new way that symbionts affect hosts, where symbiont density reduces host fitness, but less so in food-poor contexts. Finally, we use simulations to show that infected hosts benefit in the long-term across variable food contexts, especially in the harshest environments with little food. These results show that context-dependence in symbiosis can have many consequences for hosts and symbionts, though in general for D. discoideum and Paraburkholderia, both are likely to benefit.",

Further exploration and assessment of the laboratory and bioinformatics strategies are warranted to unlock the potential of metabarcoding-inferred population genetic analysis. Here, we assessed the inference of freshwater macroinvertebrate haplotypes from DNA metabarcoding data using mock samples with known Sanger-sequenced haplotypes. We also examined the influence of different DNA template concentrations and PCR cycles on detecting true haplotypes and the reduction of spurious haplotypes obtained from DNA metabarcoding. We tested our haplotyping strategy on a mock sample containing 20 specimens from four species with known haplotypes based on the 658-bp Folmer region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene. The read processing and denoising step resulted in 14 zero-radius operational taxonomic units (ZOTUs) of 421-bp length, with 12 ZOTUs having 100% match with 12 of the Sanger haplotype sequences. Quality passing reads relatively increased with increasing PCR cycles, and the relative abundance of each ZOTUs was consistent for each cycle number. This suggests that increasing the cycle number from 24 to 64 did not affect the relative abundance of quality passing filter reads of each ZOTUs. Our study demonstrated the ability of DNA metabarcoding to infer intraspecific variability while highlighting the challenges that need to be addressed before its possible applications to population genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "The rooting zone water storage capacity (S0) extends from the soil surface to the weathered bedrock (the Critical Zone) and determines land-atmosphere exchange during dry periods. Despite its importance to land-surface modeling, variations of S0 across space are largely unknown as they cannot be observed directly. We developed a method to diagnose global variations of S0 from the relationship between vegetation activity (measured by sun-induced fluorescence and by the evaporative fraction) and the cumulative water deficit (CWD). We then show that spatial variations in S0 can be predicted from the assumption that plants are adapted to sustain CWD extremes occurring with a return period that is related to the life form of dominant plants and the large-scale topographical setting. Predicted biome-level S0 distributions, translated to an apparent rooting depth (zr) by accounting for soil texture, are consistent with observations from a comprehensive zr dataset. Large spatial variations in S0 across the globe reflect adaptation of zr to the hydroclimate and topography and implies large heterogeneity in the sensitivity of vegetation activity to drought. The magnitude of S0 inferred for most of the Earths vegetated regions and particularly for those with a large seasonality in their hydroclimate indicates an important role for plant access to water stored at depth - beyond the soil layers commonly considered in land-surface models.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of local adaptations is a central aim of evolutionary biology and key for the identification of unique populations and lineages of conservation relevance. By combining RAD sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identify genetic signatures of local adaptation in mountain hares (Lepus timidus) from isolated and distinctive habitats of its wide distribution: Ireland, the Alps and Fennoscandia. Demographic modelling suggested that the split of these mountain hares occurred around 20 thousand years ago, providing the opportunity to study adaptive evolution over a short timescale. Using genome-wide scans, we identified signatures of extreme differentiation among hares from distinct geographic areas that overlap with area-specific selective sweeps, suggesting targets for local adaptation. Several identified candidate genes are associated with traits related to the uniqueness of the different environments inhabited by the three groups of mountain hares, including coat colour, ability to live at high altitudes and variation in body size. In Irish mountain hares, a variant of ASIP, a gene previously implicated in introgression-driven winter coat colour variation in mountain and snowshoe hares (L. americanus), may underlie brown winter coats, reinforcing the repeated nature of evolution at ASIP moulding adaptive seasonal colouration. Comparative genomic analyses across several hare species suggested that mountain hares adaptive variants appear predominantly species-specific. However, using coalescent simulations we also show instances where the candidate adaptive variants have been introduced via introgressive hybridization. Our work shows that standing adaptive variation, including that introgressed from other species, was a crucial component of the post-glacial dynamics of species.",

    "abstract": "Along with specialized functions, cells of multicellular organisms also perform essential functions. Whether diverse cells do this by using the same set of genes, interacting in a fixed coordinated fashion, remains a central question in biology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression of individual cells, enabling researchers to discover gene expression patterns that contribute to the diversity of cell functions. Current efforts focus primarily on identifying differentially expressed genes. However, patterns of co-expression between genes are more indicative of biological processes than are the expression of individual genes. Here, we constructed cell type-specific gene co-expression networks using the fly brain transcriptome atlas to search for a core cellular network. We detected a set of highly coordinated genes preserved across cell types and defined this set as the core network. This network was further validated through two additional datasets profiling fly brains or heads. This core has a small size and shows dense connectivity. Modules within this core are enriched for basic cellular functions and gene members of these modules have distinct evolutionary signatures. Overall, we demonstrated that a core cellular network exists in diverse cell types of fly brains and this core exhibits unique topological, structural, functional and evolutionary properties.",

    "abstract": "Collateral arteries are a vessel subtype that bridges two artery branches, forming a natural bypass that can deliver blood flow downstream of an occlusion. These bridges in the human heart are associated with better outcomes during coronary artery disease. We recently found that their rapid development in neonates supports heart regeneration, while the non-regenerative adult heart displays slow and minimal collateralization. Thus, inducing robust collateral artery networks could serve as viable treatment for cardiac ischemia, but reaching this goal requires more knowledge on their developmental mechanisms and functional capabilities. Here, we use whole-organ imaging and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to identify the spatial architecture of and predict blood flow through collaterals in neonate and adult hearts. We found that neonate collaterals are more numerous, larger in diameter, and, even when similar in size/number, are predicted to more effectively re-perfuse an occluded coronary network when compared to adults. CFD analysis revealed that collaterals perform better in neonates because of decreased differential pressures along their coronary artery tree. Furthermore, testing of various collateral configurations indicated that larger, more proximal collaterals are more beneficial than many smaller ones, identifying a target architecture for therapeutic interventions. Morphometric analysis revealed how the coronary artery network expands during postnatal growth. Vessel diameters do not scale with cardiac muscle growth. Instead, the coronary tree expands solely by adding additional branches of a set length, a burst of which occurs during murine puberty. Finally, we compared mouse structural and functional data to human hearts. Surprisingly, fetal human hearts possessed a very large number of small, but mature, smooth muscle cell covered collaterals while angiogram data indicated adult patients with chronic coronary occlusions contained at least two. Comparing size ratios with modeled mouse data suggested low re-perfusion capabilities of the embryonic collaterals but higher functional benefits of those in diseased adults. Our unique interdisciplinary approach allowed us to quantify the functional significance of collateral arteries during heart regeneration and repair-a critical step towards realizing their therapeutic potential.",

We present here an approach to evaluating cell segmentation methods without relying upon comparison to results from humans. For this, we defined a number of segmentation quality metrics that can be applied to multichannel fluorescence images. We calculated these metrics for 14 previously-described segmentation methods applied to datasets from 4 multiplexed microscope modalities covering 5 tissues. Using principal component analysis to combine the metrics we defined an overall cell segmentation quality score and ranked the segmentation methods. We found that two deep learning-based methods performed the best overall, but that results for all methods could be significantly improved by postprocessing to ensure proper matching of cell and nuclear masks. Our evaluation tool is available as open source and all code and data are available in a Reproducible Research Archive.",

    "abstract": "Human tumors are characterized by extensive intratumoral transcriptional variability within the cancer cell and stromal compartments. This variation drives phenotypic heterogeneity, producing cell states with differential pro- and anti-tumorigenic properties. While bulk RNA sequencing cannot achieve cell type specific transcriptional granularity, single cell sequencing has permitted an unprecedented view of these cell states. Despite this knowledge, we lack an understanding of the mechanistic drivers of this transcriptional and phenotypic heterogeneity. 3 untranslated region alternative polyadenylation (3 UTR-APA) drives gene expression alterations through regulation of 3 UTR length. These 3 UTR alterations modulate mRNA stability, protein expression and protein localization, resulting in cellular phenotypes including differentiation, cell proliferation, and migration. Therefore, we sought to determine whether 3 UTR-APA events could characterize phenotypic heterogeneity of tumor cell states. Here we analyze the largest single cell human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) dataset and resolve 3 UTR-APA patterns across PDAC cell states. We find that increased proximal 3 UTR-APA is associated with PDAC progression and characterizes a metastatic ductal epithelial subpopulation and an inflammatory fibroblast population. Furthermore, we find significant 3 UTR shortening events in cell state-specific marker genes associated with increased expression. Therefore, we propose that 3 UTR-APA drives phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer.",
