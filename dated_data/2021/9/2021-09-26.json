    "abstract": "During adverse conditions, mammalian cells regulate protein production by sequestering the translational machinery in membrane-less organelles known as stress granules. Here, we found that activation of the G protein subunit Gq promoted the formation of particles that contained stress granule proteins through a mechanism linked to the presence of phospholipase C{beta}1 (PLC{beta}1) in the cytosol. In experiments with PC12 and A10 cells, we showed that under basal conditions, cytosolic PLC{beta}1 bound to stress granule associated proteins, including PABPC1, eIF5A, and Ago2. Knockdown of cytosolic PLC{beta}1 with siRNA or promoting its relocalization to the plasma membrane by activating Gq resulted in the formation of particles containing the stress granule markers, PABPC1, G3BP1, and Ago2. Our studies showed that the composition of these particles resemble those formed under osmotic stress and are distinct from those formed by other stresses. Our results fit a simple thermodynamic model in which cytosolic PLC{beta}1 solubilizes stress granule proteins such that its movement to activated Gq releases these particles to enable the formation of stress granules. Together, our data are suggestive of a link between Gq-coupled signals and protein translation through stress granule formation.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive abilities allow animals to navigate through complex, fluctuating environments. In the present study, we tested the performance of a captive group of eight crows, Corvus corone, and ten domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, in the cylinder task, as a test of motor inhibitory control, and reversal learning as a measure of learning ability and behavioural flexibility. Four crows and nine chickens completed the cylinder task, eight crows and six chickens completed the reversal learning experiment. Crows performed better in the cylinder task compared to chickens. In the reversal learning experiment, species did not significantly differ in the number of trials until learning criterion was reached. Performance in the reversal learning experiment did not correlate with performance in the cylinder task in chickens. Our results suggest crows to possess better motor inhibitory control compared to chickens. In contrast, learning performance in a reversal learning task did not differ between the species, indicating similar levels of behavioural flexibility. Interestingly, we describe notable individual differences in performance. We stress the importance not only to compare cognitive performance between species but also between individuals of the same species when investigating the evolution of cognitive skills.",

Recent single-cell transcriptomic data provide new opportunities for quantifying this originally conceptual tool, offering insight into the gene regulatory networks underlying cellular development. While many methods for constructing the landscape have been proposed, by far the most commonly employed approach is based on computing the landscape as the negative logarithm of the steady-state probability distribution. Here, we use simple models to highlight the complexities and limitations that arise when reconstructing the potential landscape in the presence of stochastic fluctuations. We consider how the landscape changes in accordance with different stochastic systems, and show that it is the subtle interplay between the deterministic and stochastic components of the system that ultimately shapes the landscape. We further discuss how the presence of noise has important implications for the identifiability of the regulatory dynamics from experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are host-encoded antibiotics that combat invading pathogens. These genes commonly encode multiple products as post-translationally cleaved polypeptides. Recent studies have highlighted roles for AMPs in neurological contexts suggesting functions for these defence molecules beyond infection. During our immune study characterizing the antimicrobial peptide gene Baramicin, we recovered multiple Baramicin paralogs in Drosophila melanogaster and other species, united by their N-terminal IM24 domain. Not all paralogs were immune-induced. Here, through careful dissection of the Baramicin familys evolutionary history, we find that these non-immune paralogs result from repeated events of duplication and subsequent truncation of the coding sequence from an immune-inducible ancestor. These truncations leave only the IM24 domain as the prominent gene product. Surprisingly, using mutation and targeted gene silencing we demonstrate that two such genes are adapted for function in neural contexts in D. melanogaster. We also show enrichment in the head for independent Baramicin genes in other species. The Baramicin evolutionary history reveals that the IM24 Baramicin domain is not strictly useful in an immune context. We thus provide a case study for how an AMP-encoding gene might play dual roles in both immune and non-immune processes via its multiple peptide products. We reflect on these findings to highlight a blind spot in the way researchers approach AMP research in in vivo contexts.\n\nSignificance statementAntimicrobial peptides are immune proteins recently implicated in neurological roles. To date little attention has been paid to the contributions of different gene products in this function. Here we show that an antimicrobial peptide gene encodes multiple products with either immune-specific or neurological roles.",

    "abstract": "Microbial nitrification is a critical process governing nitrogen availability in aquatic systems. Freshwater nitrifiers have received little attention, leaving many unanswered questions about their taxonomic distribution, functional potential, and ecological interactions. Here, we reconstructed genomes to infer the metabolism and ecology of free-living picoplanktonic nitrifiers across the Laurentian Great Lakes, a connected series of five of Earths largest lakes. Surprisingly, ammonia oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) related to Nitrosospira dominated over ammonia oxidizing Archaea (AOA) at nearly all stations, with distinct ecotypes prevailing in the transparent, oligotrophic upper lakes compared to Lakes Erie and Ontario. Unexpectedly, one ecotype of Nitrosospira encodes proteorhodopsin, which could enhance survival in conditions where ammonia oxidation is inhibited or substrate limited. Nitrite oxidizing Bacteria (NOB) Ca. Nitrotoga and Nitrospira fluctuated in dominance, with the latter prevailing in deeper, less productive basins. Genome reconstructions reveal highly reduced genomes and features consistent with genome streamlining, along with diverse adaptations to sunlight and oxidative stress and widespread capacity for organic nitrogen use. Our findings expand the known functional diversity of nitrifiers and establish their ecological genomics in large lake ecosystems. By elucidating links between microbial biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, our work also informs ecosystem models of the Laurentian Great Lakes, a critical freshwater resource experiencing rapid environmental change.\n\nImportanceMicroorganisms play critical roles in Earths nitrogen cycle. In lakes, microorganisms called nitrifiers derive energy from reduced nitrogen compounds. In doing so, they transform nitrogen into a form that can ultimately be lost to the atmosphere by a process called denitrification, which helps mitigate nitrogen pollution from fertilizer runoff and sewage. Despite their importance, freshwater nitrifiers are virtually unexplored. To understand their diversity and function, we reconstructed genomes of freshwater nitrifiers across some of Earths largest freshwater lakes, the Laurentian Great Lakes. We discovered several new species of nitrifiers specialized for clear low nutrient waters, and distinct species in comparatively turbid Lake Erie. Surprisingly, one species may be able to harness light energy using a protein called proteorhodopsin, despite the fact that nitrifiers typically live in deep dark water. Our work reveals unique biodiversity of the Great Lakes and fills key gaps in our knowledge of an important microbial group, the nitrifiers.",

Significant membrane remodeling as in endo- and exocytosis is often due to aggregates of many proteins with direct or membrane-mediated interactions. Understanding this process via computer simulations is extremely challenging: protein-membrane systems involve time- and lengthscales that make atomistic simulations impractical, while most coarse-grained models fall short in resolving dynamics and physical effects of protein and membrane flexibility. Here, we develop a coarse-grained model of the bilayer membrane bestrewed with rotationally-symmetric flexible proteins, parametrized to reflect local curvatures and lateral dynamics of proteins. We investigate the kinetics, equilibrium distributions, and the free energy landscape governing the formation and break-up of protein clusters on the surface of the membrane. We demonstrate how the flexibility of the proteins as well as their surface concentration play deciding roles in highly selective macroscopic aggregation behavior.",

Machine learning narrows the gap through predictions from expert-designed input features leveraging information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) that is resource expensive to generate. Here, we showcased using embeddings from protein language models (pLMs) for competitive localization prediction without MSAs. Our lightweight deep neural network architecture used a softmax weighted aggregation mechanism with linear complexity in sequence length referred to as light attention (LA). The method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ten localization classes by about eight percentage points (Q10). So far, this might be the highest improvement of just embeddings over MSAs. Our new test set highlighted the limits of standard static data sets: while inviting new models, they might not suffice to claim improvements over the SOTA.\n\nAvailabilityOnline predictions are available at http://embed.protein.properties.

    "abstract": "We leverage the interplay between microscopic variability and macroscopic order to connect physical descriptions across scales directly from data, without underlying equations. We reconstruct a state space by concatenating measurements in time, building a maximum entropy partition of the resulting sequences, and choosing the sequence length to maximize predictive information. Trading non-linear trajectories for linear, ensemble evolution, we analyze reconstructed dynamics through transfer operators. The evolution is parameterized by a transition time{tau} : capturing the source entropy rate at small{tau} and revealing timescale separation with collective, coherent states through the operator spectrum at larger{tau} . Applicable to both deterministic and stochastic systems, we illustrate our approach through the Langevin dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential and the Lorenz system. Applied to the behavior of the nematode worm C. elegans, we derive a \"run-and-pirouette\" navigation strategy directly from posture dynamics. We demonstrate how sequences simulated from the ensemble evolution capture both fine scale posture dynamics and large scale effective diffusion in the worms centroid trajectories and introduce a top-down, operator-based clustering which reveals subtle subdivisions of the \"run\" behavior.\n\nPOPULAR SUMMARYComplex structure is often composed from a limited set of relatively simple building blocks; such as novels from letters or proteins from amino acids. In musical composition, e.g., sounds and silences combine to form longer time scale structures; motifs form passages which in turn form movements. The challenge we address is how to identify collective variables which distinguish structures across such disparate time scales. We introduce a principled framework for learning effective descriptions directly from observations. Just as a musical piece transitions from one movement to the next, the collective dynamics we infer consists of transitions between macroscopic states, like jumps between metastable states in an effective potential landscape.\n\nThe statistics of these transitions are captured compactly by transfer operators. These operators play a central role, guiding the construction of maximally-predictive short-time states from incomplete measurements and identifying collective modes via eigenvalue decomposition. We demonstrate our analysis in both stochastic and deterministic systems, and with an application to the movement dynamics of an entire organism, unravelling new insight in long time scale behavioral states directly from measurements of posture dynamics. We can, in principle, also make connections to both longer or shorter timescales. Microscopically, postural dynamics result from the fine scale interactions of actin and myosin in the muscles, and from electrical impulses in the brain and nervous system. Macroscopically, behavioral dynamics may be extended to longer time scales, to moods or dispositions, including changes during aging, or over generations due to ecological or evolutionary adaptation. The generality of our approach provides opportunity for insights on long term dynamics within a wide variety of complex systems.",

    "abstract": "The flexible and sophisticated movement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract implies the involvement of mechanisms other than enteric neural circuits, to coordinate excitation in microregions. We thus performed microimaging of pacemaker dynamics in the small intestine of mice since it contains typical network-forming pacemaker cells. A dialysis membrane-reinforced low-impedance microelectrode array (MEA) enabled field potentials over a wide frequency range to be stably measured in microregions. The pacemaker dynamics were classified into basic patterns despite large variations. In the developmental process, pacemaker activity was categorized as either an  expanding or a  migrating pattern that was initiated in or propagated to the MEA sensing area, respectively. The intercellular current of the volume conductor complicated the waveform of both activities. The existence of  expanding and  migrating patterns was attributable to duplicated pacemaker systems such as intracellular Ca2+ oscillation-activated and voltage-gated mechanisms. Additionally, from the spatio-temporal feature during the period of pacemaker events, the  bumpy/aberrant pattern was defined by aberrant, incoherent propagation, and associated with local impairment of excitability, while the  colliding/converging pattern involved the interaction of multiple activities in the MEA area. Interconversion between the four micro-coordination patterns occurred in the same microregion. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) promoted  migrating activity, implying an improvement or restoration of spatial conductivity. These results agree well with the action of 5-HT to change GI movement toward propulsion. In conclusion, our MEA method of microimaging classification enables the quantitative assessment of spatio-temporal electric coordination underlying GI motility, suggesting its application to small model animals.",

    "abstract": "In patch foraging tasks, animals must decide whether to remain with a depleting resource or to leave it in search of a potentially better source of reward. In such tasks, animals consistently follow the general predictions of optimal foraging theory (the Marginal Value Theorem; MVT): to leave a patch when the reward rate in the current patch depletes to the average reward rate across patches. Prior studies implicate an important role for the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in foraging decisions based on MVT: within single trials, ACC activity increases immediately preceding foraging decisions, and across trials, these dynamics are modulated as the value of staying in the patch depletes to the average reward rate. Here, we test whether these activity patterns reflect dynamic encoding of decision-variables and whether these signals are directly involved in decision-making. We developed a leaky accumulator model based on the MVT that generates estimates of decision variables within and across trials, and tested model predictions against ACC activity recorded from rats performing a patch foraging task. Model predicted changes in MVT decision variables closely matched rat ACC activity. Next, we pharmacologically inactivated ACC to test the contribution of these signals to decision-making. ACC inactivation had a profound effect on rats foraging decisions and response times yet rats still followed the MVT decision rule. These findings suggest that the ACC encodes foraging-related variables for reasons unrelated to patch-leaving decisions.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported advanced treatments for depressive symptoms, such as real-time neurofeedback (NF) with functional MRI (fMRI) and/or electroencephalogram (EEG). NF focusing on a regularization of brain activity associated with the amygdala or functional connectivity (FC) between the executive control network (ECN) and default mode network (DMN) has been applied to reduce depressive symptoms. However, it is practically difficult to install the fMRI-NF system and to consistently provide treatment, because of high cost. Additionally, no practical signal processing techniques have been developed extracting FC-related features from EEG signals, particularly when no physical forward models are available. In this regard, stacked pooling and linear components estimation (SPLICE), recently proposed as a multilayer extension of independent component analysis (ICA) and related independent subspace analysis (ISA), can be a promising alternative. The resting-state EEG network features can be correlated with fMRI network activity corresponding to the DMN or ECN. This may enable the modulation of the target FC-related features in EEG-based NF.\n\nIn this study, we developed a real-time EEG NF system for improving depressive symptoms by using the SPLICE. Utilizing information from the fMRI biomarkers, we evaluated our paradigm for effectiveness with regard to upregulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex /middle frontal gyrus or downregulation of the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex. We conducted an NF experiment in participants with subclinical depression; the participants were divided into the NF group (n=8) and the sham group (n=9). We found a significant reduction and a large effect size in the rumination response scale (RRS) score (reflection) in the NF group, compared to the sham group.\n\nHowever, we did not find a significant relationship between the training score and difference in symptoms. This suggests that increased controllability of the EEG signals did not directly reduce the RRS reflection score. This could be due to various reasons such as improper feature extraction, individual differences, and the targeted brain regions. In this paper, we also discuss the possible ways to modify our NF protocol including the design of the experiment, sample size, and online processing. We then discuss way to improve the NF training, based on our results.",

    "abstract": "The functioning of tissues is fundamentally dependent upon not only the phenotypes of the constituent cells but also their spatial organization in the tissue. However, acquisition of comprehensive transcriptomes of spatially- and phenotypically-defined cells in situ remains challenging. Here we present a general and robust method based on immunofluorescence-guided laser capture microdissection (immuno-LCM-RNAseq) to acquire finely resolved spatial transcriptomes including isoforms with as few as tens of cells from snap-frozen or RNAlater-treated clinical tissues, circumventing the problem of significant RNA degradation during this time-consuming process. The efficacy of this approach is exemplified by the characterization of differences at the transcript isoform level between the mouse small intestine lacteal cells at the tip versus the main capillary body. With the extensive repertoire of specific antibodies that are presently available, our method provides a powerful means by which spatially resolved cellular states can now be delineated in situ with preserved tissues. Moreover, such high quality spatial transcriptomes defined by immunomarkers can be used to compare with the phenotypes derived from single-cell RNAseq of dissociated cells as well as applied to bead-based spatial transcriptomic approaches that require such information a priori for cell identification.",

    "abstract": "To guide social interaction, people often rely on expectations about the traits of other people based on markers of social group membership, i.e., stereotypes. Although the influence of stereotypes on social behavior is widespread, key questions remain about how traits inferred from social group membership are instantiated in the brain and incorporated into neural computations that guide social behavior. Here, we show that the human lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents the content of stereotypes about members of different social groups in the service of social decision-making. During fMRI scanning, participants decided how to distribute resources across themselves and members of a variety of social groups in a modified Dictator Game. Behaviorally, we replicated our recent finding that perceptions of others traits, captured by a two-dimensional framework of stereotype content (warmth and competence), biased participants monetary allocation choices in a context-dependent manner: recipients warmth increased advantageous inequity aversion and their competence increased disadvantageous inequity aversion. Neurally, representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that perceptions of others traits in the two-dimensional space were represented in the temporoparietal junction and superior temporal sulcus, two regions associated with mentalizing, and in the lateral OFC, known to represent latent environmental features during goal-directed outcome inference outside the social domain. Critically, only the latter predicted individual choices, suggesting that the effect of stereotypes on behavior is mediated by inference-based, domain-general decision-making processes in the OFC.",

    "abstract": "The precursor of heme, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), accumulates abundantly in the uterus of birds, such as Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, resulting in brown-speckled eggshells. The molecular basis of PPIX production in the uterus remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the cause of low PPIX production in a classical Japanese quail mutant exhibiting white eggshells by comparing its gene expression in the uterus with that of the wild type using transcriptome analysis and performed genetic linkage mapping to identify the causative genomic region of the white eggshell phenotype. We showed that 11 genes, including the 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) and ferroxidase hephaestin-like 1 (HEPHL1) genes, were specifically upregulated in the wild-type uterus and downregulated in the mutant. We mapped the 172 kb candidate genomic region on chromosome 6, which contains several genes, including a part of the paired-like homeodomain 3 (PITX3), which encodes a transcription factor. ALAS1, HEPHL1, and PITX3 were expressed in the apical cells of the luminal epithelium and lamina propria cells of the uterine mucosa of the wild-type quail, and their expression was downregulated in these cells of the mutant quail. Biochemical analysis using uterine homogenates indicated that the restricted availability of 5-aminolevulinic acid is the main cause of low PPIX production. These results suggest that uterus-specific transcriptional regulation of heme-biosynthesis-related genes is an evolutionarily acquired mechanism of eggshell pigment production in Japanese quail.",

In this study, employing chemical, compositional, and NMR methods, we show that GAC is attached to peptidoglycan via glucosamine 1-phosphate. This structural feature makes the GAC-peptidoglycan linkage highly sensitive to cleavage by nitrous acid and resistant to mild acid conditions. Using this characteristic of the GAS cell wall, we identify PplD as a protein required for deacetylation of linkage N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). X-ray structural analysis indicates that PplD performs catalysis via a modified acid/base mechanism. Genetic surveys in silico together with functional analysis indicate that PplD homologs deacetylate the polysaccharide linkage in many streptococcal species.

    "abstract": "In many animals, there is a direct correspondence between the motor patterns that drive locomotion and the motor neuron innervation onto the muscle groups. For example, the adult C. elegans moves with symmetric and alternating dorsal-ventral bending waves arising from symmetric motor neuron input onto the dorsal and ventral muscles. In contrast to the adult, the C. elegans motor circuit at the juvenile larval stage has asymmetric wiring between motor neurons and muscles, but still generates adult-like bending waves with dorsal-ventral symmetry. We show that in the juvenile circuit, wiring between excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons coordinates the contraction of dorsal muscles with relaxation of ventral muscles, producing dorsal bends. However, ventral bending is not driven by analogous wiring. Instead, ventral muscles are excited uniformly by premotor interneurons through extrasynaptic signaling. Ventral bends occur in anti-phasic entrainment to activity of the same motor neurons that drive dorsal bends. During maturation, the juvenile motor circuit is replaced by two motor subcircuits that separately drive dorsal and ventral bending. Modeling reveals that the juveniles immature motor circuit is an adequate solution to generate adult-like dorsal-ventral bending before the animal matures. Developmental rewiring between functionally degenerate circuit solutions, that both generate symmetric bending patterns, minimizes behavioral disruption across maturation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIC. elegans larvae generate symmetric motor pattern with an asymmetrically wired motor circuit.\nC_LIO_LISynaptic wiring between excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons drives dorsal bending.\nC_LIO_LIExtrasynaptic excitation by premotor interneurons entrains ventral muscles for anti-phasic ventral bending.\nC_LIO_LIA developmental strategy to enable mature motor pattern before the circuit structurally matures.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Natural selection is believed to universally work to lower mutation rates (MR) due to the negative impact of mutations on individual fitness. Mutator alleles have been found to be co-selected by genetic linkage with adaptive alleles in asexual organisms. However, sexual reproduction substantially reduces genetic linkage, allowing selection to efficiently eradicate mutator alleles. The current understanding, therefore, largely postulates that in sexually reproducing populations selection always works to lower MR, limited by the effective population size that determines the overall selection efficiency. In the present paper, we apply in silico experimentation based on the Monte Carlo approach of a sexually reproducing population and demonstrate that selection acting on MR does not universally favor lower MR but depends on the mode of selection acting on adaptive phenotypic traits. We demonstrate a unique previously unreported co-selective process that can drive the evolution of higher MR in sexually reproducing populations. Our results show that MR evolution is also significantly influenced by multigenic inheritance of both MR and adaptive traits. Our study corroborates that MR evolution is significantly impacted by genetic drift; however, its primary source appears to be the amount of genetic variation present in the population under selection, with a lesser role for population size. Based on our study, we propose an expanded population genetics theory of the evolution of mutation rates in sexually reproducing populations. Our results have potential implications for understanding processes underlying rapid adaptive change in speciation and related macroevolutionary patterns.",

    "abstract": "The fast-advancing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to study the transcriptome of heterogeneous tissues at a single cell level. The initial important step of analyzing scRNA-seq data is usually to accurately annotate cells. The traditional approach of annotating cell types based on unsupervised clustering and marker genes is time-consuming and laborious. Taking advantage of the numerous existing scRNA-seq databases, many supervised label assignment methods have been developed. One feature that many label assignment methods shares is to label cells with low confidence as \"unassigned.\" These unassigned cells can be the result of assignment difficulties due to highly similar cell types or caused by the presence of unknown cell types. However, when unknown cell types are not expected, existing methods still label a considerable number of cells as unassigned, which is not desirable. In this work, we develop a neural network-based cell annotation method called NeuCA (Neural network-based Cell Annotation) for scRNA-seq data obtained from well-studied tissues. NeuCA can utilize the hierarchical structure information of the cell types to improve the annotation accuracy, which is especially helpful when data contain closely correlated cell types. We show that NeuCA can achieve more accurate cell annotation results compared with existing methods. Additionally, the applications on eight real datasets show that NeuCA has stable performance for intra- and inter-study annotation, as well as cross-condition annotation. NeuCA is freely available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/NeuCA.",

A systematic evaluation study on 649 pairs of cross-species datasets showed that CAME outperformed six benchmarking methods in terms of cell-type assignment and model robustness to insufficiency and inconsistency of sequencing depths. Comparative analyses of the major types of human and mouse brains by CAME revealed shared cell type-specific functions in homologous gene modules. Alignment of the trajectories of human and macaque spermatogenesis by CAME revealed conservative gene expression dynamics during spermatogenesis between humans and macaques. Owing to the utilization of non-one-to-one homologous gene mappings, CAME made a significant improvement on cell-type characterization cross zebrafish and other species. Overall, CAME can not only make an effective cross-species assignment of cell types on scRNA-seq data but also reveal evolutionary conservative and divergent features between species.",

    "abstract": "Super enhancers (SEs) are broad enhancer domains usually containing multiple constituent enhancers that hold elevated activities in gene regulation. Disruption in one or more constituent enhancers causes aberrant SE activities that lead to gene dysregulation in diseases. To quantify SE aberrations, differential analysis is performed to compare SE activities between cell conditions. The state-of-art strategy in estimating differential SEs relies on overall activities and neglect the changes in length and structure of SEs. Here, we propose a novel computational method to identify differential SEs by weighting the combinatorial effects of constituent-enhancer activities and locations (i.e., internal dynamics). In addition to overall activity changes, our method identified four novel classes of differential SEs with distinct enhancer structural alterations. We demonstrate that these structure alterations hold distinct regulatory impact, such as regulating different number of genes and modulating gene expression with different strengths, highlighting the differentiated regulatory roles of these unexplored SE features. When compared to the existing method, our method showed improved identification of differential SEs that were linked to better discernment of cell-type-specific SE activity and functional interpretation. We implement an R package, DASE, to facilitate the use of our method.",

We used it to characterize substrate binding to the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that triggers chromosome segregation. We find that SLiMs in APC/C substrates (the D box and KEN box) display distinct affinities and specificities for the substrate-binding subunits of the APC/C, and we show that multiple SLiMs in a substrate generate a high-affinity multivalent interaction. The remarkably adaptable substrate-binding mechanisms of the APC/C have the potential to govern the order of substrate destruction in mitosis.",

Recent progress has shown that genomic structural variants (SVs) have contributed to gene expression dynamics during tomato domestication, resulting in changes of important traits. Here, through comprehensive analyses of small RNAs (sRNAs) from nine representative tomato accessions, we demonstrate that SVs substantially contribute to the dynamic expression of the three major classes of plant sRNAs: microRNAs (miRNAs), phased secondary short interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), and 24-nt heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs). Changes in the abundance of phasiRNAs and 24-nt hc-siRNAs likely contribute to the alteration of mRNA gene expression during tomatos recent evolution, particularly for genes associated with biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. We also observe that miRNA expression dynamics are associated with imprecise processing, alternative miRNA-miRNA* selections, and SVs. SVs mainly affect the expression of less-conserved miRNAs that do not have established regulatory functions or low abundant members in highly expressed miRNA families, highlighting different selection pressures on miRNAs compared to phasiRNAs and 24-nt hc-siRNAs. Our findings provide insights into plant sRNA evolution as well as SV-based gene regulation during crop domestication.

Mitosis is underpinned by the dynamics of microtubules and the nuclear envelope. To date, our ability to study P. falciparum mitosis by microscopy has been hindered by the small size of P. falciparum nuclei. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) has recently been developed for P. falciparum, allowing visualization of mitosis at the individual nucleus level. Using U-ExM, three intranuclear microtubule structures are observed: hemispindles, mitotic spindles and interpolar spindles. A previous study demonstrated that the mini-chromosome maintenance complex binding-protein (MCMBP) depletion caused abnormal nuclear morphology and microtubule defects. To investigate the role of microtubules following MCMBP depletion and study the nuclear envelope in these parasites, we developed the first nuclear stain enabled by U-ExM in P. falciparum. MCMBP deficient parasites show aberrant hemispindles and mitotic spindles. Moreover, anaphase chromatin bridges, and individual nuclei containing multiple microtubule structures were observed following MCMBP knockdown. Collectively, this study refines our understanding of MCMBP-deficient parasites and highlights the utility of U-ExM coupled with a nuclear envelope stain for studying mitosis in P. falciparum.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic tolerance is an understudied potential contributor to antibiotic treatment failure and the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The molecular mechanisms governing tolerance remain poorly understood. A prominent type of {beta}-lactam tolerance relies on the formation of cell wall-deficient spheroplasts, which maintain structural integrity via their outer membrane (OM), an asymmetric lipid bilayer consisting of phospholipids on the inner leaflet and a lipid-linked polysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) enriched in the outer monolayer on the cell surface. How a membrane structure like LPS, with its reliance on mere electrostatic interactions to maintain stability, is capable of countering internal turgor pressure is unknown. Here, we have uncovered a novel role for the PhoPQ two-component system in tolerance to the {beta}-lactam antibiotic meropenem in Enterobacterales. We found that PhoPQ is induced by meropenem treatment and promotes an increase in 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-aminoarabinose [L-Ara4N] modification of lipid A, the membrane anchor of LPS. L-Ara4N modifications enhance structural integrity, and consequently tolerance to meropenem, in several Enterobacterales species. Importantly, mutational inactivation of the negative PhoPQ regulatory element mgrB (commonly selected for during clinical therapy with the last-resort antibiotic colistin, an antimicrobial peptide [AMP]) results in dramatically enhanced tolerance, suggesting that AMPs can collaterally select for meropenem tolerance via stable overactivation of PhoPQ. Lastly, we identify histidine kinase inhibitors (including an FDA-approved drug) that inhibit PhoPQ-dependent LPS modifications and consequently potentiate meropenem to enhance killing of tolerant cells. In summary, our results suggest that PhoPQ-mediated LPS modifications play a significant role in stabilizing the OM, promoting survival when the primary integrity maintenance structure, the cell wall, is removed.\n\nSignificanceTreating an infection with an antibiotic often fails, resulting in a tremendous public health burden. One understudied likely reason for treatment failure is the development of \"antibiotic tolerance\", the ability of bacteria to survive normally lethal exposure to an antibiotic. Here, we describe a molecular mechanism promoting tolerance. A bacterial stress sensor (PhoPQ) is activated in response to antibiotic (meropenem) treatment and consequently strengthens a bacterial protective \"shell\" to enhance survival. We also identify inhibitors of this mechanism, opening the door to developing compounds that help antibiotics work better against tolerant bacteria.",

S. baicalensis and S. barbata are among the best-studied Scutellaria species, and previous works have established flavones to be the primary source of their bioactivity. Recent genomic and biochemical studies with S. baicalensis and S. barbata have advanced our understanding of flavone biosynthesis in Scutellaria. However, as over several hundreds of Scutellaria species occur throughout the world, flavone biosynthesis in most species remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed organ-specific flavone profiles of seven Scutellaria species, including S. baicalensis, S. barbata and two species native to the Americas (S. wrightii to Texas and S. racemosa to Central and South America). We found that the roots of almost all these species produce only 4-deoxyflavones, while 4-hydroxyflavones are accumulated exclusively in their aerial parts. On the other hand, S. racemosa and S. wrightii also accumulated high levels of 4-deoxyflavones in their aerial parts, different with the flavone profiles of S. baicalensis and S. barbata. Furthermore, our metabolomics and NMR study identified the accumulation of isoscutellarein 8-O-{beta}-glucuronopyranoside, a rare 4-hydroxyflavone, in the stems and leaves of several Scutellaria species including S. baicalensis and S. barbata, but not in S. racemosa and S. wrightii. Distinctive organ-specific metabolite profiles among Scutellaria species indicate the selectivity and diverse physiological roles of flavones.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolutionarily conserved NFU-domain proteins that are targeted to plastids or mitochondria. The  plastid-type NFU1, NFU2 and NFU3 in Arabidopsis thaliana play a role in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly in this organelle, whereas the type-II NFU4 and NFU5 proteins have not been subjected to mutant studies in any plant species to determine their biological role. Here we confirm that NFU4 and NFU5 are targeted to the mitochondria. The proteins are constitutively produced in all parts of the plant, suggesting a housekeeping function. Double nfu4 nfu5 knockout mutants were embryonic lethal, and depletion of the proteins led to growth arrest of young seedlings. Biochemical analyses revealed that NFU4 and NFU5 are required for lipoylation of the H proteins of the glycine decarboxylase complex and the E2 subunits of other mitochondrial dehydrogenases, with little impact on Fe-S cluster-containing respiratory complexes and aconitase. Consequently, the Gly-to-Ser ratio was increased in mutant seedlings and early growth was improved by elevated CO2. In addition, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate and branched-chain amino acids accumulated in the nfu4 nfu5 mutants, further supporting defects in the other three mitochondrial lipoate-dependent enzyme complexes. NFU4 and NFU5 interacted with mitochondrial lipoyl synthase (LIP1) in yeast 2-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. These data indicate that NFU4 and NFU5 have a more specific function than previously thought, in providing Fe-S clusters to lipoyl synthase.\n\nOne sentence summaryA pair of evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in iron-sulfur cofactor assembly have a specific role in lipoate biosynthesis for mitochondrial dehydrogenases.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation after stroke is characterized by the activation of resident microglia and the invasion of circulating leukocytes into the brain. Although lymphocytes infiltrate the brain in small number, they have been consistently demonstrated to be the most potent leukocyte subpopulation contributing to secondary inflammatory brain injury. However, the exact mechanism how this minimal number of lymphocytes can profoundly affect stroke outcome is still largely elusive. Here, using a mouse model for ischemic stroke, we demonstrated that early activation of microglia in response to stroke is differentially regulated by distinct T cell subpopulations. Acute treatment with engineered T cells overexpressing IL-10 administered into the cisterna magna after stroke induces a switch of microglial gene expression to a profile associated with pro-regenerative functions. These findings substantiate the role of T cells in stroke with large impact on the cerebral inflammatory milieu by polarizing the microglial phenotype. Targeting T cell-microglia interactions can have direct translational relevance for further development of immune-targeted therapies for stroke and other neuroinflammatory conditions.\n\nSummaryThe crosstalk between brain infiltrating T cells and microglia in response to stroke remains elusive. Benakis et al. report that transcriptional signature of the stroke-associated microglia is reprogrammed by distinct T cell subpopulations. Engineered T cells overexpressing IL-10 administered four hours after stroke reinitiate microglial function inducing a pro-regenerative environment.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the controls on the opportunistic human pathogen Vibrio vulnificus in warm tropical waters, we conducted a year-long investigation in the Ala Wai Canal, a channelized estuary in Honolulu, HI. The abundance of V. vulnificus as determined by qPCR of the hemolysin gene (vvhA), varied spatially and temporally nearly four orders of magnitude ([&le;] 3 to 14,000 mL-1). Unlike in temperate and subtropical systems, temperatures were persistently warm (19-31{degrees}C) and explained little of the variability in V. vulnificus abundance. Salinity (1-36 ppt) had a significant, but non-linear, relationship with V. vulnificus abundance with highest vvhA concentrations (> 2,500 mL-1) observed only at salinities from 7 to 22 ppt. V. vulnificus abundances were lower on average in the summer dry season when waters were warmer but more saline. Highest canal-wide average abundances were observed during a time of modest rainfall when moderate salinities and elevated concentrations of reduced nitrogen species and silica suggested a groundwater influence. Distinguishing the abundances of two genotypes of V. vulnificus (C-type and E-type) suggest that C-type strains, which are responsible for most human infections, were usually less abundant (25% on average), but their relative contribution was greater at higher salinities, suggesting a broader salinity tolerance. Generalized regression models suggested up to 67% of sample-to-sample variation in log-transformed V. vulnificus abundance was explained (n = 202) using the measured environmental variables, and up to 97% of the monthly variation in canal-wide average concentrations (n = 13) was explained with the best subset of four variables.\n\nIMPORTANCEOur data illustrate that, in the absence of strong seasonal variation in water temperature in the tropics, variation in salinity driven by rainfall becomes a primary controlling variable on V. vulnificus abundance. There is thus a tendency for a rainfall-driven seasonal cycle in V. vulnificus abundance that is inverted from the temperature-driven seasonal cycle at higher latitudes. However, stochasticity in rainfall and its non-linear, indirect effects on V. vulnificus concentration means that high abundances can occur at any location in the canal at any time of year, making it challenging to predict concentrations of this pathogen at high temporal or spatial resolution. Much of the variability in canal-wide average concentrations, on the other hand, was explained by a few variables that reflect the magnitude of freshwater input to the system, suggesting that relative risk of exposure to this pathogen could be predicted for the system as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Raman microspectroscopy has been thoroughly used to assess growth dynamics and heterogeneity of prokaryotic cells. Yet, little is known about how the chemistry of individual cells changes during infection with lytic viruses, resulting in so-called virocells. Here, we investigate biochemical changes of bacterial and archaeal cells of three different species in laboratory cultures before and after addition of their respective viruses using single-cell Raman microspectroscopy. By applying multivariate statistics, we identified significant differences in the spectra of single cells and cells after addition of lytic phage (phi6) for Pseudomonas syringae. A general ratio of wavenumbers that contributed the greatest differences in the recorded spectra was defined as an indicator for virocells. Based on reference spectra, this difference is likely attributable to an increase in nucleic acid vs. protein ratio of virocells. This method proved also successful for identification of Bacillus subtilis cells infected with phi29 displaying a decrease in respective ratio but failed for archaeal virocells (Methanosarcina mazei with Methanosarcina Spherical Virus) due to autofluorescence. Multivariate and univariate analyses suggest that Raman spectral data of infected cells can also be used to explore the complex biology behind viral infections of bacteria. Using this method, we confirmed the previously described two-stage infection of P. syringaes phi6 and that infection of B. subtilis by phi29 results in a stress response within single cells. We conclude that Raman microspectroscopy is a promising tool for chemical identification of Gram-positive and Gram-negative virocells undergoing infection with lytic DNA or RNA viruses.\n\nImportanceViruses are highly diverse biological entities shaping many ecosystems across Earth. Yet, understanding the infection of individual microbial cells and the related biochemical changes remains limited. Using Raman microspectroscopy in conjunction with univariate and unsupervised machine learning approaches, we established a marker for identification of infected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This non-destructive, label-free analytical method at single-cell resolution paves the way for future studies geared towards analyzing complex biological changes of virus-infected cells in pure culture and natural ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The insertion of fusion proteins has enabled the crystallization of a wide range of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we explored the possibility of using a larger fusion protein, inserted into the third intracellular loop (ICL3) of {beta}1-adrenoceptor ({beta}1AR) via rigid chimeric helix fusions. The aim was to engineer a single-chain fusion protein that comprises sufficient mass and rigidity to allow single-particle cryo-EM data collection, without depending on binding proteins, such as G-proteins or nanobodies. Through parsing of the protein data bank (PDB), we identified the protein AmpC {beta}-lactamase as a suitable candidate. Both termini of this protein are -helical and the helices are antiparallel to each other. The distance between their centroids measures [~]11 [A]. Such a geometry is ideal to design extended chimeric helices with transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6 of {beta}1AR, and the insertion of the protein adds [~]39 kDa of mass to the receptor. We expressed the {beta}1AR - AmpC {beta}-lactamase fusion protein in mammalian cells. The binding of the antagonists propranolol and cyanopindolol to the purified fusion protein was confirmed by CPM-based thermofluor assays. The cryo-EM structure was solved to a nominal overall resolution of 3.6 [A] and the seven helix architecture and helix eight were clearly resolved. Superimposition of the structure with known X-ray crystal structures of {beta}1AR suggests that the protein is in its inactive conformation. The fusion protein described here provides a basis for high-throughput structure elucidation of class A GPCRs by cryo-EM for drug discovery research as well as for the elucidation of inactive state or wild-type GPCR structures. The fusion protein geometry theoretically fits a wide range of class A GPCRs and therefore can be applied to a multitude of receptors.",

    "abstract": "Plumage coloration is an important trait involved communication and is shaped by a variety of ecological pressures. Island residency has the potential to change the evolutionary trajectory of plumage colour by differences in habitat and resources, or by altering predation pressure and social selection intensity. Latitude, island size, and isolation may further influence colour evolution by biasing colonization. Therefore, general patterns of plumage evolution are difficult to disentangle. We used phylogenetically controlled analyses to assess the influence of island residency on plumage colouration, by calculating chromaticity values from red, blue, green scores extracted from photos of Order Passeriformes birds. Importantly, we controlled for ecological factors hypothesized to influence colour evolution and assessed family-level effects. We found 1) colour varied between islands and mainlands in females, but not males, and both sexes were affected by several ecological factors; 2) patterns of colour evolution varied among families; 3) island size and distance to the mainland and other islands significantly influenced colour; and 4) interactions between ecological factors and latitude were consistently influenced colour, supporting a latitudinal gradient hypothesis. Our results indicate although island residency influences female colour evolution, a myriad of ecological factors drive plumage colour and the patterns vary among families.",

    "abstract": "Aging is one of the hallmarks of multiple human diseases, including cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with high longevity and low cancer incidence percentages characterizing long-living organisms have not been fully understood yet. In this context, we hypothesized that variations in the number of copies (CNVs) of specific genes may protect some species from cancer onset. Based on the statistical comparison of gene copy numbers within the genomes of cancer -prone and -resistant organisms, we identified novel gene targets linked to the tumor predisposition of a species, such as CD52, SAT1 and SUMO protein family members. Furthermore, for the first time, we were able to discover that, considering the entire genome copy number landscape of a species, microRNAs (miRNAs) are among the most significant gene families enriched for cancer progression and predisposition. However, their roles in ageing and cancer resistance from a comparative perspective remains largely unknown. To this end, we identified through bioinformatics analysis, several alterations in miRNAs copy number patterns, represented by duplication of miR-221, miR-222, miR-21, miR-372, miR-30b, miR-30d and miR-31 among others. Therefore, our analysis provides the first evidence that an altered copy number miRNAs signature is able to statistically discriminate species more susceptible to cancer than those that are tumor resistant, helping researchers to discover new possible therapeutic targets involved in tumor predisposition.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge-based statistical potentials have been shown to be rather effective in protein 3-dimensional (3D) structure evaluation and prediction. Recently, several statistical potentials have been developed for RNA 3D structure evaluation, while their performances are either still at low level for the test datasets from structure prediction models or dependent on the \"black-box\" process through neural networks. In this work, we have developed an all-atom distance-dependent statistical potential based on residue separation for RNA 3D structure evaluation, namely rsRNASP, which is composed of short- and long-ranged potentials distinguished by residue separation. The extensive examinations against available RNA test datasets show that, rsRNASP has apparently higher performance than the existing statistical potentials for the realistic test datasets with large RNAs from structure prediction models including the newly released RNA-Puzzles dataset, and is comparable to the existing top statistical potentials for the test datasets with small RNAs or near-native decoys. Additionally, rsRNASP is also superior to RNA3DCNN, a recently developed scoring function through 3D convolutional neural networks. rsRNASP and the relevant databases are available at website https://github.com/Tan-group/rsRNASP.\n\nSIGNIFICANCERNAs play crucial roles in catalyzing biochemical reactions and regulating gene expression, and the biological functions of RNAs are generally coupled to their structures. Complementary to experiments, developing computational models to predict RNA 3D structures can be very helpful for understanding RNA biology functions. For a computational model, a reliable energy function is essentially important either for guiding conformational folding or for structure evaluation. For this purpose, we developed a residue-separation-based distance-dependent statistical potential, named rsRNASP which distinguishes the short- and long-ranged interactions, for RNA 3D structure evaluation. Our rsRNASP were examined against extensive test sets and shows overall superior performance over existing top traditional statistical potentials and a recently developed scoring function through 3D convolutional neural networks, especially for realistic test set from various computational structure prediction models.",

    "abstract": "Mass transport of photosynthates in the phloem of plants is necessary for describing plant carbon allocation, productivity, and responses to water and thermal stress. Several hypotheses about optimization of phloem structure and function and limitations of phloem transport under drought have been proposed, and tested with models and anatomical data. However, the true impact of radial water exchange of phloem conduits with their surroundings on mass transport of photosynthates has not been addressed. Here, the physics of the Munch mechanism of sugar transport is re-evaluated to include local variations in viscosity resulting from the radial water exchange in two dimensions (axial and radial). Model results show that radial water exchange pushes sucrose away from conduit walls thereby reducing wall frictional stress due to a decrease in sap viscosity and an increase in sugar concentration in the central region of the conduit. These two co-occurring effects lead to increased sugar front speed and axial mass transport across a wide range of phloem conduit lengths. Thus, sugar transport operates more efficiently than predicted by previous models that ignore these two effects. A faster front speed leads to higher phloem resiliency under drought because more sugar can be transported with a smaller pressure gradient.\n\nSummaryThe overall speed of sap increased by including a concentrationdependent viscosity in axial and radial directions.",

Coupling a multi-scale scattering data analysis to biophysical assays for peptide partitioning revealed that the AMPs rapidly saturate the bacterial envelope and reach the cytosol within less than three seconds--much faster than previously considered. Final cytosolic AMP concentrations of ~ 100 mM suggest an efficient shut-down of metabolism as primary cause for bacterial killing. On the other hand, the damage of the cell envelope is a collateral effect of AMP activity that does not kill the bacteria. This implies that the impairment of the membrane barrier is a necessary but not sufficient condition for microbial killing by lactoferricins. The most efficient AMP studied exceeds others in both speed of reaching cytoplasm and lowest cytosolic peptide concentration.",

In this study, the spatial and temporal stiffening kinetics of the different cell wall layers were recorded during fibre maturation on a sample of poplar tension wood using atomic force microscopy. The thickening of the different layers was also recorded. The stiffening of the CML, S1 and S2-layers was initially synchronous with the thickening of the S2-layer and continued a little after the S2-layer reached its final thickness as the G-layer began to develop. In contrast, the global stiffness of the G-layer, which initially increased with its thickening, was close to stable long before it reached its final maximum thickness. A limited radial gradient of stiffness was observed in the G-layer, but it decreased sharply on the lumen side, where the new sub-layers are deposited during cell wall thickening. Although very similar at the ultrastructural and biochemical levels, the stiffening kinetics of the poplar G-layer appears to be very different from that described in maturing bast fibres.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms in nature form multicellular groups called biofilms. In biofilms bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) interact intensely, due to their proximity to each other. Most studies have investigated genetically homogeneous biofilms, leaving a gap in knowledge on genetically heterogeneous biofilms. Recent insights show that a Gram-positive model bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, discriminates between strains of high (kin) and low (non-kin) phylogenetic relatedness, reflected in merging (kin) and boundaries (non-kin) between swarms. However, it is not clear how kinship between interacting strains affects their fitness, the genotype distribution, and the EPS sharing in floating biofilms (pellicles). To address this gap in knowledge we cultivate B. subtilis strains as mixtures of kin and non-kin strains in static cultures, allowing them to form pellicles. We show here that in non-kin pellicles only one strains fitness was reduced; at the same time, strains segregated into larger patches and exhibited decreased matrix sharing, as compared to kin and isogenic pellicles, in which both strains had comparable colony forming units (CFU) counts and more homogenous cell mixing. Overall, our results emphasize kin discrimination (KD) as a social behavior that shapes fitness, spatial segregation and sharing of the extracellular matrix in genetically heterogenous biofilms of B. subtilis.\n\nIMPORTANCEBiofilm communities have both beneficial and harmful effects on human societies in natural, medical and industrial environments. Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive and biotechnologically important bacterium, serves as a model for studying biofilms. Recent studies have shown that this species engages in kin discriminatory behavior during swarming, which may have implications for community assembly, thus being of fundamental importance. Effects of KD on fitness, genotype segregation and matrix sharing in biofilms is not well understood. By using environmental strains with determined kin types and integrated fluorescent reporters we provide evidence that KD involves antagonism of the dominant strain against non-kin, which has important implications for genotype segregation and sharing of matrix polysaccharides between producers and non-producers. Our results reveal novel consequences of KD and are important for advancing our fundamental understanding of microbial sociality, and its role in the assembly of multicellular groups and in the shaping of microbial diversity.",

    "abstract": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) inclusion bodies (IBs) are dynamic structures required for efficient viral replication and transcription. The minimum components needed to form IB-like structures in cells are the nucleoprotein (N) and the tetrameric phosphoprotein (P). HMPV P binds to two versions of N protein in infected cells: C-terminal P residues interact with oligomeric, RNA-bound N (N-RNA), and N-terminal P residues interact with monomeric N (N0) to maintain a pool of protein to encapsidate new RNA. Recent work on other negative-strand viruses has suggested that IBs are liquid-like organelles formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Here, HMPV IBs in infected or transfected cells were shown to possess liquid organelle properties, such as fusion and fission. Recombinant versions of HMPV N and P proteins were purified to analyze the interactions required to drive LLPS in vitro. Purified HMPV P was shown to form liquid droplets in the absence of other protein binding partners, a novel finding compared to other viral systems. Removal of nucleic acid from purified P altered phase separation dynamics, suggesting that nucleic acid interactions also play a role in IB formation. HMPV P also recruits monomeric N (N0-P) and N-RNA to IBs in vitro. These findings suggest that, in contrast to what has been reported for other viral systems, HMPV P acts as a scaffold protein to mediate multivalent interactions with monomeric and oligomeric HMPV N to promote phase separation of IBs.\n\nIMPORTANCEHuman metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of respiratory disease among children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. Currently, no vaccines or antivirals are available for treatment of HMPV infections. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), where HMPV replication and transcription occur, represent a promising target for the development of novel antivirals. The HMPV nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) are the minimal components needed for IB formation in eukaryotic cells. However, interactions that regulate the formation of these dynamic structures are poorly understood. Here, we showed that HMPV IBs possess the properties of liquid organelles and that purified HMPV P phase separates independently in vitro. Our work suggests that HMPV P phase separation dynamics are altered by nucleic acid. We provide strong evidence that, unlike results reported from other viral systems, HMPV P alone serves as a scaffold for multivalent interactions with monomeric (N0) and oligomeric (N-RNA) HMPV N for IB formation.",

    "abstract": "Organoids derived from stem cells become increasingly important to study human development and to model disease. However, methods are needed to control and study spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression in organoids. To this aim, we combined optogenetics and gene perturbation technologies to activate or knock-down RNA of target genes, at single-cell resolution and in programmable spatio-temporal patterns. To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we locally activated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in an organoid model for human neurodevelopment. High-resolution spatial transcriptomic and single-cell analyses showed that this local induction was sufficient to generate stereotypically patterned organoids in three dimensions and revealed new insights into SHHs contribution to gene regulation in neurodevelopment.\n\nWith this study, we propose optogenetic perturbations in combination with spatial transcriptomics as a powerful technology to reprogram and study cell fates and tissue patterning in organoids.",

    "abstract": "Directing and manipulating biological functions is at the heart of next-generation biomedical initiatives such as tissue and immuno-engineering. Yet, the ambitious goal of engineering complex biological networks requires the ability to precisely perturb specific signaling pathways at distinct times and places. Using lipid nanotechnology and the principles of supramolecular self-assembly, we have developed an injectable liposomal nanocomposite hydrogel platform to precisely control drug presentation through programing of the co-release of multiple protein drugs. These liposomal hydrogels exhibited robust shear-thinning and self-healing behaviors enabling facile injectability for local drug delivery applications. By integrating modular lipid nanotechnology into this hydrogel platform, we introduced multiple mechanisms of protein release based on liposome surface chemistry. When injected into immuno-competent mice, these liposomal hydrogels exhibited formulation-dependent rates of dissolution and excellent biocompatibility. To fully validate the utility of this system for multi-protein delivery, we demonstrated the synchronized, sustained, and localized release of IgG antibody and IL-12 cytokine in vivo, despite the significant size differences between these two proteins. Overall, these liposomal nanocomposite hydrogels are a highly modular platform technology with the ability the mediate orthogonal modes of protein release and the potential to precisely coordinate biological cues both in vitro and in vivo.",

The immune response via cellular immunity creates superior resistance to viral mutations, which are currently the greatest threat to the global vaccination campaign. Furthermore, we also propose a safer, more facile and physiologically appropriate immunization method using either intra-nasal or oral administration. The underlying technology is an adaptation of synthetic long peptides (SLPs) previously used in cancer immunotherapy. SLPs comprising HLA class I and class II epitopes are used to stimulate antigen cross-presentation and canonical class II presentation by dendritic cells. The result is a cytotoxic T cell-mediated prompt and specific immune response against the virus-infected epithelia and a rapid and robust virus clearance. Peptides isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients were screened for the best HLA population coverage and were tested for toxicity and allergenicity. 3D peptide folding followed by molecular docking studies provided positive results, suggesting a favourable antigen presentation.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a severe infectious disease with high mortality, and it occurs when chemicals released in the bloodstream to fight an infection trigger inflammation throughout the body and it can cause a cascade of changes that damage multiple organ systems, leading them to fail, even resulting in death. In order to reduce the possibility of sepsis or infection antiseptics are used and process is known as antisepsis. Antiseptic peptides (ASPs) show properties similar to antigram-negative peptides, antigram-positive peptides and many more. Machine learning algorithms are useful in screening and identification of therapeutic peptides and thus provide initial filters or built confidence before using time consuming and laborious experimental approaches. In this study, various machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR) were evaluated for prediction of ASPs. Moreover, the characteristics physicochemical features of ASPs were also explored to use them in machine learning. Both manual and automatic feature selection methodology was employed to achieve best performance of machine learning algorithms. A 5-fold cross validation and independent data set validation proved RF as the best model for prediction of ASPs. Our RF model showed an accuracy of 97%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.93, which are indication of a robust and good model. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to build a machine learning classifier for prediction of ASPs.",

    "abstract": "Network theory is widely used to understand microbial interactions in activated sludge and numerous other artificial and natural environments. However, when using correlation-based methods, it is not possible to identify the directionality of interactions within microbiota. Based on the classic Granger test of sequencing-based time-series data, a new Microbial Causal Correlation Network (MCCN) was constructed with distributed ecological interaction on the directed, associated links. As a result of applying MCCN to a time series of activated sludge data, we found that the hub species OTU56, classified as belonging the genus Nitrospira, was responsible for completing nitrification in activated sludge, and mainly interacted with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the form of amensal and commensal relationships, respectively. Phylogenetic tree suggested a mutualistic relationship between Nitrospira and denitrifiers. Zoogloea displayed the highest ncf value within the classified OTUs of the MCCN, indicating that it could be a foundation for activated sludge through forming the characteristic cell aggregate matrices into which other organisms embed during floc formation. Overall, the introduction of causality analysis greatly expands the ability of a network to shed a light on understanding the interactions between members of a microbial community.",

Recent developments in computational methods have led to protein structure predictions that have reached the accuracy of experimentally determined models. While this has been independently verified, the implementation of these methods across structural biology applications remains to be tested. Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold 2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modelling of interactions; and modelling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25% additional residues can be confidently modelled when compared to homology modelling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the PDB. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and protein complexes surpass state-of-the-art tools and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared to experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered. In summary, we find that these advances are likely to have a transformative impact in structural biology and broader life science research.",

RNA sequencing revealed that both warm temperature and old age profoundly alter gene expression. Further investigation uncovered that the NPR-8-dependent longevity response to warm temperature is achieved by regulating the expression of a subset of collagen genes. As elevated collagen expression is a common feature of many lifespan-extending interventions and enhanced stress resistance, collagen expression could be critical for healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Visual masking is used to infer the timescale of conscious perception in humans; yet the underlying circuit mechanisms are not understood. Here we describe a two-alternative choice backward masking task in mice and humans, in which the location of a briefly presented grating is effectively masked within a 50 ms window after stimulus onset. Importantly, human subjects reported reduced perceptual visibility during masking that closely corresponded with behavior deficits. In mice, optogenetic silencing of visual cortex reduces performance over a similar time course as masking. However, response rates and accuracy do not match masking, demonstrating that cortical silencing and masking are distinct phenomena. Spiking responses recorded in primary visual cortex (V1) are consistent with masked behavior when quantified over long, but not short, time windows, indicating masking involves further downstream processing. Behavioral performance can be quantitatively recapitulated by a dual accumulator model constrained by V1 activity. The model and the animals performance for the earliest decisions imply that the initial spike arriving from the periphery can trigger a correct response, but subsequent V1 spikes, evoked by the mask, degrade performance for longer decisions. To test the necessity of visual cortex for backward masking, we optogenetically silenced mask-evoked cortical activity which fully restored discrimination of target location. Together, these results demonstrate that mice, like humans, are susceptible to backward visual masking and that visual cortex has a crucial role in this process.",

    "abstract": "What are the spatial and temporal scales of brainwide neuronal activity, and how do activities at different scales interact? We used SCAPE microscopy to image a large fraction of the central brain of adult Drosophila melanogaster with high spatiotemporal resolution while flies engaged in a variety of behaviors, including running, grooming and flailing. This revealed neural representations of behavior on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The activity of most neurons across the brain correlated (or, in some cases, anticorrelated) with running and flailing over timescales that ranged from seconds to almost a minute. Grooming elicited a much weaker global response. Although these behaviors accounted for a large fraction of neural activity, residual activity not directly correlated with behavior was high dimensional. Many dimensions of the residual activity reflect the activity of small clusters of spatially organized neurons that may correspond to genetically defined cell types. These clusters participate in the global dynamics, indicating that neural activity reflects a combination of local and broadly distributed components. This suggests that microcircuits with highly specified functions are provided with knowledge of the larger context in which they operate, conferring a useful balance of specificity and flexibility.",

    "abstract": "The anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction is a microbially mediated process requiring a syntrophic partnership between anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). Based on genome taxonomy, ANME lineages are polyphyletic within the phylum Halobacterota, none of which have been isolated in pure culture. Here we reconstruct 28 ANME genomes from environmental metagenomes and flow sorted syntrophic consortia. Together with a reanalysis of previously published datasets, these genomes enable a comparative analysis of all marine ANME clades. We review the genomic features which separate ANME from their methanogenic relatives and identify what differentiates ANME clades. Large multiheme cytochromes and bioenergetic complexes predicted to be involved in novel electron bifurcation reactions are well-distributed and conserved in the ANME archaea, while significant variations in the anabolic C1 pathways exists between clades. Our analysis raises the possibility that methylotrophic methanogenesis may have evolved from a methanotrophic ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Context-dependency, C-D, of outcomes occurs when several factors affect a focal metric. Remedies for treating milder cases of C-D are readily available but severe cases, where some contributory factors cause non-linear changes in others, escaped routine scrutiny. This poses a universal challenge to standard research strategies. We suggest that metacommunity framework may be particularly vulnerable because its core notions (habitat structure, dispersal, and species interactions) are functionally entangled. When these notions are generalized to include many species and situations, they become interdependent. To illustrate the significance of such interdependence, we test two hypotheses. One that holding combination of parameters constant in all but one dimension, can alter inference of a study and the second that the severity of context-dependency increases when core metacommunity dimensions interact and transform one another through a variety of mechanisms. The results support these ideas and imply that C-D predicts a dauntingly vast space of possible empirical outcomes and interpretations, most of which can arise from reciprocal interactions among metacommunity core dimensions. We proffer that an adaptable and structured use of macro-variables is a place to start investigating metacommunity mechanisms more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "The vocal activity and detectability of tropical birds are subject to high levels of temporal heterogeneity, but quantifying fine-grain patterns of diel and day-to-day variation in complex systems is challenging with traditional point-count methods. As a result, research concerning stochastic temporal effects on tropical avian assemblages is limited, typically offering only broad conclusions, e.g., that overall activity is highest in the first few hours of the morning and that some species are active at different times of day. Passive acoustic monitoring introduces several advantages for studying temporal variation, particularly by enabling simultaneous and continuous data collection across adjacent sites. Here, we employed autonomous recording units to quantify temporal variation in avian vocal activity levels and observed species richness at an Amazonian reserve in Madre de Dios, Peru--a region featuring some of Earths richest, most complex avian assemblages. We manually annotated 18 dawn hour recordings, collected simultaneously from three separate days at the same six sites, which represent a variety of microhabitats and avian community compositions. We documented significant and consistent temporal variation in avian vocal activity levels and observed species richness within the dawn hour and across days. We found that temporal effects were stronger for vocal activity than for observed species richness and that diel activity patterns varied on a species-to-species basis at a fine scale. Our results indicate that overlooked temporal variation in Amazonian soundscapes may obfuscate the results of surveys that fail to sufficiently account for temporal variables with simultaneous monitoring. Further research concerning the automated processing of acoustic data could lead to more efficient methods for reducing temporal bias and improving the calibration and accuracy of ornithological surveys in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "Accurate estimates of the rate of recombination are key to understanding a host of evolutionary processes as well as the evolution of recombination rate itself. Model-based population genetic methods that infer recombination rates from patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome have become a popular method to estimate rates of recombination. However, these LD-based methods make a variety of simplifying assumptions about the populations of interest that are often not met in natural populations. One such assumption is the absence of gene flow from other populations. Here, we use forward-time population genetic simulations of isolation-with-migration scenarios to explore how gene flow affects the accuracy of LD-based estimators of recombination rate. We find that moderate levels of gene flow can result in either the overestimation or underestimation of recombination rates by up to 20-50% depending on the timing of divergence. We also find that these biases can affect the detection of interpopulation differences in recombination rate, causing both false positive and false negatives depending on the scenario. We discuss future possibilities for mitigating these biases and recommend that investigators exercise caution and confirm that their study populations meet assumptions before deploying these methods.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) are small peptides, classified as amyloids, that have the potential to self-assemble and form cytotoxic species, such as small soluble oligomers and large insoluble fibrils. The formation of A{beta} aggregates facilitates the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD), while IAPP aggregates induce pancreatic {beta}-cell apoptosis, leading to exacerbation of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cross-amyloid interactions between A{beta} and IAPP have been described both in vivo and in vitro, implying the role of A{beta} or IAPP as modulators of cytotoxic self-aggregation of each peptide, and suggesting that A{beta}-IAPP interactions are a potential molecular link between AD and T2D. Using molecular dynamics simulations, \"hot spot\" regions of the two peptides were studied to understand the formation of hexamers in a heterogenous and homogenous peptide-containing environment. Systems of only A{beta}(16-22) peptides formed antiparallel, {beta}-barrel-like structures, while systems of only IAPP(20-29) peptides formed stacked, parallel beta strands and had relatively unstable aggregation structures after 2 s of simulation time. Systems containing both A{beta} and IAPP (1:1 ratio) hexamers showed antiparallel, {beta}-barrel-like structures, with an interdigitated arrangement of A{beta}(16-22) and IAPP(20-29). These {beta}-barrel structures have features of cytotoxic amyloid species identified in previous literature. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide atomistic insight into both the mechanism behind cross-amyloid interactions and structural morphologies of these toxic amyloid species.\n\nStatement of SignificanceMolecular knowledge, biophysical characterization, structural morphologies, and formation pathways of amyloid oligomers - specifically low-molecular weight, cross-amyloid oligomers - remain preliminary and undefined. Characterizing interactions between homogenous and heterogenous amyloid oligomers is of great interest given that certain oligomer morphologies contribute to cytotoxicity, eventually resulting in comorbid diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Utilizing model systems (e.g., fragments of full-length peptides) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the biophysical underpinnings of cross-amyloid oligomer structures is the first step in understanding the dynamics, stability, and potential modes of cytotoxicity of these species, providing important insights into targetable biomolecular structures.",

It has also been recently reported that the aggregation of -synuclein may also take place through an alternative pathway, which takes place within dense liquid condensates produced through liquid-liquid phase separation. The microscopic mechanism of this process, however, remains to be clarified. Here, we developed a fluorescence-based assay to perform a kinetic analysis of the aggregation process of -synuclein within liquid condensates, and applied it to determine the corresponding mechanism of aggregation. Our analysis shows that at pH 7.4 the aggregation process of -synuclein within dense condensates starts with spontaneous primary nucleation followed by rapid aggregate-dependent proliferation. Taken together, these results reveal a highly efficient pathway for the appearance and proliferation of -synuclein aggregates at physiological pH.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a powerful approach in drug discovery for removing (rather than inhibiting) proteins implicated in diseases. A key step in this approach is the formation of an induced proximity complex, where a degrader molecule recruits an E3 ligase to the protein of interest (POI), facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to the POI and initiating the proteasomal degradation process. Here, we address three critical aspects of the TPD process: 1) formation of the ternary complex induced by a degrader molecule, 2) conformational heterogeneity of the ternary complex, and 3) assessment of ubiquitination propensity via the full Cullin Ring Ligase (CRL) macromolecular assembly. The novel approach presented here combines experimental biophysical data--in this case hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS, which measures the solvent exposure of protein residues)--with all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aided by enhanced sampling techniques to predict structural ensembles of ternary complexes at atomic resolution. We present results demonstrating the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of our approach to predict ternary structure ensembles using the bromodomain of SMARCA2 (SMARCA2BD) with the E3 ligase VHL as the system of interest. The simulations reproduce X-ray crystal structures - including prospective simulations validated on a new structure that we determined in this work (PDB ID: 7S4E) - with root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 1.1 to 1.6 [A]. The simulations also reveal a structural ensemble of low-energy conformations of the ternary complex within a broad energy basin. To further characterize the structural ensemble, we used snapshots from the aforementioned simulations as seeds for Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (HREMD) simulations, and then perform 7.1 milliseconds of aggregate simulation time using Folding@home. The resulting free energy surface identifies the crystal structure conformation within a broad low-energy basin and the dynamic ensemble is consistent with solution-phase biophysical experimental data (HDX-MS and small-angle x-ray scattering, SAXS). Finally, we graft structures from the ternary complexes onto the full CRL and perform enhanced sampling simulations, where we find that differences in degradation efficiency can be explained by the proximity distribution of lysine residues on the POI relative to the E2-loaded ubiquitin. Several of the top predicted ubiquitinated lysine residues are validated prospectively through a ubiquitin mapping proteomics experiment.",

    "abstract": "1O_LIModels have become indispensable tools in conservation science in the face of increasingly rapid loss of biodiversity through anthropogenic habitat loss and natural resource exploitation. In addition to their ecological components, accurately representing human decision-making processes in such models is vital to maximise their utility. This can be problematic as modelling complexity increases, making them challenging to communicate and parameterise.\nC_LIO_LIGames have a long history of being used as science communication tools, but are less widely used as data collection tools, particularly in videogame form. We propose a novel approach to (1) aid communication of complex social-ecological models, and (2) \"gamesource\" human decision-making data, by explicitly casting an existing modelling framework as an interactive videogame.\nC_LIO_LIWe present players with a natural resource management game as a front-end to a social-ecological modelling framework (Generalised Management Strategy Evaluation, GMSE). Players actions replace a model algorithm making management decisions about a population of wild animals, which graze on crops and can thus lower agricultural yield. A number of non-player agents (farmers) respond through modelled algorithms to the players management, taking actions that may affect their crop yield as well as the animal population. Players are asked to set their own management goal (e.g. maintain the animal population at a certain level or improve yield) and make decisions accordingly. Trial players were also asked to provide any feedback on both gameplay and purpose.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the utility of this approach by collecting and analysing game play data from a sample of trial plays, in which we systematically vary two model parameters, and allowing trial players to interact with the model through the game interface. As an illustration, we show how variations in land ownership and the number of farmers in the system affects decision-making patterns as well as population trajectories (extinction probabilities).\nC_LIO_LIWe discuss the potential and limitations of this model-game approach in the light of trial player feedback received. In particular, we highlight how a common concern about the game framework (perceived lack of \"realism\" or relevance to a specific context) are actually criticisms of the underlying model, as opposed to the game itself. This further highlights both the parallels between games and models, as well as the utility of model-games to aid in communicating complex models. We conclude that videogames may be an effective tool for conservation and natural resource management, and that although they provide a promising means to collect data on human decision-making, it is vital to carefully consider both external validity and potential biases when doing so.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Many factors determine whether an individual responding to vaccination will generate an immune response that can lead to protection. Several studies have shown that the pre-vaccination immune state is associated with the antibody response to vaccines. However, the generalizability and mechanisms that underlie this association remain poorly defined. Here, we sought to identify a common pre-vaccination signature and mechanisms that could predict the immune response across a wide variety of vaccines. We leveraged the \"Immune Signatures Data Resource\" created by the NIH Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) to integrate data from 28 studies involving 13 different vaccines and associate the blood transcriptional status of 820 healthy young adults with their responses. An unsupervised analysis of blood transcriptional profiles across studies revealed three distinct pre-vaccination states, characterized by the differential expression of genes associated with a pro-inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and metabolism alterations downstream of NF{kappa}B and IRF7. Innate and adaptive immune cell subset-specific genes were also associated with the three pre-vaccination states. Importantly, individuals whose pre-vaccination state was enriched in pro-inflammatory response genes known to be downstream of NF{kappa}B tended to have higher serum antibody responses one month after vaccination. A supervised analysis of the same data resulted in a single classifier, also enriched for NF{kappa}B regulated genes, that predicted the antibody response across most of the vaccines. Projection into single-cell RNA-sequencing data suggested that this pre-vaccination state was attributable to the signature of activation of non-classical monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. Transcriptional signatures of acute responses to bacterial and not viral infections were enriched in the high pro-inflammatory pre-vaccination state and also included NF{kappa}B regulated genes. The pro-inflammatory pre-vaccination state was highly reminiscent of the innate activation state triggered by TLR ligands or adjuvants. These results demonstrate that wide variations in the transcriptional state of the immune system in humans can be a key determinant of responsiveness to vaccination. They also define a transcriptional signature NF{kappa}B activation at baseline, that is associated with a greater magnitude of antibody response to multiple vaccines, and suggest that modulation of the innate immune system by next-generation adjuvants targeting NF{kappa}B before vaccine administration may improve vaccine responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Existing models of human walking use low-level reflexes or neural oscillators to generate movement. While appropriate to generate the stable, rhythmic movement patterns of steady-state walking, these models lack the ability to change their movement patterns or spontaneously generate new movements in the specific, goal-directed way characteristic of voluntary movements. Here we present a neuromuscular model of human locomotion that bridges this gap and combines the ability to execute goal directed movements with the generation of stable, rhythmic movement patterns that are required for robust locomotion. The model represents goals for voluntary movements of the swing leg on the task level of swing leg joint kinematics. Smooth movements plans towards the goal configuration are generated on the task level and transformed into descending motor commands that execute the planned movements, using internal models. The movement goals and plans are updated in real time based on sensory feedback and task constraints. On the spinal level, the descending commands during the swing phase are integrated with a generic stretch reflex for each muscle. Stance leg control solely relies on dedicated spinal reflex pathways. Spinal reflexes stimulate Hill-type muscles that actuate a biomechanical model with eight internal joints and six free-body degrees of freedom. The model is able to generate voluntary, goal-directed reaching movements with the swing leg and combine multiple movements in a rhythmic sequence. During walking, the swing leg is moved in a goal-directed manner to a target that is updated in real-time based on sensory feedback to maintain upright balance, while the stance leg is stabilized by low-level reflexes and a behavioral organization switching between swing and stance control for each leg. With this combination of reflex-based stance leg and voluntary, goal-directed control of the swing leg, the model controller generates rhythmic, stable walking patterns in which the swing leg movement can be flexibly updated in real-time to step over or around obstacles.",

    "abstract": "Development of elaborate and polarized neuronal morphology requires precisely regulated transport of cellular cargos by motor proteins such as kinesin-1. Kinesin-1 has numerous cellular cargos which must be delivered to unique neuronal compartments. The process by which this motor selectively transports and delivers cargo to regulate neuronal morphogenesis is poorly understood, although the cargo-binding kinesin light chain (KLC) subunits contribute to specificity. Our work implicates one such subunit, KLC4, as an essential regulator of axon branching and arborization pattern of sensory neurons during development. Using live imaging approaches in klc4 mutant zebrafish, we show that KLC4 is required for stabilization of nascent axon branches, proper microtubule (MT) dynamics, and endosomal transport. Furthermore, KLC4 is required for proper tiling of peripheral axon arbors: in klc4 mutants, peripheral axons showed abnormal fasciculation, a behavior characteristic of central axons. This result suggests that KLC4 patterns axonal compartments and helps establish molecular differences between central and peripheral axons. Finally, we find that klc4 mutant larva are hypersensitive to touch and adults show anxiety-like behavior in a novel tank test, implicating klc4 as a new gene involved in stress response circuits.",

    "abstract": "Brainstem to spinal cord pathways modulate spinal neuronal activity. We implemented locus coeruleus (LC) targeting strategies by microinjecting CAV-PRS-ChR2 virus in the spinal cord (LC:SC module) or LC (LC:LC module). While activation of both modules inhibited evoked spinal neuronal firing via 1-adrenoceptor-mediated actions, LC:SC opto-activation abolished diffuse noxious inhibitory controls. The LC as a pain generator is likely mechanistically underpinned by maladaptive communication with discrete descending modulatory pathways.",

    "abstract": "Late cardiac toxicity is a potentially lethal complication of cancer therapy, yet the pathogenic mechanism remains largely unknown, and few treatment options exist. Here we report DNA damaging agents such as radiation and anthracycline chemotherapies induce delayed cardiac inflammation following therapy due to activation of cGAS and STING-dependent type I interferon signaling. Genetic ablation of cGAS-STING-signaling in mice inhibits DNA damage induced cardiac inflammation, rescues late cardiac functional decline, and prevents death from cardiac events. Treatment with a STING antagonist suppresses cardiac interferon signaling following DNA damaging therapies and effectively mitigates cardiotoxicity. These results identify a therapeutically targetable, pathogenic mechanism for one of the most vexing treatment-related toxicities in cancer survivors.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prevailed all over the world and emerged as a significant public health emergency. The rapid outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is largely due to its high transmission capacity. Studies implied that the cold chain logistics would be a potential route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The low temperature condition of the cold chain is conducive to survival and transmission of virus. Thus, the virus disinfection in cold chain should not be neglected for controlling COVID-19. However, due to the low temperature feature of the cold-chain, the virus disinfecting methods suitable in cold chain are limited. Here the high-energy electron beam irradiation is proposed to disinfect the SARS-CoV-2 in cold chain logistics. We evaluated the impact of high-energy electron beam irradiation on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped virus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and explored the possible mechanism of the action of high-energy electron beam irradiation on PEDV. The irradiation dose of 10 kGy inactivated 98.1 % PEDV on the both top and bottom surfaces of various packaging materials under cold chain frozen condition. High-energy electron beam inactivated PEDV by inducing damages on viral genome or even capsid.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which has so far affected more than 500 million people worldwide and killed over 6 million as of 1st May, 2022. The approved emergency-use vaccines were lifesaving to such a devastating pandemic. Viroporins are important players of the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and are primary to its pathogenesis. We studied the two prominent viroporins of SARS-CoV-2 (i) Orf3a and (ii) Envelope (E) protein from a sequential and structural point of view. Orf3a is a cation selective viral ion channel which has been shown to disrupt the endosomal pathways. E protein is one of the most conserved proteins among the SARS-CoV proteome which affects the ERGIC related pathways. The aqueous medium through the viroporins mediates the non-selective translocation of cations, affecting ionic homeostasis in the host cellular compartments. This ionic imbalance could potentially lead to increased inflammatory response in the host cell. Our results shed light into the mechanism of viroporin action, which can be potentially leveraged for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Our results corroborate with previously published transcriptomic data from COVID-19 infected lung alveolar cells where inflammatory responses and molecular regulators directly impacted by ion channelling were upregulated.",

    "abstract": "Recent development of cancer immunotherapy has opened unprecedented avenues to eliminate tumor cells using the human immune system. Cancer vaccines composed of neoantigens, or peptides unique to tumor cells due to somatic mutations, have emerged as a promising approach to activate or strengthen the immune response against cancer. A key step to identifying neoantigens is computationally predicting which somatically mutated peptides are presented on the cell surface by a human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Computational prediction relies on large amounts of high-quality training data, such as mass spectrometry data of peptides presented by one of several HLAs in living cells. We developed a complete pipeline to prioritize neoantigens for cancer vaccines. A key step of our pipeline is PEPPRMINT (PEPtide PResentation using a MIxture model and Neural neTwork), a model designed to exploit mass spectrometry data to predict peptide presentation by HLAs. We applied our pipeline to DNA sequencing data of 60 melanoma patients and identified a group of neoantigens that were more immunogenic in tumor cells than in normal cells. Additionally, the neoantigen burden estimated by PEPPRMINT was significantly associated with activity of the immune system, suggesting these neoantigens could induce an immune response.",

    "abstract": "DDE transposons are widespread selfish genetic elements, often comprising a large proportion of eukaryotic genomic content. DDE transposons have also made important contributions to varied host functions during eukaryotic evolution, and their transposases may be the most abundant and ubiquitous genes in nature. Yet much remains unknown about their basic biology. We employ a broadscale screen of DDE transposase diversity to characterise major evolutionary patterns for all 19 DDE transposon superfamilies. We identify considerable variation in DDE transposon superfamily size, and find a dominant association with animal hosts. While few DDE transposon superfamilies specialise in plants or fungi, the four largest superfamilies contain major plant-associated clades, at least partially underlying their relative success. We recover a pattern of host conservation among DDE transposon lineages, punctuated by occasional horizontal transfer to distantly related hosts. Host range and horizontal transfer are strongly positively correlated with DDE transposon superfamily size, arguing against variation in the capacity for generalism. We find that rates of horizontal transfer decrease sharply with increasing levels of host taxonomy, supporting the existence of host-associated barriers to DDE transposon spread. Overall, despite their relatively simple genetic structure, our results imply that trade-offs in host adaptation are important in defining DDE transposon-host relationships and evolution. In addition, our study provides a phylogenetic framework to facilitate the identification and further analysis of DDE transposons.",

    "abstract": "Many bioinformatics pipelines include tests for equilibrium. Tests for diploids are well studied and widely available, but extending these approaches to autopolyploids is hampered by the presence of double reduction, the co-migration of sister chromatid segments into the same gamete during meiosis. Though a hindrance for equilibrium tests, double reduction rates are quantities of interest in their own right, as they provide insights about the meiotic behavior of autopolyploid organisms. Here, we develop procedures to (i) test for equilibrium while accounting for double reduction, and (ii) estimate double reduction given equilibrium. To do so, we take two approaches: a likelihood approach, and a novel U-statistic minimization approach that we show generalizes the classical equilibrium{chi} 2 test in diploids. For small sample sizes and uncertain genotypes, we further develop a bootstrap procedure based on our U-statistic to test for equilibrium. Finally, we highlight the difficulty in distinguishing between random mating and equilibrium in tetraploids at biallelic loci.
