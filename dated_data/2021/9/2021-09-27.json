    "abstract": "Photoreceptors are proteins that sense incident light and then trigger downstream signaling events. Phytochromes are linear tetrapyrrole-binding photoreceptors present in plants, algae, fungi, and various bacteria. Most phytochromes respond to red and far-red light signals. Among the phytochrome superfamily, cyanobacteria-specific cyanobacteriochromes show much more diverse optical properties covering the entire visible region. Both phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes share the GAF domain scaffold to cradle the chromophore as the light-sensing region. It is unknown what physiological demands drove the evolution of cyanobacteriochromes in cyanobacteria. Here we utilize ancestral sequence reconstruction and report that the resurrected ancestral cyanobacteriochrome proteins reversibly respond to green and red light signals. pH titration analyses indicate that the deprotonation of the bound phycocyanobilin chromophore enables the photoreceptor to perceive green light. The ancestral cyanobacteriochromes show modest thermal reversion to the green light-absorbing form, suggesting that they evolved to sense green-rich irradiance rather than red light, which is preferentially utilized for photosynthesis. In contrast to plants and green algae, many cyanobacteria can utilize green light for photosynthesis with their special light-harvesting complexes, phycobilisomes. The evolution of green/red sensing cyanobacteriochromes may therefore have allowed ancient cyanobacteria to acclimate to different light environments by rearranging the absorption capacity of the cyanobacterial antenna complex by chromatic acclimation.\n\nSignificance StatementLight serves as a crucial environmental stimulus affecting the physiology of organisms across all kingdoms of life. Photoreceptors serve as important players of light responses, absorbing light and actuating biological processes. Among a plethora of photoreceptors, cyanobacteriochromes arguably have the wealthiest palette of color sensing, largely contributing to the success of cyanobacteria in various illuminated habitats. Our ancestral sequence reconstruction and the analysis of the resurrected ancestral proteins suggest that the very first cyanobacteriochrome most probably responded to the incident green-to-red light ratio, in contrast to modern red/far-red absorbing plant phytochromes. The deprotonation of the light-absorbing pigment for green light-sensing was a crucial molecular event for the invention of the new class of photoreceptors with their huge color tuning capacity.",

    "abstract": "The essential pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF2 (also called U2AF65) identifies polypyrimidine (Py) tract signals of nascent transcripts, despite length and sequence variations. Previous studies have shown that the U2AF2 RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) preferentially bind uridine-rich RNAs. Nonetheless, the specificity of the RRM1/RRM2 interface for the central Py tract nucleotide has yet to be investigated. We addressed this question by determining crystal structures of U2AF2 bound to a cytidine, guanosine, or adenosine at the central position of the Py tract, and compared U2AF2-bound uridine structures. Local movements of the RNA site accommodated the different nucleotides, whereas the polypeptide backbone remained similar among the structures. Accordingly, molecular dynamics simulations revealed flexible conformations of the central, U2AF2-bound nucleotide. The RNA binding affinities and splicing efficiencies of structure-guided mutants demonstrated that U2AF2 tolerates nucleotide substitutions at the central position of the Py tract. Moreover, enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of endogenous U2AF2 in human erythroleukemia cells showed uridine-sensitive binding sites with lower sequence conservation at the central nucleotide positions of otherwise uridine-rich, U2AF2-bound splice sites. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of RNA flexibility for protein recognition and take a step towards relating splice site motifs to pre-mRNA splicing efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "Cardenolides are a group of steroidal metabolites found in Digitalis lanata with potent cardioactive effects on animals. In plants, cardenolides are involved in various stress responses. However, the molecular mechanism of cardenolide increase during stresses is mostly unknown. Here we show that cardenolides were increased upon methyl jasmonate (MJ), sorbitol, potassium (KCl) chloride, and salicylic acid analog (BTH: 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) treatments. However, the expression of three known genes for cardenolide biosynthesis did not correlate well with these increases. Specifically, the expression of progesterone-5{beta}-reductases (P5{beta}R and P5{beta}R2) did not correlate with cardenolide increase. The expression of 3{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3{beta}HSD) correlated with cardenolide levels only during the BTH treatment. Mining the D. lanata transcriptome identified genes involved in cholesterol and phytosterol biosynthesis: SSR1 (sterol sidechain reductase), SMO1, and SMO3 (sterol methyl oxidase). Surprisingly, the expression of all three genes correlated well with the cardenolide increase after BTH treatment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SSR1 is likely involved in both cholesterol and phytosterol biosynthesis. In addition, SMO1 is likely specific to phytosterol biosynthesis, and SMO3 is specific to cholesterol biosynthesis. These results suggest that both cholesterol and phytosterol are involved in cardenolide biosynthesis. In summary, this work shows that cardenolides are important for stress responses in D. lanata and revealed a novel relationship between phytosterol and cardenolide biosynthesis.",

To facilitate the implementation of multicellular networks in the most commonly used eukaryotic chassis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed the yeast communication toolkit (YCTK). This toolkit is based on the fungal mating pathway and contains five pheromone-inducible promoters (response parts), eleven pheromones (-factors; sender parts), eleven pheromone receptors (Ste2; receiver parts), as well as five Bar1 proteases (suppressor parts). All YCTK parts were thoroughly characterized and are compatible with the commonly used yeast Golden Gate cloning standard. We demonstrated the application of the YCTK by implementing several different logic gate-like population networks. Furthermore, we used this toolkit to investigate the pheromone-receptor promiscuity patterns among different yeast species. This toolkit extends currently available resources for construction of complex multicellular eukaryotic networks with varying degrees of promiscuity and attenuation.",

    "abstract": "Collective transmission via structures containing several virions has recently emerged as a highly efficient mode of viral spread. Here, we demonstrate that HIV-1 spreads between T lymphocytes in the form of viral particles colonies that are concentrated and sheltered in an extracellular matrix (ECM) lattice enabling their collective transmission upon cell contacts. Intrinsically, ECM-clustered viruses infect T lymphocytes more efficiently than individual viral particles. They preserve HIV-1 transmission from antiretroviral treatment (ArT) and potent broadly neutralizing antibodies. We also show that collagen induced by HIV-1 infection controls the clustering of virions and their collective spread, thereby enhancing infectivity. CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-infected patients produce and transmit ECM-virus clusters, supporting that they could be involved in vivo. This study provides new insights into modes of HIV-1 transmission and identifies a novel fundamental role for collagen in this process. HIV-1 spread via ECM-virus clusters may have important implications for viral dissemination and persistence, including during therapy.",

However, how the bacteria respond to changes in temperature and coral host during heat stress is unknown. Here, we employed the cultivable, dominant species E. montiporae as a working organism to explore how Endozoicomonas responds to heat stress. We designed two experiments to clarify the extent to which E. montiporae is influenced by temperature and coral host. We detected differentially expressed protein (DEP) profiles in this bacterium at 31{degrees}C and 33{degrees}C compared to 25{degrees}C by tandem mass tags-based quantitative proteome analysis. Fifty DEPs, including many heat shock proteins, were detected when the temperature changed. The expression of antioxidant defense proteins and key pyruvate synthase proteins decreased, suggesting that E. montiporae were in a physiology of stress at 33{degrees}C. Furthermore, some proteins were differentially expressed because of the heat-stress-treated coral lysate specifically, suggesting that not only heat but also heat-induced host factors can affect the protein expression of the bacterium. This study provides an in-depth analysis of how the molecular mechanisms of Endozoicomonas are affected by heat stress and coral host.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions. Computational approaches inform function to aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. However, experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult as glycans can sample a wide range of low energy conformations, thus limiting the study of glycan-mediated molecular interactions. In this work, we expanded the RosettaCarbohydrate framework, developed and benchmarked effective tools for glycan modeling and design, and extended the Rosetta software suite to better aid in structural analysis and benchmarking tasks through the SimpleMetrics framework. We developed a glycan-modeling algorithm, GlycanTreeModeler, that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer, using adaptive kernel density estimates (KDE) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and from quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. After a rigorous optimization of kinematic and energetic considerations to improve near-native sampling enrichment and decoy discrimination, GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of diverse glycan structures, or \"trees\". Structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building. GlycanTreeModeler algorithms and associated tools were employed to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine that are able to direct the immune response by shielding regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, aid in both X-ray and electron microscopy density solutions and refinement, and help lead the way towards a new era of computational glycobiology.",

    "abstract": "Length control of flagella represents a simple and tractable system to investigate the dynamics of organelle size. Models for flagellar length control in the model organism, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have focused on the length-dependence of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system which manages the delivery and removal of axonemal subunits at the tip of the flagella. One of these cargoes, tubulin, is the major axonemal subunit, and its frequency of arrival at the tip plays a central role in size control models. However, the mechanisms determining tubulin dynamics at the tip are still poorly understood. We discovered a loss-of-function mutation that leads to shortened flagella, and found that this was an allele of a previously described gene, SHF1, whose molecular identity had not previously been determined. We found that SHF1 encodes a Chlamydomonas ortholog of Crescerin, previously identified as a cilia-specific TOG-domain array protein that can bind tubulin via its TOG domains and increase tubulin polymerization rates. In this mutant, flagellar regeneration occurs with the same initial kinetics as wild-type cells, but plateaus at a shorter length. Using a computational model in which the flagellar microtubules are represented by a differential equation for flagellar length combined with a stochastic model for cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics, we found that our experimental results are best described by a model in which Crescerin/SHF1 binds tubulin dimers in the cytoplasm and transports them into the flagellum. We suggest that this TOG-domain protein is necessary to efficiently and preemptively increase intra-flagella tubulin levels to offset decreasing IFT cargo at the tip as flagellar assembly progresses.",

In this study, we have performed global RNA-sequencing and functional assays on adipocytes obtained from subcutaneous (SC) and deep-neck (DN) depots of human neck and differentiated with or without BMP7. We found that BMP7 did not influence differentiation but upregulated browning markers, including UCP1 mRNA and protein. BMP7 also enhanced mitochondrial DNA content, fragmentation, and levels of oxidative phosphorylation complex subunits along with PGC1 and p-CREB upregulation. Furthermore, both UCP1-dependent proton leak and UCP1-independent, creatine driven substrate cycle coupled thermogenesis were augmented upon BMP7 treatment in SC and DN derived adipocytes. The gene expression analysis shed light also on possible role of genes unrelated to thermogenesis so far, including ACAN, CRYAB, and ID1, which were amongst the highest upregulated ones by BMP7 treatment in both types of adipocytes. Together, our study shows that BMP7 strongly upregulates thermogenesis in human neck area derived adipocytes, along with genes, which might have a supporting role in energy expenditure.",

To discover new candidate substrates of Wee1 kinase, we used SILAC-based phosphoproteomics and selective chemical inhibition to quantitatively compare phosphorylation site abundances in the presence and absence of Wee1 activity. Unexpectedly, we uncovered a role for the Wee1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdk1-cyclin B at tyrosine 15 (Y15) in facilitating chemical inhibition of Cdk1-cyclin B by the inhibitor RO3306. Thermal shift stability assays demonstrated greater binding affinity of RO3306 for Y15-phosphorylated Cdk1-cyclin B versus unphosphorylated complex, providing an additional molecular basis for the observed Wee1 inhibitor-based toxicity in human cells. In addition, our experiments identified Cdk5-CABLES and Cdk5-cyclin B as novel substrates of Wee1 during chemically induced exit from mitosis.

The fact that environmental conditions can trigger cyclically parthenogens to engage in distinct reproductive modes strongly suggests that gene expression plays a key role in the origin of cyclical parthenogenesis. However, the genetic basis underlying cyclical parthenogenesis remains understudied. In this study we characterize the female transcriptomic signature of sexual vs. asexual reproduction in the cyclically parthenogenetic microcrustacean Daphnia pulex and D. pulicaria. Our analyses of differentially expressed genes, pathway enrichment, and GO term enrichment clearly show that compared to sexual reproduction the asexual reproductive stage is characterized by both the under-regulation of meiosis and cell-cycle genes and the up-regulation of metabolic genes. We suggest that the under-regulation of meiosis and cell-cycle genes is responsible for the origin of parthenogenesis from meiosis, whereas differentially expressed metabolic genes may mediate choice of asexual vs. sexual reproductive pathway. Furthermore, our analyses identify some cases of divergent expression among gene family members (e.g., doublesex, NOTCH2) associated with asexual or sexual reproductive stage, suggesting potential functional divergence among gene family members.",

    "abstract": "Structural and physiological changes in the female reproductive system underlie the origins of pregnancy in multiple vertebrate lineages. In mammals, for example, the glandular portion of the lower reproductive tract has transformed into a structure specialized for supporting fetal development. These specializations range from relatively simple maternal provisioning in egg-laying monotremes to an elaborate suite of traits that support intimate maternal-fetal interactions in Eutherians. Among these traits are the maternal decidua and fetal component of the placenta, but there is considerable uncertainty about how these structures evolved. We identified the origins of pregnancy utilizing ancestral transcriptome reconstruction to infer functional evolution of the maternal-fetal interface. Remarkably, we found that maternal gene expression profiles are correlated with degree of placental invasion. These results indicate that an epitheliochorial-like placenta evolved early in the mammalian stem-lineage and that the ancestor of Eutherians had a hemochorial placenta, and suggest maternal control of placental invasiveness. Collectively, these data resolve major transitions in the evolution of pregnancy and indicate that ancestral transcriptome reconstruction can be used to study the function of ancestral cell, tissue, and organ systems.",

    "abstract": "Obesity, a leading cause of several metabolic abnormalities, is mainly due to an imbalance of energy homeostasis. IRX3 and IRX5 have been suggested as determinants of obesity in connection with the intronic variants of FTO, the strongest genetic risk factor of polygenic obesity in humans. Although the causal effects of Irx3 on obesity and its related metabolic consequences have been demonstrated in vivo, the metabolic function of Irx5 remains unclear. In this study, using mice homozygous for an Irx5-knockout (Irx5KO) allele, we show a direct link between Irx5 expression and regulation of body mass/composition and energy homeostasis. Irx5KO mice are leaner and resistant to diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities, primarily through the loss of adiposity with an increase in basal metabolic rate with adipose thermogenesis and lower food intake. Furthermore, our long-term feeding analysis found that Irx3 mutant mouse lines also have less food intake, indicating that lower caloric intake also contributes to their lean phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate that Irx5 is critical for energy homeostasis and regulation of body mass/composition and suggest that it likely acts in other tissues beyond adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "Heritable non-genetic information can regulate a variety of complex phenotypes. However, what specific non-genetic cues are transmitted from parents to their descendants are poorly understood. Here, we perform metabolic methyl-labelling experiments to track the heritable transmission of methylation from ancestors to their descendants in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that methylation is transmitted to descendants in proteins, RNA, DNA and lipids. We further find that in response to parental starvation, fed naive progeny display reduced fertility, increased heat stress resistance, and extended longevity. This intergenerational hormesis is accompanied by a heritable increase in N6-dimethyl adenosine (m6,2A) on the 18S ribosomal RNA at adenosines 1735 and 1736. We identified the conserved DIMT-1 as the m6,2A methyltransferase in C. elegans and find that dimt-1 is required for the intergenerational hormesis phenotypes. This study provides the first labeling and tracking of heritable non-genetic material across generations and demonstrates the importance of rRNA methylation for regulating the heritable response to starvation.",

    "abstract": "A significant challenge today within protein lipidology is to understand the relationship between cell structure, lipid membrane integrity, ion homeostasis and the embedded membrane proteins. The bacterial magnesium transporter A (MgtA) is a specialized P-type ATPase important for Mg2+ import into the cytoplasm; disrupted magnesium homeostasis is linked to intrinsic ribosome instability and nitro-oxidative stress in Salmonella strains. MgtAs function is highly dependent on anionic lipids, particularly cardiolipin, and further co-localization of cardiolipin with MgtA at the E. coli cell poles has been revealed. Here, we show that MgtA has functional specificity for cardiolipin 18:1, but it reaches maximum activity only in combination with cardiolipin 16:0, equivalent to the major components of native cardiolipin found in E. coli membranes. This is the first time it has been shown experimentally that two different lipid species from the same class, individually promoting low activity, can enhance activity in combination. Native mass spectrometry verifies the presence of two binding sites for cardiolipin and kinetic studies reveal that a cooperative relationship likely exists between the two different cardiolipin variants (cardiolipin 16:0 and cardiolipin 18:1). This is the first experimental evidence of cooperative effects between lipids of the same class, with only minor variations in their acyl chain composition, acting on a membrane protein. In summary, our results reveal that MgtA exhibits a highly complex interaction with one cardiolipin 18:1 and one cardiolipin 16:0, affecting protein activity and stability, and contributing to our understanding of the particular interactions between lipid environment and membrane proteins. Further, a better understanding of Mg2+ homeostasis in bacteria, due to its role as a virulence regulator, will provide further insights into the regulation and mechanism of bacterial infections.",

Newly engineered AAVs with improved abilities are now entering the clinic. It has proven challenging, however, to predict the translational potential of gene therapies developed in animal models, due to cross-species differences. Human retinal explants are the only available model of fully developed human retinal tissue, and are thus important for the validation of candidate AAV vectors. In this study, we evaluated 18 wildtype and engineered AAV capsids in human retinal explants using a recently developed single-cell RNA-Seq AAV engineering pipeline (scAAVengr). Human retinal explants retained the same major cell types as fresh retina, with similar expression of cell-specific markers, except for a cone population with altered expression of cone-specific genes. The efficiency and tropism of AAVs in human explants were quantified, with single-cell resolution. The top performing serotypes, K91, K912, and 7m8, were further validated in non-human primate and human retinal explants. Together, this study provides detailed information about the transcriptome profiles of retinal explants, and quantifies the infectivity of leading AAV serotypes in human retina, accelerating the translation of retinal gene therapies to the clinic.\n\nGraphic abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/461256v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e110ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a2c7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15f1633org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa741a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "It is well established that microgravity exposure causes significant muscle weakness and atrophy via muscle unloading. On Earth, muscle unloading leads to a disproportionate loss in muscle force and size with the loss in muscle force occurring at a faster rate. Though the exact mechanisms are unknown, a role for Ca2+ dysregulation has been suggested. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump actively brings cytosolic Ca2+ into the SR, eliciting muscle relaxation and maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). SERCA dysfunction contributes to elevations in [Ca2+]i, leading to cellular damage and thus may contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Here, we investigated SERCA function, SERCA regulatory protein content (sarcolipin, phospholamban, and neuronatin), and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) protein adduction in murine skeletal muscle after 35-37 days of spaceflight. In male and female soleus muscles, spaceflight led to drastic impairments in Ca2+ uptake despite significant increases in SERCA1a protein content. We attribute this impairment to an increase in RONS production and elevated total protein tyrosine (T) nitration and cysteine (S) nitrosylation. Contrarily, in the tibialis anterior (TA) we observed an enhancement in Ca2+ uptake, which we attribute to a shift towards a faster muscle fiber type (i.e., increased myosin heavy chain IIb and SERCA1a) without elevated total protein T-nitration and S-nitrosylation. Thus, spaceflight affects SERCA function differently between the soleus and TA. As the soleus is severely affected by spaceflight, future studies should determine whether improving SERCA function in this muscle can mitigate muscle atrophy and weakness.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are ubiquitous parasites of bacteria and major drivers of bacterial ecology and evolution. Despite an ever-growing interest in their biotechnological and therapeutic applications, detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying phage-host interactions remains scarce. Here, we show that bacteriophage N4 exploits a novel surface glycan, NGR, as a receptor to infect its host Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that this process is regulated by the second messenger c-di-GMP and that N4 infection is specifically stimulated by the diguanylate cyclase DgcJ while the phosphodiesterase PdeL effectively protects E. coli from N4-mediated killing. PdeL-mediated protection requires its catalytic activity to reduce c-di-GMP and includes a secondary role as a transcriptional repressor. We demonstrate that PdeL binds to and represses the promoter of the wec operon, which encodes components of the ECA exopolysaccharide pathway. However, only the acetylglucosamine epimerase WecB but none of the other ECA components is required for N4 infection. Based on this, we postulate that NGR is an N-acetylmannosamine-based carbohydrate polymer that is produced and exported to the cell surface of E. coli in a c-di-GMP dependent manner where it serves as a receptor for N4. This novel carbohydrate pathway is conserved in E. coli and other bacterial pathogens, serves as the primary receptor for a range of N4-like bacteriophages, and is induced at elevated temperature and by specific amino acid-based nutrients. These studies provide an entry point into understanding how bacteria use specific regulatory mechanisms to balance costs and benefits of highly conserved surface structures.\n\nImportanceBecause bacterial surface glycans are in direct contact with the environment they can provide essential protective functions during infections or against competing bacteria. But such structures are also  Achilles heels as they can serve as primary receptors for bacteriophages. Bacteria thus need to carefully control the exposure of conserved surface glycans to balance costs and benefits. Here, we identify a novel exopolysaccharide that is widely conserved in E. coli and is used by N4 and related bacteriophages as primary receptor. We demonstrate that the synthesis of NGR (N4 glycan receptor) is tightly controlled by the second messenger c-di-GMP in a highly specific manner and by a single diguanylate cyclase. These studies provide an example of how bacteria can alleviate the strong selective pressure imposed on them by bacteriophages entering through conserved surface structures by carefully regulating their synthesis and secretion.",

Understanding the genetic variations, mutations and recombination of the begomovirus population infecting papaya has several important implications in alleviating substantial losses, mainly in developing countries, including India. In an attempt for a bioinformatics driven study of diversity and variability of papaya leaf curl disease in India, a total of thirty-two (32) DNA-A and sixteen (16) betasatellite sequences were retrieved from GenBank. An uneven distribution of evolutionary divergence has been observed across the branch length, which triggered the estimated recombinational event. Interestingly, a maximum of the begomoviruses were found to be intra-species recombinants. Further genetic variability, selection pressure, and substitution rate acting on the population were estimated and found to be high enough to support the evolution of geminiviruses. Genetic divergence composition in all begomovirus datasets revealed predominance of nucleotide diversity driven by mutation. The analysis indicates that even though a significant fraction of the genetic variations might be due to recombination but, it was constantly lower than the mutation rate. Thus, the diversification of the begomovirus population is principally impelled by mutational dynamics.",

The aim of this study was to assess cardiovascular, metabolic and renal function in adult offspring of IF-exposed dams. Food was withheld from Wistar rats from 17:00 to 09:00 daily throughout pregnancy; controls had ad libitum access to food. Birth weight was unaffected; however male IF pups grew more slowly up to 10 weeks of age (P < 0.01) whereas IF females matched their control counterparts. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), glucose tolerance and basal renal function at 14 weeks were not affected by IF exposure. When offered saline solutions (0.9-2.1%) to drink, females showed a greater salt preference than males (P < 0.01); however there were no differences between dietary groups. A separate group of pups was weaned onto a 4% NaCl diet. SBP increased in IF pups sooner, at 7 weeks (P < 0.01), than controls which became hypertensive from 10 weeks. Renal function did not appear to differ; however markers of renal injury were elevated in IF males (P < 0.05). Maternal IF does not affect resting cardiovascular, metabolic and renal function; but when challenged by dietary salt load male IF offspring are more prone to renal injury.",
