    "abstract": "Testis development and sustained germ cell production in adults rely on the establishment and maintenance of spermatogonia stem cells and their proper differentiation into spermatocytes. Chromatin remodeling complexes regulate critical processes during gamete development by restricting or promoting accessibility of DNA repair and gene expression machineries to the chromatin. Here, we investigated the role of CHD4 and CHD3 catalytic subunits of the NURD complex during spermatogenesis. Germ cell-specific deletion of Chd4 early in gametogenesis, but not Chd3, resulted in arrested early gamete development due to failed cell survival of neonate undifferentiated spermatogonia stem cell population. Candidate assessment revealed that CHD4 controls expression of Dmrt1 and its downstream target Plzf, both described as prominent regulators of spermatogonia stem cell maintenance. Our results show the requirement of CHD4 in mammalian gametogenesis pointing to functions in gene expression early in the process.",

    "abstract": "Helping those who help others appears to be a widespread phenomenon. It is typically framed as indirect reciprocity in which individuals who are seen to help later receive returns from third parties. However, indirect reciprocity only works when individuals condition their help not just on how their recipient has behaved in the past but also on whether their recipient was justified in behaving that way. It also requires sufficient repeated interactions of this type among other individuals for a benefit to be reciprocated. These factors limit the scope of indirect reciprocity to explain cases where people do help those who help others. Here, I propose instead that helping can be explained by the indirect fitness benefits (or  relatedness) that result from helping other helpers in groups. This means that when individuals help other helpers, they may not make any returns via indirect reciprocity, but rather they may be helping a strategy of helping those who help. In this way, the helping strategy can spread even when helping has no net benefit to the individual helper. This is a form of relatedness in which individuals help their kin that are recognized by their helping behaviour. As such, conditional helping is likely to be found where population structure promotes relatedness through non-random association. The analysis suggests indirect reciprocity may not have played the decisive role in the evolution of human cooperation that is often thought, but paradoxically that the use of image scores deserves renewed attention as a strategy of helping those with the same behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The brain uses temporal structure in the environment, like rhythm in music and speech, to predict the timing of events, thereby optimizing their processing and perception. Temporal expectations can be grounded in different aspects of the input structure, such as a regular beat or a predictable pattern. One influential account posits that a generic mechanism underlies beat-based and pattern-based expectations, namely entrainment of low frequency neural oscillations to rhythmic input, while other accounts assume different underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we addressed this outstanding issue by examining EEG activity and behavioral responses during silent periods following rhythmic auditory sequences. We measured responses outlasting the rhythms both to avoid confounding the EEG analyses with evoked responses, and to directly test whether beat-based and pattern-based expectations persist beyond stimulation, as predicted by entrainment theories. To properly disentangle beat-based and pattern-based expectations, which often occur simultaneously, we used non-isochronous rhythms with a beat, a predictable pattern, or random timing. In Experiment 1 (N = 32), beat-based expectations affected behavioral ratings of probe events for two beat-cycles after the end of the rhythm. The effects of pattern-based expectations reflected expectations for one interval. In Experiment 2 (N = 27), using EEG, we found enhanced spectral power at the beat frequency for beat-based sequences both during listening and silence. For pattern-based sequences, enhanced power at a pattern-specific frequency was present during listening, but not silence. Moreover, we found a difference in the evoked signal following pattern-based and beat-based sequences. Finally, we show how multivariate pattern decoding and multi scale entropy - measures sensitive to non-oscillatory components of the signal - can be used to probe temporal expectations. Together, our results suggest that the input structure used to form temporal expectations may affect the associated neural mechanisms. We suggest climbing activity and low-frequency oscillations may be differentially associated with pattern-based and beat-based expectations.",

Here, by applying an in vitro system enabling inducible gene expression control, we report that moderate induction of transcriptionally active exogenous {beta}- catenin in {beta}-catenin null mouse ESCs promotes epiblast-like cell (EpiLC) derivation in vitro. Instead, in wild type cells moderate chemical pre-activation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway promotes EpiLC in vitro derivation.

Overall, our results confirm previous findings about the role of {beta}-catenin in pluripotency and differentiation, while indicating a role for its doses in promoting specific differentiation programs.",

    "abstract": "Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Functional roles of several non-coding transcripts including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to influence the pathobiology of autism. We hypothesized that there are more autism-associated lncRNAs to be discovered. Here, we utilized a systems biology approach to identify novel lncRNAs that might play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of autism. Based on the data provided by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI), a three-component regulatory network comprising mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and lncRNAs was constructed. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify molecular pathways potentially mediated by components of the network. The potential association of four candidate lncRNAs with autism was investigated experimentally by developing and verifying a valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mouse model of autism. We composed a network of 33 mRNA, 25 miRNA and 4 lncRNA nodes associated with neurologically-relevant pathways and functions. We then verified the differential expression of four candidate lncRNAs: Gm10033, 1500011B03Rik, A930005H10Rik and Gas5 in the brain of VPA-exposed mice. We furthermore identified a novel splice variant of Gm10033, designated as Gm10033-{Delta}Ex2, which was expressed in various mouse tissues. The integrative approach, we utilized, combines the analysis of a three-component regulatory network with experimental validation of targets in an animal model of autism. As a result of the analysis, we prioritized a set of candidate autism-associated lncRNAs. These links add to the common understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are involved in disease etiology, specifically in the autism.",

Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we monitored dendritic morphogenesis, odor-evoked responsiveness, endogenous Ca2+ signaling, and survival/death of adult-born juxtaglomerular neurons (abJGNs). We found that maturation of abJGNs is accompanied by a significant reduction in dendritic complexity, with surviving and subsequently eliminated cells showing similar degrees of dendritic remodeling. Surprisingly, 63% of eliminated abJGNs acquired odor-responsiveness before death, with amplitudes and time courses of odor-evoked responses similar to those recorded in surviving cells. We observed, however, a significant long-lasting enhancement of endogenous Ca2+ signaling in subsequently eliminated abJGNs, visible already 6 days before death. These findings identify ongoing endogenous Ca2+ signaling as a key predictor of abJGNs fate.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation and population sizes are critical factors for successful adaptation to novel environmental conditions. Gene flow between sub-populations is a potent mechanism to provide such variation and can hence facilitate adaptation, for instance by increasing genetic variation or via the introduction of beneficial variants. On the other hand, if gene flow between different habitats is too strong, locally beneficial alleles may not be able to establish permanently. In the context of evolutionary rescue, intermediate levels of gene flow are therefore often optimal for maximizing a species chance for survival in metapopulations without spatial structure. To which extent and under which conditions gene flow facilitates or hinders evolutionary rescue in spatially structured populations remains unresolved. We address this question by studying the differences between evolutionary rescue in the island model and in the stepping stone model in a gradually deteriorating habitat. We show that evolutionary rescue is modulated by the rate of gene flow between different habitats, which in turn depends strongly on the spatial structure and the pattern of environmental deterioration. We use these insights to show that in many cases spatially structured models can be translated into a simpler island model using an appropriately scaled effective migration rate.",

Knockdown was associated with increased embryonic growth (+7%) and metabolic rate (+25%), and decreased heart rate (- 50%) in early life. Juvenile growth and respiratory rate were also elevated (+30% and 7-fold increase respectively). The transcriptome was permanently remodelled by this transient disruption, with dysregulation of multiple growth, cardiac, and metabolic pathways. Phenotypic alteration persisted into adulthood, resulting in a leaner body with elevated skeletal and cardiac muscle content and aerobic scope (43%).

    "abstract": "Multiple recent studies have shown that motor activity greatly impacts the activity of primary sensory areas like V1. Yet, the role of this motor related activity in sensory processing is still unclear.\n\nHere we dissect how these behavior signals are broadcast to different layers and areas of the visual cortex. To do so, we leveraged a standardized and spontaneous behavioral fidget event in passively viewing mice. Importantly, this behavior event had no relevance to any ongoing task allowing us to compare its neuronal correlate with visually relevant behavior like running.\n\nA large two-photon Ca2+ imaging database of neuronal responses uncovered four neural response types during fidgets that were surprisingly consistent in their proportion and response patterns across all visual areas and layers of the visual cortex. Indeed, the layer and area identity could not be decoded above chance level based only on neuronal recordings. In contrast to running behavior, fidget evoked neural responses were independent to visual processing.\n\nThe broad availability of visually orthogonal standardized behavior signals could be a key component in how the cortex selects, learns and binds local sensory information with motor outputs. Contrary to relevant motor outputs, irrelevant motor signals would use a separate neural subspaces.\n\nSignificance StatementRecent studies have shown contextual and behavioral variables to dominate brain-wide activity, but yet it is unknown how this information is broadcast across cortical layers and areas. Using a large two-photon dataset collected in mice passively viewing a battery of visual stimuli, we characterized the neuronal response of neurons of the visual cortex to a standardized fidget behavior. We found that as much as 47% of excitatory neurons show significant co-activity with fidgets. Throughout all areas and layers we recorded from, those responses were distributed across surprisingly consistent three neural response types. Further analysis showed no interaction between fidget neural events and cells visual stimulus responses, contrasting with feedback neural signals induced by running. These contrasting response distribution patterns suggest that behavioral neuronal correlates are broadly available but will modulate sensory responses depending on their relevance to local sensory inputs.",

    "abstract": "STRUCTURED ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSThe majority of genetic kidney disease leading to kidney failure is caused by mutations in ciliary genes. How cilia malfunction leads to progressive kidney damage is poorly understood, but recent evidence links ciliopathy genes to CCL2 dependent macrophage recruitment in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most studied renal ciliopathy. Whether or not renal inflammation is involved in other renal ciliopathies is unclear.\n\nMETHODSWe combined mice models with kidney biopsies and renal epithelial cells sampled from human urine to characterize the renal inflammatory network of nephronophthisis (NPH), the most frequent renal ciliopathy in children.\n\nRESULTSIn human, mutations in cilia genes involved in NPH enhance urine excretion of the chemokine CCL2, causing abnormal macrophage recruitment in kidney tissues from NPH patients. Differing from ADPKD, inactivating Ccl2 specifically in mouse tubular cells does not rescue the NPH phenotype, suggesting that other inflammatory mediators are involved. Using transcriptional data from 2 NPH models, we identify a set of pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated in this disease, independently of CCL2. The majority of detectable transcripts from this set are specifically upregulated in kidney cells from NPH patients. In line with the function of these cytokines, NPH kidneys show disproportionate neutrophils and T cells infiltrates compared to healthy subject or hypertensive and diabetic chronic kidney disease patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThis study reveals that inflammation is a central aspect in human NPH and delineates a specific set of inflammatory mediators that regulates immune cell recruitment in human NPH.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMutations in genes encoding primary cilia proteins are the leading cause of genetic kidney failure. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), deregulated cilia signaling leads to kidney infiltration by macrophages through the chemokine CCL2. Little is known about renal inflammation in nephronophthisis (NPH), the most frequent pediatric renal ciliopathy. Using NPH mice models, tissues and cells from NPH patients, we unveil renal inflammation as preeminent feature of NPH. Remarkably, the renal inflammatory evoked by ciliary gene mutations in NPH does not overlap with ADPKD: it is CCL2 independent, involves a prominent recruitment of neutrophils and T cells and a specific cytokine signature. This unforeseen findings strengthen the link between primary cilia and renal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Core gene phylogenies provide a window into early evolution, but different gene sets and analytical methods have yielded substantially different views of the tree of life. Trees inferred from a small set of universal core genes have typically supported a long branch separating the archaeal and bacterial domains. By contrast, recent analyses of a broader set of non-ribosomal genes have suggested that Archaea may be less divergent from Bacteria, and that estimates of inter-domain distance are inflated due to accelerated evolution of ribosomal proteins along the inter-domain branch. Resolving this debate is key to determining the diversity of the archaeal and bacterial domains, the shape of the tree of life, and our understanding of the early course of cellular evolution. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of the marker genes key to the debate. We show that estimates of a reduced Archaea-Bacteria (AB) branch length result from inter-domain gene transfers and hidden paralogy in the expanded marker gene set. By contrast, analysis of a broad range of manually curated marker gene datasets from an evenly sampled set of 700 Archaea and Bacteria reveal that current methods likely underestimate the AB branch length due to substitutional saturation and poor model fit; that the best-performing phylogenetic markers tend to support longer inter-domain branch lengths; and that the AB branch lengths of ribosomal and non-ribosomal marker genes are statistically indistinguishable. Furthermore, our phylogeny inferred from the 27 highest-ranked marker genes recovers a clade of DPANN at the base of the Archaea, and places CPR within Bacteria as the sister group to the Chloroflexota.",

    "abstract": "Novel therapeutic approaches are needed for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who otherwise have limited options. Here we studied and deployed non-freezing  cytostatic hypothermia to stunt GBM growth. This contrasts with ablative, cryogenic hypothermia: a double-edged sword against tumors infiltrating otherwise healthy tissue. We investigated three grades of hypothermia in vitro and identified a cytostatic window of 20-25{degrees}C. For some glioma lines, 18 h/d of cytostatic hypothermia was sufficient to halt division in vitro. Cytostatic hypothermia induced cell cycle arrest, reduced metabolite production and consumption, and reduced inflammatory cytokine synthesis. Next, we fabricated an experimental device to test local cytostatic hypothermia in vivo in two rodent models of GBM: utilizing the rat F98 and the human U-87 MG lines. Hypothermia more than doubled the median survival of F98 bearing rats from 3.9 weeks to 9.7 weeks and two rats survived through 12 weeks. All U-87 MG bearing rats that successfully received cytostatic hypothermia survived their study period. Thus, this approach lengthened survival without chemical interventions. Unlike targeted therapeutics that are successful in preclinical models but fail in clinical trials, cytostatic hypothermia affects multiple cellular processes simultaneously. This, alongside reduced cellular division, suggests that opportunities for tumor evolution are reduced and the likelihood of translation to larger species may be more likely. In addition, based on our work, designs, and the literature, engineering a patient-centric device is tangible. Taken together, cytostatic hypothermia could be a novel approach to cancer therapy and eventually serve a valuable role to patients with GBM.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHypothermia influences multiple cellular pathways, can be a safe and effective approach to halt glioblastoma growth, and holds translational promise.",

In the present study, we integrated these two bodies of research, used the psychological continuity of self vs. other as a  test-case, and used fMRI to investigate whether these networks would encode social concepts differently. We found a robust dissociation between the DN and SN - while both networks contained sufficient information for decoding broad-stroke distinction of social categories, the DN carried more generalisable information for cross-classifying across social distance and emotive valence than did the SN. We also found that the overarching distinction of self vs. other was a principal divider of the representational space while social distance was an auxiliary factor (subdivision, nested within the principal dimension), and this representational landscape was more manifest in the DN than in the SN. Taken together, our findings demonstrate how insights from connectome research can benefit social neuroscience, and have implications for clarifying the two networks differential contributions to social cognition.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is known to optimize behavioral responses via error minimization, yet how past sensory experience shapes cerebellar output is still poorly understood. We imaged cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in larval zebrafish during a behavioral assay in which they learnt to expect the direction of optic flow stimulus. PCs encoded signals of expectation and a graded error signal when a deviant stimulus was encountered. The amplitude of the error signal scaled based on stimulus history over minute-timescales. Granule cells (GC) did not encode error, however, some GC types encoded putative expectation signals. When PC population-wide readouts of expectation and error signals were strong, swim latency was low and vice versa, indicating participation of these signals in motor planning. Consistent with this, lesioning the cerebellum abolished expectation-dependent modulation of swim latency. Based on these results we propose that PCs use expectation and error signals to acquire and update internal models of the world.\n\nHighlightsO_LILarval zebrafish learn to expect repeatedly encountered optic flow stimuli\nC_LIO_LIStimulus history over minutes contributes to an internal model of the sensory world\nC_LIO_LIPurkinje neuron activity encodes deviations from expected direction of optic flow\nC_LIO_LIThe cerebellum uses learnt expectations to generate lower latency swim responses\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Differential growth conditions typically trigger global transcriptional responses in filamentous fungi. Such fungal responses to environmental cues involve epigenetic regulation, including chemical histone modifications. It has been proposed that conditionally expressed genes, such as those that encode secondary metabolites but also effectors in pathogenic species, are often associated with a specific histone modification, lysine27 methylation of H3 (H3K27me3). However, thus far no analyses on the global H3K27me3 profiles have been reported under differential growth conditions in order to assess if H3K27me3 dynamics governs differential transcriptional. Using ChIP- and RNA-sequencing data from the plant pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae grown in three in vitro cultivation media, we now show that a substantial number of the identified H3K27me3 domains globally display stable profiles among these growth conditions. However, we do observe local quantitative differences in H3K27me3 ChIP-seq signal that associate with a subset of differentially transcribed genes between media. Comparing the in vitro results to expression during plant infection suggests that in planta-induced genes may require chromatin remodelling to achieve expression. Overall, our results demonstrate that some loci display H3K27me3 dynamics associated with concomitant transcriptional variation, but many differentially expressed genes are associated with stable H3K27me3 domains. Thus, we conclude that while H3K27me3 is required for transcriptional repression, it does not appear that transcriptional activation requires global erasure of H3K27me3. We propose that the H3K27me3 domains that do not undergo dynamic methylation may contribute to transcription through other mechanisms or may serve additional genomic regulatory functions.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research is shedding light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human host and on its role in human health state. Existing machine learning methods have shown great potential in discriminating healthy from diseased microbiome states. Most of them leverage shotgun metagenomic sequencing to extract gut microbial species-relative abundances or strain-level markers. Each of these gut microbial features showed diagnostic potential when tested separately; however, no existing approach combines them in a single predictive framework. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel deep learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. MVIB achieves competitive classification performance while being faster than existing methods. Additionally, MVIB offers interpretable results. Our model adopts an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks and computes a joint stochastic encoding of different input data modalities. We use MVIB to predict whether human hosts are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing gut microbial species-relative abundances and strain-level markers. MVIB is evaluated on human gut metagenomic samples from 11 publicly available disease cohorts covering 6 different diseases. We achieve high performance (0.80 < ROC AUC < 0.95) on 5 cohorts and at least medium performance on the remaining ones. We adopt a saliency technique to interpret the output of MVIB and identify the most relevant microbial species and strain-level markers to the models predictions. We also perform cross-study generalisation experiments, where we train and test MVIB on different cohorts of the same disease, and overall we achieve comparable results to the baseline approach. Further, we evaluate our model by adding metabolomic data derived from mass spectrometry as a third input modality. Our method is scalable with respect to input data modalities and has an average training time of < 1.4 seconds. The source code and the datasets used in this work are publicly available.\n\nAuthor summaryThe gut microbiome can be an indicator of various diseases due to its interaction with the human system. Our main objective is to improve on the current state of the art in microbiome classification for diagnostic purposes.

    "abstract": "The 3-dimensional (3D) conformation of the chromatin creates complex networks of noncoding regulatory regions (distal elements) and promoters impacting gene regulation. Despite the importance of the role of noncoding regions in complex diseases, little is known about their interplay within regulatory hubs and implication in multigenic diseases like schizophrenia. Here we show that cis-regulatory hubs (CRHs) in neurons highlight functional interactions between distal elements and promoters, providing a model to explain epigenetic mechanisms involved in complex diseases. CRHs represent a new 3D model, where distal elements interact to create a complex network of active genes. In a disease context, CRHs highlighted strong enrichments in schizophrenia-associated genes, schizophrenia-associated SNPs and schizophrenia heritability compared to equivalent structures. Finally, CRHs exhibit larger proportions of genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia compared to promoter-distal element pairs or TADs. CRHs thus capture causal regulatory processes improving the understanding of complex disease etiology such as schizophrenia. These multiple lines of genetic and statistical evidence support CRHs as 3D models to study dysregulation of gene expression in complex diseases more generally.\n\nSummary BlurbGenes and their regulatory elements are organized within 3D networks in neurons which model functional structures and explain schizophrenia genetic etiology.",

    "abstract": "In natural populations, the same mutation can lead to different phenotypic outcomes due to the genetic variation that exists among individuals. Such genetic background effects are commonly observed, including in the context of many human diseases. However, systematic characterization of these effects at the species level is still lacking to date. Here, we sought to comprehensively survey background-dependent traits associated with gene loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in 39 natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a transposon saturation strategy. By analyzing the modeled fitness variability of a total of 4,469 genes, we found that 15% of them, when impacted by a LoF mutation, exhibited a significant gain- or loss-of-fitness phenotype in certain natural isolates compared to the reference strain S288C. Out of these 632 genetic background-dependent fitness genes identified, a total of 2/3 show a continuous variation across the population while 1/3 are specific to a single genetic background. Genes related to mitochondrial function are significantly overrepresented in the set of genes showing a continuous variation and display a potential functional rewiring with other genes involved in transcription and chromatin remodeling as well as in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. Such rewiring effects are likely modulated by both the genetic background and the environment. While background-specific cases are rare and span diverse cellular processes, they can be functionally related at the individual level. All background-dependent fitness genes tend to have an intermediate connectivity in the global genetic interaction network and have shown relaxed selection pressure at the population level, highlighting their potential evolutionary characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the effects of a plant-host shift is important for monitoring insect populations over long time periods and for interventions in a conservation or pest management framework. In a heterogeneous environment, individuals may disperse between sources and sinks in order to persist. Here we propose a single-species two-patch model that aims to capture the generational movement of an insect that exhibits density-dependent dispersal, to see how shifting between hosts could alter its viability and asymptotic dynamics. We then analyse the stability and persistence properties of the model and further validate it using parameter estimates derived from laboratory experiments. In order to evaluate the potential of this model, we applied it to Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae), which has become a harmful pest in several countries around the world. Although many studies have investigated the preference and attractiveness of potential hosts on this invasive drosophilid, no studies thus far have investigated whether a shift of fruit host could affect such a species ecological viability or spatiotemporal persistence. The model results show that a shift in host choice can significantly affect the growth potential and fecundity of a species such as D. suzukii, which ultimately could aid such invasive populations in their ability to persist within a changing environment.",

In recent years, the addition of DNA and RNA sequencing to this framework has allowed researchers to leverage the statistical power inherent to experimental evolution study the genetic basis of longevity itself. Here we incorporated metabolomic data into to this framework to generate even deeper insights into the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying longevity differences in three groups of experimentally evolved D. melanogaster populations with different aging and longevity patterns. Our metabolomic analysis found that aging alters mitochondrial metabolism through increased consumption of NAD+ and increased usage of the TCA cycle. Combining our genomic and metabolomic data produced a list of biologically relevant candidate genes. Among these candidates, we found significant enrichment for genes and pathways associated with neurological development and function, and carbohydrate metabolism. While we do not explicitly find enrichment for aging canonical genes, neurological dysregulation and carbohydrate metabolism are both known to be associated with accelerated aging and reduced longevity. Taken together, our results provide plausible genetic mechanisms for what might be driving longevity differences in this experimental system. More broadly, our findings demonstrate the value of combining multiple types of omic data with experimental evolution when attempting to dissect mechanisms underlying complex and highly polygenic traits like aging.",

The axonal domain of these neurons is highly complex, with a large subset of non-synaptic release sites and a smaller subset of synaptic terminals from which glutamate or GABA are released. The molecular mechanisms regulating the connectivity of DA neurons and their neurochemical identity are unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules neurexins (Nrxns) regulate DA neuron neurotransmission. Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::Nrxns KO) showed that loss of Nrxns does not impair the basic development and ultrastructural characteristics of DA neuron terminals. However, loss of Nrxns caused an impairment of DA transmission revealed as a reduced rate of DA reuptake following activity-dependent DA release, decreased DA transporter levels, increased vesicular monoamine transporter expression, and impaired amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Strikingly, electrophysiological recording revealed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of the KO mice. These findings suggest that Nrxns act as key regulators of DA neuron connectivity and DA-mediated functions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe study provides the first direct evidence of the role of neurexins in dopaminergic neurons.\nC_LIO_LIThe synaptic adhesion molecules, neurexins, are not required for maintaining the structure of dopamine neuron terminals.\nC_LIO_LINeurexins regulate dopaminergic neurotransmission through regulation of dopamine reuptake, impacting amphetamine-induced locomotion.\nC_LIO_LIDeletion of Nrxns in DA neurons causes a region-specific increase of GABA release by DA neurons.\nC_LI",

Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals, particularly those lacking visual identifiers, is particularly challenging. Problems of mistaken identities and lost information on key anatomical features are common in existing methods. Here we propose a markerless video-based tool to simultaneously track two socially interacting mice of the same appearance. It incorporates conventional handcrafted tracking and deep learning based techniques, which are trained on a small number of labeled images from a very basic, uncluttered experimental setup. The output consists of body masks and coordinates of the snout and tail-base for each mouse. The method was tested on a series of cross-setup videos recorded under commonly used experimental conditions including bedding in the cage and fiberoptic or headstage implants on the mice. Results obtained without any human intervention showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach, evidenced by a near elimination of identities switches and a 10% improvement in tracking accuracy over a pure deep-learning-based keypoint tracking approach trained on the same data. Finally, we demonstrated an application of this approach in studies of social behaviour of mice, by using it to quantify and compare interactions between pairs of mice in which some are anosmic, i.e. unable to smell. Our results indicated loss of olfaction impaired typical snout-directed social recognition behaviors of mice, while non-snout-directed social behaviours were enhanced. Together, these results suggest that the hybrid approach could be valuable for studying group behaviors in rodents, such as social interactions.",

In self-compatible hermaphrodites, individuals may vary in their lifetime propensity for selfing, which consists of individual and environmental components. According to the reproductive assurance hypothesis explaining partial selfing, a key environmental factor is mate availability, which fluctuates with population density.\n\nWe quantified individual variation in selfing propensity in a hermaphroditic snail by manipulating mate availability, recording mating behaviour, estimating selfing rates from progeny arrays, and measuring female lifetime fitness. We found substantial among-individual variation in selfing propensity, including pure outcrossers, pure selfers, and two types of plastic individuals. This variation only manifested in the laboratory; for the highly dense field population, data suggest full outcrossing. Meanwhile, experimental levels of mate availability (low versus moderate) neither significantly affected selfing propensities nor selfing rates.\n\nInstead, selfing propensities had an individual, environment-independent component. Our results imply that selfing propensities are partially heritable and, when selected on, cause mean selfing rates to evolve. We propose that genetic variation in selfing propensities offers a reconciliation between the reproductive assurance hypothesis and its limited empirical support in animals: distributions of selfing propensities vary temporally and spatially, thus obscuring the relationship between population density and realised selfing rates.",

Since this huge amount of expression data accumulated from past studies is a promising source of new biological insights, we focused on a meta-analysis of 1783 runs of RNA-seq data under the conditions of two types of stresses: oxidative stress (OS) and hypoxia. The collected RNA-seq data of OS were organized as the OS dataset to retrieve and analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The OS-induced DEGs were compared with the hypoxia-induced DEGs retrieved from a previous study. The results from the meta-analysis of OS transcriptomes revealed two genes, CRIP1 and CRIP3, which were particularly downregulated, suggesting a relationship between OS and zinc homeostasis. The comparison between meta-analysis of OS and hypoxia showed that several genes were differentially expressed under both stress conditions, and it was inferred that the downregulation of cell cycle-related genes is a mutual biological process in both OS and hypoxia.",

This paper compared the stability of RDV encapsulated with our platform technology based polymer NV-387 (NV-CoV-2), in presence of plasma in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a non- clinical pharmacology studies of NV-CoV-2 (Polymer) and NV-CoV-2-R (Polymer encapsulated Remdesivir) in both NL-63 infected and uninfected rats were done. In an in vitro cell culture model experiment, antiviral activity of NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R are also compared with RDV.\n\nThe results are (i) NV-CoV-2 polymer encapsulation protects RDV from plasma- mediated catabolism in vitro and in vivo, too. (ii) Body weight measurements of the normal (uninfected) rats after administration of the test materials (NV-CoV-2, and NV-CoV-2-R) show no toxic effects on them. (iii) NL-63 infected rats body weights and their survival length were like uninfected rats after treatment with NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R, and the efficacy as an antiviral regimen were found in the order as below: NV-CoV-2-R > NV-CoV-2 > RDV.\n\nIn brief, our platform technology based NV-387-encapsulated-RDV (NV-CoV-2-R) drug has a dual effect on coronaviruses. First, NV-CoV-2 itself as an antiviral regimen. Secondly, RDV is protected from plasma-mediated degradation in transit, rendering altogether the safest and an efficient regimen against COVID-19.",

Here we used Nanopore ReCappable Sequencing (NRCeq), a new technique that can identify capped full-length RNAs, to assemble a complete annotation of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs and annotate the location of capping sites across the viral genome. We obtained robust estimates of sgRNA expression across cell lines and viral isolates and identified novel canonical and non-canonical sgRNAs, including one that uses a previously un-annotated leader-to-body junction site.

    "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are components of membrane phospholipids and precursors of bioactive lipid mediators. Here, we investigated the crosstalk of three pathways providing PUFAs for lipid mediator production: (i) secreted group X phospholipase A2 (GX sPLA2) and (ii) cytosolic group IVA PLA2 (cPLA2), which both mobilize PUFAs from phospholipids, and (iii) adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which breaks down triacylglycerols (TAGs) stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Combining lipidomic and functional analyses, we demonstrate that lipid mediator production depends on TAG turnover. GX sPLA2 directs PUFAs into TAGs and ATGL is required for their entry into lipid mediator biosynthetic pathways. ATGL also promotes the incorporation of LD-derived PUFAs into phospholipids representing substrates for cPLA2. Additionally, inhibition of TAG synthesis mediated by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) reduces the levels of mitogenic lipid signals and compromises tumour growth. This study expands the paradigm of PLA2-driven lipid mediator signalling and identifies LDs as central lipid mediator production hubs.",

Temporal sequences can be represented relative to a recurrent beat (beat-based or relative timing), or as a series of absolute durations (non-beat-based or absolute timing). Neuroimaging work suggests involvement of the basal ganglia, supplementary motor area (SMA), the premotor cortices, and the cerebellum in both beat- and non-beat-based timing. Here we examined how beat-based timing and non-beat-based sequence timing were affected by modulating excitability of the supplementary motor area, the right cerebellum, and the bilateral dorsal premotor cortices, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Participants were subjected to a sham stimulation session, followed an active stimulation session where anodal or cathodal 2mA tDCS was applied to the SMA, right premotor cortex, left premotor cortex, or the cerebellum. During both sessions, participants discriminated changes in rhythms which differentially engage beat-based or non-beat-based timing. Rhythm discrimination performance was improved by increasing SMA excitability, and impaired by decreasing SMA excitability. This polarity-dependent effect on rhythm discrimination was absent for cerebellar or premotor cortex stimulation, suggesting a crucial role of the SMA and/or its functionally connected networks in rhythmic timing mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Late-onset Alzheimers Disease (LOAD) pathology is rare in our closest living evolutionary relatives (chimpanzees), which also express much lower microglial levels of CD33(Siglec-3)-a myelomonocytic receptor inhibiting innate immune reactivity by extracellular V-set domain recognition of sialic acid(Sia)-containing \"self-associated molecular patterns\" (SAMPs). We earlier showed that V-set domain-deficient CD33-variant allele, protective against LOAD, is derived and specific to hominin-lineage. We now report that CD33 also harbors multiple hominin-specific V-set domain mutations and explore selection forces that may have favored such genomic changes. N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), the preferred Sia-ligand of ancestral CD33 is absent in humans, due to hominin-specific, fixed loss-of-function mutation in CMAH, which generates CMP-Neu5Gc from its precursor, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). Extensive mutational analysis and MD-simulations indicate that fixed change in amino acid 21 of hominin V-set domain and conformational changes related to His45 corrected for Neu5Gc-loss by switching to Neu5Ac-recognition. Considering immune-evasive \"molecular mimicry\" of SAMPs by pathogens, we found that human-specific pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Group B Streptococcus (affecting fertility and fetuses/neonates respectively) selectively bind huCD33 and this binding is significantly impacted by amino acid 21 modification. Alongside LOAD-protective CD33 alleles, humans harbor additional, derived, population-universal, cognition-protective variants absent in \"great ape\" genomes. Interestingly, 11 of 13 SNPs in these human genes (including CD33), that protect the cognitive health of elderly populations, are not shared by genomes of archaic hominins: Neanderthals and Denisovans. Finally, we present a plausible evolutionary scenario to compile, correlate and comprehend existing knowledge about huCD33 evolution and suggest that grandmothering emerged in humans.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to chemotherapy is a leading cause of treatment failure. Drug-resistance mechanisms involve mutations in specific proteins or changes in their expression levels. It is commonly understood that resistance mutations happen randomly prior to treatment and are selected during the treatment. However, selection of drug-resistant mutants in culture could be achieved by multiple drug exposures of cloned genetically identical cells, and thus cannot result from selection of pre-existent mutations. Accordingly, adaptation must involve generation of mutations de-novo upon drug treatment. Here we explored the origin of resistance mutations to a widely used Top1 inhibitor irinotecan, which triggers DNA breaks, causing cytotoxicity. Resistance mechanism involved gradual accumulation of recurrent mutations in non-coding regions of DNA at Top1-cleavage sites. Surprisingly, cancer cells had higher number of such sites than reference genome, which may define their increased sensitivity to irinotecan. Homologous recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks at these sites following initial drug exposures gradually reverted cleavage-sensitive \"cancer\" sequences back to cleavage-resistant \"normal\" sequences. These mutations reduced generation of DNA breaks upon subsequent exposures, thus gradually increasing the drug resistance. Together, large target size for mutations and their Top1-guided generation lead to their gradual and rapid accumulation, synergistically accelerating development of resistance.\n\nAbstract Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/470089v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d9d93forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45b88forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@157cafeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cff4a4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Accurately functioning genetic networks should be responsive to signals but prevent transmission of stochastic bursts of expression. Existing data in mammalian cells suggests that such transcriptional \"noise\" is transmitted by some genes and not others, suggesting that noise transmission is tunable, perhaps at the expense of other signal processing capabilities.However, systematic claims about noise transmission in genetic networks have been limited by the inability to directly measure noise transmission. Here we build a mathematical framework capable of modeling allelic correlation and noise transmission. We find that allelic correlation and noise transmission correspond across a broad range of model parameters and network architectures. We further find that limiting noise transmission comes with the trade-off of being unresponsive to signals, and that within the parameter regimes that are responsive to signals, there is a further trade-off between response time and basal noise transmission. Using a published allele specific single cell RNA-sequencing dataset, we found that genes with high allelic odds ratios are enriched for cell-type specific functions, and that within multiple signaling pathways, factors which are upstream in the pathway have higher allelic odds ratios than downstream factors. Overall, our findings suggest that some degree of noise transmission is required to be responsive to signals, but that minimization of noise transmission can be accomplished by trading-off for a slower response time.",

While it is clear that African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) act as the main wildlife reservoir, viral and immune response dynamics during FMD virus acute infection have not been described before in this species. We used experimental needle inoculation and contact infections with three Southern African Territories serotypes to assess clinical, virological and immunological dynamics for thirty days post infection. Clinical FMD in the needle inoculated buffaloes was mild and characterised by pyrexia. Despite the absence of generalised vesicles, all contact animals were readily infected with their respective serotypes within the first 2-9 days after being mixed with needle challenged buffaloes. Irrespective of the route of infection or serotype there were positive associations between the viral loads in blood and the induction of host innate pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins. Viral loads in blood and tonsils were tightly correlated during the acute phase of the infection, however, viraemia significantly declined after a peak at 4 days post infection (dpi), which correlated with the presence of detectable neutralising antibodies. In contrast, infectious virus was isolated in the tonsils until the last sampling point (30 dpi) in most animals. The pattern of virus detection in serum and tonsil swabs was similar for all three serotypes in the direct challenged and contact challenged animals.\n\nWe have demonstrated for the first time, that African buffalo are indeed systemically affected by FMD virus and clinical FMD in buffalo is characterized by a transient pyrexia. Despite the lack of FMD lesions, infection of African buffalo was characterised by high viral loads in blood and oropharynx, rapid and strong host innate and adaptive immune responses and high transmissibility.",

    "abstract": "Brain swelling occurs in cerebral malaria (CM) and may either reverse or result in fatal outcome. It is currently unknown how brain swelling in CM reverses, as investigations have been hampered by inadequate animal models. In this study, we show that reversible brain swelling in experimental murine cerebral malaria (ECM) can be induced reliably after single vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites as revealed by in vivo high-field (9.4T) magnetic resonance imaging. Our results provide evidence that parenchymal fluid increase and consecutive brain swelling results from transcellular blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), as revealed by electron microscopy. This mechanism enables reversal of brain swelling but does not prevent persistent focal brain damage, evidenced by microhemorrhages, in areas of most severe BBBD. In a cohort of 27 pediatric and adult CM patients (n=4 fatal, n=23 non-fatal) two out of four fatal CM patients (50%) and 8 out of 23 non-fatal CM patients (35%) showed microhemorrhages on MRI at clinical field strength of 1.5T, emphasizing the translational potential of the experimental model. Our data suggest that targeting transcellular BBBD may represent a promising adjunct therapeutic approach in cerebral brain swelling to reduce edema and may ultimately lead to a reduced permanent brain damage and a better longtime neurological outcome.\n\nAuthor summaryBrain swelling, which occurs in diseases such as cerebral malaria, is not necessarily fatal, and may reverse. Even upon reversal of brain swelling, neurological sequelae can still occur. The factors contributing to the reversibility of brain edema are not known, and treatment options remain therefore limited. Identifying the mechanisms leading to such reversibility could inform clinical management aimed at decreasing brain swelling and consecutive brain injury. Here we introduce a reproducible and simple animal model that allows comprehensive in vivo studies of reversible brain swelling in cerebral malaria at the peak of disease and upon recovery. We identify a specific type of blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) as a mechanism that occurs in brain swelling. We show that BBBD can reverse, but also highlight remaining brain damage in areas of most severe BBBD. As the ECM model introduced here bares crucial similarities to the CM in humans, our findings open strategies to study new therapeutic avenues and point to compounds that specifically target transcellular BBBD to reduce brain edema, and increase survival rates.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) strains that produce the toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL; PVL-SA) frequently cause recurrent skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). PVL binds to and kills human neutrophils, resulting in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, but the pathomechanism has not been extensively studied. Furthermore, it is unclear why some individuals colonized with PVL-SA suffer from recurring infections whereas others are asymptomatic. We thus aimed to (a) investigate how PVL exerts its pathogenicity on neutrophils and (b) identify factors that could help to explain the predisposition of patients with recurring infections.\n\nWe provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that PVL-induced NET formation is independent of NADPH-oxidase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, through NET proteome analysis we identified that the protein content of PVL-induced NETs is different from NETs induced by mitogen or the microbial toxin nigericin. The abundance of the proteins cathelicidin (CAMP), elastase (NE), and proteinase 3 (PRTN3) was lower on PVL-induced NETs, and as such they were unable to kill S. aureus. Furthermore, we found that neutrophils from affected patients express higher levels of CD45, one of the PVL receptors, and are more susceptible to be killed at a low PVL concentration than control neutrophils. Neutrophils from patients that suffer from recurring PVL-positive infections may thus be more sensitive to PVL-induced NET formation, which might impair their ability to combat the infection.\n\nImportanceIndividuals colonized by Staphylococcus aureus strains that produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL-SA) often present with recurrent skin and soft-tissue infections, whilst other individuals remain asymptomatic. PVL is a toxin that kills neutrophils, which results in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Traps induced by other stimuli are known to be toxic to S. aureus. We found however that NETs specifically induced by PVL are not toxic to S. aureus. Furthermore, we show that neutrophils from individuals that suffer from recurring PVL-SA infections are more sensitive to PVL-induced NET formation compared to healthy individuals. The significance of our work is in identifying a mechanism through which PVL-SA may actively counter the engagement of neutrophils. Moreover, we identified that patients with recuring PVL-SA infections may be more sensitive to this mechanism, which may help to explain their clinical condition and might provide avenues for future treatment development.",

    "abstract": "To fulfil their orchestrating function in immune cell trafficking in homeostasis and disease, a network of 49 chemokines and 23 receptors capitalizes on features of specificity, redundancy, and functional selectivity such as biased agonism. The discovery of the chemokine interactome, i.e. heteromeric chemokine-chemokine interactions, even across CC- and CXC-class borders, has further expanded the complexity within the network. Moreover, some inflammatory mediators, which are not structurally linked to classical CC-, CXC-, CX3C-, or C-chemokines, can bind to chemokine receptors and behave as atypical chemokines (ACKs). We identified the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as an ACK that binds to the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 to promote atherogenic leukocyte recruitment. Here, we hypothesized that chemokine-chemokine interactions extend to ACKs and that MIF may form heterocomplexes with classical chemokines. We tested this hypothesis, applying an unbiased chemokine protein binding array. The platelet chemokine CXCL4L1, but not its variant CXCL4 or the CXCR2/CXCR4 ligands CXCL8 or CXCL12, was identified as a candidate interactor. MIF/CXCL4L1 complexation was verified by co-immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon-resonance analysis, and microscale thermophoresis, which also established high-affinity binding (KD{asymp}100-150 nM). The binding interface was predicted by peptide array-based mapping and molecular docking. We next determined whether heterocomplex formation modulates inflammatory and atherogenic activities of MIF. MIF-elicited T-cell chemotaxis as assessed in a 3D-matrix-based live cell-imaging set-up was abrogated, when cells were co-incubated with MIF and CXCL4L1. Heterocomplexation also blocked MIF-triggered migration of Egfp+ microglia in cortical cultures in situ. Of note, CXCL4L1 blocked the binding of Alexa-MIF to a soluble ectodomain mimic of CXCR4 and co-incubation with CXCL4L1 attenuated MIF-triggered dynamic mass redistribution in HEK293-CXCR4 transfectants, indicating that complex formation interferes with MIF/CXCR4 pathways. As MIF and CXCL4L1 are abundant platelet products, we finally tested their role in platelet activation. Multi-photon microscopy, FLIM- FRET, and proximity ligation assay visualized heterocomplexes in platelet aggregates and clinical human thrombus sections. Moreover, heterocomplex formation inhibited MIF- stimulated thrombus formation under flow and skewed the morphology of adhering platelets from a large to a small lamellipodia phenotype. Together, our study establishes a novel molecular interaction, adding to the complexity of the chemokine interactome and chemokine/receptor network. MIF/CXCL4L1, or more generally, ACK/CXC-motif chemokine heterocomplexes may be promising target structures to modulate inflammation and thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria live attached to surfaces in densely-packed communities1,2. While new experimental and imaging techniques are beginning to provide a window on the complex processes that play out in these communities, resolving the behaviour of individual cells through time and space remains a major challenge. Although a number of different software solutions have been developed to track microorganisms3-8, these approaches typically rely on a large number of user-defined parameters that must be carefully tuned to effectively track cells. Testing a given parameter combination can take hours to days depending on the size of the dataset, making iterative optimisation impractical. To overcome these limitations, we have developed FAST, the Feature-Assisted Segmenter/Tracker, which uses unsupervised machine learning to optimise tracking while maintaining ease of use. Our approach, rooted in information theory, largely eliminates the need for users to iteratively adjust parameters manually and make qualitative assessments of the resulting cell trajectories. Instead, FAST measures multiple distinguishing \"features\" for each cell and then autonomously quantifies the amount of unique information each feature provides. We then use these measurements to determine how data from different features should be combined to minimize tracking errors. Comparing our algorithm with a naive approach that uses cell position alone revealed that FAST produced 4 to 10 times fewer tracking errors. The modular design of FAST combines our novel tracking method with tools for segmentation, extensive data visualisation, lineage assignment, and manual track correction. It is also highly extensible, allowing users to extract custom information from images and seamlessly integrate it into downstream analyses. FAST therefore enables high-throughput, data-rich analyses with minimal user input. It has been released for use either in Matlab or as a compiled stand-alone application, and is available at https://bit.ly/3vovDHn, along with extensive tutorials and detailed documentation.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is difficult to treat due to dormant cells in hypoxic granulomas, and stochastically-formed persisters tolerant of antibiotics. Bactericidal antibiotics kill by corrupting their energy-dependent targets. We reasoned that noise in the expression of an energy-generating component will produce rare persister cells. In sorted low ATP M. tuberculosis grown on acetate there is considerable cell-to-cell variation in the level of mRNA coding for AckA, the acetate kinase. Quenching the noise by overexpressing ackA sharply decreases persisters, showing that it acts as the main persister gene under these conditions. This demonstrates that a low energy mechanism is responsible for the formation of M. tuberculosis persisters and suggests that the mechanism of their antibiotic tolerance is similar to that of dormant cells in a granuloma. Entrance into a low energy state driven by stochastic variation in expression of energy-producing enzymes is likely a general mechanism by which bacteria produce persisters.",

M. abscessus subsp. abscessus cells were injected into the silkworm hemolymph. When reared at 37{degrees}C, the silkworms died within 2 days post-infection with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus. Viable cell numbers of M. abscessus subsp. abscessus increased in the hemolymph of silkworms injected with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus. Silkworms were not killed by injections with heat-killed M. abscessus subsp. abscessus cells. The administration of clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug used to treat the infection, prolonged the survival time of silkworms injected with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus. The LD50 values of 7 clinical isolates were determined using the silkworm infection model and differed by up to 9-fold. The Mb-17 isolate, which was identified as a pathogenic strain in the silkworm infection model, induced more detachment of human THP-1-derived macrophages during infection than the Mb-10 isolate. These findings suggest that the silkworm M. abscessus infection model with can be used to quantitatively evaluate the virulence of M. abscessus clinical isolates in a short time period.",

    "abstract": "Determining the mechanisms by which genes are switched on and off during development and differentiation is a key aim of current biomedical research. Gene transcription has been widely observed to occur in a discontinuous fashion, with short bursts of activity interspersed with longer periods of inactivity. It is currently not known if or how this dynamic behaviour changes as mammalian cells differentiate. To investigate this, using a newly developed on-microscope analysis, we monitored mouse -globin transcription in live cells throughout sequential stages of erythropoiesis. We find that changes in the overall levels of -globin transcription are most closely associated with changes in the fraction of time a gene spends in the active transcriptional state. We identify differences in the patterns of transcriptional bursting throughout differentiation, with maximal transcriptional activity occurring in the mid-phase of differentiation. Early in differentiation, we observe increased fluctuation in the patterns of transcriptional activity whereas at the peak of gene expression, in early and intermediate erythroblasts, transcription appears to be relatively stable and efficient. Later during differentiation as -globin expression declines, we again observed more variability in transcription within individual cells. We propose that the observed changes in transcriptional behaviour may reflect changes in the stability of enhancer-promoter interactions and the formation of active transcriptional compartments as gene expression is turned on and subsequently declines at sequential stages of differentiation.",

    "abstract": "To monitor the effect of nature restoration projects in North Sea ecosystems, accurate and intensive biodiversity assessments are vital. DNA based techniques and especially environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is becoming a powerful monitoring tool. However, current approaches are based on genetic target regions <500 nucleotides, which offer limited taxonomic resolution. We developed a method for eDNA metabarcoding, based on nanopore sequencing of a longer amplicon, enabling improved identification of fish species. We designed a universal primer pair targeting a 2kb region of fish mitochondria, and compared it to the commonly used MiFish primer pair that targets only [~]170bp. In sillico and mock community testing showed that the 2kb fragments improved the accurate identification of genetically closely related species. eDNA was amplified, and sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION in combination with the sequence read processing pipeline Decona. Analyzing eDNA from a North Sea aquarium showed that sequences from both primer pairs could be assigned to most species, but both approaches also identified unique species in the aquarium eDNA. Next, both primer pairs were used on multiple eDNA samples from the North Sea. Here, similar location specific fish communities were obtained from both approaches. More species were identified through the MiFish approach in the field samples. Interestingly, this difference was not observed in the aquarium, suggesting that 2kb fragment based metabarcoding potentially detects more recent occurrences of animals. This new method has the potential to improve and expand the molecular toolbox for eDNA based monitoring approaches.",

    "abstract": "Nedd4/Rsp5 family E3 ligases mediate numerous cellular processes, many of which require the E3 ligase to interact with PY-motif containing adaptor proteins. Several Arrestin-Related Trafficking adaptors(ARTs) of Rsp5 were self-ubiquitinated for activation, but the regulation mechanism remains elusive. Remarkably, we demonstrate that Art1, Art4, and Art5 undergo K63-linked di-ubiquitination by Rsp5. This modification enhances the PM recruitment of Rsp5 by Art1 or Art5 upon substrate induction, required for cargo protein ubiquitination. In agreement with these observations, we find that di-ubiquitin strengthens the interaction between the Pombe orthologs of Rsp5 and Art1, Pub1 and Any1. Further, we discover that the HECT domain exosite protects the K63-linked di-ubiquitin on the adaptors from cleavage by the deubiquitination enzyme Ubp2. Strikingly, loss of this protection results in the loss of K63-linked di-ubiquitin from the adaptors and diverts the adaptors for K48-linked poly-ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Together, our study uncovers a novel ubiquitination modification implemented by Rsp5 adaptor proteins, underscoring the regulatory mechanism of how adaptor proteins control the recruitment and activity of Rsp5 for the turnover of membrane proteins.",

In C. elegans, the epidermal aECM, the cuticle, is composed mainly of different types of collagen, associated in circumferential ridges separated by furrows. Here, we show that in mutants lacking furrows, the normal intimate connection between the epidermis and the cuticle is lost, specifically at the lateral epidermis, where, in contrast to the dorsal and ventral epidermis, there are no hemidesmosomes. At the ultrastructural level, there is a profound alteration of structures that we term \"meisosomes\", in reference to eisosomes in yeast. We show that meisosomes are composed of stacked parallel folds of the epidermal plasma membrane, alternately filled with cuticle. We propose that just as hemidesmosomes connect the dorsal and ventral epidermis, above the muscles, to the cuticle, meisosomes connect the lateral epidermis to it. Moreover, furrow mutants present marked modifications of the biomechanical properties of their skin and exhibit a constitutive damage response in the epidermis. As meisosomes co-localise to macrodomains enriched in phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, they might act, like eisosomes, as signalling platforms, to relay tensile information from the aECM to the underlying epidermis, as part of an integrated stress response to damage.",

    "abstract": "Some species are difficult to observe and others, need to be not disturbed because of their vulnerability. In response to the difficulty of studying the dispersal behaviors of these species, some areas of biology have been combined in order to access the information despite practical limitations. Here we present the combination of several methodologies from landscape ecology to non- invasive population genetics that allow us to obtain important information on Rinolophus hipposideros, a vulnerable European bat. We genotyped 18 georeferrenced colonies in Brittany (France) from droppings collected in their refuges. We used 6 microsatellite markers in order to obtain the genetic distances between them. On the other hand we calculated Euclidian distances between the refuges occupied by these colonies and some ecological distances with the Pathmatrix module of ArcGis 3.2. We tested hypothesis about the difficulty of dispersal of the species in areas without forest cover or with a low density of hedges. Thanks to the Monmonier algorithm we could infer possible genetic barriers between the colonies and we could compare their location to the presence of landscape barriers (areas with little tree cover). We detected a pattern of isolation by distance that reveals limited dispersal capacities in the species but no pattern linked to ecological distances. We found that some of the neighboring colonies with greater genetic distances between them were located in areas with low density of hedges which could suggest an impact of this landscape element in their movements. Finer studies should allow us to conclude on the need or not of forest cover in the dispersal of this species.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/470144v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (65K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1efb190org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17287c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3072c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf84a9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genomes hold a treasure trove of protein fossils: fragments of formerly protein-coding DNA, which mainly come from transposable elements (TEs) or host genes. These fossils reveal ancient evolution of TEs and genomes, and many fossils have been exapted to perform diverse functions important for the hosts fitness. However, old and highly-degraded fossils are hard to identify, standard methods (e.g. BLAST) are not optimized for this task, and few Paleozoic protein fossils have been found.\n\nHere, a recently optimized method is used to find protein fossils in vertebrate genomes. It finds Paleozoic fossils predating the amphibian/amniote divergence from most major TE categories, including virus-related Polinton and Gypsy elements. It finds 10 fossils in the human genome (8 from TEs and 2 from host genes) that predate the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates, probably from the Ordovician period. It also finds types of transposon and retrotransposon not found in human before. These fossils have extreme sequence conservation, indicating exaptation: some have evidence of gene-regulatory function, and they tend to lie nearest to developmental genes. Some ancient fossils suggest \"genome tectonics\", where two fragments of one TE have drifted apart by up to megabases, possibly explaining gene deserts and large introns.\n\nThis paints a picture of great TE diversity in our aquatic ancestors, with patchy TE inheritance by later vertebrates, producing new genes and regulatory elements on the way. Host-gene fossils too have contributed anciently-conserved DNA segments. This paves the way to further studies of ancient protein fossils.",

However, the accurate molecular arrangement of NPCs remains enigmatic owing to their huge size and highly dynamic nature.

In each IR monomer, two approximately parallel rhomboidal structures of the inner and outer layers are sandwiched with the Z-shaped Nup188-Nup192 middle layer and Nup188, Nup192 and Nic96 link all subunits to constitute a relatively stable IR monomer, while the intact IR is assembled by loose and instable interactions between IR monomer. These structures reveal various interaction modes and extensive flexible connections in the assembly, providing a structural basis for the stability and malleability of IR.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAccurate structure of inner ring reveals its assembly and function in dilation and constriction of nuclear pore complex.",

By using colorectal cancer organoids, we phenotypically tracked their spheroid formation and growth capacity to a single-cell resolution, and we discovered that the spheroid-forming cells exhibit a heterogeneous growth pattern, consisting of slow- and fast-growing spheroids. The isolated fast-growing spheroids seem to preserve a dual-growing pattern through multiple passages, whereas the isolated slow-growing spheroids are restricted to a slow-growing pattern. Notably, the spheroids of both patterns were tumorigenic. Moreover, the expression of CSC markers varied among the subpopulations with different growth patterns. The isolated slow-growing spheroids adopted the dual-growing pattern by various extrinsic triggers, in which Musashi-1 plays a key role. The slow-growing fraction was resistant to chemotherapy, and its successful isolation can provide an in vitro platform allowing us to elucidate their role in drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "C4 and CAM photosynthesis have repeatedly evolved in plants over the past 30 million years. Because both repurpose the same set of enzymes but differ in their spatial and temporal deployment, they have long been considered as distinct and incompatible adaptations. Remarkably, Portulaca contains multiple C4 species that perform CAM when droughted. Spatially explicit analyses of gene expression reveal that C4 and CAM systems are completely integrated in P. oleracea, with CAM and C4 carbon fixation occurring in the same cells and CAM-generated metabolites likely incorporated directly into the C4 cycle. Flux balance analysis corroborates the gene expression and predicts an integrated C4+CAM system under drought. This first spatially explicit description of a C4+CAM photosynthetic metabolism presents a new blueprint for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is a model microorganism for the study of Streptomycetes, antibiotic production, and secondary metabolism in general. Even though S. coelicolor has an outstanding variety of regulators among bacteria, little effort to globally study its transcription has been made. We manually curated 29 years of literature and databases to assemble a meta-curated experimentally-validated gene regulatory network (GRN) with 5386 genes and 9707 regulatory interactions ([~]41% of the total expected interactions). This provides the most extensive and up-to-date reconstruction available for the regulatory circuitry of this organism. Only [~]6% (534/9707) are supported by experiments confirming the binding of the transcription factor to the upstream region of the target gene, the so-called \"strong\" evidence. While for the remaining interactions there is no confirmation of direct binding. To tackle network incompleteness, we performed network inference using several methods (including two proposed here) for motif identification in DNA sequences and GRN inference from transcriptomics. Further, we contrasted the structural properties and functional architecture of the networks to assess the reliability of the predictions, finding the inference from DNA sequence data to be the most trustworthy approach. Finally, we show two applications of the inferred and the curated networks. The inference allowed us to propose novel transcription factors for the key Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs). The curated network allowed us to study the conservation of the system-level components between S. coelicolor and Corynebacterium glutamicum. There we identified the basal machinery as the common signature between the two organisms. The curated networks were deposited in Abasy Atlas (https://abasy.ccg.unam.mx/) while the inferences are available as Supplementary Material.",

It is a locus for interactions between long-range inputs, L1 interneurons and apical tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons. While input to neocortical L1 has been studied intensively, the level and effect of input to this layer has still not been completely characterized. Here we examined the input to L1 of mouse somatosensory cortex with retrograde tracing and optogenetics. Our assays reveal that local input to L1 is predominantly from L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons and interneurons, and that subtypes of local L5 and L6b neurons project to L1 with different probabilities. Long-range input from sensory-motor cortices to L1 of S1 also arose predominantly from L2/3 neurons. Our optogenetic experiments showed that intra-telencephalic L5 pyramidal neurons drive L1 interneurons but have no effect on L5 apical tuft dendrites. Dual retrograde tracing revealed that a fraction of local and long-range neurons were both presynaptic to L5 neurons and projected to L1. Taken together our work highlights the prominent role of local inputs to L1 and shows the potential for complex interactions between long-range and local inputs which are both in position to modify the output of somatosensory cortex.",

S. aureus often targets the vascular endothelium to interfere with proper host responses during invasive infections. In this study, we provide evidence that S. aureus {beta}-toxin inhibits wound repair mechanisms in human endothelial cells by preventing cell proliferation and migration. These findings were confirmed in a rabbit aortic explant model where {beta}-toxin impedes sprout formation. Decreased cell proliferation was accompanied by decreased production of the angiogenic proteins endothelin-1, IGFBP-3, thrombospondin-1, TIMP-1, and TIMP-4. Meanwhile, inhibited wound repair was marked by increased HGF secretion from endothelial cells, likely a marker of endothelial cell damage. Together, these findings establish a mechanistic role for {beta}-toxin where it inhibits proper tissue repair processes that likely promote S. aureus infective niche.",

    "abstract": "Accurate detection and segmentation of single cells in three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence timelapse images is essential for observing individual cell behaviors in large bacterial communities called biofilms. Recent progress in machine-learning-based image analysis is providing this capability with every increasing accuracy. Leveraging the capabilities of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we recently developed bacterial cell morphometry in 3D (BCM3D), an integrated image analysis pipeline that combines deep learning with conventional image analysis to detect and segment single biofilm-dwelling cells in 3D fluorescence images. While the first release of BCM3D (BCM3D 1.0) achieved state-of-the-art 3D bacterial cell segmentation accuracies, low signal-to-background ratios (SBRs) and images of very dense biofilms remained challenging. Here, we present BCM3D 2.0 to address this challenge. BCM3D 2.0 is entirely complementary to the approach utilized in BCM3D 1.0. Instead of training CNNs to perform voxel classification, we trained CNNs to translate 3D fluorescence images into intermediate 3D image representations that are, when combined appropriately, more amenable to conventional mathematical image processing than a single experimental image. Using this approach, improved segmentation results are obtained even for very low SBRs and/or high cell density biofilm images. The improved cell segmentation accuracies in turn enable improved accuracies of tracking individual cells through 3D space and time. This capability opens the door to investigating timedependent phenomena in bacterial biofilms at the cellular level.",

    "abstract": "Adenylate Cyclase Toxin (ACT or CyaA) is an important virulence factor secreted by Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium causative of whooping cough, playing an essential role in the establishment of infection in the respiratory tract. ACT is a pore-forming cytolysin belonging to the RTX (Repeats in ToXin) family of leukotoxins, capable of permeabilizing several cell types and pure lipid vesicles. Besides, the toxin delivers its N-terminal adenylate cyclase domain into the target cytosol, where catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP, which affects cell signalling. In this study we have made two major observations. First, we show that ACT binds free cholesterol, and identify in its sequence 38 potential cholesterol-recognition motifs. Second, we reveal that four of those motifs are real, functional cholesterol-binding sites. Mutations of the central phenylalanine residues in said motifs have an important impact on the ACT lytic and translocation activities, suggesting their direct intervention in cholesterol recognition and toxin functionality. From our data a likely transmembrane topology can be inferred for the ACT helices constituting the translocation and the hydrophobic regions. From this topology a simple and plausible mechanism emerges by which ACT could translocate its AC domain into target cells, challenging previous views in the field. Blocking the ACT-cholesterol interactions might thus be an effective approach for inhibiting ACT toxicity on cells, and this could help in mitigating the severity of pertussis disease in humans.",

Reduced spine density, activated microglia phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) were observed in wild-type mice after LPS injection, whereas hIL-37tg mice showed no impairment.

DNA- replication-related template switching is a poorly known mutational mechanism capable of causing major chromosomal rearrangements as well as creating short inverted sequence copies that appear as local mutation clusters in sequence comparisons. I reanalyzed haplotype-resolved genome assemblies representing 25 human populations and multinucleotide variants aggregated from 140,000 human sequencing experiments. Local template switching could explain thousands of complex mutation clusters across the human genome, the loci segregating within and between populations. I developed computational tools for identification of template switch events using both short-read sequencing data and genotype data, and for genotyping candidate loci using short-read data. The characteristics of template-switch mutations complicate their detection and, worryingly, widely used analysis pipelines for short-read sequencing data, normally capable of identifying single nucleotide changes, were found to miss template-switch mutations of tens of base pairs, potentially invalidating medical genetic studies searching for a causative allele behind genetic diseases. Combined with the massive sequencing data now available for humans, the novel tools described here enable building catalogs of affected loci and studying the cellular mechanisms behind template switching in both healthy organisms and disease.",

    "abstract": "Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a pathogenic fungus that infects hundreds of crop species, causing extensive yield loss every year. Chemical fungicides are used to control this phytopathogen, but with concerns about increasing resistance and impacts on non-target species, there is a need to develop alternative control measures. In the present study, we engineered Brassica napus to constitutively express a hairpin (hp)RNA molecule to silence ABHYRDOLASE-3 in S. sclerotiorum. We demonstrate the potential for Host Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS) to protect B. napus from S. sclerotiorum using leaf, stem and whole plant infection assays. The interaction between the transgenic host plant and invading pathogen was further characterized at the molecular level using dual-RNA sequencing and at the anatomical level through microscopy to understand the processes and possible mechanisms leading to increased tolerance to this damaging necrotroph. We observed significant shifts in the expression of genes relating to plant defense as well as cellular differences in the form of structural barriers around the site of infection in the HIGS-protected plants. Our results provide proof-of-concept that HIGS is an effective means of limiting damage caused by S. sclerotiorum to the plant and demonstrates the utility of this biotechnology in the development of resistance against fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA)-releasing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNcDA) inhibit target cells in the striatum through postsynaptic activation of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for GABAergic signaling remain unclear, as SNcDA neurons lack enzymes typically required to produce GABA or package it into synaptic vesicles. Here we show that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1), an enzyme proposed to function as a GABA synthetic enzyme in SNcDA neurons does not produce GABA for synaptic transmission. Instead, we demonstrate that SNcDA axons obtain GABA exclusively through presynaptic uptake using the membrane GABA transporter Gat1 (encoded by Slc6a1). GABA is then packaged for vesicular release using the vesicular monoamine transporter Vmat2. Our data therefore show that presynaptic transmitter recycling can substitute for de novo GABA synthesis and that Vmat2 contributes to vesicular GABA transport, expanding the range of molecular mechanisms available to neurons to support inhibitory synaptic communication.",

    "abstract": "Semantic control is the capability to operate on meaningful representations, selectively focusing on certain aspects of meaning while purposefully ignoring other aspects based on ones behavioural aim. This ability is especially vital for comprehending figurative/ambiguous language. It remains unclear, at the topographical level, why/how regions involved in semantic control seem reliably juxtaposed alongside other functionally specialised regions in the association cortex. We investigated this issue by characterising how semantic control regions topographically relate to the default-mode network (associated with memory and abstract cognition) and multiple-demand network (associated with executive control). Topographically, we confirmed that semantic control areas were sandwiched by the default-mode and multi-demand networks, forming an orderly arrangement observed both at the individual- and group-level. Functionally, semantic control regions exhibited  hybrid responses, fusing a preference for cognitively demanding processing (multiple-demand) and a preference for meaningful representations (default-mode) into a domain-specific preference for difficult operations on meaningful representations. When projected onto the principal gradient of human connectome, the neural activity of semantic control showed a robustly dissociable trajectory from visuospatial control, implying different roles in the functional transition from sensation to cognition. We discuss why the hybrid functional profile of semantic control regions might result from their intermediate topographical positions.",
