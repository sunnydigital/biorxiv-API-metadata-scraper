    "abstract": "Generally, sexual organisms contain two haploid genomes, one from each parent, united in a single diploid nucleus of the zygote which links their fate during growth. A fascinating exception to this are Basidiomycete fungi, where the two haploid genomes remain separate in a dikaryon, retaining the option to fertilize subsequent monokaryons encountered. How the ensuing nuclear competition influences the balance of selection within and between individuals is largely unexplored. We test the consequences of the dikaryotic lifecycle for mating success and mycelium-level fitness components. We assume a tradeoff between mating fitness at the level of the haploid nucleus and fitness of the fungal mycelium. We show that the maintenance of fertilization potential by dikaryons leads to a higher proportion of fertilized monokaryons, but that the ensuing intra-dikaryon selection for increased nuclear mating fitness leads to reduced mycelium fitness relative to a diploid life cycle. However, this fitness reduction is lower compared to a hypothetical life cycle where dikaryons can also exchange nuclei. Prohibition of fusion between dikaryons therefore reduces the level of nuclear parasitism. The number of loci influencing fitness is an important determinant of the degree to which average mycelium-level fitness is reduced. The results of this study crucially hinge upon a tradeoff between nucleus and mycelium-level fitness. We discuss the evidence for this assumption and the implications of an alternative that there is a positive relationship between nucleus and mycelium-level fitness.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical stimuli such as stretch and resistance training are essential to regulate growth and function of skeletal muscle. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in sensing mechanical stress during muscle formation remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of the mechano-sensitive ion channel Piezo1 during myogenic progression. Direct manipulation of Piezo1 in muscle stem cells alters their myogenic progression. Indeed, Piezo1 knockdown suppresses myoblast fusion leading to smaller myotubes. Such event is accompanied by significant downregulation of the fusogenic protein Myomaker. In parallel, while Piezo1 knockdown also lowers Ca2+ influx in response to stretch, Piezo1 activation increases Ca2+ influx in response to stretch and enhances myoblasts fusion. We believe these findings may help understand molecular defects present in some muscle diseases. Altogether our study shows that Piezo1 is essential for terminal muscle differentiation acting on myoblast fusion, suggesting that Piezo1 deregulation may have implications in muscle aging and degenerative diseases including muscular dystrophies.",

    "abstract": "Trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1) is a highly conserved enzyme that converts the 5 mono-methylguanosine cap of snRNAs to a trimethylguanosine cap. Here, we show that loss of TGS1 in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and D. rerio results in neurological phenotypes similar to those caused by Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) deficiency. Importantly, expression of human TGS1 ameliorates the SMN-dependent neurological phenotypes in both flies and worms, revealing that TGS1 can partly counteract the effects of SMN deficiency. TGS1 loss in HeLa cells leads to the accumulation of immature U2 and U4atac snRNAs with long 3 tails that are often uridylated. snRNAs with defective 3 terminations also accumulate in Drosophila Tgs1 mutants. Consistent with defective snRNA maturation, TGS1 and SMN mutant cells also exhibit partially overlapping transcriptome alterations that include aberrantly spliced and readthrough transcripts. Together, these results identify a neuroprotective function for TGS1 and reinforce the view that defective snRNA maturation affects neuronal viability and function.",

However, methods providing lower-dimensional representations of microbiome dynamics both at the community and individual taxa level are not currently available. To that end, we present EMBED: Essential MicroBiomE Dynamics, a probabilistic non-linear tensor factorization approach. Similar to normal mode analysis in structural biophysics, EMBED infers ecological normal modes (ECNs), which represent the unique orthogonal modes capturing the collective behavior of microbial communities. A very small number of ECNs can accurately approximate microbiome dynamics across multiple data sets. Inferred ECNs reflect specific ecological behaviors, providing natural templates along which the dynamics of individual bacteria may be partitioned. Moreover, the multi-subject treatment in EMBED systematically identifies subject-specific and universal abundance dynamics that are not detected by traditional approaches. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of EMBED as a versatile dimensionality reduction tool for studies of microbiome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Natural decisions involve two seemingly separable processes: inferring the relevant task (task-belief) and performing the believed-relevant task. The assumed separability has led to the traditional practice of studying task-switching and perceptual decision-making individually. Here, we used a novel paradigm to manipulate and measure macaque monkeys task-belief, and demonstrated inextricable neuronal links between flexible task-belief and perceptual decision-making. We showed that in animals, but not artificial networks that performed as well or better than the animals, stronger task-belief is associated with better perception. Correspondingly, recordings from neuronal populations in cortical areas 7a and V1 revealed that stronger task-belief is associated with better discriminability of the believed-relevant but not the believed-irrelevant feature. Perception also impacts belief updating: noise fluctuations in V1 help explain how task-belief is updated. Our results demonstrate that complex tasks and multi-area recordings can reveal fundamentally new principles of how biology affects behavior in health and disease.",

Using multiple experimental designs, live-dead cell staining, and real-time cell cycle imaging, we measure necrotic and proliferation-inhibited regions in over 1000 4D tumour spheroids (3D space plus cell cycle status). By intentionally varying the initial spheroid size and temporal sampling frequencies across multiple cell lines, we collect an abundance of measurements of internal spheroid structure. These data are difficult to compare and interpret. However, using an objective mathematical modelling framework and statistical identifiability analysis we quantitatively compare experimental designs and identify design choices that produce reliable biological insight. Measurements of internal spheroid structure provide the most insight, whereas varying initial spheroid size and temporal measurement frequency is less important. Our general framework applies to spheroids grown in different conditions and with different cell types.",

Functional connectivity (FC) analysis with short sliding windows and coactivation pattern (CAP) analysis are two widely used methods for assessing the dynamic characteristics of brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

In this study, we found that the results of CAP analysis were similar for real fMRI data and simulated stationary data with matching covariance structures and spectral contents.

Cardiolipin plays an important role in regulating mitochondria function and dynamics. Yet, the mechanisms connecting cardiolipin distribution and mitochondrial protein function remain indirect. In our previous work, we established an in vitro system reconstituting mitochondrial inner membrane fusion mediated by Opa1. We found that the long form of Opa1 (l-Opa1) works together with the proteolytically processed short form (s-Opa1) to mediate fast and efficient membrane fusion. Here, we extend our reconstitution system to generate supported lipid bilayers with asymmetric cardiolipin distribution. Using this system, we find the presence of cardiolipin on the inter-membrane space-facing (outer) leaflet is important for membrane tethering and fusion. We discuss how the presence of cardiolipin in this leaflet may influence protein and membrane properties, and future applications for this approach.",

    "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, with increased incidence in elderly individuals. In this work, we analyzed the transcriptome of human HSCs purified from young and elderly healthy donors, as well as MDS patients, identifying transcriptional alterations following eight different patterns of expression. While aging-associated lesions seemed to predispose HSCs to myeloid transformation, disease-specific alterations may trigger MDS development. Among MDS-specific lesions, we detected the upregulation of the transcription factor DDIT3. Overexpression of DDIT3 in human healthy HSCs induced an MDS-like transcriptional state, and a delay in erythropoiesis. Such effect was associated with downregulation of transcription factors required for normal erythropoiesis, and with a failure in the activation of their transcriptional programs. Moreover, DDIT3 knockdown in CD34+ cells from MDS patients with anemia was able to restore erythropoiesis. These results identify DDIT3 as a driver of dyserythropoiesis, and a potential therapeutic target to restore the inefficient erythropoiesis characterizing MDS patients.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThis study defines how human aging and MDS development are characterized by transcriptional alterations in HSCs that follow different patterns, some of which may contribute to myeloid transformation. Among them, we demonstrate how MDS-specific upregulation of DDIT3 in HSCs induces dyserythropoiesis, while its knockdown in HSPCs from MDS patients restores proper erythroid differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection, an evolutionary force that retains genetic diversity, has been detected in multiple genes and organisms, such as the sexual mating loci in fungi. However, to quantify the strength of balancing selection and define the mating-related genes require a large number of specimens. In tetrapolar basidiomycete fungi, sexual type is determined by two unlinked loci, MATA and MATB. Genes in both loci defines mating type identity, control successful mating and completion of the life cycle. These loci are usually highly diverse. Previous studies have speculated, based on culture crosses, that species of the non-model genus Trichaptum (Hymenochaetales, Basidiomycota) possess a tetrapolar mating system, with multiple alleles. Here, we sequenced a hundred and eighty specimens of three Trichaptum species. We characterized the chromosomal location of MATA and MATB, the molecular structure of MAT regions and their allelic richness. Our sequencing effort was sufficient to molecularly characterize multiple MAT alleles segregating before the speciation event of Trichaptum species. Our analyses suggested that long-term balancing selection has generated trans-species polymorphisms. Mating sequences were classified in different allelic classes based on an amino acid identity (AAI) threshold supported by phylogenetics. The inferred allelic information mirrored the outcome of in vitro crosses, thus allowing us to support the degree of allelic divergence needed for successful mating. Even with the high amount of divergence, key amino acids in functional domains are conserved. The observed allelic classes could potentially generate 14,560 different mating types. We conclude that the genetic diversity of mating in Trichaptum loci is due to long-term balancing selection, with limited recombination and duplication activity. Our large number of sequenced specimens highlighted the importance of sequencing multiple individuals from different species to detect the mating-related genes, the mechanisms generating diversity and the evolutionary forces maintaining them.\n\nAuthor summaryFungi have complex mating systems, and basidiomycete fungi can encode thousands of mating types. Individuals with the same mating type cannot mate. This sexual system has evolved to facilitate sexual mating, increasing the chances to recombine into advantageous allelic combination and prune deleterious alleles. We explored the genomes of hundred and eighty specimens, combined with experimental mating studies of selected specimens, from a non-model organism (Trichaptum). We characterized the genomic regions controlling sex. The mating ability of the specimens confirmed the role of the mating alleles observed in the genomic data. The detailed analyses of many specimens allowed us to observe gene duplication and rearrangements within the mating loci, increasing the diversity within these loci. We supported previous suggestions of balancing selection in this region, an evolutionary force that maintains genomic diversity. These results supports that our fungal specimens are prone to outcross, which might facilitate the adaptation to new conditions.",

    "abstract": "N-glycan-mediated activation of the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) under pathological conditions has been implicated in myeloproliferative neoplasms induced by mutant calreticulin, which forms an endogenous receptor-agonist complex that constitutively activates the receptor. However, the molecular basis for this mechanism has not been studied because no external agonists existed. We describe the structure and function of a marine sponge-derived MPL agonist, thrombocorticin (ThC), a homodimerized lectin with calcium-dependent fucose-binding properties. ThC-induced activation persists due to limited receptor internalization. The strong synergy between ThC and thrombopoietin suggests that ThC catalyzes the formation of receptor dimers on the cell surface. MPL is subject to sugar-mediated activation, where the kinetics differ from those of cytokines. This result suggests the presence of diverse receptor activation pathways in human thrombopoiesis.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA marine sponge lectin catalyzes thrombopoietin receptor dimerization and activation, exhibiting strong synergy with thrombopoietin, and modulates internalization of the receptor.",

    "abstract": "The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is a structure that describes the joint genealogies of sampled DNA sequences along the genome. Recent computational methods have made impressive progress towards scalably estimating whole-genome genealogies. In addition to inferring the ARG, some of these methods can also provide ARGs sampled from a defined posterior distribution. Obtaining good samples of ARGs is crucial for quantifying statistical uncertainty and for estimating population genetic parameters such as effective population size, mutation rate, and allele age. Here, we use standard neutral coalescent simulations to benchmark the estimates of pairwise coalescence times from three popular ARG inference programs: ARGweaver, Relate, and tsinfer+tsdate. We compare 1) the true coalescence times to the inferred times at each locus; 2) the distribution of coalescence times across all loci to the expected exponential distribution; 3) whether the sampled coalescence times have the properties expected of a valid posterior distribution. We find that inferred coalescence times at each locus are most accurate in ARGweaver, and often more accurate in Relate than in tsinfer+tsdate. However, all three methods tend to overestimate small coalescence times and underestimate large ones. Lastly, the posterior distribution of ARGweaver is closer to the expected posterior distribution than Relates, but this higher accuracy comes at a substantial trade-off in scalability. The best choice of method will depend on the number and length of input sequences and on the goal of downstream analyses, and we provide guidelines for the best practices.",

    "abstract": "Biomaterials, like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), are soft, biocompatible, and tuneable, which makes them useful to delineate specific substrate factors that regulate the complex landscape of cell-substrate interactions. We used a commercial formulation of PDMS to fabricate substrates with moduli 40 kPa, 300 kPa, and 1.5 MPa, and cultured HMF3S fibroblasts on them. Gene expression analysis was performed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cellular and nuclear morphologies were analyzed using confocal imaging, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were determined with gelatin zymography. Results, comparing mechanotransduction on PDMS substrates with control petridishes, show that substrate stiffness modulates cell morphologies and proliferations. Cell nuclei were rounded on compliant substrates and correlated with increased tubulin expression. Proliferations were higher on stiffer substrates with cell cycle arrest on softer substrates. Integrin 5 expression decreased on lower stiffness substrates, and correlated with inefficient TGF-{beta} activation. Changes to the activated state of the fibroblast on higher stiffness substrates were linked to altered TGF-{beta} secretion. Collagen I, collagen III, and MMP-2 expression levels were lower on compliant PDMS substrates as compared to stiffer ones; there was little MMP-9 activity on substrates. These results demonstrate critical feedback mechanisms between substrate stiffness and ECM regulation by fibroblasts which is highly relevant in diseases like tissue fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Variability in the detection and discrimination of weak visual stimuli has been linked to oscillatory neural activity. In particular, the amplitude of activity in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) has been shown to impact upon the objective likelihood of stimulus detection, as well as measures of subjective visibility, attention, and decision confidence. We aimed to clarify how preparatory alpha influences performance and phenomenology, by recording simultaneous subjective measures of attention and confidence (Experiment 1), or attention and visibility (Experiment 2) on a trial-by-trial basis in a visual detection task. Across both experiments, alpha amplitude was negatively and linearly correlated with the intensity of subjective attention. In contrast to this linear relationship, we observed a quadratic relationship between the strength of alpha oscillations and subjective ratings of confidence and visibility. We find that this same quadratic relationship links alpha amplitude to the strength of stimulus evoked responses. Visibility and confidence judgements corresponded to the strength of evoked responses, but confidence, uniquely, incorporated information about attentional state. As such, our findings reveal distinct psychological and neural correlates of metacognitive judgements of attentional state, stimulus visibility, and decision confidence.",

    "abstract": "Application of machine learning algorithms to structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data has yielded behaviorally meaningful estimates of the biological age of the brain (brain-age). The choice of the machine learning approach in estimating brain-age in children and adolescents is important because age-related brain changes in these age-groups are dynamic. However, the comparative performance of the multiple machine learning algorithms available has not been systematically appraised. To address this gap, the present study evaluated the accuracy (Mean Absolute Error; MAE) and computational efficiency of 21 machine learning algorithms using sMRI data from 2,105 typically developing individuals aged 5 to 22 years from five cohorts. The trained models were then tested in two independent holdout datasets, comprising 4,078 pre-adolescents aged 9-10 years and another sample of 594 individuals aged 5-21 years. The algorithms encompassed parametric and nonparametric, Bayesian, linear and nonlinear, tree-based, and kernel-based models. Sensitivity analyses were performed for parcellation scheme, number of neuroimaging input features, number of cross-validation folds, number of extreme outliers, and sample size. The best performing algorithms were Extreme Gradient Boosting (MAE of 1.49), Random Forest Regression (MAE of 1.58) and Support Vector Regression with Radial Basis Function Kernel (MAE of 1.64) which had acceptable and comparable computational efficiency. Findings of the present study could be used as a guide for optimizing methodology when quantifying age-related changes in youth.",

    "abstract": "Determining the mechanisms by which genes are switched on and off during development and differentiation is a key aim of current biomedical research. Gene transcription has been widely observed to occur in a discontinuous fashion, with short bursts of activity interspersed with longer periods of inactivity. It is currently not known if or how this dynamic behaviour changes as mammalian cells differentiate. To investigate this, using a newly developed on-microscope analysis, we monitored mouse -globin transcription in live cells throughout sequential stages of erythropoiesis. We find that changes in the overall levels of -globin transcription are most closely associated with changes in the fraction of time a gene spends in the active transcriptional state. We identify differences in the patterns of transcriptional bursting throughout differentiation, with maximal transcriptional activity occurring in the mid-phase of differentiation. Early in differentiation, we observe increased fluctuation in the patterns of transcriptional activity whereas at the peak of gene expression, in early and intermediate erythroblasts, transcription appears to be relatively stable and efficient. Later during differentiation as -globin expression declines, we again observed more variability in transcription within individual cells. We propose that the observed changes in transcriptional behaviour may reflect changes in the stability of enhancer-promoter interactions and the formation of active transcriptional compartments as gene expression is turned on and subsequently declines at sequential stages of differentiation.",

The role of NK3 homeobox 2 (Nkx3.2) transcription factor in patterning the primary jaw joint of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) is well known, however knowledge about its regulatory mechanism is lacking. In this study, we report a proximal enhancer element of Nkx3.2 that is deeply conserved in gnathostomes but undetectable in the jawless hagfish. This enhancer is active in the developing jaw joint region of the zebrafish Danio rerio, and was thus designated as jaw joint regulatory sequence 1 (JRS1). We further show that JRS1 enhancer sequences from a range of gnathostome species, including a chondrichthyan and mammals, have the same activity in the jaw joint as the native zebrafish enhancer, indicating a high degree of functional conservation despite the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fish lineages or the transition of the primary jaw joint into the middle ear of mammals. Finally, we show that deletion of JRS1 from the zebrafish genome using CRISPR/Cas9 leads to a transient jaw joint deformation and partial fusion. Emergence of this Nkx3.2 enhancer in early gnathostomes may have contributed to the origin and shaping of the articulating surfaces of vertebrate jaws.",

    "abstract": "Copper (Cu) is one of the most abundant trace metals in all organisms, involved in a plethora of cellular processes. Yet elevated concentrations of the element are harmful, and interestingly prokaryotes are more sensitive for environmental Cu stress than humans. Various transport systems are present to maintain intracellular Cu homeostasis, including the prokaryotic plasmid-encoded multiprotein pco operon, which is generally assigned as a defense mechanism against elevated Cu concentrations. Here we structurally and functionally characterize the outer membrane component of the Pco system, PcoB, recovering a 2.2 [A] structure, revealing a classical {beta}-barrel architecture. Unexpectedly, we identify a large opening on the extracellular side, linked to a considerably electronegative funnel that becomes narrower towards the periplasm, defining an ion conducting pathway as also supported by metal binding quantification via ICP-MS and MD simulations. However, the structure is partially obstructed towards the periplasmic side, and yet flux is permitted in the presence of a Cu gradient as shown by functional characterization in vitro. Complementary in vivo experiments demonstrated that isolated PcoB confers increased sensitivity towards Cu. Aggregated, our findings indicate that PcoB serves to permit Cu import. Thus, it is possible the Pco system physiologically accumulates Cu in the periplasm as a part of an unorthodox defense mechanism against metal stress. These results point to a previously unrecognized principle of maintaining Cu homeostasis and may as such also assist in the understanding and in efforts towards combatting bacterial infections of Pco-harboring pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that can present as low- or high-risk tumors (LR-NBs and HR-NBs), the latter group showing poor prognosis due to metastasis and strong resistance to current therapy. NBs are known to originate from alterations to cells in the sympatho-adrenal lineage derived from the neural crest, but whether LR-NBs and HR-NBs differ in the way they exploit the transcriptional program underlying their developmental origin remains unclear. Here, we compared the transcriptional landscapes of primary samples of LR-NBs, HR-NBs and human fetal adrenal gland, and thereby identified the transcriptional signature associated to NB formation that further distinguishes LR-NBs from HR-NBs. The majority of the genes comprising this signature belong to the core sympatho-adrenal developmental program, are associated with favorable patient prognosis and with diminished disease progression. The top candidate gene of this list, Neurexophilin-1 (NXPH1), encodes a ligand of the transmembrane receptors -Neurexins (-NRXNs). Our functional in vivo and in vitro assays reveal that NXPH1/-NRXN signaling has a dual impact on NB behavior: whereas NXPH1 and -NRXN1 promote NB tumor growth by stimulating cell proliferation, they conversely inhibit the ability of NB cells to form metastases. Our findings uncover a module of the neural crest-derived sympatho-adrenal developmental program that opposes neuroblastoma malignancy by impeding metastasis, and pinpoint NXPH1/-NRXN signaling as a promising target to treat HR-NBs.",

We proposed a new method (TripletGO) to deduce GO terms of protein-coding and non-coding genes, through the integration of four complementary pipelines built on transcript expression profiling, genetic sequence alignment, protein sequence alignment and naive probability, respectively. TripletGO was tested on a large set of 5,754 genes from 8 species (human, mouse, arabidopsis, rat, fly, budding yeast, fission yeast, and nematoda) and 2,433 proteins with available expression data from the CAFA3 experiment and achieved function annotation accuracy significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art approaches. Detailed analyses show that the major advantage of TripletGO lies in the coupling of a new triplet-network based profiling method with the feature space mapping technique which can accurately recognize function patterns from transcript expressions. Meanwhile, the combination of multiple complementary models, especially those from transcript expression and protein-level alignments, improves the coverage and accuracy of the final GO annotation results.

In amniotes, representations of self-location have been found in regions such as the hippocampus. It is unknown whether more ancient brain regions contain such representations and by which pathways they may drive locomotion. Fish displaced by water currents must prevent uncontrolled drift to potentially dangerous areas. We found that larval zebrafish track such movements and can later swim back to their earlier location. Whole-brain functional imaging revealed the circuit enabling this process of positional homeostasis. Position-encoding brainstem neurons integrate optic flow, then bias future swimming to correct for past displacements by modulating inferior olive and cerebellar activity. Manipulation of position-encoding or olivary neurons abolished positional homeostasis or evoked behavior as if animals had experienced positional shifts. These results reveal a multiregional hindbrain circuit in vertebrates for optic flow integration, memory of self-location, and its neural pathway to behavior.",

    "abstract": "When a person listens to sound, the brain time-locks to specific aspects of the sound. This is called neural tracking and it can be investigated by analysing neural responses (e.g., measured by electroencephalography) to continuous natural speech. Measures of neural tracking allow for an objective investigation of a range of auditory and linguistic processes in the brain during natural speech perception. This approach is more ecologically valid than traditional auditory evoked responses and has great potential for research and clinical applications. This article reviews the neural tracking framework and highlights three prominent examples of neural tracking analyses: neural tracking of the fundamental frequency of the voice (f0), the speech envelope and linguistic features. Each of these analyses provides a unique point of view into the human brains hierarchical stages of speech processing. F0-tracking assesses the encoding of fine temporal information in the early stages of the auditory pathway, i.e., from the auditory periphery up to early processing in the primary auditory cortex. Envelope tracking reflects bottom-up and top-down speechrelated processes in the auditory cortex and is likely necessary but not sufficient for speech intelligibility. Linguistic feature tracking (e.g. word or phoneme surprisal) relates to neural processes more directly related to speech intelligibility. Together these analyses form a multi-faceted objective assessment of an individuals auditory and linguistic processing.",

    "abstract": "The mouse retina encodes diverse visual features in the spike trains of more than 40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. Each RGC type innervates a specific subset of the more than 50 retinorecipient brain areas. Our catalog of RGC types and feature representations is nearing completion. Yet, we know little about where specific RGC types send their information. Furthermore, the developmental strategies by which RGC axons choose their targets and pattern their terminal arbors remain obscure. Here we identify a genetic intersection (Cck-Cre and Brn3cCKOAP) that selectively labels transient Suppressed-by-Contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a member of an evolutionarily conserved functionally mysterious RGC subclass. We find that tSbC RGCs selectively innervate the dorsolateral and ventrolateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus (dLGN and vLGN), the superior colliculus (SC), and the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT). They binocularly innervate dLGN and vLGN but project only contralaterally to SC and NOT. In each target, tSbC RGC axons occupy a specific sublayer, suggesting that they restrict their input to specific circuits. The tSbC RGC axons span the length of the optic tract by birth and remain poised there until they simultaneously innervate their four targets around postnatal day five. The tSbC RGC axons make no errors in choosing their targets and establish mature stratification patterns from the outset. This precision is maintained in the absence of Brn3c. Our results provide the first map of SbC inputs to the brain, revealing a narrow target set, unexpected laminar organization, target-specific binocularity, and developmental precision.\n\nSignificance statementIn recent years, we have learned a lot about the visual features encoded by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the eyes output neurons. In contrast, we know little about where RGCs send their information and how RGC axons, which carry this information, target specific brain areas during development. Here, we develop an intersectional strategy to label a unique RGC type, the tSbC RGC, and map its projections. We find that tSbC RGC axons are highly selective. They innervate few retinal targets and restrict their arbors to specific sublayers within these targets. The selective tSbC RGC projection patterns develop synchronously and without trial and error, suggesting molecular determinism and coordination.",

    "abstract": "Our aim was to assess the cognitive and emotional state, as well as related-changes in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression of adolescent C57BL/6J male mice after a five-week two-bottle choice protocol (postnatal day (pd) 21 to pd52). Additionally, we wanted to analyse whether the behavioural and neurobiological effects observed in late adolescence (pd62) lasted until adulthood (pd84). Behavioural testing revealed that alcohol during early adolescence increased anxiety-like and compulsive-related behaviours, which was maintained in adulthood. Concerning cognition, working memory was only altered in late adolescent mice, whereas object location test performance was impaired in both ages. In contrast, novel object recognition remained unaltered. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that alcohol during adolescence diminished BDNF+ cells in the cingulate cortex, the hippocampal CA1 layer and the central amygdala. Regarding hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) functioning, alcohol abuse increased the GR and CRF expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the central amygdala. Besides this, GR density was also higher in the prelimbic cortex and the basolateral amygdala, regardless of the animals age. Our findings suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure led to long-term behavioural alterations, along with changes in BDNF, GR and CRF expression in limbic brain areas involved in stress response, emotional regulation, and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Selective vulnerability is an enigmatic feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), whereby a widely expressed protein causes lesions in specific brain regions and cell types. This selectivity may arise from cells possessing varying capacities to regain proteostasis when stressed by cytotoxic protein conformers. Using the RiboTag method in mice, translational responses of five neural subtypes to acquired prion disease (PrD) were measured. Pre-onset and disease onset timepoints were chosen based on longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed a gradual increase in theta power between 10- and 18-weeks after prion injection, resembling a clinical feature of human PrD. At disease onset, marked by significantly increased theta power and histopathological lesions, mice had pronounced translatome changes in all five cell types despite having a normal outward appearance. Remarkably, at a pre-onset stage, prior to EEG and neuropathological changes, we found that 1) translatomes of astrocytes indicated a sharply reduced synthesis of ribosomal and mitochondrial components, 2) excitatory neurons showed increased expression of cytoskeletal genes, and 3) inhibitory neurons revealed reduced expression of circadian rhythm network genes. Further assessment for the role of circadian rhythms using a jet lag paradigm modestly exacerbated disease. These data demonstrate that early translatome responses to neurodegeneration emerge prior to other signs of disease and are unique to different cell types. Therapeutic strategies may need to target multiple pathways, each in specific populations of cells, early in the disease process.",

    "abstract": "Here we investigate how the extent of spatial attention affects center-surround interaction in visual motion processing. To do so, we measured motion direction discrimination thresholds in humans using drifting gratings and two attention conditions. Under the narrow attention condition, attention was limited to the central part of the visual stimulus, whereas under the wide attention condition, it was directed to both the center and surround of the stimulus. We found stronger surround suppression under the wide attention condition. The magnitude of the attention effect increased with the size of the surround when the stimulus had low contrast, but did not change when it had high contrast. Results also showed that attention had a weaker effect when the center and surround gratings drifted in opposite directions. Next, to establish a link between the behavioral results and the neuronal response characteristics, we performed computer simulations using the divisive normalization model. Our simulations showed that the model can successfully predict the observed behavioral results using parameters derived from the medial temporal (MT) area of the cortex. These findings reveal the critical role of spatial attention on surround suppression and establish a link between neuronal activity and behavior. Further, these results also suggest that the reduced surround suppression found in certain clinical disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder) may be caused by abnormal attention mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Nociceptive signals interact with various regions of the brain, including those involved in physical sensation, reward, cognition, and emotion. Emerging evidence points to a role of nociception in the modulation of the mesolimbic reward system. The mechanism by which nociception affects dopamine (DA) signaling and reward is unclear. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the lateral habenula (LHb) receive somatosensory inputs and are structurally connected with the mesolimbic DA system. Here we show that the LH-LHb pathway is necessary for nociceptive modulation of this system. Our extracellular single-unit recordings and head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed that nociceptive stimulation by tail-pinch excited LHb and LH neurons, which was inhibited by chemical lesion of the LH. Tail-pinch decreased extracellular DA release in the nucleus accumbens ventrolateral shell, which was blocked by disruption of the LH. Furthermore, tail-pinch attenuated cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, which was inhibited by chemogenetic silencing of the LH-LHb pathway. Our findings suggest that nociceptive stimulation recruits the LH-LHb pathway to inhibit mesolimbic DA system and drug reinstatement.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed a set of historical data from rapid vegetation inventories in a tropical montane cloud forest in northern Andean Ecuador. Trees in plots from several types of forest were counted and measured, including: (1) primary forest, including mature and recently closed-canopy sites and naturally formed gaps, (2) abandoned pasture, and (3) intensively-farmed sites. The goal of the study was to understand in a specific period of time the similarities and differences among natural and anthropogenic disturbances and their potential long term effect on the forest plant community. We found that mature and intermediate close canopy sites are similar. Also old forest is quite resilient to gap-forming disturbance. Natural gaps are quickly colonized by old-forest-associated plant species, and return to an old-forest-type community of trees in a short time. In contrast, forests regenerating from anthropogenic disturbance appear to have multiple possible states: some regenerating forest sites where the anthropogenic disturbance were low are coming to closely resemble old-forest-type communities, but some where the anthropogenic disturbance was intense appear to be changing in a very different direction, which does not resemble any other vegetation community type currently in the forest. A major predictor of present ecological state is the type of land use before reforestation: pastures can occasionally transition back to the pre-disturbance state of forest. More intensively used sites, many of which are abandoned sugar cane plantations, do not return to a pre-disturbance ecological state, instead forming a new and different kind of forest, dominated by a different community of trees. We examined tree-seedling communities to understand the trajectory of the forest into the future, and find that new forest types may be forming that do not resemble any existing associationsintensive agricultural sites. We also found that Los Cedros is extremely diverse in tree species. We estimate approximately 500 species of tree in only the small southeastern area of the reserve that has been explored scientifically. Additionally, the forest tree community shows extremely rapid distance decay (beta-diversity), approaching near complete turn-over in the limited spatial extent of the study. This suggests that hundreds of other tree species remain to be observed in the reserve, in addition to the 350+ that are directly observed in the present study, including new observations of species with IUCN threatened-endangered status. We also highlight the conservation value of Reserva Los Cedros, which has managed to reverse deforestation within its boundaries despite a general trend of extensive deforestation in the surrounding region, and to protect large, contiguous areas of highly-endangered Andean primary cloud forest habitat.",

    "abstract": "Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has devastated coral populations along Floridas Coral Reef and beyond. Although widespread infection and mortality of adult colonies have been documented, no studies have yet investigated the susceptibility of recruits to this disease. Here, we exposed eight-month-old Diploria labyrinthiformis recruits and four-month-old Colpophyllia natans recruits to two sequential doses of SCTLD in the laboratory to track infection and assess potential resilience. Both species began to develop lesions as early as 48 h after exposure began. During the first dose, 59.0% of C. natans recruits lost all tissue (died) within two to eight days of developing lesions, whereas D. labyrinthiformis recruits experienced significantly slower rates of tissue loss and minimal eventual mortality. In C. natans, larger recruits and those fused into groups of multiple genets (chimeras) exhibited the highest survivorship. In contrast, smaller and/or single (ungrouped) recruits had the lowest survivorship (9.9 - 26.5%). After 20 days, a second SCTLD dose was delivered to further test resistance in remaining recruits, and all recruits of both species succumbed within 6 days. Although no recruits showed absolute resistance to SCTLD following repeated exposures, our results provide evidence that interactions between species, size, and chimerism can impact relative resistance. This study represents the first report of SCTLD in Caribbean coral recruits and carries implications for natural species recovery and reef restoration efforts. Additional research on the susceptibility of coral juveniles to SCTLD is urgently needed, to include different species, locations, parents, and algal symbionts, with the goal of assessing relative susceptibility and identifying potential sources of resilience for this critical life history stage.",

Negative correlations between a host susceptibility to different pathogens is an often-cited explanation for maintenance of genetic variation in immune function determining traits in a host population. In this study, we investigated the change in susceptibility of Drosophila melanogaster flies to various novel bacterial pathogens after being experimentally selected for increased resistance to one particular bacterial pathogen. We independently selected flies to become more resistant towards Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas entomophila, and baring a few exceptions the evolved populations exhibited cross-resistance against the range of pathogens tested in the study. Neither the identity of the native pathogen nor the host sex was major determining factors in predicting the pattern of cross-resistance exhibited by the selected populations. We therefore report that a generalized cross-resistance to novel pathogens can repeatedly evolve in response to selection for resistance against a single pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance is usually associated with fitness costs. The magnitude of fitness costs is affected by environmental and ecological factors. Here, we explored how host plants could affect fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance. Initially, spinetoram-resistant (RR) and susceptible (SS) strains of Spodoptera frugiperda were selected using F2 screen from a population collected in Sao Desiderio, Bahia State, Brazil in 2018. Besides de RR and SS strains, fitness costs were also assessed for a heterozygous strain (RS). Life-history traits were evaluated to estimate population growth parameters of neonate larvae of each strain fed on corn, soybean and cotton plants. Compared to the SS strain, the relative fitness of the RR strain, based on intrinsic rate of population increase, was 1.06, 0.84 and 0.67 on plants of corn, soybean and cotton respectively. The relative fitness of the RS strain was similar to the SS strain regardless the host plant, suggesting a recessive fitness cost. No differences were found between the strains fed on corn plants. The larval development time was greater for RR strain fed on soybean and cotton plants compared to RS and SS strain. Low survival rate and fecundity of the RR strain were found when larvae fed on plants of soybean and cotton. The results of this study demonstrated that fitness costs of spinetoram resistance in S. frugiperda depend strongly on the host plants that S. frugiperda larvae fed on. Such information can be used to design resistance management strategies considering the host plants of the agricultural landscape.\n\nKey messagesO_LIThe presence of fitness costs associated with resistance can be exploited in resistance management strategies.\nC_LIO_LIHost plant influences the fitness costs associated with spinetoram resistance in S. frugiperda.\nC_LIO_LIInformation considering the host plants in an agricultural landscape is essential to design effective resistance management programs.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Climate change is associated with both the increase in mean and variability of thermal conditions. The use of more realistic thermal regimes is therefore the most appropriate laboratory method to correctly predict population responses to thermal heterogeneity. However, both the long- and short-term implications of evolving under such conditions are not well understood. Here, we examined the effect of fluctuating daily temperatures on several key life history traits in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, that was exposed to a short-term thermal switch into a novel environment. Populations were kept for 19 generations at one of two temperatures: constant control temperature (T=29{degrees}C) or a fluctuating daily cycle (Tmean=33{degrees}C, Tmax=40{degrees}C, and Tmin=26{degrees}C) and were subsequently exposed to a switch to the opposite condition. We found that beetles that had evolved in stressful environments were smaller in size when switched to a constant 29{degrees}C and had far greater reproductive fitness compared to beetles from both the constant control and continuously stressful 33{degrees}C environments. This suggests that beetles raised in environments with stressful fluctuating temperatures were more phenotypically plastic and had greater genetic variability than control treatment beetles and indicates that populations that experience fluctuations in temperature may be better able to respond to short-term changes in environmental conditions.",

The Cryo-EM structure of the P. patens photosystem I light harvesting complex I supercomplex (PSI-LHCI) at 2.8 [A] reveals that Lhca4 is replaced by a unique Lhca2 paralogue in moss. This PSI-LHCI supercomplex also retains the PsaM subunit, present in cyanobacteria and several algal species but lost in higher plants, and the PsaO subunit responsible for binding light harvesting complex II. The blue shifted Lhca2 paralogue and chlorophyll b enrichment relative to higher plants make the P. patens PSI-LHCI spectroscopically unique among other green lineage supercomplexes.

    "abstract": "Primary hepatocytes are essential cellular resource for drug screening and medical transplantation. Since culture systems for them have already succeeded in reconstituting the biomimetic microenvironment, acquiring additional capabilities both to expand primary hepatocytes and to handle them easily would be expected as progress to the next stage. This paper describes a culture system for primary rat hepatocytes that is equipped with scalability and handleability relying on cell fiber technology. Cell fibers are cell-laden core-shell hydrogel microfibers; in the core regions, cells are embedded in extracellular matrix proteins, cultured three-dimensionally, and exposed to soluble growth factors in the culture medium through the hydrogel shells. By encapsulating primary rat hepatocytes within cell fibers, we first demonstrated they increase in number while keeping their viability and their hepatic specific functions for up to thirty days of subsequent culture. Then, we demonstrated the potency of the primary rat hepatocytes that proliferate in cell fibers not only as cell-based sensors to detect drugs that damage hepatic functions and hepatocellular processes but also as transplants to improve the plasma albumin concentrations of congenital analbuminemia. Therefore, our culture system could serve for innovating strategies and promising developments in applying primary hepatocytes to both pharmaceutical and medical fields.",

    "abstract": "Traditional bulk sequencing methods are limited to measuring the average signal in a group of cells, potentially masking heterogeneity, and rare populations. The single-cell resolution, however, enhances our understanding of complex biological systems and diseases, such as cancer, the immune system, and chronic diseases. However, the single-cell technologies generate massive amounts of data that are often high-dimensional, sparse, and complex, thus making analysis with traditional computational approaches difficult and unfeasible. To tackle these challenges, many are turning to deep learning (DL) methods as potential alternatives to the conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms for single-cell studies. DL is a branch of ML capable of extracting high-level features from raw inputs in multiple stages. Compared to traditional ML, DL models have provided significant improvements across many domains and applications. In this work, we examine DL applications in genomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration, and address whether DL techniques will prove to be advantageous or if the single-cell omics domain poses unique challenges. Through a systematic literature review, we find that DL has not yet revolutionized or addressed the most pressing challenges of the single-cell omics field. However, using DL models for single-cell omics has shown promising results (in many cases outperforming the previous state-of-the-art models) in data preprocessing and downstream analysis, but many DL models still lack the needed biological interpretability. Although developments of DL algorithms for single-cell omics have generally been gradual, recent advances reveal that DL can offer valuable resources in fast-tracking and advancing research in single-cell.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/470166v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14fc7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cc132forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff78b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4df643_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe three-dimensional nuclear arrangement of chromatin impacts many cellular processes operating at the DNA level in animal and plant systems. Chromatin organization is a dynamic process that can be affected by biotic and abiotic stresses. Three-dimensional imaging technology allows to follow these dynamic changes, but only a few semi-automated processing methods currently exist for quantitative analysis of the 3D chromatin organization.\n\nResultsWe present an automated method, Nuclear Object DetectionJ (NODeJ), developed as an imageJ plugin. This program segments and analyzes high intensity domains in nuclei from 3D images. NODeJ performs a Laplacian convolution on the mask of a nucleus to enhance the contrast of intra-nuclear objects and allows their detection. We reanalyzed public datasets and determined that NODeJ is able to accurately identify heterochromatin domains from a diverse set of Arabidopsis thaliana nuclei stained with DAPI or Hoechst. NODeJ is also able to detect signals in nuclei from DNA FISH experiments, allowing for the analysis of specific targets of interest.\n\nConclusion and availabilityNODeJ allows for efficient automated analysis of subnuclear structures by avoiding the semi-automated steps, resulting in reduced processing time and analytical bias. NODeJ is written in Java and provided as an ImageJ plugin with a command line option to perform more high-throughput analyses.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe recent big data revolution in Genomics, coupled with the emergence of Deep Learning as a set of powerful machine learning methods, has shifted the standard practices of machine learning for Genomics. Even though Deep Learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are becoming widespread in Genomics, developing and training such models is outside the ability of most researchers in the field.\n\nResultsHere we present ENNGene - Easy Neural Network model building tool for Genomics. This tool simplifies training of custom CNN or hybrid CNN-RNN models on genomic data via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. ENNGene allows multiple input branches, including sequence, evolutionary conservation, and secondary structure, and performs all the necessary preprocessing steps, allowing simple input such as genomic coordinates. The network architecture is selected and fully customized by the user, from the number and types of the layers to each layer's precise set-up. ENNGene then deals with all steps of training and evaluation of the model, exporting valuable metrics such as multi-class ROC and precision-recall curve plots or TensorBoard log files. To facilitate interpretation of the predicted results, we deploy Integrated Gradients, providing the user with a graphical representation of an attribution level of each input position. To showcase the usage of ENNGene, we train multiple models on the RBP24 dataset, quickly reaching the state of the art while improving the performance on more than half of the proteins by including the evolutionary conservation score and tuning the network per protein.\n\nConclusionsAs the role of DL in big data analysis in the near future is indisputable, it is important to make it available for a broader range of researchers. We believe that an easy-to-use tool such as ENNGene can allow Genomics researchers without a background in Computational Sciences to harness the power of DL to gain better insights into and extract important information from the large amounts of data available in the field.\n\nContactpanagiotis.alexiou@ceitec.muni.cz",

    "abstract": "The microbial interactions within the human microbiome are complex and temporally dynamic, but few methods are available to model this system within a longitudinal network framework. Based on general longitudinal 16S rRNA sequence data, we propose a stationary Gaussian graphical model (SGGM) for microbial interaction networks (MIN) which can accommodate the possible correlations between the high-dimensional observations. For SGGM, an EM-type algorithm is devised to compute the L1-penalized maximum likelihood estimate of MIN which employs the classic graphical LASSO algorithm as the building block and can therefore be implemented easily. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the conventional algorithms when the correlations between measurements grow large. The algorithms are then applied to a real 16S rRNA gene sequence data set for gut microbiome. With the estimated MIN in hand, module-preserving permutation test is proposed to test the independence of the MIN and the corresponding phylogenetic tree. The results demonstrate strong evidence of an association between the MIN and the phylogenetic tree which indicates that the genetically related taxa tend to have more/stronger interactions. The proposed algorithms are implemented in R package lglasso at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lglasso.",

    "abstract": "The family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest protein families in the human genome. GPCRs transduct chemical signals from extracellular to intracellular regions via a conformational switch between active and inactive states upon ligand binding. While experimental structures of GPCRs remain limited, high-accuracy computational predictions are now possible with AlphaFold2. However, AlphaFold2 only predicts one state and is biased towards either the active or inactive conformation depending on the GPCR class. Here, a multi-state prediction protocol is introduced that extends AlphaFold2 to predict either active or inactive states at very high accuracy using state-annotated templated GPCR databases. The predicted models accurately capture the main structural changes upon activation of the GPCR at the atomic level. For most of the benchmarked GPCRs (10 out of 15), models in the active and inactive states were closer to their corresponding activation state structures. Median RMSDs of the transmembrane regions were 1.12 [A] and 1.41 [A] for the active and inactive state models, respectively. The models were more suitable for protein-ligand docking than the original AlphaFold2 models and template-based models. Finally, our prediction protocol predicted accurate GPCR structures and GPCR-peptide complex structures in GPCR Dock 2021, a blind GPCR-ligand complex modeling competition. We expect that high accuracy GPCR models in both activation states will promote understanding in GPCR activation mechanisms and drug discovery for GPCRs. At the time, the new protocol paves the way towards capturing the dynamics of proteins at high-accuracy via machine-learning methods.",

Meanwhile, convergent cognitive components processing was found in the core language-related regions in left hemisphere, including the inferior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, superior and middle temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus and supplementary motor areas.

    "abstract": "During development, retinal progenitors navigate a complex landscape of fate decisions that results in the generation of unique cell types necessary for proper vision. Here, we aim to provide the resources and techniques required to identify fac-tors that are critical for fate decisions in photoreceptors. These factors help create a diversity of photoreceptor subtypes that sustain vision in day and night, enable the discrimination of colors, facilitate the detection of prey and predators, and support other aspects of vision. First, we generate a key resource: a high-quality and deep transcriptomic profile of each photoreceptor subtype in zebrafish. We make this resource openly accessible, easy to explore and integrate it with other currently available photoreceptor transcriptomic datasets. Second, using our transcriptomic profiles, we derive an in-depth map of expression of transcription factors in photoreceptors--potential key players in cell-fate decisions. Third, we explore CRISPR-FO screening as a fast, efficient and versatile technique to assess the involvement of candidate transcription factors in photoreceptor subtype-specification. We first show that known phenotypes can be easily replicated: loss of S cones in foxq2 mutants and loss of rods in nr2e3 mutants. We then explore four additional transcription factors of unknown function (Skor1a, Sall1a, Lrrfip1a and Xbp1) and find no evidence for their involvement in photoreceptor-subtype specification. Finally, we identify novel functions of Tbx2, demonstrating that it plays a central role in controlling the identity of all photoreceptor sub-types within the retina. Our study provides an open roadmap to discover additional factors involved in this process. This dataset and screening method will be a valuable way to explore the genes involved in many essential aspects of photoreceptor biology.",

Here, we develop the STAMP algorithm to allow the simultaneous training and pruning of a UNet architecture for medical image segmentation with targeted channelwise dropout to make the network robust to the pruning. We demonstrate the technique across segmentation tasks and imaging modalities. It is then shown that, through online pruning, we are able to train networks to have much higher performance than the equivalent standard UNet models while reducing their size by more than 85% in terms of parameters. This has the potential to allow networks to be directly trained on datasets where very low numbers of labels are available.",

    "abstract": "Advances in applied machine learning techniques for neuroimaging have encouraged scientists to implement models to diagnose brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease at early stages. Predicting the exact stage of Alzheimers disease is challenging; however, complex deep learning techniques can manage this with precision. While successful, these complex architectures are difficult to interrogate and computationally expensive. Therefore, using novel, simpler architectures with more efficient pattern extraction capabilities, such as transformers, is of interest to neuroscientists. This study introduced an optimized vision transformer architecture to predict the group membership by separating healthy adults, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimers brains within the same age group (>75 years) using resting-state functional (rs-fMRI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. Our optimized architecture known as OViTAD is currently the sole vision transformer-based end-to-end pipeline and outperformed the existing transformer models and most state-of-the-art solutions. Our model achieved F1-scores of 97%{+/-}0.0 and 99.55%{+/-}0.39 from the testing sets for the rs-fMRI and sMRI modalities in the triple-class prediction experiments. Furthermore, our model reached these performances using 30% fewer parameters than a vanilla transformer. The model was robust and repeatable, producing similar estimates across three runs (we reported the averaged evaluation metrics). Finally, to challenge the model, we observed how it handled increasing noise levels by inserting varying numbers of healthy brains into the two dementia groups. Our findings suggest that optimized vision transformers are a promising and exciting new approach for neuroimaging applications, especially for Alzheimers disease prediction.",

Here we focused on a unique group of neuropathic pain patients undergoing thoracic vertebrectomy where the DRG is removed as part of the surgery allowing for molecular characterization and identification of mechanistic drivers of neuropathic pain independently of preclinical models. Our goal was to quantify whole transcriptome RNA abundances using RNA-seq in pain-associated human DRGs from these patients, allowing comprehensive identification of molecular changes in these samples by contrasting them with non-pain associated DRGs. We sequenced 70 human DRGs, including over 50 having mRNA libraries with neuronal mRNA. Our expression analysis revealed profound sex differences in differentially expressed genes including increase of IL1B, TNF, CXCL14, and OSM in male and including CCL1, CCL21, PENK and TLR3 in female DRGs associated with neuropathic pain. Co-expression modules revealed enrichment in members of JUN-FOS signaling in males, and centromere protein coding genes in females. Neuro-immune signaling pathways revealed distinct cytokine signaling pathways associated with neuropathic pain in males (OSM, LIF, SOCS1) and females (CCL1, CCL19, CCL21). We validated cellular expression profiles of a subset of these findings using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Our findings give direct support for sex differences in underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain in patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Recent political polarization has highlighted the extent to which individuals with opposing views experience ongoing events in markedly different ways. In this study, we explored the neural mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. We conducted functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) scanning right- and left-wing participants watching political videos just before the 2019 elections in Israel. Behavioral results demonstrated significant differences between left- and right-wing participants in their interpretation of the videos content. Neuroimaging results revealed partisanship-dependent differences in both high-order regions and early-motor and somato-sensory regions, although no such differences were found with regard to neutral content. Moreover, we found that most of the political content was more potent in synchronizing participants with right-wing views, and that this synchronization was observed already in early visual and auditory cortices. These results suggest that political polarization is not limited to higher-order processes as previously thought, but rather emerges already in motor and sensory regions.",

    "abstract": "Human health is consistently threatened by different species of pathogenic bacteria. To fight the spread of diseases, it is important to develop rapid methods for bacterial identification. Over the years, different kinds of biosensors were developed for this cause. Another environmental risk are poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that may be emitted from industrial facilities and pollute environmental water and soil. One of the methods for their purification is conducted by the addition of bacteria that can degrade the PAHs, while the bacteria itself can be filtrated at the end of the process. Although many studies reported monitoring of the PAHs degradation by fluorescence, not much attention was dedicated to studying the influence of the PAHs on the intrinsic fluorescence of the degrading bacteria. In this work, we apply synchronous fluorescence (SF) measurements to study the ability of the 5 PAHs: 9-Antracene carboxylic acid (9ACA), Pyrene, Perylene, Pentacene, and Chrysene to interact with bacteria and change its fluorescence spectra. We show that upon incubation of each PAH with the bacterium E.coli only the 2 PAHs 9ACA and Perylene cause an intensity decrease in the emission at {lambda} = 300 - 375 nm, which derives from the emission of Tyrosine and Tryptophane (TT). Also, we show that upon incubation of 9ACA and Perylene with 5 different pathogenic bacteria, the intensity increase or decrease in the TT emission is unique to each bacterial species. Based on this observation, we suggest that the PAHs 9ACA and Perylene can be utilized as biosensors for bacterial identification.",

    "abstract": "Development of rapid methods for detection of virus particles based on their intrinsic fluorescence is challenging. Pure viruses may be detected in filtered solutions, based on the strong fluorescence of the amino acid Tryptophan (Trp) in their proteins. Nevertheless, Trp also exists in high quantities in the hosts and host cultivation media. In this work, we show that a separation of the bacteriophage{varphi} x-174 from its E. coli host (grown on the standard cultivation medium \"Nutrient Agar\") by simple extraction and filtration is not sufficient for its detection based on the intrinsic fluorescence since ~70 % of the Trp fluorescence is derived from impurities. We formulate a new cultivation medium with very low Trp concentration. We apply synchronous fluorescence measurements to show that no Trp fluorescence is detected in the extract solution upon incubation of this medium substrate with ammonium acetate extraction buffer. Finally, we detect{varphi} x-174 based on the spectral fingerprint of its intrinsic Trp content by synchronous fluorescence measurements. The concept of coupling intrinsic fluorescence-based methods to impurities reduction in the source, may pave the way towards future development of simple, cheap, and rapid methods for detection of viral pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is typically considered a host generalist, however certain strains are associated with specific hosts and show genetic features of host adaptation. Here, we sequenced 131 S. Typhimurium strains from wild birds collected in 30 U.S. states during 1978-2019. We found that isolates from broad taxonomic host groups including passerine birds, water birds (Aequornithes), and larids (gulls and terns) represented three distinct lineages and certain S. Typhimurium CRISPR types presented in individual lineages. We also showed that lineages formed by wild bird isolates differed from most strains originating from domestic animal sources, and genomes from these lineages substantially improved source attribution of Typhimurium genomes to wild birds by a machine learning classifier. Furthermore, virulence gene signatures that differentiated S. Typhimurium from passerines, water birds, and larids were detected. Passerine isolates tended to lack S. Typhimurium-specific virulence plasmids. Isolates from the passerine, water bird, and larid lineages had close genetic relatedness with human clinical isolates, including those from a 2021 U.S. outbreak linked to passerine birds. These observations indicate that S. Typhimurium from wild birds in the U.S. are likely host-adapted, and the representative genomic dataset examined in this study can improve source prediction and facilitate outbreak investigation.\n\nIMPORTANCEWithin-host evolution of S. Typhimurium may lead to pathovars adapted to specific hosts. Here, we report the emergence of disparate avian S. Typhimurium lineages with distinct virulence gene signatures. The findings highlight the importance of wild birds as a reservoir for S. Typhimurium and contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity of S. Typhimurium from wild birds. Our study indicates that S. Typhimurium may have undergone adaptive evolution within wild birds in the U.S. The representative S. Typhimurium genomes from wild birds, together with the virulence gene signatures identified in these bird isolates, are valuable for S. Typhimurium source attribution and epidemiological surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Lactococcus cremoris and L. lactis are well-known for their occurrence and applications in dairy fermentations, but their niche extends to a range of natural and food production environments. L. cremoris and L. lactis produce MKs (vitamin K2), mainly as the long-chain forms represented by MK-9 and MK-8, and a detectable amount of short-chain forms represented by MK-3. The physiological significance of the different MK forms in the lifestyle of these bacterial species has not been investigated extensively. In this study, we used L. cremoris MG1363 to construct mutants producing different MK profiles by deletion of genes encoding (i) a menaquinone-specific isochorismate synthase, (ii) a geranyltranstransferase and (iii) a prenyl diphosphate synthase. These gene deletions resulted in (i) a non-MK producer ({Delta}menF), (ii) a presumed MK-1 producer ({Delta}ispA) and (iii) a MK-3 producer ({Delta}llmg_0196), respectively. By examining the phenotypes of the MG1363 wildtype strain and respective mutants, including biomass accumulation, stationary phase survival, oxygen consumption, primary metabolites, azo dye/copper reduction, and proteomes, under aerobic, anaerobic and respiration-permissive conditions, we could infer that short-chain MKs like MK-1 and MK-3 are preferred to mediate extracellular electron transfer and reaction with extracellular oxygen, while the long-chain MKs like MK-9 and MK-8 are more efficient in aerobic respiratory electron transport chain. The different electron transfer routes mediated by short-chain and long-chain MKs likely support growth and survival of L. cremoris in a range of (transiently) anaerobic and aerobic niches including food fermentations, highlighting the physiological significance of diverse MKs in L. cremoris.",

    "abstract": "Cyanide is widely used in industry as a potent lixiviant due to its capacity to tightly bind metals. This property imparts cyanide enormous toxicity to all known organisms. Thus, industries that utilize this compound must reduce its concentration in recycled or waste waters. Physical, chemical, and biological treatments have been used for cyanide remediation; however, none of them meet all the desired characteristics: efficiency, low cost and low environmental impact. A better understanding of metabolic pathways and biochemistry of enzymes involved in cyanide degradation is a necessary step to improve cyanide bioremediation efficacy to satisfy the industry requirements. Here, we used several approaches to explore this topic. We have isolated three cyanide-degrading Bacillus strains from water in contact with mine tailings from Lima, Peru, and classified them as Bacillus safensis PER-URP-08, Bacillus licheniformis PER-URP-12, and Bacillus subtilis PER-URP-17 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and core genome analyses. Additionally, core genome analyses of 132 publicly available genomes of Bacillus pumilus group including B. safensis and B. altitudinis allowed us to reclassify some strains and identify two strains that did not match with any known species of the Bacillus pumilus group. We searched for possible routes of cyanide-degradation in the genomes of these three strains and identified putative B. licheniformis PER-URP-12 and B. subtilis PER-URP-17 rhodaneses and B. safensis PER-URP-08 cyanide dihydratase (CynD) sequences possibly involved cyanide degradation. We identified characteristic C-terminal residues that differentiate CynD from B. pumilus and B. safensis, and showed that, differently from CynD from B. pumilus C1, recombinant CynD from the Bacillus safensis PER-URP-08 strain remains active up to pH 9 and presents a distinct oligomerization pattern at pH 8 and 9. Moreover, transcripts of B. safensis PER-URP-08 CynD (CynDPER-URP-08) are strongly induced in the presence of cyanide. Our results warrant further investigation of B. safensis PER-URP-08 and CynDPER-URP-08 as potential tools for cyanide-bioremediation.",

Three modes of population growth depended upon feeding sources, including induction of social behaviors and different reproductive strategies. In addition to fission, representatives of all haplotypes produced  swarmers, which could be formed from the lower epithelium (with greater cell- type diversity) as a separate asexual reproduction stage. In aging culture, we reported the formation of specialized structures ( spheres) from the upper cell layer as a part of the innate immune defense response with the involvement of fiber cells.

    "abstract": "Marine animals such as the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) rely on a productive marine environment and are vulnerable to oceanic changes that can affect their reproduction and survival rates. Davis Base, Antarctica, acts as a moulting site for southern elephant seals that forage in Prydz Bay, but the genetic diversity and natal source populations of these seals has not been characterized. Determining the genetic diversity of moulting populations like this one provides essential information on seal dispersal, inter-population mixing, and foraging behaviours. In this study, we combined genetic and animal tracking data on these moulting seals to identify levels of genetic diversity, natal source population, and movement behaviours during foraging and haul-out periods. Using mitochondrial sequence data, we identified two major breeding lineages of seals at Davis Base. We found that the majority of the seals originated from breeding stocks within the South Atlantic Ocean and South Indian Ocean. One seal was grouped with the Macquarie Island breeding stock (South Pacific Ocean). The Macquarie Island population, unlike the other two stocks, is decreasing in size. Tracking data revealed long-distance foraging activity of the Macquarie Island seal around Crozet Islands. We speculate that changes to the Antarctic marine environment have resulted in a shift in foraging and dispersal strategies, which subsequently affects seal population growth rates. These findings have implications for conservation management plans aimed at improving the population status of the southern elephant seal.",

    "abstract": "Over the last several decades, peat has been extracted from bogs of temperate, populated regions of Eastern Canada, leaving large areas devoid of vegetation if unrestored. For the last 25 years, projects have been conducted in these regions to re-establish vegetation and facilitate recolonization by wildlife. We tested whether vegetation structure and bird species assemblages 10 to 20 years post extraction differ among natural, unrestored and restored bogs at the scales of individual sites and entire bogs. We conducted bird counts and vegetation surveys between 1993 and 2019, using both point counts (309 sites) and Autonomous Recording Units (80 sites). According to our vegetation surveys, restoration of sites that were previously used for peat harvesting accelerated the establishment of Sphagnum and herbaceous strata, but ericaceous and tree strata were unaffected over a 17-year period. None of the bird species with large home ranges were associated specifically to natural, unrestored, or restored areas at the bog level. Bird species diversity was similar in restored and natural sites, but lower in unrestored sites. Alder Flycatcher and American Goldfinch occupied restored and unrestored sites more frequently than natural sites, independent of the number of years post extraction. Occupancy of restored sites by Palm and Yellow-rumped Warblers increased over the years, reaching levels similar to those in natural sites 20 years after restoration was implemented. Occupancy of restored sites by Song and Savannah sparrows increased from 1993-2019 and diverged from their declining occupancy of natural sites. Species assemblages of restored and unrestored sites differed significantly from those of natural sites soon after peat extraction ceased or post restoration. But assemblages from restored and unrestored sites became progressively similar to those of natural sites during the first 20 years, especially in restored sites. We conclude that bird species assemblages of restored bog sites are converging toward those of natural sites, and that restoration provides novel habitats for regionally declining species, e.g., Savannah Sparrows.",

    "abstract": "Empirical research is increasingly documenting eco-evolutionary dynamics that shape ecological processes. I examine the population dynamic implications of this, analysing whether natural selection improves our ability to predict population dynamic trajectories. Fitting single-species population dynamic models to 3,368 and 480 timeseries for 900 species of birds and 208 mammals, I find that selection-based population dynamic models are 320 (se:1.3) times more probable on average than models with no selection. Selection is essential in 76% to 90% of AIC-selected models, explaining 80% of the population dynamics variance, with median selection regulation being 1.5 (se:1.1) times stronger than density regulation. The estimated dynamics is cyclic with median damping ratios for birds and mammals of 0.12 (se:0.0068) and 0.083 (se:0.022), and population periods of 8 (se:0.56) and 6.1 (se:1.1) generations, given stable cycles with damping ratios around zero. These results highlight the necessity of integrating natural selection into population dynamic theory, and they are discussed in relation to the literature resolving several enigmas of population dynamic cycle.",

    "abstract": "Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the maintenance of ARTs over time, including disruptive and negative frequency-dependent selection and female choice. However, these mechanisms focus exclusively on selection in the sex exhibiting the polymorphism, potentially limiting our understanding of the evolutionary causes and consequences of ARTs. Here we explore the role that intralocus sexual conflict may play in the maintenance of sex-specific ARTs. We use a genetically explicit individual-based model in which female fecundity and male tactic share a genetic architecture. By modeling ART maintenance under varying selection regimes and levels of sex-specific gene expression, we explore the conditions under which intralocus sexual conflict can maintain a hypothetical ART defined by two color morphs that depend on an underlying liability trait. Our models consistently revealed that sexual conflict can result in the persistence of a sex-specific polymorphism over hundreds of generations, even in the absence of negative frequency-dependent selection. ARTs were maintained through correlated selection when one male ART has lower fitness but produces daughters with higher fitness. Importantly, the maintenance of ARTs through sexual conflict resulted in a significant reduction in population growth rate, indicating that the evolutionary mechanism of ART maintenance can have broad ecological consequences. These results highlight the importance of understanding selection on both sexes when attempting to explain the maintenance of ARTs. Our results are consistent with a growing literature documenting genetic correlations between male ARTs and female fitness, suggesting that the maintenance of sex-specific ARTs through intralocus sexual conflict may be common and widespread in nature.",

We have assembled a nearly chromosomal genome for Danaus chrysippus (known as the African Monarch, African Queen, and Plain Tiger) using long read sequencing data. This species is of particular interest for the study of genome structural change and its consequences for evolution. Comparison with the genome of the North American Monarch Danaus plexippus reveals generally strong synteny, but highlights three inversion differences. The three chromosomes involved were previously found to carry peaks of intra-specific differentiation in D. chrysippus in Africa, suggesting that these inversions may be polymorphic and associated with local adaptation. The D. chrysippus genome is over 40% larger than that of D. plexippus, and nearly all of the additional [~]100 Megabases of DNA comprises repeats. Future comparative genomic studies within this genus will shed light on the evolution of genome architecture.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian transcriptional regulatory sequences are comprised of complex combinations of simple transcription factor (TF) motifs. Stereospecific juxta-positioning of simple TF motifs generates composite elements (CEs), that increase combinatorial and regulatory specificity of TF-DNA interactions. Although a small number of CEs and their cooperative or anti-cooperative modes of TF binding have been thoroughly characterized, a systematic analysis of CE diversity, prevalence and properties in cis-regulomes has not been undertaken. We developed a computational pipeline termed CEseek to discover >20,000 CEs in open chromatin regions of diverse immune cells and validated many using CAP-SELEX, ChIP-Seq and STARR-seq datasets. Strikingly, the CEs manifested a bimodal distribution of configurations, termed digital and fuzzy, based on their stringent or relaxed stereospecific constraints, respectively. Digital CEs mediate cooperative as well as anti-cooperative binding of structurally diverse TFs that likely reflect AND/OR genomic logic gates. In contrast, fuzzy CEs encompass a less diverse set of TF motif pairs that are selectively enriched in p300 associated, multi-genic enhancers. The annotated CEs greatly expand the regulatory DNA motif lexicon and the universe of TF-TF interactions that underlie combinatorial logic of gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Human APOBEC3A (A3A) is a nucleic acid-modifying enzyme that belongs to the cytidine deaminase family. Canonically, A3A catalyzes the deamination of cytosine into uracil in single-stranded DNA, an activity that makes A3A both a critical antiviral defense factor and a useful tool for targeted genome editing. However, off-target mutagenesis by A3A has been readily detected in both cellular DNA and RNA, which has been shown to promote oncogenesis. Given the importance of substrate discrimination for the physiological, pathological, and biotechnological activities of A3A, here we explore the mechanistic basis for its preferential targeting of DNA over RNA. Using a chimeric substrate containing a target ribocytidine within an otherwise DNA backbone, we demonstrate that a single hydroxyl at the sugar of the target base acts as a major selectivity determinant for deamination. To assess the contribution of bases neighboring the target cytosine, we show that overall RNA deamination is greatly reduced relative to that of DNA, but can be observed when ideal features are present, such as preferred sequence context and secondary structure. A strong dependence on idealized substrate features can also be observed with a mutant of A3A (eA3A, N57G) which has been employed for genome editing due to altered selectivity for DNA over RNA. Altogether, our work reveals a relationship between the overall decreased reactivity of A3A and increased substrate selectivity, and our results hold implications both for characterizing off-target mutagenesis and for engineering optimized DNA deaminases for base-editing technologies.",

    "abstract": "How cellular functions are regulated through protein phosphorylation events that promote or inhibit protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is key to understanding regulatory molecular mechanisms. Whilst phosphorylation can orthosterically or allosterically influence protein recognition, phospho-driven changes in the conformation of recognition motifs are less well explored. We recently discovered that clathrin heavy chain recognises phosphorylated TACC3 through a helical motif that, in the unphosphorylated protein, is disordered. However, it was unclear whether and how phosphorylation could stabilize a helix in a broader context. In the current manuscript, we address this challenge using poly-Ala based model peptides and a suite of circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. We show that phosphorylation of a Ser residue stabilizes the -helix in the context of an Arg(i - 3)pSeri Lys(i + 4) triad through charge-reinforced side chain interactions with positive co-operativity, whilst phosphorylation of Thr induces an opposing response. This is significant as it may represent a general method for control of PPIs by phosphorylation; basic kinase-substrate motifs are common with 55 human protein kinases recognising an Arg at a position -3 from the phosphorylated Ser, whilst the Arg(i - 3)pSeri Lys(i + 4) is a motif found in over 2000 human proteins.",

Our phenotype-centric approach not only identifies known beneficial intervention strategies for this network, but it also provides an understanding of mechanistic context for the validity of these predictions. Additionally, we propose a set of hypothetical strains with the potential to outperform reported production strains and enhance the mechanistic understanding of the amorphadiene biosynthetic network.

However, obtaining primary T cells from human donors is expensive and variable. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have the potential to serve as a consistent and renewable source of T cells, but differentiating PSCs into hematopoietic progenitors with T cell potential remains a significant challenge. Here, we developed an efficient serum- and feeder-free protocol for differentiating human PSCs into hematopoietic progenitors and T cells. This defined method allowed us to study the impact of individual recombinant proteins on blood emergence and lineage potential. We demonstrate that the presence of DLL4 and VCAM1 during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) enhances downstream progenitor T cell output by >80-fold. Using single cell transcriptomics, we showed that these two proteins synergise to drive strong notch signalling in nascent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and that VCAM1 additionally drives a pro-inflammatory transcriptional program. Finally, we applied this differentiation method to study the impact of cytokine concentration dynamics on T cell maturation. We established optimised media formulations that enabled efficient and chemically defined differentiation of CD8{beta}+, CD4-, CD3+, TCR{beta}+ T cells from PSCs.",

The excitatory effects of glutamate are mediated by AMPA-, kainate-, and NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). The expression patterns of these receptors in the vertebrate retina have been investigated so far with mainly immunocytochemical, in-situ hybridization, and electrophysiological/pharmacological techniques. Here, we have used scRNA sequencing data from chicken, mouse, macaque, and human retina to describe and compare the profile of iGluR expression in major retinal cell types across species. Our results suggest that major retinal cell types each express a unique set of iGluRs with substantial differences between non-mammalian and mammalian retinae. Expression of iGluRs has been investigated in more detail for amacrine and bipolar cell types of the human retina, each showing minor variations of a common pattern. The differential expression of iGluRs is likely to convey unique signal processing properties to individual elements of the retinal circuitry.",

Nonetheless, the neurochemical pathways that underpin this regulatory function remain unknown. To study this, we have utilised an optofluid technology, precisely combining optogenetic stimulation with pharmacological receptor antagonism, to investigate the neurotransmission involved in this circuitry.

Activity-dependent changes in palmitoylation have been observed for several neuronal substrates, however a full characterization of the activity-regulated palmitoylome is lacking.

Of the 121 differentially palmitoylated proteins identified 63 were synaptic proteins, while others were associated with metabolic functions, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. The vast majority of synaptic proteins exhibited increased palmitoylation following fear conditioning, whereas proteins that exhibited decreased palmitoylation were predominantly associated with metabolic processes. We show a link between dynamic palmitoylation and synapse plasticity by demonstrating that the palmitoylation of one of our identified proteins, PRG-1/LPPR4, is essential for activity-induced insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Together, this study identifies networks of synaptic proteins whose dynamic palmitoylation may play a central role in learning and memory.\n\nSUMMARYThis study identifies networks of proteins that undergo dynamic post-translational palmitoylation in response to fear conditioning and demonstrates that palmitoylation of one of these proteins is essential for synapse plasticity.

    "abstract": "IntroductionWhite matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the aging population in general, as well as in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. They are known to exacerbate the cognitive deficits and worsen the clinical outcomes in the patients. However, it is not well-understood whether there are disease-specific differences in prevalence and distribution of WMHs in different neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nMethodsData included 976 participants with cross-sectional T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRIs from the Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) cohort of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) with eleven distinct diagnostic groups: cognitively intact elderly (CIE), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular MCI (V-MCI), Alzheimers dementia (AD), vascular AD (V-AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), cognitively intact elderly with Parkinsons disease (PD-CIE), cognitively impaired Parkinsons disease (PD-CI), and mixed dementias. WMHs were segmented using a previously validated automated technique. WMH volumes in each lobe and hemisphere were compared against matched CIE individuals, as well as each other, and between men and women.\n\nResultsAll cognitively impaired diagnostic groups had significantly greater overall WMH volumes than the CIE group. Vascular groups (i.e. V-MCI, V-AD, and mixed dementia) had significantly greater WMH volumes than all other groups, except for FTD, which also had significantly greater WMH volumes than all non-vascular groups. Women tended to have lower WMH burden than men in most groups and regions, controlling for age. The left frontal lobe tended to have a lower WMH burden than the right in all groups. In contrast, the right occipital lobe tended to have greater WMH loads than the left.\n\nConclusionsThere were distinct differences in WMH prevalence and distribution across diagnostic groups, sexes, and in terms of asymmetry. WMH burden was significantly greater in all neurodegenerative dementia groups, likely encompassing areas exclusively impacted by neurodegeneration as well as areas related to cerebrovascular disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "Various physical stimulation methods are developed to minimize the invasiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS)1-3. Among them, only magnetic field can penetrate into the biological tissues without scattering or absorption4, which makes it ideal for untethered DBS. Recently developed magnetogenetics have shown the potential of developing treatments for neurological disorders5. However, magnetogenetic approaches have potential side effects from overexpression of exogenous ion channels and gene delivery with viral vectors6,7. Here, we demonstrated that the iron oxide magnetic nanodiscs (~270 nm) can be used as transducers to trigger calcium responses in the wild-type cultured neurons during the application of slow varying weak magnetic fields (50 mT at 10 Hz). Moreover, we identified that the intrinsic mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC), which were widely expressed in the brain8, plays the main roles in this magnetomechanical stimulation. Finally, when we applied magnetic fields to the awake mice with magnetic nanodiscs injecting into subthalamic nucleus, the magnetomechanical stimulation triggered neuronal activities in the targeted region and the downstream region. Overall, this research demonstrated a magnetomechanical approach that can be used for wireless neuronal stimulation in vitro and untethered DBS in awake mice in vivo without implants or genetic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a current discord between the foundational theories underpinning motor learning and how we currently apply transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS): the former is dependent on tight coupling of events while the latter is conducted with very low temporal resolution.\n\nObjectiveHere we aimed to investigate the temporal specificity of stimulation by applying TDCS in short epochs, and coincidentally with movement, during a motor adaptation task.\n\nMethodsParticipants simultaneously adapted a reaching movement to two opposing velocity-dependent force-fields (clockwise and counter-clockwise), distinguished by a contextual leftward or rightward shift in the task display and cursor location respectively. Brief bouts (< 3 second) of event-related TDCS (er-TDCS) were applied over M1 or the cerebellum during movements for only one of these learning contexts.\n\nResultsWe show that when short duration stimulation is applied to the cerebellum and yoked to movement, only those reaching movements performed simultaneously with stimulation are selectively enhanced, whilst similar and interleaved movements are left unaffected. We found no evidence of improved adaptation following M1 er-TDCS, as participants displayed equivalent levels of error during both stimulated and unstimulated movements. Similarly, participants in the sham stimulation group adapted comparably during left and right-shift trials.\n\nConclusionsIt is proposed that the coupling of cerebellar stimulation and movement influences timing-dependent (i.e., Hebbian-like) mechanisms of plasticity to facilitate enhanced learning in the stimulated context.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is notoriously difficult to treat. Treatment efficacy is limited by Mtbs intrinsic drug resistance, as well as its ability to evolve acquired resistance to all antituberculars in clinical use. A deeper understanding of the bacterial pathways that govern drug efficacy could facilitate the development of more effective therapies to overcome resistance, identify new mechanisms of acquired resistance, and reveal overlooked therapeutic opportunities. To define these pathways, we developed a CRISPR interference chemical-genetics platform to titrate the expression of Mtb genes and quantify bacterial fitness in the presence of different drugs. Mining this dataset, we discovered diverse and novel mechanisms of intrinsic drug resistance, unveiling hundreds of potential targets for synergistic drug combinations. Combining chemical-genetics with comparative genomics of Mtb clinical isolates, we further identified numerous new potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, one of which is associated with the emergence of a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) outbreak in South America. Lastly, we make the unexpected discovery of an \"acquired drug sensitivity.\" We found that the intrinsic resistance factor whiB7 was inactivated in an entire Mtb sublineage endemic to Southeast Asia, presenting an opportunity to potentially repurpose the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin to treat TB. This chemical-genetic map provides a rich resource to understand drug efficacy in Mtb and guide future TB drug development and treatment.",

    "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate as to whether cognitive processes arise from a group of functionally specialized brain modules (modularism) or as the result of distributed nonlinear processes (dynamical systems theory). The former predicts that tasks recruiting similar local brain areas should be equally similar in their network profiles. The latter allows for differential connectivity, even when the areas recruited are largely the same. Here we evaluated both views at the macroscopic level by comparing region-wise activation patterns and functional correlation profiles from a large sample of healthy subjects (N=242) that performed two executive control tasks known to recruit nearly identical brain areas, the color-word Stroop task and the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). Using a measure of instantaneous functional correlations, based on edge time series, we estimated the task-related networks that differed between incongruent and congruent conditions. At the group level, the two tasks were much more different in their network profiles than in their evoked activity patterns. This is found even when matching the degrees of freedom of both activation patterns and functional correlation profiles, when considering subject-level differences, after changing brain parcellations, and if employing alternative methods for defining task-related network profiles. Our results are consistent with the perspective of the brain as a dynamical system, suggesting that task representations should be independently evaluated at both node and edge (connectivity) levels.\n\nSignificant StatementIf the brain is strictly modular at the macroscopic scale, then recruiting the same brain regions should result in the same functional interactions between regions. However, if the brain is a dynamical system, with information represented at both the node and edge levels, then two tasks could have the same pattern of activation, but largely different functional correlation profiles. Here we tested this contrastive prediction using two tasks with overlapping cognitive demands, but different sensory signals. Despite being nearly identical in their activation patterns, we found that the tasks produced largely different functional correlation profiles. These findings reinforce the view of the brain as a dynamical system, with task states represented both within and across regions.",

    "abstract": "Striatal adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) activation can inhibit dopamine release. A1Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol-sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A1Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In ex vivo striatal slices from male and female mice, A1R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A1R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor NBTI reduced dopamine release and promoted A1R-mediated inhibition, and conversely, virally-mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A1R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor GRAB-Ado, we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 mM) promoted A1R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol. These data add to the diverse mechanisms through which ethanol modulates striatal dopamine, and to emerging datasets supporting astrocytic transporters as important regulators of striatal function.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDopamine axons in the mammalian striatum are emerging as strategic sites where neuromodulators can powerfully influence dopamine output in health and disease. We found that ambient levels of the neuromodulator adenosine tonically inhibit dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core via adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs), to a variable level that promotes the contrast in dopamine signals released by different frequencies of activity. We reveal that the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) on astrocytes limits this tonic inhibition, and that ethanol promotes it by diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. These findings support the hypotheses that A1Rs on dopamine axons inhibit DA release and, furthermore, that astrocytes perform important roles in setting the level of striatal dopamine output, in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "RationalePericytes (PCs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), collectively known as mural cells (MCs), are recruited through PDGFB-PDGFRB signaling. MCs are essential for vascular integrity, and their loss has been associated with numerous diseases. Most of this knowledge is based on studies in which MCs are insufficiently recruited or fully absent upon inducible ablation. In contrast, little is known about the physiological consequences that result from impairment of specific MC functions.\n\nObjectiveHere, we characterize the role of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) in MCs and study its function in developmental and pathological contexts.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe generated a mouse model of MC-specific inducible Srf gene deletion and studied its consequences during retinal angiogenesis. By postnatal day (P)6, PCs lacking SRF were morphologically abnormal and failed to properly co-migrate with angiogenic sprouts. As a consequence, PC-deficient vessels at the retinal sprouting front became dilated and leaky. By P12, also the vSMCs had lost SRF, which coincided with the formation of pathological arteriovenous (AV) shunts. Mechanistically, we show that PDGFB-dependent SRF activation is mediated via MRTF co-factors. We further show that MRTF-SRF signaling promotes pathological PC activation during ischemic retinopathy. RNA-sequencing, immunohistology, in vivo live imaging and in vitro experiments demonstrated that SRF regulates expression of contractile SMC proteins essential to maintain the vascular tone.\n\nConclusionsSRF is crucial for distinct functions in PCs and vSMCs. SRF directs PC migration downstream of PDGFRB signaling and mediates pathological PC activation during ischemic retinopathy. In vSMCs, SRF is essential for expression of the contractile machinery, and its deletion triggers formation of AV shunts. These essential roles in physiological and pathological contexts provide a rational for novel therapeutic approaches through targeting SRF activity in MCs.",

Two mechanisms have been highlighted: forming new connections from and between the problem elements and insight solving (with a sudden realization of a solution). We examined EEG activity during an adapted version of a classical insight problem task, the Remote Associates Test, that requires finding a word connecting three words. It allowed us to explore remoteness in semantic connections (by varying the remoteness of the solution word across trials) and insight solving (identified as a \"Eureka\" moment reported by the participants). Semantic remoteness was associated with a power increase in alpha band (8-12Hz) in a left parieto-temporal cluster, beta band (13-30Hz) in a right fronto-temporal cluster in the early phase of the task, and theta band (3-7Hz) in frontal cluster before the participants responded. Insight solving was associated with power increase preceding the response in alpha and gamma band (31-60Hz) in left temporal clusters and theta band in a frontal cluster. Source reconstructions show the brain regions associated with these clusters. Overall, our findings shed new light on the dynamic of some of the mechanisms involved in creative problem-solving.",

However, the effect of host metabolic conditions on MSCs in general, and IMT in particular, has largely remained unexplored. This study has identified a molecular pathway that primarily governs the metabolic function and IMT of MSCs. We found underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired mitophagy, and reduced IMT in MSCs derived from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice (MSC-Ob). Mechanistically, MSC-Ob failed to sequester their damaged mitochondria into LC3-dependent autophagosomes due to decrease in mitochondrial cardiolipin content, which we propose as a putative mitophagy receptor for LC3 in MSCs. Functionally, MSC-Ob exhibited diminished potential to rescue metabolic deficits and cell death in stress-induced epithelial cells. In a small molecule screen, we found pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a regulator of mitophagy and IMT. Long-term culture of MSC-Ob with PQQ (MSC-ObPQQ) restored cardiolipin content and sequestration of mitochondria to autophagosomes with concomitant activation of mitophagy. Upon co-culture, MSC-ObPQQ rescued cell death in stress-induced epithelial cells by enhancing IMT. The beneficial effect of PQQ was also evident in MSCs derived from human subjects in an in vitro model. In two independent mice models, the transplantation of MSC-ObPQQ restored IMT to airway epithelial cells, improved their mitochondrial metabolism and attenuated features of allergic airway inflammation (AAI). However, unmodulated MSC-Ob failed to do so. In summary, we uncover the molecular mechanism leading to the therapeutic decline of obese-derived MSCs and highlight the importance of pharmacological modulation of these cells for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "MotivationModeling single-cell gene expression trends along cell pseudotime is a crucial analysis for exploring biological processes. Most existing methods rely on nonparametric regression models for their flexibility; however, nonparametric models often provide trends too complex to interpret. Other existing methods use interpretable but restrictive models. Since model interpretability and flexibility are both indispensable for understanding biological processes, the single-cell field needs a model that improves the interpretability and largely maintains the flexibility of nonparametric regression models.\n\nResultsHere we propose the single-cell generalized trend model (scGTM) for capturing a genes expression trend, which may be monotone, hill-shaped, or valley-shaped, along cell pseudotime. The scGTM has three advantages: (1) it can capture non-monotonic trends that are still easy to interpret, (2) its parameters are biologically interpretable and trend informative, and (3) it can flexibly accommodate common distributions for modeling gene expression counts. To tackle the complex optimization problems, we use the particle swarm optimization algorithm to find the constrained maximum likelihood estimates for the scGTM parameters. As an application, we analyze several single-cell gene expression data sets using the scGTM and show that it can capture interpretable gene expression trends along cell pseudotime and reveal molecular insights underlying the biological processes.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe Python package scGTM is open-access and available at https://github.com/ElvisCuiHan/scGTM.\n\nContactjli@stat.ucla.edu",

    "abstract": "Genome sequence analyses predicted the presence of effectors in the gram-negative Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) even without the presence of a classical type III secretion system. Since CLas is not culturable, it is not possible to perform traditional gene knockout experiments to determine the role of various effectors in Huanglongbing (HLB) pathogenesis. Therefore, we followed an alternative functional genomics approach to examine the role of the CLas effectors in HLB pathogenesis in general and more specifically in suppressing citrus innate immune response. Here, we focused on the CLas effectors, P235 and Effector 3, to perform the following studies. First, proteomic studies by LC-MS/MS were conducted to screen the putative interacting citrus protein partners of P235 and Effector 3 from the healthy and CLas-infected Hamlin extracts and the most probable candidates were identified based upon their high protein scores from LC-MS/MS. Second, a transgenic tobacco split GFP system was designed for in planta detection of the most probable citrus interacting protein partners of P235 and Effector 3. Third, in vitro and in planta studies were performed to show that each of two effectors interacts with and inhibits the functions of multiple citrus proteins belonging to the innate immune pathways. These inhibitory interactions led to a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), blocking of bactericidal lipid binding protein (LTP), and induction of premature programmed cell death (PCD), thereby supporting CLas infection and HLB pathogenesis. Finally, an LTP mimic was designed to sequester and block the CLas effector and to rescue the bactericidal activity of LTP.",
