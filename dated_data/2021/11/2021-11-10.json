    "abstract": "BackgroundTracking animal movement is important for understanding how animals interact with their (changing) environment, and crucial for predicting and explaining how animals are affected by anthropogenic effects. The Wadden Sea is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a region of global importance for millions of small shorebirds. Due to climate change and anthropogenic activity, understanding and predicting movement and space-use in areas like the Wadden Sea is increasingly important. Monitoring and predicting animal movement, however, requires high-resolution tracking of many individuals. While high-resolution tracking has been made possible through GPS, trade-offs between tag weight and battery life limit its use to larger species.\n\nMethodsHere, we introduce WATLAS (the Wadden Sea deployment of the ATLAS tracking system) capable of monitoring the movements of hundreds of (small) birds simultaneously in the Dutch Wadden Sea. WATLAS employs an array of receiver stations that can detect and localise small, low-cost tags at fine spatial (meters) and temporal resolution (seconds). From 2017-2021, we tracked red knots, sanderlings, bar-tailed godwits, and common terns. We use parts of these data to give four examples on its performance and how WATLAS can be used to study numerous aspects of animal behaviour, such as, space-use (both intra- and inter-specific), among-individual variation, and social networks.\n\nResultsAfter describing the WATLAS system, we first illustrate space-use of red knots across the study area and how the tidal environment affects their movement. Secondly, we show large among-individual differences in distances travelled per day, and thirdly illustrate how high-throughput WATLAS data allows calculating a proximity-based social network. Finally, we demonstrate that using WATLAS to monitor multiple species can reveal differential space use. For example, despite sanderlings and red knots roosting together, they foraged in different areas of the mudflats.\n\nConclusionsThe high-resolution tracking data collected by WATLAS offers many possibilities for research into the drivers of bird movement in the Wadden Sea. WATLAS could provide a tool for impact assessment, and thus aid nature conservation and management of the globally important Wadden Sea ecosystem.",

Despite the increasing importance of range shifts due to global change, dispersal has proved difficult to quantify, limiting empirical understanding of this phenotypic trait and wider synthesis.\nC_LIO_LIHere we aim to estimate and compare empirical dispersal kernels for European breeding birds considering average dispersal, natal (before first breeding) and breeding dispersal (between subsequent breeding attempts), and test whether different dispersal properties are phylogenetically conserved.\nC_LIO_LIWe standardised and analysed data from an extensive volunteer-based bird ring-recoveries database in Europe (EURING) by accounting for biases related to different censoring thresholds in reporting between countries and to migratory movements. Then, we fitted four widely used probability density functions in a Bayesian framework to compare and provide the best statistical descriptions of the average, the natal and the breeding dispersal kernels for each bird species.\nC_LIO_LIThe dispersal movements of the 234 European bird species analysed were statistically best explained by heavy-tailed kernels, meaning that while most individuals disperse over short distances, long-distance dispersal is a feature in almost all bird species. The overall phylogenetic signal in both median and long dispersal distances was low (Pagels {lambda} < 0.40), implying a high degree of taxonomic generality in our findings. As expected in birds, natal dispersal was 5 Km greater as an average than breeding dispersal for most species (88% species analysed).\nC_LIO_LIOur comprehensive analysis of empirical kernels indicates that long-distance dispersal is common among European breeding bird species and across life stages. The dispersal estimates offer a first guide to selecting appropriate dispersal kernels in range expansion studies and provide new avenues to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and rules underlying dispersal events.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Analysis of intracellular molecular networks has many applications in understanding of the molecular bases of some complex diseases and finding the effective therapeutic targets for drug development. To perform such analyses, the molecular networks need to be converted into computational models. In general, network models constructed using literature and pathway databases may not accurately predict and reproduce experimental network data. This can be due to the incompleteness of literature on molecular pathways, the resources used to construct the networks, or some conflicting information in the resources. In this paper, we propose a network learning approach via an integer linear programming formulation that can efficiently incorporate biological dynamics and regulatory mechanisms of molecular networks in the learning process. Moreover, we present a method to properly take into account the feedback paths, while learning the network from data. Examples are also provided to show how one can apply the proposed learning approach to a network of interest. Overall, the proposed methods are useful for reducing the gap between the curated networks and experimental network data, and result in calibrated networks that are more reliable for making biologically meaningful predictions.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects 23 million people worldwide. It is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by the attack of inflammatory chemicals on the synovial tissue that lines joints. It is advantageous to develop effective, targeted treatments and identify specific diagnostic biomarkers for RA before extensive joint degradation, bone erosion, and cartilage destruction. Current modes of RA treatments have alleviated and notably halted the progression of RA. Despite this, not many patients reach low disease activity status after treatment, and a significant number of patients fail to respond to medication due to drug non-specificity. While the reasons for these rates remain unknown, the cellular and molecular signatures present in the synovial tissue for RA patients likely play a role in the varied treatment response. Thus, a drug that particularly targets specific genes and networks may have a significant effect in halting the progression of RA. This study evaluates and proposes potential drug targets through in silico mathematical modeling of various pathways of interest in RA. To understand how drugs interact with genes, we built a mathematical model with 30 two-gene and three-gene network interactions and analyzed the effect of 92 different perturbations to rate constants. We determined that inhibition of the LCK-CD4, VAV1-CD4, and MLT-ROR pathways could potentially serve as drug targets. We also found that increased activity of the DEC2-IL1{beta} and the NF-kB-interleukin pathway and the decreased activity of the TNF--REV-ERB pathway could serve as diagnostic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "One of the main goals of microbiome research is to identify bacterial members that significantly affect host phenotypes and understand their contributions to disease pathogenesis. Studies identifying bacterial members that dictate host phenotype have focused mainly on the dominant members, and the role of low abundance microbes in determining host phenotypes and pathogenesis of diseases remains unexplored. In this study, we compared the gut bacterial community of mice with wide-ranging microbial exposure to determine if low abundance bacteria vary based on microbial exposure or remain consistent. We noted that similar to the high abundance bacterial community, a core community of low abundance bacteria made up a significant portion of the gut microbiome irrespective of microbial exposure. To determine the effect of low abundance bacteria on community structure and host gene expression, we devised a microbiome dilution strategy to \"delete\" out low abundance bacteria and engrafted the diluted microbiomes into germ-free mice. Our approach successfully excluded low abundance bacteria from small and large intestinal bacterial communities and induced global changes in microbial community structure and composition in the large intestine. Gene expression analysis of intestinal tissue revealed that loss of low abundance bacteria resulted in a drastic reduction in expression of multiple genes involved MHC class II antigen presentation pathway and T-cell cytokine production in the small intestine. The effect of low abundance bacteria on MHC class II expression was found specific to the intestinal epithelium at an early timepoint post-colonization and correlated with bacteria belonging to the family Erysipelotrichaceae. We conclude that low abundance bacteria have a significantly higher immuno-stimulatory effect compared to dominant bacteria and are thus potent drivers of early immune education in the gut. Therefore, characterizing immune interaction of low abundance bacteria with the host will offer greater insight into the intestinal immune landscape and disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveDiet-induced obesity (DIO) is associated with hypothalamic microglial activation and dysfunction of the melanocortin pathway, but the molecular mechanisms linking the two remain unclear. Previous studies have hypothesized that microglial inflammatory signaling is linked with impaired pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron function, but this mechanism has never been directly tested in vivo. We addressed this hypothesis using the specific microglial silencing molecule, CX3CL1 (fractalkine), to determine whether reducing hypothalamic microglial activation can restore POMC/melanocortin signaling in the brain to protect against DIO.\n\nMethodsWe performed metabolic analyses in mice with targeted viral overexpression of CX3CL1 in the hypothalamus exposed to high fat diet (HFD). Electrophysiologic recording in hypothalamic slices from POMC-MAPT-GFP mice was used to determine the effects of HFD feeding and microglial silencing via minocycline or CX3CL1 on GFP-labeled POMC neurons. Finally, mice with hypothalamic overexpression of CX3CL1 received central treatment with the melanocortin receptor antagonist SHU-9119 to determine whether melanocortin signaling is required for the metabolic benefits of CX3CL1.\n\nResultsWe found that targeted expression of both soluble and membrane-bound forms of CX3CL1 in the mediobasal hypothalamus potently reduced weight gain and increased leptin sensitivity in animals exposed to high fat diet. The protective effect of CX3CL1 rescued diet-induced changes in POMC neuron excitability and required intact melanocortin receptor signaling in vivo.\n\nConclusionOur results provide the first evidence that HFD-induced POMC neuron dysfunction involves microglial activation. Furthermore, our study suggests that the anti-obesity action of CX3CL1 is mediated through the restoration of POMC neuron excitability and melanocortin signaling.",

In studies of healthy volunteers and non-critically ill patients, prospective cardiorespiratory data are routinely collected to remove non-neuronal fluctuations in the rs-fMRI signal during analysis. However, the feasibility and utility of collecting cardiorespiratory data in critically ill patients on a clinical MRI scanner are unknown. We concurrently acquired rs-fMRI (TR=1250ms), cardiac and respiratory data in 23 critically ill patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and 12 healthy control subjects. We compared the functional connectivity results after denoising with cardiorespiratory data (i.e., RETROICOR) with the results obtained after standard bandpass filtering. Rs-fMRI data in 7 patients could not be analyzed due to imaging artifacts. In 6 of the remaining 16 patients (37.5%), cardiorespiratory data were either incomplete or corrupted. In both patients and control subjects, the functional connectivity corrected with RETROICOR did not significantly differ from that corrected with bandpass filtering of 0.008-0.125 Hz. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is a limited feasibility and utility to prospectively acquire high-quality cardiorespiratory data during rs-fMRI in critically ill patients with severe TBI for physiological correction.",

Cognitive psychology suggests that cognitive control mechanisms play a key role when facing such complex task conditions. However, in value-based decision-making, it still remains unclear to what extent cognitive control mechanisms become essential when the task condition is complex. In this study, we investigated decision-making behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms using a multifactor gambling task where participants simultaneously considered probability and delay. Decision-making behavior in the multifactor task was modulated by both probability and delay. The behavioral effect of probability was stronger than delay, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, in a subset of conditions that recruited fronto-parietal activations, reaction times were paradoxically elongated despite lower probabilistic uncertainty. Notably, such a reaction time elongation did not occur in control tasks involving single factors. Meta-analysis of brain activations suggested an association between the paradoxical increase of reaction time and strategy switching. Together, these results suggest a novel aspect of complex value-based decision-makings that is strongly influenced by fronto-parietal cognitive control.\n\nHighlights* A value-based decision task with concurrent delay and probabilistic uncertainty\n* Stronger behavioral effect of probability than delay\n* Paradoxically long reaction time despite low probabilistic uncertainty\n* The task activated fronto-parietal cognitive control network\n* Reaction time elongation coincided with activation similar to strategy switching",

But the interpretation of these Subsequent Memory Effects (SMEs) remains unclear: if the identified signals reflect cognitive and neural mechanisms of memory encoding then the underlying neural activity must be causally related to future memory. However, almost all previous SME analyses do not control for potential confounders of this causal interpretation, such as serial position and item effects. We collect a large fMRI dataset and use a novel experimental design and analysis approach that allows us to statistically adjust for all exogenous confounding variables. We find that, using standard approaches without adjustment, we replicate several univariate and multivariate subsequent memory effects and are able to predict memory performance across people. However, we are unable to identify any signal that reliably predicts subsequent memory after adjusting for confounding variables, bringing into doubt the causal status of these effects. We apply the same approach to subjects judgments of learning collected during an encoding period, and show that these behavioral measures of encoding quality do predict memory after adjustments, suggesting that it is possible to measure signals at the time of encoding that reflect causal mechanisms but that existing neuroimaging measures may not have the precision and specificity to do so.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other animals navigate different landscapes and environments with ease, a feat that requires the brains ability to rapidly and accurately adapt to different visual domains, generalizing across contexts/backgrounds. Despite recent progress in deep learning applied to classification and detection in the presence of multiple confounds including contextual ones [25, 30], there remain important challenges to address regarding how networks can perform context-dependent computations and how contextually-invariant visual concepts are formed. For instance, recent studies have shown artificial networks that repeatedly misclassified familiar objects set on new backgrounds, e.g. incorrectly labelling known animals when they appeared in a different setting [3]. Here, we show how a bio-inspired network motif can explicitly address this issue. We do this using a novel dataset which can be used as a benchmark for future studies probing invariance to backgrounds. The dataset consists of MNIST digits of varying transparency, set on one of two backgrounds with different statistics: a Gaussian noise or a more naturalistic background from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use this dataset to learn digit classification when contexts are shown sequentially, and find that both shallow and deep networks have sharply decreased performance when returning to the first background after experience learning the second - the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in continual learning. To overcome this, we propose an architecture with additional \" switching\" units that are activated in the presence of a new background. We find that the switching network can learn the new context even with very few switching units, while maintaining the performance in the previous context - but that they must be recurrently connected to network layers. When the task is difficult due to high transparency, the switching network trained on both contexts outperforms networks without switching trained on only one context. The switching mechanism leads to sparser activation patterns, and we provide intuition for why this helps to solve the task. We compare our architecture with other prominent learning methods, and find that elastic weight consolidation is not successful in our setting, while progressive nets are more complex but less effective. Our study therefore shows how a bio-inspired architectural motif can contribute to task generalization across context.",

How neural processes enable this capacity is a fundamental open question. Previous works have identified two candidate mechanisms: a low-dimensional organization of neural activity and a modulation by contextual inputs. We hypothesized that combining the two might facilitate generalization and adaptation in complex tasks. We tested this hypothesis in the framework of flexible timing tasks where dynamics play a key role. Examining trained recurrent neural networks, we found that confining the dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace allowed tonic inputs to parametrically control the overall input-output transform, enabling generalization to novel inputs and adaptation to changing conditions. Reverse-engineering and theoretical analyses demonstrated that this parametric control relies on a mechanism where tonic inputs modulate the dynamics along non-linear manifolds in activity space while preserving their geometry. Comparisons with data from behaving monkeys confirmed the behavioral and neural signatures of this mechanism.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo investigate the immune cell profiling and their longitudinal changes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nMethodsWe employed mass cytometry with three different 38-39 marker panels (Immunophenotyping, T cell/monocyte, and B cell) in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from nine patients with early SLE, 15 patients with established SLE, and 14 non-inflammatory controls. We used machine learning-driven clustering, FlowSOM (Flow Self-Organizing Maps) and dimensional reduction with tSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to identify unique cell populations in early and established SLE. For the nine early SLE patients, longitudinal mass cytometry analysis was applied to PBMCs at three time points (at enrollment, six months post-enrollment, and one year post-enrollment). Serum samples were also assayed for 65 cytokines by Luminex multiplex assay, and associations between cell types and cytokines/chemokines assessed.\n\nResultsT peripheral helper cells (Tph cells), T follicular helper cells (Tfh cells) and several Ki67+ proliferating subsets (ICOS+ Ki67+ CD8 T cells, Ki67+ regulatory T cells, CD19int Ki67hi plasmablasts, and Ki67hi PU.1hi monocytes) were increased in early SLE. Longitudinal mass cytometry and multiplex serum cytokine assays of samples from early SLE patients revealed that Tfh cells and CXCL10 decreased at one year post-enrollment. CXCL13 correlated positively with several of the expanded cell populations in early SLE.\n\nConclusionsTwo major helper T cell subsets and unique Ki67+ proliferating immune cell subsets were expanded in the early phase of SLE, and the immunologic features characteristic of early SLE evolved over time.",

    "abstract": "The paper nautilus, Argonauta argo, also known as the greater argonaut, is a species of octopods distinctly characterized by its pelagic lifestyle and by the presence of a spiral-shaped shell-like eggcase in females. The eggcase functions by protecting the eggs laid inside it, and by building and keeping air intakes for buoyancy. To reveal the genomic background of the species adaptation to pelagic lifestyle and the acquisition of its shell-like eggcase, we sequenced the draft genome sequence of the species. The genome size was 1.1 Gb, which is the smallest among the cephalopods known to date, with the top 215 scaffolds (average length 5,064,479 bp) covering 81% (1.09 Gb) of the total assembly. A total of 26,433 protein-coding genes were predicted from 16,802 assembled scaffolds. From these, we identified nearly intact HOX, Parahox, Wnt clusters and some gene clusters probably related to the pelagic lifestyle, such as reflectin, tyrosinase, and opsin. For example, opsin might have undergone an extensive duplication in order to adapt to the pelagic lifestyle, as opposed to other octopuses, which are mostly the benthic. Our gene models also discovered several genes homologous to those related to calcified shell formation in Conchiferan Mollusks, such as Pif-like, SOD, and TRX. Interestingly, comparative genomics analysis revealed that the homologous genes for such genes were also found in the genome of the octopus, which does not have a shell, as well as the basal cephalopods Nautilus. Therefore, the draft genome sequence of A. argo we presented here had not only helped us to gain further insights into the genetic background of the dynamic recruitment and dismissal of genes for the formation of an important, converging extended phenotypic structure such as the shell and the shell-like eggcase, but also the evolution of lifestyles in Cephalopods and the octopods, from benthic to pelagic.",

    "abstract": "The first gapless, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) sequence assemblies of plant chromosomes were reported recently. However, sequence assemblies of most plant genomes remain fragmented. Only recent breakthroughs in accurate long-read sequencing have made it possible to achieve highly contiguous sequence assemblies with a few tens of contigs per chromosome, i.e. a number small enough to allow for a systematic inquiry into the causes of the remaining sequence gaps and the approaches and resources needed to close them. Here, we analyze sequence gaps in the current reference genome sequence of barley cv. Morex (MorexV3). Optical map and sequence raw data, complemented by ChIP-seq data for centromeric histone variant CENH3, were used to estimate the abundance of centromeric, ribosomal DNA and subtelomeric repeats in the barley genome. These estimates were compared with copy numbers in the MorexV3 pseudomolecule sequence. We found that almost all centromeric sequences and 45S ribosomal DNA repeat arrays were absent from the MorexV3 pseudomolecules and that the majority of sequence gaps can be attributed to assembly breakdown in long stretches of satellite repeats. However, missing sequences cannot fully account for the difference between assembly size and flow cytometric genome size estimates. We discuss the prospects of gap closure with ultra-long sequence reads.",

    "abstract": "PREMISEThe HybPiper pipeline has become one of the most widely used tools for the assembly of target enrichment (sequence capture) data for phylogenomic analysis. Between the production of locus sequences and phylogenetic analysis, the identification of paralogs is a critical step ensuring accurate inference of evolutionary relationships. Algorithmic approaches using gene tree topologies for the inference of ortholog groups are computationally efficient and broadly applicable to non-model organisms, especially in the absence of a known species tree. Unfortunately, software compatibility issues, unfamiliarity with relevant programming languages, and the complexity involved in running numerous subsequent analysis steps continue to limit the broad uptake of these approaches and constrain their application in practice.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTSWe updated the scripts constituting HybPiper and a pipeline for the inference of ortholog groups (\"Yang and Smith\") to provide novel options for the treatment of supercontigs, remove bugs, and seamlessly use the outputs of the former as inputs for the latter. The pipelines were containerised using Singularity and implemented via two Nextflow pipelines for easier deployment and to vastly reduce the number of commands required for their use. We tested the pipelines with several datasets, one of which is presented for demonstration.\n\nCONCLUSIONShybpiper-rbgv and yang-and-smith-rbgv provide easy installation, user-friendly experience, and robust results to the phylogenetic community.

    "abstract": "PurposeSCLC is a recalcitrant malignancy with limited treatment options. BET inhibitors have shown promising preclinical activity in SCLC, but their broad sensitivity spectrum limits their clinical prospects in this malignancy. Drug combination could be a solution.\n\nExperimental designWe performed high-throughput drug combination screens in SCLC cell lines to identify potential therapeutics synergizing with BET inhibitors. Validation was performed in SCLC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Genome-wide RNA sequencing of xenograft tumors was performed to determine the mechanism underlying the synergy of the drug combination.\n\nResultsInhibitors of the PI-3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were the top candidates from the screens. Among the therapeutics targeting this pathway, mTOR inhibitors showed the highest degree of synergy with BET inhibitors in vitro. Furthermore, the combination of these two classes of drugs showed superior antitumor efficacy and tolerability in vivo. Using both in vitro and in vivo SCLC models, we demonstrate that BET inhibitors activate the intrinsic apoptotic cascade, and mTOR inhibitors further enhance these apoptotic effects. Mechanistically, BET inhibitors activate the TSC2-mTOR-p70S6K1 signaling cascade by upregulating RSK3, an upstream kinase of TSC2. Activation of p70S6K1 leads to BAD phosphorylation and cell survival. mTOR inhibition blocks this survival signaling cascade and potentiates the antitumor effects of BET inhibitors.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that RSK3 upregulation is a novel resistance mechanism of BET inhibitors in SCLC, and mTOR inhibition can overcome this resistance and enhance apoptosis. These findings provide a rationale to evaluate the combination of mTOR and BET inhibitors in patients with SCLC.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with the development of metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and hypertension. Young mice that are negative for the neuroendocrine prohormone Chromogranin A (CgA knockout, CgA-KO) display two opposite aging phenotypes: hypertension but heightened insulin sensitivity. We determined these phenotypes in aging CgA mice. In comparison, aging wild-type (WT) mice gradually lost glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, while aging WT mice had increased inflammation with higher plasma TNF-, IFN-{gamma} and CCL2 and increased mitochondrial fission, these phenotypes were the opposite in aging CgA-KO mice. CgA-KO mice also showed increased expression of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded complex I genes, implying that they were healthier than WT mice. Most intriguingly, the hypertension in CgA-KO mice was spontaneously reversed with aging. Supplementation of CgA-KO mice with pancreastatin, a hyperglycemic peptide produced from CgA by proteolysis, increased both blood glucose levels and blood pressure, implicating hyperglycemia, and hypertension. We conclude that age-related insulin resistance and hypertension are caused by CgA.",

    "abstract": "The single skinned muscle fibre technique was used to investigate Ca2+- and Sr2+- activation properties of skeletal muscle fibres from elderly women (66-90 years). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle. Three populations of muscle fibres were identified according to their specific Sr2+- activation properties: slow-twitch (type I), fast-twitch (type II) and hybrid (type I/II) fibres. All three fibre types were sampled from the biopsies of 66 to 72 years old women, but the muscle biopsies of women older than 80 years yielded only slow-twitch (type I) fibres. The proportion of hybrid fibres in the vastus lateralis muscle of women of circa 70 years of age (24%) was several-fold greater than in the same muscle of adults (<10%), suggesting that muscle remodelling occurs around this age. There were no differences between the Ca2+- and Sr2+- activation properties of slow-twitch fibres from the two groups of elderly women, but there were differences compared with muscle fibres from adults with respect to sensitivity to Ca2+, steepness of the activation curves, and characteristics of the fibre-type dependent phenomenon of spontaneous force oscillations (SOMO) occurring at submaximal levels of activation. The maximal Ca2+ activated specific force from all the fibres collected from the seven old women use in the present study was significantly lower by 20% than in the same muscle of adults. Taken together these results show there are qualitative and quantitative changes in the activation properties of the contractile apparatus of muscle fibres from the vastus lateralis muscle of women with advancing age, and that these changes need to be considered when explaining observed changes in womens mobility with aging.",

    "abstract": "Adequate sleep is critical for development and facilitates the maturation of the neurophysiological circuitries at the basis of cognitive and behavioral function. Observational research has associated sleep problems in early life with worse later cognitive, psychosocial, and somatic health outcomes. Yet, the extent to which day-to-day sleep habits in early life relate to neurophysiology - acutely and long-term - remains to be explored. Here, we report that sleep habits in 32 healthy 6-month-olds assessed with actimetry are linked to fundamental aspects of their neurophysiology measured with high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG). Our study reveals four key findings: First, daytime sleep habits are linked to EEG slow wave activity (SWA). Second, habits of nighttime movement and awakenings from sleep are connected with spindle density. Third, habitual sleep timing is linked to neurophysiological connectivity quantified as Delta-coherence. And lastly, Delta-coherence at age 6 months predicts nighttime sleep duration at age 12 months. These novel findings widen our understanding that infants sleep habits are closely intertwined with three particular levels of neurophysiology: sleep pressure (determined by SWA), the maturation of the thalamocortical system (spindles), and the maturation of cortical connectivity (coherence). Our companion paper complements this insight in the perspective of later developmental outcomes: early thalamocortical connectivity (spindle density) at age 6 months predicts later behavioural status at 12 and 24 months. The crucial next step is to extend this concept to clinical groups to objectively characterize infants sleep habits \"at risk\" that foster later neurodevelopmental problems.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInfants habitual sleep behavior (actimetry) is linked with their sleep neurophysiology (EEG)\nC_LIO_LIHabits of daytime sleeping (naps) are related to slow wave activity\nC_LIO_LIInfants movements and awakenings at nighttime are linked to their sleep spindles\nC_LIO_LISleep timing (infants bedtimes) is associated with cortical connectivity in the EEG\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Neuroplasticity, defined as the brains potential to change in response to its environment, has been extensively studied at the cellular and molecular levels. Work in animal models suggests that stimulation to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) enhances plasticity, and that myelination constrains plasticity. Little is known, however, about whether proxy measures of these properties in the human brain are associated with learning. Here, we investigated the plasticity of the frontoparietal system by asking whether VTA resting-state functional connectivity and myelin map values (T1w/T2w ratios) predicted learning after short-term training on the adaptive n-back (n = 46, ages 18-25). We found that stronger baseline connectivity between VTA and lateral prefrontal cortex predicted greater improvements in accuracy. Lower myelin map values predicted improvements in response times, but not accuracy. Our findings suggest that proxy markers of neural plasticity can predict learning in humans.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) are the leading causes of death due to infectious disease. Although Mtb and CoV2 both cause serious and sometimes fatal respiratory infections, the effect of Mtb infection and its associated immune response on secondary infection with CoV2 is unknown. To address this question we applied two mouse models of COVID19, using mice which were chronically infected with Mtb. In both model systems, Mtb-infected mice were resistant to secondary CoV2 infection and its pathological consequences, and CoV2 infection did not affect Mtb burdens. Single cell RNA sequencing of coinfected and monoinfected lungs demonstrated the resistance of Mtb-infected mice is associated with expansion of T and B cell subsets upon viral challenge. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Mtb infection conditions the lung environment in a manner that is not conducive to CoV2 survival.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) are distinct organisms which both cause lung disease. We report the surprising observation that Mtb-infected mice are resistant to secondary infection with CoV2, with no impact on Mtb burden and resistance associating with lung T and B cell expansion.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have great prospects for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after liver transplantation. At this stage, the main factor limiting MSCs in the treatment of fatty liver IRI of the donor liver is the residence time of stem cells at the site of inflammatory injury. This study investigated whether bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) stimulated by tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) can promote the repair of fatty liver cell oxidative stress injury and fatty liver IRI in rats. The results indicated the BMSCs treatment group stimulated by TNF- had lower indexes and significantly improved oxidative stress damage in vitro through Transwell chamber co-culture experiment, compared with the control group. In vivo, compared with the PBS group and the BMSCs group, the indexes of the BMSCs treatment group stimulated by TNF- were reduced, and the degree of tissue damage was significantly reduced. BMSCs can repair fatty liver cell oxidative stress injury and fatty liver IRI, however, BMSCs stimulated by TNF- can promote the repair of tissues and cells.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition shapes a broad range of life history traits, ultimately impacting animal fitness. A key fitness-related trait, female fecundity is well known to change as a function of diet. In particular, the availability of dietary protein is one of the main drivers of egg production, and in the absence of essential amino acids egg laying declines. However, it is unclear whether all essential amino acids have the same impact on phenotypes like fecundity. Using a holidic diet, we fed adult female D. melanogaster diets that contain all necessary nutrients except one of the 10 essential amino acids and assessed the effects on egg production. For most essential amino acids, depleting a single amino acid induced as rapid a decline in egg production as when there were no amino acids in the diet. However, when either methionine or histidine were excluded from the diet, egg production declined more slowly. Next, we tested whether GCN2 and TOR were involved in this difference in response across amino acids. While mutations in GCN2 did not eliminate the differences in the rates of decline in egg laying among amino acid drop-out diets, we found that inhibiting TOR signalling caused egg laying to decline rapidly for all drop-out diets. TOR signalling does this by regulating the yolk-forming stages of egg chamber development. Our results suggest that amino acids differ in their ability to induce signalling via the TOR pathway. This is important because if phenotypes differ in sensitivity to individual amino acids, this generates the potential for mismatches between the output of a pathway and the animals true nutritional status.",

    "abstract": "Passive collection is an emerging sampling method for environmental DNA (eDNA) in aquatic systems. Passive eDNA collection is inexpensive, efficient, and requires minimal equipment, making it suited to high density sampling and remote deployment. Here, we compare the effectiveness of nine membrane materials for passively collecting fish eDNA from a 3 million litre marine mesocosm. We submerged materials (cellulose, cellulose with 1% and 3% chitosan, cellulose overlayed with electrospun nanofibers and 1% chitosan, cotton fibres, hemp fibres and sponge with either zeolite or active carbon) for intervals between five and 1080 minutes. We show that for most materials, with as little as five minutes submersion, mitochondrial fish eDNA measured with qPCR, and fish species richness measured with metabarcoding, was comparable to that collected by conventional filtering. Furthermore, PCR template DNA concentrations and species richness were generally not improved significantly by longer submersion. Species richness detected for all materials ranged between 11 to 37 species, with a median of 27, which was comparable to the range for filtered eDNA (19-32). Using scanning electron microscopy, we visualised biological matter adhered to the surface of materials, rather than entrapped, with images also revealing a diversity in size and structure of putative eDNA particles.\n\nEnvironmental DNA can be collected rapidly from seawater with a passive approach and using a variety of materials. This will suit cost and time-sensitive biological surveys, and where access to equipment is limited.",

To interpret the function of these active-RSCNEs, we developed a Conserved Non-coding Element interpretation method by gene Regulatory network (CNEReg) to define toolkit transcription factors (TTF) and model its regulation on rumen specific gene via batteries of active-RSCNEs during development. Our developmental GRN reveals 18 TTFs and 313 active-RSCNEs regulating the functional modules of the rumen and identifies OTX1, SOX21, HOXC8, SOX2, TP63, PPARG and 16 active-RSCNEs that functionally distinguish the rumen from the esophagus.\n\nConclusionsWe argue that CNEReg is an attractive systematic approach to integrate evo-devo concepts with omics data to understand how gene regulation evolves and shapes complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is characterized by a failure of cells to complete skeletal muscle differentiation. Although ERMS cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress, the relevance of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis in oncogenesis is unclear. Here, we show that ERMS cell lines as well as primary tumours exhibit elevated expression of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU). MCU knockdown resulted in impaired mitochondrial calcium uptake and a reduction in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) levels. Phenotypically, MCU knockdown cells exhibited reduced cellular proliferation and motility, with an increased propensity to differentiate in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing of MCU knockdown cells revealed a significant reduction in genes involved in TGF{beta} signalling that play prominent roles in oncogenesis and inhibition of myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, modulation of mROS production impacted TGF{beta} signalling. Our study elucidates mechanisms by which mitochondrial calcium dysregulation promotes tumour progression and suggests that targeting the MCU complex to restore mitochondrial calcium homeostasis could be a therapeutic avenue in ERMS.",

Five different murine anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs from our panel of 24 murine anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs (1) were found to rescue some of the challenged mice. All five murine mAbs were used to genetically engineer humanized anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs by inserting the murine complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into a human IgG1,kappa scaffold and expressing the humanized mAbs in CHO cells. Three humanized anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs were effective at rescuing mice from sepsis in three different animal models of sepsis. The effectiveness of the treatment was both time and dose dependent. Humanized anti-MV-A iNOS rHJ mAb could rescue up to 80% of the challenged animal if administered early and at a high dose.\n\nConclusionsOur conclusions are MV-A iNOS is a novel therapeutic target to treat sepsis; anti-MV-A iNOS mAbs can mitigate the harmful effects of MV-A iNOS; the neutralizing mAbs efficacy is both time and dose dependent; and a specifically targeted immunotherapeutic for MV-A iNOS could potentially save tens-of-thousands of lives annually and could result in improved antibiotic stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the worlds deadliest infectious diseases and remains a significant global health burden. TB disease and pathology can present clinically across a spectrum of outcomes, ranging from total sterilization of infection to active disease. Much remains unknown about the biology that drives an individual towards various clinical outcomes as it is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is unknown whether numbers of immune cells in the blood accurately reflect ongoing events during infection within human lungs. Herein, we utilize a systems biology approach by developing a whole-host model of the immune response to Mtb across multiple physiologic and time scales. This model, called HostSim, tracks events at the cellular, granuloma, organ, and host scale and represents the first whole-host, multi-scale model of the immune response following Mtb infection. We show that this model can capture various aspects of human and non-human primate TB disease and predict that biomarkers in the blood may only faithfully represent events in the lung at early time points after infection. We posit that HostSim, as a first step toward personalized digital twins in TB research, offers a powerful computational tool that can be used in concert with experimental approaches to understand and predict events about various aspects of TB disease and therapeutics.",

However, existing model extraction algorithms are unable to ensure that the context-specific model is thermodynamically feasible. This protocol introduces XomicsToModel, a semi-automated pipeline that integrates bibliomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data with a generic genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, or model, to extract a context-specific, genome-scale metabolic model that is stoichiometrically, thermodynamically and flux consistent. The XomicsToModel pipeline is exemplified for extraction of a specific metabolic model from a generic metabolic model, but it enables omics data integration and extraction of physicochemically consistent mechanistic models from any generic biochemical network. With all input data fully prepared, algorithmic completion of the pipeline takes ~10 min, however manual review of intermediate results may also be required, e.g., when inconsistent input data lead to an infeasible model.",

    "abstract": "The close association between astrocytes and microglia causes great difficulties to distinguish their individual roles in innate immune responses in central nervous system. Current chemical-based methods to eliminate microglia in glial cell culture introduce various molecular and functional alterations to astrocytes. Here, we describe a novel two-step approach to achieve a complete elimination of microglia without affecting the biological properties of co-cultured astrocytes by temporal treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We verify TSA as a potent inducer for microglial-specific cell death, which also causes comprehensive gene expression changes in astrocytes. However, withdrawal of TSA not only ensures no microglia repopulation, but also restores all the gene expression changes in terms of astrocyte functions, including neurotrophic factors, glutamate and potassium transporters, and reactive astrocyte subtypes. By contrast, withdrawal of PLX5622, the commonly used colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor neither prevents microglia repopulation nor restores the gene expression changes mentioned above. Using this method, we are able to discriminate differential roles of microglia and astrocytes in the induced expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines upon various pathological stimuli including the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This simple and efficient method can be customized for the understanding of microglia-astrocyte interaction and the development of epigenetic therapies that target over-activated microglia in neuroinflammation-related diseases.",

The Spike glycoprotein of alpha has acquired a number mutations including the P681H mutation in the polybasic cleavage site that has been suggested to enhance Spike cleavage. Here, we show that the alpha Spike protein confers a level of resistance to the effects of interferon-{beta} (IFN{beta}) in lung epithelial cells. This correlates with resistance to restriction mediated by interferon-induced transmembrane protein-2 (IFITM2) and a pronounced infection enhancement by IFITM3. Furthermore, the P681H mutation is necessary for comparative resistance to IFN{beta} in a molecularly cloned SARS-CoV-2 encoding alpha Spike. Overall, we suggest that in addition to adaptive immune escape, mutations associated with VOCs also confer replication advantage through adaptation to resist innate immunity.",

There was a relatively uniform increase in cytokine expression between 3 and 12 months of age in serum and retina.\n\n670nm exposure was delivered daily for a week in 12 month old mice. This shifted patterns of cytokine expression in both serum and retina inducing a selective increase with some in serum increasing >5 fold. Changes in retina were smaller. In serum there were major increases in IL-7, 6, 13, 16 and 23, also in TNF- and CXCL 9 and 10. In retina the increases were found mainly in some IL (interleukins) and CXCLs (chemokines). A few cytokines were reduced by light exposure.\n\nChanges in serum cytokines implies that long wavelengths impacts systemically even to unexposed tissues deep in the body. In the context of wider literature, increased cytokine expression may be protective. However, their upregulation by light merits further analysis as cytokines upregulation can also be negative.",

LRRC15 mRNA is expressed in human collagen-producing lung myofibroblasts and LRRC15 protein is induced in severe COVID-19 infection where it can be found lining the airways. Mechanistically, LRRC15 does not itself support SARS-CoV-2 infection, but fibroblasts expressing LRRC15 can suppress both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in trans. Moreover, LRRC15 expression in fibroblasts suppresses collagen production and promotes expression of IFIT, OAS, and MX-family antiviral factors. Overall, LRRC15 is a novel SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding receptor that can help control viral load and regulate antiviral and antifibrotic transcriptional programs in the context of COVID-19 infection.",

It remains unknown whether a third dose of inactivated vaccine elicits immune potential against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we showed a significant decline in plasma neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 at seven months after a second dose of the inactivated vaccine in a large-scale cohort. However, we also found that a third vaccination with an inactivated vaccine largely increased plasma neutralization against variants including Beta, Delta, and Lambda. More importantly, the high-affinity anti-RBD memory B cells were also generated by the third vaccination, suggesting a more potent and longer protection. These findings highlighted the importance and effectiveness of a third dose of inactivated vaccine in conferring higher protection against the emerging variants in populations.",

Herein, we present a spatial proteomics approach integrating mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) with label-free proteomics in a mouse model of FXS to map the spatial distribution and quantify the levels of proteins in the hippocampus and hypothalamus brain regions. In total, 1,004 unique peptides were spatially resolved, demonstrating the diverse array of peptidomes present in the tissue slices and the broad coverage of the strategy. A group of proteins that are known to be involved in the GABAergic system, synaptic transmission, and co-expression network analysis indicated that protein in soy group was significantly associated with metabolism and synapse modules in the Fmr1KO brain. Ultimately, this spatial proteomics work laid the ground for identifying novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for FXS.",

We examined whether contributions to editorial decisions at various stages of the publication process is subject to gender disparity, based on analytics collected by the biomedical researcher-led journal eLife. Despite efforts to increase women representation, the board of reviewing editors (BRE) was men-dominant (69%). Moreover, authors suggested more men from the BRE pool, even after correcting for mens numerical over-representation. Although women editors were proportionally involved in the initial editorial process, they were under-engaged in editorial activities involving reviewers and authors. Additionally, converging evidence showed gender homophily in manuscripts assignment, such that men Senior Editors over-engaged men Reviewing Editors. This tendency was stronger in more gender-balanced scientific disciplines. Together, our findings confirm that gender disparities exist along the editorial process and suggest that merely increasing the proportion of women might not be sufficient to eliminate this bias.",

In addition to the CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided, sequence-specific binding and cleavage of target RNAs, such as phage transcripts, the type VI effector, Cas13, causes collateral RNA cleavage, which induces bacterial cell dormancy, thus protecting the host population from phage spread3,4. We show here that the principal form of collateral RNA degradation elicited by Cas13a protein from Leptotrichia shahii upon target RNA recognition is the cleavage of anticodons of multiple tRNA species, primarily those with anticodons containing uridines. This tRNA cleavage is necessary and sufficient for bacterial dormancy induction by Cas13a. In addition, Cas13a activates the RNases of bacterial toxin-antitoxin modules, thus indirectly causing mRNA and rRNA cleavage, which could provide a back-up defense mechanism. The identified mode of action of Cas13a resembles that of bacterial anticodon nucleases involved in antiphage defense5, which is compatible with the hypothesis that type VI effectors evolved from an abortive infection module6,7 encompassing an anticodon nuclease.",

    "abstract": "Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of stratified squamous epithelial cells causes nearly five percent of cancer cases worldwide. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers harbor few mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway compared to HPV-negative cancers at the same anatomical site, prompting the hypothesis that an HPV-encoded protein inactivates the Hippo pathway and activates the Hippo effector YAP1. The HPV E7 oncoprotein is required for HPV infection and for HPV-mediated oncogenic transformation. We investigated the effects of HPV oncoproteins on YAP1 and found that E7 activates YAP1, promoting YAP1 nuclear localization in basal epithelial cells. YAP1 activation by HPV E7 required that E7 bind and degrade the tumor suppressor PTPN14. E7 required YAP1 transcriptional activity to extend the lifespan of primary keratinocytes, indicating that YAP1 activation contributes to E7 carcinogenic activity. Maintaining infection in basal cells is critical for HPV persistence, and here we demonstrate that YAP1 activation causes HPV E7 expressing cells to be retained in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia. We propose that YAP1 activation resulting from PTPN14 inactivation is an essential, targetable activity of the HPV E7 oncoprotein relevant to HPV infection and carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Zymomonas mobilis is a promising bacterial host for biofuel production but further improvement has been hindered because some aspects of its metabolism remain poorly understood. For example, one of the main byproducts generated by Z. mobilis is acetate but the pathway for acetate production is unknown. Acetaldehyde oxidation has been proposed as the major source of acetate and an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase was previously isolated from Z. mobilis via activity guided fractionation, but the corresponding gene has never been identified. We determined that the locus ZMO1754 (also known as ZMO_RS07890) encodes an NADP+-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase that is responsible for acetate production by Z. mobilis. Deletion of this gene from the chromosome resulted in a growth defect in oxic conditions, suggesting that acetaldehyde detoxification is an important role of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The deletion strain also exhibited a near complete abolition of acetate production, both in typical laboratory conditions and during lignocellulosic hydrolysate fermentation. Our results show that ZMO1754 encodes the major acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in Z. mobilis and we therefore rename the gene aldB based on functional similarity to the Escherichia coli acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.\n\nImportanceBiofuel production from non-food crops is an important strategy for reducing carbon emissions from the transportation industry but it has not yet become commercially viable. An important avenue to improve biofuel production is to enhance the characteristics of fermentation organisms by genetic engineering. To make genetic modifications successful, we must gain sufficient information about the genome and metabolism of the organism to enable rational design and engineering. Here, we improved understanding of Zymomonas mobilis, a promising biofuel producing bacterium, by identifying a metabolic pathway and associated gene that lead to byproduct formation. This information may be used in the future for genetic engineering to reduce byproduct formation during biofuel production.",

Rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is urgently needed in the clinic to enable personalized prescription in high-resistance environments and limit the use of broad-spectrum drugs. Previously we have described a 30 min AST method based on imaging of individual bacterial cells. However, current phenotypic AST methods do not include species identification (ID), leaving time-consuming plating or culturing as the only available option when ID is needed to make the sensitivity call. Here we describe a method to perform phenotypic AST at the single-cell level in a microfluidic chip that allows subsequent genotyping by in situ FISH. By stratifying the phenotypic AST response on the species of individual cells, it is possible to determine the susceptibility profile for each species in a mixed infection sample in 1.5 h. In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate the operation with four antibiotics and a mixed sample with four species.",

Histological characterization revealed progressive epithelial cellular differentiation with well-resemblance to autologous ex vivo tissues. We demonstrate that MERS-CoV displays a divergent cell tropism and replication kinetics profile in both AEC models. Furthermore, we observed that in the camelid AEC models MERS-CoV replication can be inhibited by both type I and III interferons (IFNs). In conclusion, we successfully established camelid AEC cultures that recapitulate the in vivo airway epithelium and reflect MERS-CoV infection in vivo. In combination with human AEC cultures, this system allows detailed characterization of the molecular basis of MERS-CoV cross-species transmission in respiratory epithelium.",

Three factors explained >40% of the observed variance in clone survival of HTLV-1 in vivo: the radial intranuclear position of the provirus, its absolute genomic distance from the centromere, and the intensity of host genome transcription flanking the provirus. The radial intranuclear position of the provirus and its distance from the centromere also explained ~7% of clonal persistence of HIV-1 in vivo.

In a participant developed V3-glycan NAb response, naturally selected mutations at the V3 N301 and N332 glycan sites abrogated CCR8 usage while conferred APJ usage on the cognate T/F strain. Mutations at the N301 glycan also impaired CCR3 usage and partially compromised the efficiency in using CCR5, which could be fully restored by a single escape mutation at the N332 glycan site. Our study demonstrates the link between NAb escape and coreceptor usage alteration in natural HIV-1 infection and indicates that NAb response could drive virus entry tropism evolution in vivo.",

Most assembled metagenome public repositories use annotation pipelines tailored for prokaryotes regardless of the taxonomic origin of contigs and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Consequently, eukaryotic contigs and MAGs, with intrinsically different gene features, are not optimally annotated, resulting in an incorrect representation of the eukaryotic component of biodiversity, despite their biological relevance.\n\nResultsUsing an automated analysis pipeline, we have filtered 7.9 billion of contigs from 6,873 soil metagenomes in the IMG/M database of the Joint Genome Institute to identify eukaryotic contigs. We have re-annotated genes using eukaryote-tailored methods, yielding 8 million eukaryotic proteins. Of these, 5.6 million could be traced back to non-chimeric higher confidence eukaryotic contigs. Our pipeline improves eukaryotic proteins completeness, contiguity and quality.

The effects of the mutations on tertiary structure of the PTB domain in human CCM2 protein were predicted to examine the effect of the nsSNPs on tertiary structure on PTB Cores.\n\nResultsOur mutation analysis, through alignment of protein structures between wildtype CCM2 and mutant, indicated that the structural impacts of pathogenic nsSNPs is biophysically limited to only the spatially adjacent substituted amino acid site with minimal structural influence on the adjacent core of the PTB domain, suggesting both cores are independently functional and essential for proper CCM2 function.\n\nConclusionUtilizing a combination of protein conservation and structure-based analysis, we analyzed the structural effects of inherited pathogenic mutations within the CCM2 PTB domain.

    "abstract": "T cell signaling starts with assembling several tyrosine kinases and adaptor proteins to the T cell receptor (TCR), following the antigen binding. The lifetime of the TCR: antigen complex and the time delay between the recruitment and activation of each kinase determines the T cell response. The mechanism by which the time delays are implemented in TCR signaling is not fully understood. Combining experiments and kinetic modeling, we here report a thermodynamic-brake in the regulatory module of ZAP-70, which determines the ligand selectivity, and may delay the ZAP-70 activation in TCR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the evolution of the thermodynamic-brake coincides with the divergence of the adaptive immune system to the cell-mediated and humoral responses. Paralogous kinase Syk expressed in B cells, does not possess such a functional thermodynamic brake, which may explain higher basal activation and lack of ligand selectivity by Syk.",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids offer a promising solution to renal failure, yet current organoid protocols often lead to off-target cells and phenotypic alterations, preventing maturity. Here, we created various dynamic hydrogel architectures, conferring a controlled and biomimetic environment for organoid encapsulation. We investigated how hydrogel stiffness and stress relaxation affect renal phenotype and undesired fibrotic markers. We observed stiff hydrogel encapsulation led to an absence of certain renal cell types and signs of an epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas encapsulation in soft-stress-relaxing hydrogels led to all major renal segments, fewer fibrosis/EMT associated proteins, apical proximal tubule enrichment, and primary cilia formation, representing a significant improvement over current approaches to culture kidney organoids. Our findings show that engineering hydrogel mechanics and dynamics has a decided benefit for organoid culture. These structure-property- function relationships can enable rational design of materials, bringing us closer to functional engraftments and disease-modelling applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA common polymorphism (R577X) in the ACTN3 gene results in complete absence of the Z-disc protein -actinin-3 from fast-twitch muscle fibres in ~16% of the worlds population. This single gene polymorphism has been subject to strong positive selection pressure during recent human evolution. Previously, using an Actn3KO mouse model, we have shown in fast-twitch muscles, eccentric contractions at L0+ 20% stretch did not cause eccentric damage. In contrast, L0+ 30% stretch produced a significant ~40% deficit in maximum force; here we use isolated single fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibres from the Actn3KO mouse to investigate the mechanism underlying this.\n\nMethodsSingle fast-twitch fibres are separated from the intact muscle by a collagenase digest procedure. We use label-free second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging, ultra-fast video microscopy and skinned fibre measurements from our MyoRobot automated biomechatronics system to study the morphology, visco-elasticity, force production and mechanical strength of single fibres from the Actn3KO mouse. Data are presented as means {+/-} SD and tested for significance using ANOVA.\n\nResultsWe show that the absence of -actinin-3 does not affect the unloaded maximum speed of contraction, visco-elastic properties or myofibrillar force production. Eccentric contractions demonstrated that chemically skinned Actn3KO fibres are mechanically weaker being prone to breakage when eccentrically contracted. Furthermore, SHG images reveal disruptions in the myofibrillar alignment of Actn3KO fast-twitch fibres with an increase in Y-shaped myofibrillar lattice shifts.\n\nConclusionsAbsence of -actinin-3 from the Z-disc in fast-twitch fibres disrupts the organisation of the myofibrillar proteins, leading to structural weakness. This provides a mechanistic explanation for our earlier findings that, in vitro intact Actn3KO fast-twitch muscles are significantly damaged by L0+ 30%, but not, L0+ 20%, eccentric contraction strains. Our study also provides a possible mechanistic explanation as to why -actinin-3 deficient humans have been reported to have a faster decline in muscle function with increasing age, that is; as sarcopenia reduces muscle mass and force output, the eccentric stress on the remaining functional -actinin-3 deficient fibres will be increased, resulting in fibres breakages.",

Intraepithelial CD4+ T cells recruited after MNV or AdV infection co-express Ly6A and CCR9, and exhibit T helper 1 and cytotoxic profiles. Although these cells display a diverse TCR repertoire, they conferred protection against AdV and MNV both in vivo and in an organoid co-culture model in an IFN-{gamma}-dependent manner. Ablation of the T cell receptor (TCR) or the transcription factor ThPOK in CD4+ T cells prior to infection prevented viral control, while TCR ablation during infection did not impact viral clearance.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe gut microbiome plays an important role in autoimmunity including multiple sclerosis and its mouse model called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Prior studies have demonstrated that the multiple sclerosis gut microbiota can contribute to disease hence making it a potential therapeutic target. In addition, antibiotic treatment has been shown to ameliorate disease in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Yet, to this date, the mechanisms mediating these antibiotics effects are not understood. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the gut derived bacterial strains that drive neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis.\n\nResultsHere we characterized the gut microbiome of untreated and vancomycin treated EAE mice over time to identify bacteria with neuroimmunomodulatory potential. We observed alterations in the gut microbiota composition following EAE induction. We found that vancomycin treatment ameliorates EAE and that this protective effect is mediated via the microbiota. Notably, we observed increased abundance of bacteria known to be strong inducers of regulatory T cells, including members of Clostridium clusters XIVa and XVIII in vancomycin-treated mice during the presymptomatic phase of EAE, as well as at disease peak. We identified 50 bacterial taxa that correlate with EAE severity. Interestingly, several of these taxa exist in the human gut and some of them have been implicated in multiple sclerosis including Anaerotruncus colihominis, a butyrate producer, which had a positive correlation with disease severity. We found that Anaerotruncus colihominis ameliorates EAE and this is associated with induction of ROR{gamma}t+ regulatory T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes.\n\nConclusionsWe identified vancomycin as a potent modulator of the gut-brain axis by promoting the proliferation of bacterial species that induce regulatory T cells. In addition, our findings reveal 50 gut commensals as regulator of the gut-brain axis that can be used to further characterize pathogenic and beneficial host-microbiota interactions in multiple sclerosis patients. Our findings suggest that elevated Anaerotruncus colihominis in multiple sclerosis patients may represent a protective mechanism associated with recovery from the disease.",

    "abstract": "The mRNA 5 cap structure serves both to protect transcripts from degradation and promote their translation. Cap removal is thus an integral component of mRNA turnover that is carried out by cellular decapping enzymes, whose activity is tightly regulated and coupled to other stages of the mRNA decay pathway. The poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes its own decapping enzymes, D9 and D10, that act on cellular and viral mRNA, but may be regulated differently than their cellular counterparts. Here, we evaluated the targeting potential of these viral enzymes using RNA sequencing from cells infected with wild-type and decapping mutant versions of VACV as well as in uninfected cells expressing D10. We found that D9 and D10 target an overlapping subset of viral transcripts but that D10 plays a dominant role in depleting the vast majority of human transcripts, although not in an indiscriminate manner. Unexpectedly, the splicing architecture of a gene influences how robustly its corresponding transcript is targeted by D10, as transcripts derived from intronless genes are less susceptible to enzymatic decapping by D10. As all VACV genes are intronless, preferential decapping of transcripts from intron-encoding genes provides an unanticipated mechanism for the virus to disproportionately deplete host transcripts and remodel the infected cell transcriptome.",

To characterize features that influence insertion efficiency, we designed a library of 2,666 sequences up to 69 nt in length and measured the frequency of their insertion into four genomic sites in three human cell lines, using different prime editor systems. We discover that insertion sequence length, nucleotide composition and secondary structure all affect insertion rates, and that mismatch repair proficiency is a strong determinant for the shortest insertions. Combining the sequence and repair features into a machine learning model, we can predict insertion frequency for new sequences with R = 0.69. The tools we provide allow users to choose optimal constructs for DNA insertion using prime editing.",

We analyzed these sequencing data along with wild type samples and in vitro transcribed reference sequences to specifically detect changes in modification status. We show for the first time that direct RNA-sequencing is feasible on smaller, i.e. Flongle, flow cells. Our targeted approach reduces RNA input requirements, making it accessible to the analysis of limited samples such as patient derived material. The analysis of rRNA modifications during cardiomyocyte differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells, and of heart biopsies from cardiomyopathy patients revealed altered modifications of specific sites, among them pseudouridines, 2-O-methylation of riboses and acetylation of cytidines.

    "abstract": "The Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program (CITP) is an NIH-funded research consortium of investigators who conduct analyses at three independent sites to identify chemical interventions that reproducibly promote health and lifespan in a robust manner. The founding principle of the CITP is that compounds with positive effects across a genetically diverse panel of Caenorhabditis species and strains are likely engaging conserved biochemical pathways to exert their effects. As such, interventions that are broadly efficacious might be considered prominent compounds for translation for pre-clinical research and human clinical applications. Here, we report results generated using a recently streamlined pipeline approach for the evaluation of the effects of chemical compounds on lifespan and health. We studied five compounds previously shown to extend C. elegans lifespan or thought to promote mammalian health: 17-estradiol, acarbose, green tea extract, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and rapamycin. We found that green tea extract and nordihydroguaiaretic acid extend Caenorhabditis lifespan in a species-specific manner. Additionally, these two antioxidants conferred assay-specific effects in some studies--for example, decreasing survival for certain genetic backgrounds in manual survival assays in contrast with extended lifespan as assayed using automated C. elegans Lifespan Machines. We also observed that GTE and NDGA impact on older adult mobility capacity is dependent on genetic background, and that GTE reduces oxidative stress resistance in some Caenorhabditis strains. Overall, our analysis of the five compounds supports the general idea that genetic background and assay type can influence lifespan and health effects of compounds, and underscores that lifespan and health can be uncoupled by chemical interventions.",

    "abstract": "The structural maintenance of chromosome complexes exhibit the remarkable ability to actively extrude DNA, which has led to the appealing and popular \"loop extrusion\" model to explain one of the most important processes in biology: the compaction of chromatin during the cell cycle. A potential mechanism for the action of extrusion is the classic Brownian ratchet, which requires short DNA loops to overcome an initial enthalpic barrier to bending, before favoured entropic growth of longer loops. We present a simple model of the constrained dynamics of DNA loop formation based on a frictional worm like chain, where for circular loops of order, or smaller than the persistence length, internal friction to bending dominates solvent dynamics. Using Rayleighs dissipation function, we show how bending friction can be translated to simple one dimensional diffusion of the angle of the loop resulting in a Smoluchowski equation with a coordinate dependent diffusion constant. This interplay between Brownian motion, bending dissipation and geometry of loops leads to a qualitatively new phenomenon, where the friction vanishes for bends with an angle of exactly 180 degrees, due to a decoupling between changes in loop curvature and angle. Using this theory and given current parameter uncertainties, we tentatively predict mean first passage times of between 1 and 10 seconds, which is of order the cycle time of ATP, suggesting spontaneous looping could be sufficient to achieve efficient initiation of looping.",

    "abstract": "The skeletal muscle voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV1.1) primarily functions as voltage sensor for excitation-contraction coupling. Conversely, its ion-conducting function is modulated by multiple mechanisms within the pore-forming 1S subunit and the auxiliary 2{delta}-1 and {gamma}1 subunits. Particularly, developmentally regulated alternative splicing of exon 29, which inserts 19 amino acids in the extracellular IVS3-S4 loop of CaV1.1a, greatly reduces the current density and shifts the voltage-dependence of activation to positive potentials outside the physiological range. We generated a new HEK293-cell line stably expressing 2{delta}-1, {beta}3, and STAC3. When the adult (CaV1.1a) and the embryonic (CaV1.1e) splice variants were expressed in these cells, the difference in the voltage-dependence of activation observed in muscle cells was reproduced, but not the reduced current density of CaV1.1a. Only when we further co-expressed the {gamma}1 subunit, the current density of CaV1.1a, but not of CaV1.1e, was reduced by >50 %. In addition, {gamma}1 caused a shift of the voltage-dependence of inactivation to negative voltages in both variants. Thus, the current-reducing effect of {gamma}1, but not its effect on inactivation, is specifically dependent on the inclusion of exon 29 in CaV1.1a. Molecular structure modeling revealed several direct ionic interactions between oppositely charged residues in the IVS3-S4 loop and the {gamma}1 subunit. However, substitution of these residues by alanine, individually or in combination, did not abolish the {gamma}1-dependent reduction of current density, suggesting that structural rearrangements of CaV1.1a induced by inclusion of exon 29 allosterically empower the {gamma}1 subunit to exert its inhibitory action on CaV1.1 calcium currents.\n\nSummaryEl Ghaleb et al. analyzed the effects of the {gamma}1 subunit on current properties and expression of the adult (CaV1.1a) and embryonic (CaV1.1e) calcium channel splice variants, demonstrating that {gamma}1 reduces the current amplitude in a splicing-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "The human lung is constantly exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus spores, the most prevalent worldwide cause of fungal respiratory disease. Pulmonary tissue damage is a unifying feature of Aspergillus-related diseases; however, the mechanistic basis of damage is not understood. In the lungs of susceptible hosts A. fumigatus undergoes an obligatory morphological switch involving spore germination and hyphal growth. We modelled A. fumigatus infection in cultured A549 human pneumocytes, capturing phosphoactivation status of five host signalling pathways, nuclear translocation & DNA binding of eight host transcription factors, and expression of nine host response proteins over six time points encompassing exposures to live fungus and the secretome thereof. The resulting dataset, comprised of more than 1000 data points, reveals that pneumocytes mount differential responses to A. fumigatus spores, hyphae and soluble secreted products via the NF-kB, JNK, and JNK + p38 pathways respectively. Importantly, via selective degradation of host pro-inflammatory (IL-6 and IL-8) cytokines and growth factors (FGF-2), fungal secreted products reorchestrate the host response to fungal challenge as well as driving multiparametric epithelial damage, culminating in cytolysis. Dysregulation of NF-kB signalling, involving iterative stimulation of canonical and non-canonical signalling, was identified as a significant feature of host damage both in vitro and in a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. Our data demonstrate that composite tissue damage results from iterative exposures to different fungal morphotypes and secreted products and suggest that modulation of host responses to fungal challenge might represent a unified strategy for therapeutic control of pathologically distinct types of Aspergillus-related disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEPulmonary aspergillosis is a spectrum of diseases caused primarily by Aspergillus fumigatus. This fungus is ubiquitous in the environment and grows as a mold, which harbors and disperses spores into the environment. Like other airborne pathogens, the lung mucosa is the first point of contact with the fungus post inhalation. The outcome and severity of disease depends on the host-fungal interaction at the lung interface. We studied how the human lung interacts with spore, germ tube and hyphae growth forms to understand the sequence and dynamics of the early events, which are critical drivers of disease development and progression. Our work is significant in identifying, in response to fungal secreted products, non-canonical NF-kB activation via RelB as being a driving factor in fungus-mediated lung damage. This process could be modulated therapeutically to protect the integrity of infected lung mucosae.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease characterized by increased levels of desmoplasia that contributes to reduced drug delivery and poor treatment outcomes. In PDAC, the stromal content can account for up to 90% of the total tumor volume. The complex interplay between stromal components, including pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts (PCAFs), and PDAC cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a significant impact on prognoses and thus needs to be recapitulated in vitro when evaluating various treatment strategies. This study is a systematic evaluation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in 3D heterotypic coculture models of PDAC with varying ratios of patient derived PCAFs that simulate heterogenous PDAC tumors with increasing stromal content. The efficacy of antibody-targeted PDT (photoimmunotherapy; PIT) using cetuximab photoimmunoconjugates (PICs) of benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) is contrasted with that of liposomal BPD (Visudyne(R)), which is currently in PDT clinical trials for PDAC. We demonstrate that both Visudyne(R)-PDT and PIT were effective in heterotypic PDAC 3D spheroids with a low stromal content. However, as the stromal content increases above 50% in the 3D spheroids, the efficacy of Visudyne(R)-PDT is reduced by up to 10-fold, while PIT retains its efficacy. PIT was found to be 10-fold, 19-fold and 14-fold more phototoxic in spheroids with 50%, 75% and 90% PCAFs, respectively, as compared to Visudyne(R)-PDT. This marked difference in efficacy is attributed to the ability of PICs to penetrate and distribute within spheroids with a higher stromal content, whereas Visudyne(R) is restricted to the spheroid periphery. This study thus demonstrates how the stromal content in PDAC spheroids directly impacts their responsiveness to PDT and proposes PIT to be a highly suited treatment option for desmoplastic tumors with particularly high degrees of stromal content.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality and is hypothesized to contribute to PCa aggressiveness and disparities in African American populations. The prostate epithelium was recently shown to express megalin, an endocytic receptor that internalizes globulin-bound hormones, which suggests regulation of prostate hormone levels, in contrast to the free hormone hypothesis. Here, we demonstrated that megalin imports testosterone bound to sex hormone-binding globulin into prostate cells. Prostatic loss of Lrp2 (megalin) in a mouse model resulted in reduced prostate testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. Megalin expression was regulated and suppressed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) in cell lines, patient-derived prostate epithelial cells, and prostate tissue explants, indicating a negative feedback loop. In patent samples, the relationships between hormones support this feedback mechanism, as prostatic DHT levels are higher in African American men and are inversely correlated with serum 25D status. Megalin levels are reduced in localized PCa by the Gleason grade and in patients with future disease recurrence. Our findings suggest that the free hormone hypothesis should be revisited for testosterone and highlight the impact of vitamin D deficiency on prostate androgen levels, which are known drivers of PCa. Thus, we revealed a mechanistic link between vitamin D and PCa disparities observed in African Americans.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer has a high recurrence rate and low survival of advanced stage patients. Few genetic drivers of bladder cancer have thus far been identified. We performed in-depth structural variant analysis on whole-genome sequencing data of 206 metastasized urinary tract cancers. In ~10% of the patients, we identified recurrent in-frame deletions of exons 8 and 9 in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor gene (AHR{Delta}e8-9), which codes for a ligand-activated transcription factor. Pan-cancer analyses show that AHR{Delta}e8-9 is highly specific to urinary tract cancer and mutually exclusive with other bladder cancer drivers. In AHR{Delta}e8-9 the ligand-binding domain is disrupted and we show that this results in ligand-independent AHR-pathway activation. In bladder organoids, AHR{Delta}e8-9 induces a transformed phenotype that is characterized by upregulation of AHR target genes, downregulation of differentiation markers and upregulation of genes associated with stemness and urothelial cancer. Furthermore, AHR{Delta}e8-9 expression results in anchorage independent growth of bladder organoids, indicating tumorigenic potential. DNA-binding deficient AHR{Delta}e8-9 fails to induce transformation, suggesting a role for AHR target genes in the acquisition of the oncogenic phenotype. In conclusion, we show that AHR{Delta}e8-9 is a novel driver of urinary tract cancer and that the AHR pathway could be an interesting therapeutic target.",

Optical test target, euthanized mice and rats, and live mice were used as objects.\n\nResultsThe results of optical test target showed that the spatial resolution was about 2 times higher than that of our conventional prototype. The image performance in vivo was evaluated in euthanized healthy mice and rats, allowing visualization of detailed blood vessels in the liver and kidneys. In tumor-bearing mice, different results of vascular induction were shown depending on the type of tumor and the method of transplantation. By utilizing the video imaging function, we were able to observe the movement of blood vessels around the tumor.\n\nConclusionWe have demonstrated the feasibility of the system as a less invasive animal experimental device, as it can acquire vascular images in animals in a non-contrast and non-invasive manner.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer has a relentless tendency to come back after treatment. Analyses of public data from about 2100 breast cancers produce a model that explains this recurrence and implicates variants of Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV or Human Herpes Virus 4). These viruses cause chromosome breaks. Broken chromosome pieces rejoin abnormally, sometimes including two centromeres. Two centromeres on the same chromosome interfere with cell division. Each centromere gets pulled toward a different pole. This mechanical stress shatters chromosomes. Shattered chromosome fragments rejoin arbitrarily, but showers of mutations accompany their rejoining. In this way, a single break can destabilize the entire genome. The breast cancer phenotype is not fixed and constantly creates new cancer driver genes. The phenotype becomes independent of the original virus and its dosage. Cancer comes back because treatment does not explicitly target the underlying breakage-rejoining cycles or the contributing virus.\n\nThe following data support this model. EBV causes chromosome breaks, and breast cancer chromosomes often have two centromeres. Breast cancer breakpoints on all chromosomes aggregate around the same positions as breakpoints in cancers definitively associated with EBV infection (nasopharyngeal cancer and endemic Burkitts lymphoma). Rejoined boundaries of highly fragmented chromosomes characteristic of breakage fusion cycles cluster around viral sequences. There is presumptive evidence of past infection. Human EBV sequences distribute like retrovirus transposons near dense piRNA clusters at a critical MHC-immune response region of chromosome 6. Other viruses strongly resemble endogenous transposons which piRNAs inactivate by methylation and cleavage. Remnants of exogenous EBV variants sit close to inactive transposons in piRNA sandwiches. The arrangement grossly resembles bacterial CRISPR and adds a layer of DNA protection to the immune system. Breast cancers target this protection with chromosome breaks and mutations and have a distinctive methylation signature nearby. Finally, areas near EBV docking sites can have increased numbers of breaks.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467751v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@abc058org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e0ffe9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c13bc9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c16d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Scatter-hoarding decisions by rodents are key for the long-term maintenance of scattered tree populations. Decisions are determined by seed value, competition and predation risk, so that they can be influenced by the integrity of the biological system composed by trees, rodents, ungulate competitors, and rodent predators. We manipulate and model the oak-mice interaction in a Spanish dehesa, an anthropogenic savanna system suffering chronic tree regeneration failure, and quantify the joint effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on acorn dispersal effectiveness. First, we conducted a large-scale cafeteria field experiment, where we modified ungulate presence and predation risk, and followed mouse scatter-hoarding decisions under contrasting levels of moonlight and acorn availability. Then, we estimated the net effects of competition and risk by means of transition probability models that simulated mouse scatter-hoarding decisions according to the environmental context. Our results show that suboptimal conditions for mice balance the interaction towards the mutualism as they force mice to forage less efficiently. Under stressful conditions (predation risks and presence of ungulates), lack of antipredatory cover around dehesa trees limited transportation of acorns, but also precluded mice activities outside tree canopies. As a result, post-dispersal predation rates were reduced and large acorns had a higher probability to survive. Our work shows that inter-specific interactions preventing efficient foraging by scatter-hoarders benefitted seed dispersal. Therefore, the maintenance of the full set of producers, consumers, dispersers and predators in ecosystems is key for promoting seed dispersal effectiveness in conditional mutualisms.",

Antioxidant enzymes activities including catalase, peroxidase and peroxidase were measured through different antioxidant assays and different antioxidant metabolites were also determined. During stress condition antioxidant metabolites serve as signal for the activation of antioxidant enzymes.

    "abstract": "Spatial analyses can reveal important interactions between and among cells and their microenvironment. However, most existing staining methods are limited to a handful of markers per slice, thereby limiting the number of interactions that can be studied. This limitation is frequently overcome by registering multiple images to create a single composite image containing many markers. While there are several existing image registration methods for whole slide images (WSI), most have specific use cases. Here, we present the Virtual Alignment of pathoLogy Image Series (VALIS), a fully automated pipeline that opens, registers (rigid and/or non-rigid), and saves aligned slides in the ome.tiff format. VALIS has been tested with 273 immunohistochemistry (IHC) samples and 340 immunofluorescence (IF) samples, each of which contained between 2-69 images per sample. The registered WSI tend to have low error and are completed within a matter of minutes. In addition to registering slides, VALIS can also using the registration parameters to warp point data, such as cell centroids previously determined via cell segmentation and phenotyping. VALIS is written in Python and requires only few lines of code for execution. VALIS therefore provides a free, opensource, flexible, and simple pipeline for rigid and non-rigid registration of IF and/or IHC that can facilitate spatial analyses of WSI from novel and existing datasets.",

The heterogeneous cellular composition of isolated PDM as well as autologous TILs was analyzed by FFPE immunohistochemistry and multi-color flow cytometry, respectively. For in-depth protein profiling of PDM we established Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analyses of >110 total and phospho-proteins. Treatment efficacy in response to chemotherapeutics as well as immunotherapeutic compounds was assessed in PDM and PDM-TIL co-cultures using a functional viability assay in microplate format.\n\nResultsThe enzymatic digestion of primary ovarian cancer tissue and suspension culture in defined serum-free media allowed fast and efficient recovery of patient-derived microtumors (PDM). Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated histopathological comparability of ovarian cancer PDM with corresponding patient tumor tissue. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA)-based analyses of >110 total and phospho-proteins enabled the identification of patient-specific sensitivities to standard, platinum-based therapy and thereby the prediction of potential treatment-responders. Finally, combining PDM and autologous TILs for individual efficacy testing of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment demonstrated the potential for patient-specific enhancement of cytotoxic TIL activity by this therapeutic approach.\n\nConclusion3D patient-derived ovarian cancer microtumors represent a preclinical, ex vivo tumor model that reflects intertumoral heterogeneity and represent the cellular complexity of individual patient tumors. Combining protein pathway analysis and anti-cancer drug efficacy testing of PDM enables drug mode-of-action analyses and therapeutic sensitivity prediction within a clinically relevant time frame after surgery. Follow-up studies in larger cohorts are currently under way to further evaluate the applicability of this platform to support clinical decision-making and personalizing cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ethiopia is recognized as a center of diversity for barley, and its landraces are known for the distinct genetic features compared to other barley collections. The genetic diversity of Ethiopian barley likely results from the highly diverse topography, altitude, climate conditions, soil types, and farming systems. To get detailed information on the genetic diversity a panel of 260 accessions, comprising 239 landraces and 21 barley breeding lines, obtained from the Ethiopian biodiversity institute (EBI) and the national barley improvement program, respectively were studied for their genetic diversity using the 50k iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 983 highly informative SNP markers were used for structure and diversity analysis. Three genetically distinct clusters were obtained from the structure analysis comprising 80, 71, and 109 accessions, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed the presence of higher genetic variation (89%) within the clusters than between the clusters (11%), with moderate genetic differentiation (PhiPT=0.11) and adequate gene flow (Nm=2.02). The Mantel test revealed that the genetic distance between accessions is poorly associated with their geographical distance. Despite the observed weak correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation, for some regions like Gonder, Jimma, Gamo-Gofa, Shewa, and Welo, more than 50% of the landraces derived from these regions are assigned to one of the three clusters.",
