    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to significant public health, economic and social problems. Development of effective vaccines is still a priority to contain the virus and end the global pandemic. In this study, we reported that ReCOV, a recombinant trimeric NTD and RBD two-component SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine adjuvanted with BFA03 (an AS03-like squalene adjuvant), induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the circulating variants in mice, rabbits and rhesus macaques. Notably, two-dose immunizations of ReCOV provided complete protection against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice and rhesus macaques, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. These results support further clinical development of ReCOV and the vaccine is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in New Zealand (NCT04818801).",

    "abstract": "We apply the theory of learning to physically renormalizable systems in an attempt to develop a theory of biological evolution, including the origin of life, as multilevel learning. We formulate seven fundamental principles of evolution that appear to be necessary and sufficient to render a universe observable and show that they entail the major features of biological evolution, including replication and natural selection. These principles also follow naturally from the theory of learning. We formulate the theory of evolution using the mathematical framework of neural networks, which provides for detailed analysis of evolutionary phenomena. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed theoretical framework, we derive a generalized version of the Central Dogma of molecular biology by analyzing the flow of information during learning (back-propagation) and predicting (forward-propagation) the environment by evolving organisms. The more complex evolutionary phenomena, such as major transitions in evolution, in particular, the origin of life, have to be analyzed in the thermodynamic limit, which is described in detail in the accompanying paper.\n\nSignificance statementModern evolutionary theory gives a detailed quantitative description of microevolutionary processes that occur within evolving populations of organisms, but evolutionary transitions and emergence of multiple levels of complexity remain poorly understood. Here we establish correspondence between the key features of evolution, renormalizability of physical theories and learning dynamics, to outline a theory of evolution that strives to incorporate all evolutionary processes within a unified mathematical framework of the theory of learning. Under this theory, for example, natural selection readily arises from the learning dynamics, and in sufficiently complex systems, the same learning phenomena occur on multiple levels or on different scales, similar to the case of renormalizable physical theories.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAlthough the link between microbial infections and Alzheimers disease (AD) has been demonstrated in multiple studies, the involvement of pathogens in the development of AD remains unclear. Therefore, this theory beckons further systematic investigation. In this study, we have examined the association between the 10 most widely discussed viral and bacterial pathogens found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with AD.\n\nMethodsWe have used an in-house developed multiplex PCR kit for simultaneous detection of five bacterial and five viral pathogens in serum and CSF from 50 AD patients and 53 healthy controls. Data analysis was performed with multiple statistical methods: Fishers exact test, chisquare goodness of fit test, and one-sample proportion test.\n\nResultsWe observed an increased frequency of AD patients tested positive for Treponema spp. (AD: 62.2%; CTRL: 30.3%; p-value = 0.007). Furthermore, we confirmed a significantly higher prevalence of cases with two and more simultaneous infections in AD patients compared to controls (AD: 24%; CTRL 7.5%; p-value = 0.029). The studied pathogens were widespread equally in serum and CSF. Borrelia burgdorferi, human herpesvirus 7, and human cytomegalovirus were not detected in any of the studied samples.\n\nDiscussionAn increased prevalence of Treponema spp. and double-species infections in AD patients compared to the healthy controls provides further evidence of the association between microbial infections and AD. Paralleled analysis of multiple sample specimens provides complementary information and is advisable for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrogliomas are a subtype of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant gliomas defined by the co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. Although the somatic genomic alterations of oligodendrogliomas have been well described, transcriptional changes unique to these tumors are not well studied. Here, we identify Tripartite Motif Containing 67 (TRIM67), an E3 ubiquitin ligase with essential roles during neuronal development, as an oncogene distinctly upregulated in oligodendrogliomas. We characterize the function of TRIM67 using high throughput assays, including RNA sequencing, total lysate-mass spectrometry (MS) and co-immunoprecipitation (IP)-MS using human neural progenitor cells and patient-derived glioma tumorspheres constitutively overexpressing TRIM67. Our high throughput data suggest that TRIM67 overexpression alters the abundance of cytoskeletal proteins, which were validated by functional assays, including immunofluorescence (IF) staining, co-IP and western blotting (WB). Additionally, IF staining results indicate that TRIM67 ectopic expression induces formation of membrane blebs in glioma cells, which could be reverted with the nonmuscle class II myosin inhibitor blebbistatin and selective ROCK inhibitor fasudil. GTP pulldown and WB assays further indicate that Rho GTPase/ROCK2 signaling is altered upon TRIM67 ectopic expression. Phenotypically, TRIM67 expression resulted in higher cell motility in wound healing experiments, reduced cell adherence in adhesion assays, accelerated tumor growth and reduced survival in mouse orthotopic implantation models of an oligodendroglioma-derived patient tumorsphere line. Taken together, our results demonstrate that upregulated TRIM67 induces blebbing-based rounded cell morphology through Rho GTPase/ROCK-mediated signaling thereby contributing to glioma pathogenesis.\n\nSignificanceWe identify TRIM67 as a novel oncogene in oligodendroglioma that leads to increased cell motility, tumor growth, reduced adhesion, and survival in mice. Our results also show that constitutive TRIM67 expression transforms cell morphology from an adherent to a rounded appearance with membrane blebs. Mechanistic alteration of actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPase signaling upon TRIM67 upregulation underlies the rounded cell structure and the membrane blebbing phenotype. TRIM67-induced blebbing is specifically regulated by RHOA-RAC1-ROCK2 signaling axis. TRIM67 overexpression also alters pathways associated with cell migration and wound healing in various glioma cell lines and human neural progenitor cells, suggesting a general oncogenic mechanism in gliomas. Overall, our study highlights TRIM67 as a novel player orchestrating cytoskeleton, Rho GTPase signaling and bleb-based cell movement, ultimately causing tumorigenic outcomes in oligodendrogliomas.",

    "abstract": "The HD-GYP domain, named after two of its conserved sequence motifs, was first described in 1999 as a specialized version of the widespread HD phosphohydrolase domain that had additional highly conserved amino acid residues. Domain associations of HD-GYP indicated its involvement in bacterial signal transduction and distribution patterns of this domain suggested that it could serve as a hydrolase of the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP, in addition to or instead of the EAL domain. Subsequent studies confirmed the ability of various HD-GYP domains to hydrolyze c-di-GMP to linear pGpG and/or GMP. Certain HD-GYP-containing proteins hydrolyze another second messenger, cGAMP, and some HD-GYP domains participate in regulatory protein-protein interactions. The recently solved structures of HD-GYP domains from four distinct organisms clarified the mechanisms of c-di-GMP binding and metal-assisted hydrolysis. However, the HD-GYP domain is poorly represented in public domain databases, which causes certain confusion about its phylogenic distribution, functions, and domain architectures. Here, we present a refined sequence model for the HD-GYP domain and describe the roles of its most conserved residues in metal and/or substrate binding. We also calculate the numbers of HD-GYPs encoded in various genomes and list the most common domain combinations involving HD-GYP, such as the RpfG (REC-HD-GYP), Bd1817 (DUF3391- HD-GYP), and PmGH (GAF-HD-GYP) protein families. We also provide the descriptions of six HD-GYP-associated domains, including four novel integral membrane sensor domains. This work is expected to stimulate studies of diverse HD-GYP-containing proteins, their N-terminal sensor domains and the signals to which they respond.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe HD-GYP domain forms class II of c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases that control the cellular levels of the universal bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP and therefore affect flagellar and/or twitching motility, cell development, biofilm formation, and, often, virulence. Despite more than 20 years of research, HD-GYP domains are insufficiently characterized; they are often confused with  classical HD domains that are involved in various housekeeping activities and may participate in signaling, hydrolyzing (p)ppGpp and c-di-AMP. This work provides an updated description of the HD-GYP domain, including its sequence conservation, phylogenetic distribution, domain architectures, and the most widespread HD-GYP-containing protein families. This work shows that HD-GYP domains are widespread in many environmental bacteria and are predominant c-di-GMP hydrolases in many lineages, including clostridia and deltaproteobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Peronospora effusa causes downy mildew, the economically most important disease of cultivated spinach worldwide. To date, 19 P. effusa races have been denominated based on their capacity to break spinach resistances, but their genetic diversity and the evolutionary processes that contribute to race emergence are unknown. Here, we performed the first systematic analysis of P. effusa races showing that those emerge by both asexual and sexual reproduction. Specifically, we studied the diversity of 26 P. effusa isolates from 16 denominated races based on mitochondrial and nuclear comparative genomics. Mitochondrial genomes based on long-read sequencing coupled with diversity assessment based on short-read sequencing uncovered two mitochondrial haplogroups, each with distinct genome organization. Nuclear genome-wide comparisons of the 26 isolates revealed that ten isolates from six races could clearly be divided into three asexually evolving groups, in concordance with their mitochondrial phylogeny. The remaining isolates showed signals of reticulated evolution and discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies, suggesting that these evolved through sexual reproduction. Increased understanding of this pathogens reproductive modes will provide the framework for future studies into the molecular mechanisms underlying race emergence and into the P. effusa-spinach interaction, thus assisting in sustainable production of spinach through knowledge-driven resistance breeding.\n\nSignificance statementMany microbial plant pathogens depend on the successful colonization of their hosts to complete their life cycle, thereby damaging food crops worldwide. The most effective way of disease control is to deploy genetic disease resistances. However, the extensive use of resistant crop varieties exerts strong selective pressure on microbial plant pathogens to adapt in order to escape resistance. Through yet unknown mechanisms, the spinach pathogen Peronospora effusa can rapidly break the resistance of newly introduced varieties, often within a single growing season. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms driving adaptation in P. effusa. This information will lead the way to knowledge-driven resistance breeding. Here, we capture for the first time the genetic variation of 26 P. effusa, 16 of which can break a different combination of host resistances. We demonstrate that P. effusa isolates evolve by both asexual and sexual reproduction, and thereby provide the framework to study the molecular mechanisms of the interactions between P. effusa and spinach.",

    "abstract": "The optic tectum (OT) is a multilaminated midbrain structure that acts as the primary retinorecipient in the zebrafish brain. Homologous to the mammalian superior colliculus, the OT is responsible for the reception and integration of stimuli, followed by elicitation of salient behavioral responses. While the OT has been the focus of functional experiments for decades, less is known concerning specific cell types, microcircuitry, and their individual functions within the OT. Recent efforts have contributed substantially to the knowledge of tectal cell types; however, a comprehensive cell catalog is incomplete. Here we contribute to this growing effort by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptomic profiles of tectal cells labeled by the transgenic enhancer trap line y304Et(cfos:Gal4;UAS:Kaede). We sequenced 13,320 cells, a 4X cellular coverage, and identified 25 putative OT cell populations. Within those cells, we identified several mature and developing neuronal populations, as well as non-neuronal cell types including oligodendrocytes, microglia, and radial glia. Although most mature neurons demonstrate GABAergic activity, several glutamatergic populations are present, as well as one glycinergic population. We also conducted Gene Ontology analysis to identify enriched biological processes, and computed RNA velocity to infer current and future transcriptional cell states. Finally, we conducted in situ hybridization to validate our bioinformatic analyses and spatially map select clusters. In conclusion, the larval zebrafish OT is a complex structure containing at least 25 transcriptionally distinct cell populations. To our knowledge, this is the first time scRNA-seq has been applied to explore the OT alone and in depth.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for animal models of COVID-19 to study immunopathogenesis and test therapeutic intervenes. In this study we showed that NSG mice engrafted with human lung (HL) tissue (NSG-L mice) could be infected efficiently by SARS-CoV-2, and that live virus capable of infecting Vero cells was found in the HL grafts and multiple organs from infected NSG-L mice. RNA-seq examination identified a series of differentially expressed genes, which are enriched in viral defense responses, chemotaxis, interferon stimulation, and pulmonary fibrosis between HL grafts from infected and control NSG-L mice. Furthermore, when infecting humanized mice with human immune system (HIS) and autologous HL grafts (HISL mice), the mice had bodyweight loss and hemorrhage and immune cell infiltration in HL grafts, which were not observed in immunodeficient NSG-L mice, indicating the development of anti-viral immune responses in these mice. In support of this possibility, the infected HISL mice showed bodyweight recovery and lack of detectable live virus at the later time. These results demonstrate that NSG-L and HISL mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, offering a useful in vivo model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated immune response and immunopathology, and testing anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies.",

    "abstract": "Particulate organic matter (POM) in the ocean sustains diverse communities of bacteria that mediate the remineralization of organic complex matter. However, the variability of these particles and of the environmental conditions surrounding them present a challenge to the study of the ecological processes shaping particle-associated communities and their function. In this work, we utilise data from experiments in which coastal water communities were grown on synthetic particles to ask which are the most important ecological drivers of their assembly and associated traits. Combining 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with shotgun metagenomics, together with an analysis of the full genomes of a subset of isolated strains, we were able to identify two-to-three distinct community classes, corresponding to early vs. late colonizers. We show that these classes are shaped by environmental selection (early colonizers) and facilitation (late colonizers), and find distinctive traits associated with each class. While early colonizers have a larger proportion of genes related to uptake of nutrients, motility and environmental sensing with few pathways enriched for metabolism, late colonizers devote a higher proportion of genes for metabolism, comprising a wide array of different pathways including metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and xenobiotics We find evidence in selected metabolic pathways for the existence of a trophic-chain topology connecting both classes. The interpretation of these traits suggests a distinction between early and late colonizers analogous to other classifications found in the literature, and we discuss connections with the classical distinction between r- and K-strategists.",

Ablation of the core clock within the endocrine pancreas of adult animals impairs the transcription and splicing of genes involved in hormone exocytosis and causes hypoinsulinemic diabetes. However, identification of druggable proteins and pathways to ameliorate the burden of circadian metabolic disease remains a challenge. Here, we generated {beta} cells expressing a nano-luciferase reporter within the proinsulin polypeptide to screen 2,640 pharmacologically-active compounds and identify insulinotropic molecules that bypass the secretory defect in clock mutant {beta} cells. We validated lead compounds in primary mouse islets and identified known modulators of ligandgated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors, including the antihelmintic ivermectin. Single-cell electrophysiology in circadian mutant mouse and human cadaveric islets validated ivermectin as a glucose-dependent secretagogue. Genetic, genomic, and pharmacologic analyses established that the molecular clock controls the expression of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor to mediate the insulinotropic activity of ivermectin. These findings identify the P2Y1 purinergic receptor as a target to rescue circadian {beta}-cell failure and establish a chemical genetic screen for endocrine therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin state undergoes global and dynamic changes during spermatogenesis, and is critical to chromosomal synapsis, meiotic recombination, and transcriptional regulation. However, the key regulators involved and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein we report that mouse BEND2, one of the BEN-domain-containing proteins conserved in vertebrates, was specifically expressed in spermatogenic cells within a short time-window spanning meiotic initiation, and that it plays an essential role in the progression of prophase in meiosis I. Bend2 gene knockout in male mice arrested meiosis at the transition from zygonema to pachynema, disrupted synapsis and DNA double-strand break repair, and induced non-homologous chromosomal pairing. BEND2 interacted with a number of chromatin-associated proteins--including ZMYM2, LSD1, CHD4, and ADNP-- which are components of certain transcription-repressor complexes. BEND2-binding sites were identified in diverse chromatin states and enriched in simple sequence repeats. BEND2 contributed to shutting down the mitotic gene-expression program and to the activation of meiotic and post-meiotic gene expression, and it regulated chromatin accessibility as well as the modification of H3K4me3. Therefore, our study identified BEND2 as a novel and key regulator of meiosis, gene expression, and chromatin state during mouse spermatogenesis.\n\nTeaserMeiosis is a highly complex yet poorly understood process that involves the concerted actions of an increasing number of regulators, of which the list remains incomplete. Ma et al. identified BEND2 as a novel and key regulator of meiosis and showed that it interacts with critical chromatin modulators and specific genomic elements to control the expression of mitotic and meiotic genes.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic basis of repeatedly evolved traits provides a way to reconstruct their evolutionary history and ultimately investigate the predictability of evolution. Here, we focus on the oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus), which occurs in the southeastern United States, where it exhibits considerable coat-color variation. Dorsal coats range from dark brown in mice inhabiting mainland habitat to near white on the white-sand beaches of the southeastern US, where light pelage has evolved independently on Floridas Gulf and Atlantic coasts as an adaptation to visually hunting predators. To facilitate genomic analyses in this species, we first generated a high-quality, chromosome-level genome assembly of P. polionotus subgriseus. Next, in a uniquely variable mainland population that occurs near beach habitat (P. p. albifrons), we scored 23 pigment traits and performed targeted resequencing in 168 mice. We find that variation in pigmentation is strongly associated with a ~2 kb region approximately 5 kb upstream of the Agouti-signaling protein (ASIP) coding region. Using a reporter-gene assay, we demonstrate that this regulatory region contains an enhancer that drives expression in the dermis of mouse embryos during the establishment of pigment prepatterns. Moreover, extended tracts of homozygosity in this region of Agouti indicate that the light allele has experienced recent and strong positive selection. Notably, this same light allele appears fixed in both Gulf and Atlantic coast beach mice, despite these populations being separated by >1,000km. Given the evolutionary history of this species, our results suggest that this newly identified Agouti enhancer allele has been maintained in mainland populations as standing genetic variation and from there has spread to, and been selected in, two independent beach mouse lineages, thereby facilitating their rapid and parallel evolution.",

    "abstract": "Humans present remarkable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant mosaicism, not only across tissues but even across individual cells within one person. The timing of the first appearance of this mosaicism has not yet been established. In this study, we hypothesized it occurs during preimplantation development. To investigate this, we deep-sequenced the mtDNA of 254 oocytes from 85 donors, 158 single blastomeres of 25 day-3 embryos, 17 inner cell mass and trophectoderm samples of 7 day-5 blastocysts, 142 bulk DNA and 68 single cells of different adult tissues. We found that day-3 preimplantation embryos already present blastomeres that carry variants unique to that cell, showing that the first events of mtDNA mosaicism happen very early in human development. We classified the mtDNA variants based on their recurrence or uniqueness across sibling oocytes and embryos, and between single cells and samples from the same embryos or adult individuals. Variants that recurred across samples had higher heteroplasmic loads and more frequently resulted in synonymous changes or were located in non-coding regions than variants that were unique to one oocyte or single embryonic cell. These differences were maintained through developmental stages, suggesting that the mtDNA mosaicism arising in preimplantation development is maintained into adulthood. Further, the results support a model in which close clustering of mitochondria carrying specific mtDNA variants in the ooplasm leads to asymmetric distribution of these mitochondria throughout the cell divisions of the preimplantation embryo, resulting in the appearance of the first form of mtDNA mosaicism in human development.",

    "abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWAS), aiming to find genetic variants associated with a trait, have widely been used on bacteria to identify genetic determinants of drug resistance or hypervirulence. Recent bacterial GWAS methods usually rely on k-mers, whose presence in a genome can denote variants ranging from single nucleotide polymorphisms to mobile genetic elements. Since many bacterial species include genes that are not shared among all strains, this approach avoids the reliance on a common reference genome. However, the same gene can exist in slightly different versions across different strains, leading to diluted effects when trying to detect its association to a phenotype through k-mer based GWAS. Here we propose to overcome this by testing covariates built from closed connected subgraphs of the De Bruijn graph defined over genomic k-mers. These covariates are able to capture polymorphic genes as a single entity, improving k-mer based GWAS in terms of power and interpretability. As the number of subgraphs is exponential in the number of nodes in the DBG, a method naively testing all possible subgraphs would result in very low statistical power due to multiple testing corrections, and the mere exploration of these subgraphs would quickly become computationally intractable. The concept of testable hypothesis has successfully been used to address both problems in similar contexts. We leverage this concept to test all closed connected subgraphs by proposing a novel enumeration scheme for these objects which fully exploits the pruning opportunity offered by testability, resulting in drastic improvements in computational efficiency. We illustrate this on both real and simulated datasets and also demonstrate how considering subgraphs leads to a more powerful and interpretable method. Our method integrates with existing visual tools to facilitate interpretation. We also provide an implementation of our method, as well as code to reproduce all results at https://github.com/HectorRDB/Caldera_Recomb.",

Here, we make advancements to the RT moiety to improve prime editing efficiencies and truncations to mitigate issues with AAV viral vector size limitations, which currently do not support efficient delivery of the large prime editing components. These efforts include RT variant screening, codon optimization, and PE truncation by removal of the RNase H domain and further trimming. This led to a codon-optimized and size-minimized PE that has an expression advantage (1.4x fold) and size advantage (621 bp shorter). In addition, we optimize the split intein PE system and identify Rma-based Cas9 split sites (573-574 and 673-674) that combined with the truncated PE delivered by dual AAVs result in superior AAV titer and prime editing efficiency. This novel minimized PE provides great value to AAV-based delivery applications in vivo.",

Critical in regulating these regulators are a patchwork of mechanisms, including post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as MEK-mediated phosphorylation. Here, we discover that ERK1/2 are subject to S-palmitoylation, a reversible lipid modification of cysteine residues, at C271/C254. Moreover, the levels of ERK1/2 S-acylation are modulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, mirroring its phosphorylation dynamics, and palmitoylation-deficient ERK2 displays altered phosphorylation patterns at key sites. We find that chemical inhibition of either lipid addition or removal significantly alters ERK1/2s EGF-triggered transcriptional program. We also identify a subset of \"writer\" protein acyl transferases (PATs) and an \"eraser\" acyl protein thioesterase (APT) that drive ERK1/2s cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation. Finally, we examine ERK1/2 S-acylation in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome, correlating changes in its lipidation levels with alterations in writer/eraser expression and solidifying the link between ERK1/2 activity, ERK1/2 lipidation, and organismal health. This study not only presents a previously undescribed mode of ERK1/2 regulation and a node to modulate MAPK pathway signaling in pathophysiological conditions, it also offers insight into the role of dynamic S-palmitoylation in cell signaling more generally.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas wilt (XW) of banana caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm) does not spread to all plants physically interconnected through the rhizome when one or a few are diseased. However, the factors behind this incomplete systemic spread of Xvm are not fully known yet could inform XW management. This study explored the effect of Xvm inoculum amounts, number and size of suckers, sucker positioning on mother plant corms and other mother plant corm attributes on sucker colonization. A shorter (p <0.05) incubation period (17.9 vs 21.1 days) and higher (p<.001) cumulative number of symptomatic leaves (5.2 vs 1.6 leaves) was observed when all (high inoculum) compared to two leaves (low inoculum) were inoculated. Xvm was recovered in corms at 29 days post inoculation (dpi) in both treatments with no differences (p >0.05) in proportions of corms with Xvm between the treatments. However, Xvm was recovered earlier and at a higher frequency in suckers when all leaves were inoculated. Lower Xvm recoveries occurred in the lower corm sections to which most suckers were attached relative to the middle and upper corm sections. Xvm incidence in corms increased with the number of attached maiden suckers, and the dpi while it declined with increasing mother plant and corm height. Thus, Xvm spread within mats is influenced by the amount of inoculum and the physiological stage (e.g., height) of the plant and attached suckers. The position of suckers, predominantly at the bottom of corms also protects them from infection. Measures that reduce Xvm inoculum build-up in mats are thus crucial for minimizing within mat XW spread.",

    "abstract": "Brilacidin, a mimetic of host defense peptides (HDPs), is currently in phase 2 clinical trial as an antibiotic drug candidate. A recent study reported that brilacidin has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating the virus. In this work, we discovered an additional mechanism of action of brilacidin by targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on host cell surface. Brilacidin, but not acetyl brilacidin, inhibits the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into multiple cell lines, and heparin, a HSPG mimetic, abolishes the inhibitory activity of brilacidin on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry. In addition, we found that brilacidin has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple human coronaviruses (HCoVs) including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63. Mechanistic studies revealed that brilacidin has a dual antiviral mechanism of action including virucidal activity and binding to coronavirus attachment factor HSPGs on host cell surface. Brilacidin partially loses its antiviral activity when heparin was included in the cell cultures, supporting the host-targeting mechanism. Drug combination therapy showed that brilacidin has a strong synergistic effect with remdesivir against HCoV-OC43 in cell culture. Taken together, this study provides appealing findings for the translational potential of brilacidin as a broad-spectrum antiviral for coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 encodes two viral cysteine proteases, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro), both of which are validated antiviral drug targets. The PLpro is involved in the cleavage of viral polyproteins as well as immune modulation through removing ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from host proteins. Therefore, targeting PLpro might be a two-pronged approach. Several compounds including YM155, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, dihydrotanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, SJB2-043, 6-thioguanine, and 6-mercaptopurine were recently identified as SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors through high-throughput screening. In this study, we aim to validate/invalidate the reported PLpro inhibitors using a combination of PLpro target specific assays including enzymatic FRET assay, thermal shift binding assay (TSA), and the cell based FlipGFP assay. Collectively, our results showed that all compounds tested either did not show binding or led to denaturation of the PLpro in the TSA binding assay, which might explain their weak enzymatic inhibition in the FRET assay. In addition, none of the compounds showed cellular inhibition of PLpro as revealed by the FlipGFP assay. Therefore, more efforts are needed to search for specific and potent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors.",

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are the principal chemosensors in the GI tract, but investigation of their role in behavior has been limited by the difficulty of selectively targeting these cells in vivo. Here we describe an intersectional genetic approach for manipulating EEC subtypes in behaving mice. We show that multiple EEC subtypes inhibit food intake but have different effects on learning. Conditioned flavor preference is driven by release of cholecystokinin whereas conditioned taste aversion is mediated by serotonin and substance P. These positive and negative valence signals are transmitted by vagal and spinal afferents, respectively.

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic genes encoding functionally related proteins are often clustered in operons. The compact structure of operons allows for co-transcription of the genes, and for co-translation of the polycistronic messenger RNA to the corresponding proteins. This leads to reduced regulatory complexity and enhanced gene expression efficiency, and as such to an overall metabolic benefit for the protein production process in bacteria and archaea. Interestingly, the genes encoding the subunits of one of the most conserved and ubiquitous protein complexes, the RNA polymerase, are not clustered in a single operon. Rather, its genes are scattered in all known prokaryotic genomes, generally integrated in different ribosomal operons. To analyze the impact of this genetic organization on the fitness of Escherichia coli, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome harboring the genes encoding the RNA polymerase complex in a single operon. Subsequent deletion of the native chromosomal genes led to a reduced growth on minimal medium. However, by using adaptive laboratory evolution the growth rate was restored to wild-type level. Hence, we show that a highly conserved genetic organization of core genes in a bacterium can be reorganized by a combination of design, construction and optimization, yielding a well-functioning synthetic genetic architecture.",

Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been suggested as important regulators of transcription factor activity, their contributions to the systemic immunopathologies observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection have remained unknown. Here, we employed a targeted single-cell RNA-seq approach to reveal lncRNAs differentially expressed in blood leukocytes during severe COVID-19. Our results uncover the lncRNA PIRAT as a major PU.1 feedback-regulator in monocytes, governing the production of the alarmins S100A8/A9 - key drivers of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Knockout and transgene expression, combined with chromatin-occupancy profiling characterized PIRAT as a nuclear decoy RNA, diverting the PU.1 transcription factor from alarmin promoters to dead-end pseudogenes in naive monocytes. NF{kappa}B-dependent PIRAT down-regulation during COVID-19 consequently releases a transcriptional brake, fueling alarmin production.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an endemic disease in Rwanda, but little is known about its prevalence and causative mycobacterial species. The disease causes tremendous losses in livestock and wildlife and remains a significant threat to public health.\n\nMaterials and methodsA cross-sectional study employing a systematic random sampling of cattle (n=300) with the collection of retropharyngeal lymph nodes and tonsils (n=300) irrespective of granulomatous lesions was carried out in six abattoirs to investigate the prevalence and identify mycobacterial species using culture, acid-fast bacteria staining, polymerase chain reaction, and GeneXpert assay. Individual risk factors and the origin of samples were analysed for association with the prevalence.\n\nFindingsOf the 300 samples, six were collected with visible TB-like lesions. Our findings demonstrated the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in 1.7% (5/300) of sampled slaughtered cattle. M. bovis was isolated from 1.3% (4/300) animals while one case was caused by a rifampicin-resistance (RR) M. tuberculosis. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were identified in 12.0% (36/300) of the sampled cattle. There were no significant associations between the prevalence and abattoir category, age, sex, and breeds of slaughtered cattle.\n\nConclusionsThis study is the first in Rwanda to isolate both M. bovis and RR M. tuberculosis in slaughtered cattle indicating that bTB is prevalent in Rwanda with a low prevalence. The isolation of RR M. tuberculosis from cattle indicates possible zooanthroponotic transmission of M. tuberculosis and close human-cattle contact. To protect humans against occupational zoonotic diseases, it is essential to control bTB in cattle and raise the awareness among all occupational groups as well as reinforce biosafety at the farm level and in the abattoirs.\n\nAuthors summaryTuberculosis in cattle (bTB) causes financial losses to livestock owners and is a disease transmissible to humans especially those with an occupational risk through exposure to infected animals and animal products. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of bTB and characterize the mycobacterial species from cattle slaughtered in the six abattoirs in Rwanda. Four M. bovis, as well as one rifampicin-resistant (RR) M. tuberculosis, were identified from slaughtered cattle and, thus, the apparent bTB prevalence was 1.7% (5/300). Likely, the RR M. tuberculosis isolate was mostly likely of human origin and transmitted to cattle during close human-cattle contact. It is therefore essential to control bTB in cattle and reinforce the protection of farmworkers and abattoir workers who are always exposed to infected animals.",

To support MM, Escherichia coli Nissle was engineered with the SIINFEKL epitope (OVA) and orally administered to C57BL/6 mice. The treatment elicited OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in the lamina propria and inhibited the growth of OVA-B16F10 tumors. Importantly, the administration of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) engineered with different T cell epitopes elicited epitope-specific T cells and inhibited tumor growth. Microbiome shotgun sequencing and TCR sequencing provided evidence that cross-reacting T cells were induced at the mucosal level and subsequently reached the tumor site.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEnteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is a predominant but neglected enteric pathogen implicated in infantile diarrhoea and nutrient malabsorption. There are no non-antibiotic approaches to dealing with persistent infection by these exceptional colonizers, which form copious biofilms. We screened the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box for chemical entities that inhibit EAEC biofilm formation.\n\nMethodologyWe used two EAEC strains, 042 and MND005E, in a medium-throughput crystal violet-based antibiofilm screen. Hits were confirmed in concentration-dependence, growth kinetic and time course assays and activity spectra were determined against a panel of genome-sequenced EAEC. Antibiofilm activity against isogenic EAEC mutants, molecular docking simulations and comparative genomic analysis were used to identify the mechanism of action of one hit.\n\nPrincipal findingsIn all, five compounds (1.25%) reproducibly inhibited biofilm accumulation by at least one strain by 30-85% while inhibiting growth by under 10%. Hits exhibited at least 10-fold greater antibiofilm activity than nitazoxanide, the only known EAEC biofilm inhibitor. Reflective of known EAEC heterogeneity, only one hit was active against both screen isolates, but three hits showed broad antibiofilm activity against a larger panel of strains. Mechanism of action studies point to the EAEC anti-aggregation protein (Aap), dispersin, as the target of compound MMV687800.\n\nConclusionsThis study identified five compounds not previously described as anti-adhesins or Gram-negative antibacterials with significant and specific EAEC antibiofilm activity. One molecule, MMV687800, targets the EAEC Aap. In vitro small-molecule inhibition of EAEC colonization opens a way to new therapeutic approaches to preventing and treating EAEC infection.\n\nAuthor summaryDiarrhoea accounts for over half a million deaths in children under five annually. It additionally contributes to childhood malnutrition as well as growth and development deficiencies, particularly in low-income countries. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) causes diarrhoea that is often persistent and can also contribute to growth deficiencies in young children. EAEC is a neglected pathogen that is often resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Small molecules that block EAEC colonization may hold the key to interfering with EAEC disease without promoting antimicrobial resistance. We screened the Medicines for Malaria Ventures Pathogen Box for chemicals that can interfere with EAEC biofilm formation, a key colonization indicator. Our screen identified five biofilm-inhibiting molecules that did not interfere with bacterial viability and therefore are unlikely to exert strong pressure for resistance. Molecular biology and computational investigations point to the EAEC anti-aggregative protein, also known as dispersin, as a possible target for one of these hit molecules. Optimizing EAEC antibiofilm hits will create templates that can be employed for resolving EAEC diarrhoea and related infections.",

    "abstract": "Aging is an irreversible process characterized by a progressive loss of homeostasis in cells, which often manifests as protein aggregates. Recently, it has been speculated that aggregates of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) may go through pathological transitions during aging and drive the progression of ageassociated neurodegenerative diseases. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system of aging, we find that P-bodies --an RBP granule that is formed and can be beneficial for cell growth during stress conditions -- naturally form during aging without any external stresses and an increase in P-body intensity is negatively correlated with the future lifespan of yeast cells. When mother cells transfer age-induced P-bodies to daughter cells, the mother cells extend lifespan, while the daughter cells grow poorly, suggesting that these age-induced P-bodies may be directly pathological. Furthermore, we find that suppressing acidification of the cytosol during aging slows down the increase in the intensity of P-body foci and extends lifespan. Our data suggest that acidification of the cytosol may facilitate the pathological transition of RBP granules during aging.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-mediated degradation of oocyte translational regulatory proteins is a conserved feature of the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, multiple translational regulatory proteins, including the TRIM-NHL RNA-binding protein LIN-41/Trim71 and the Pumilio-family RNA-binding proteins PUF-3 and PUF-11, are degraded during the OET. Degradation of each protein requires activation of the M-phase cyclin-dependent kinase CDK-1, is largely complete by the end of the first meiotic division and does not require the anaphase promoting complex (APC). However, only LIN-41 degradation requires the F-box protein SEL-10/FBW7/Cdc4p, the substrate recognition subunit of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This finding suggests that PUF-3 and PUF-11, which localize to LIN-41-containing ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), are independently degraded through the action of other factors and that the oocyte RNPs are disassembled in a concerted fashion during the OET. We develop and test the hypothesis that PUF-3 and PUF-11 are targeted for degradation by the proteasome-associated HECT-type ubiquitin ligase ETC-1/UBE3C/Hu15, which is broadly expressed in C. elegans. We find that several GFP-tagged fusion proteins that are degraded during the OET, including fusions with PUF-3, PUF-11, LIN-41, IFY-1/Securin and CYB-1/Cyclin B, are incompletely degraded when ETC-1 function is compromised. However, it is the fused GFP moiety that appears to be the critical determinant of this proteolysis defect. These findings are consistent with a conserved role for ETC-1 in promoting proteasome processivity and suggest that proteasomal processivity is an important element of the OET during which many key oocyte regulatory proteins are rapidly targeted for degradation.\n\nArticle SummaryThe ubiquitin-mediated degradation of translational regulatory RNA-binding proteins is a conserved feature of the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET). C. elegans LIN-41 is a master regulator of oogenesis and is found in a large translational regulatory ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with more than 1000 maternal transcripts and the Pumilio-family RNA-binding proteins PUF-3 and PUF-11. We show that the concerted action of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and proteasome processivity rapidly disassemble LIN-41-containing RNPs during the OET thereby relieving repression of many maternal transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Previous research indicates that the human genetic diversity found in Wallacea - islands in present-day Eastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste that were never part of the Sunda or Sahul continental shelves - has been shaped by complex interactions between migrating Austronesian farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherer communities. Here, we provide new insights into this regions demographic history based on genome-wide data from 16 ancient individuals (2600-250 yrs BP) from islands of the North Moluccas, Sulawesi, and East Nusa Tenggara. While the ancestry of individuals from the northern islands fit earlier views of contact between groups related to the Austronesian expansion and the first colonization of Sahul, the ancestry of individuals from the southern islands revealed additional contributions from Mainland Southeast Asia, which seems to predate the Austronesian admixture in the region. Admixture time estimates for the oldest individuals of Wallacea are closer to archaeological estimates for the Austronesian arrival into the region than are admixture time estimates for present-day groups. The decreasing trend in admixture times exhibited by younger individuals supports a scenario of multiple or continuous admixture involving Papuan- and Asian-related groups. Our results clarify previously debated times of admixture and suggest that the Neolithic dispersals into Island Southeast Asia are associated with the spread of multiple genetic ancestries.",

    "abstract": "Carboxysomes are proteinaceous organelles that encapsulate key enzymes of CO2 fixation - Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase - and are the centerpiece of the bacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM). In the CCM, actively accumulated cytosolic bicarbonate diffuses into the carboxysome and is converted to CO2 by carbonic anhydrase, producing a high CO2 concentration near Rubisco and ensuring efficient carboxylation. Self-assembly of the -carboxysome is orchestrated by the intrinsically disordered scaffolding protein, CsoS2, which interacts with both Rubisco and carboxysomal shell proteins, but it is unknown how the carbonic anhydrase, CsoSCA, is incorporated into the -carboxysome. Here, we present the structural basis of carbonic anhydrase encapsulation into -carboxysomes from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus. We find that CsoSCA interacts directly with Rubisco via an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. A 1.98 [A] single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of Rubisco in complex with this peptide reveals that CsoSCA binding is predominantly mediated by a network of hydrogen bonds. CsoSCAs binding site overlaps with that of CsoS2 but the two proteins utilize substantially different motifs and modes of binding, revealing a plasticity of the Rubisco binding site. Our results advance the understanding of carboxysome biogenesis and highlight the importance of Rubisco, not only as an enzyme, but also as a central hub for mediating assembly through protein interactions.",

There has been particular emphasis on the use of plant virions as immunosorbent nanoparticle chassis for their diverse morphologies and accessible, high yield manufacturing via crop cultivation. To date, studies in this area have focused on proof-of-concept immunosorbent functionality in biosensing and purification contexts. Here we consolidate a previously reported pro-vector system into a single Agrobacterium tumefaciens vector to investigate and expand the utility of virus-based immunosorbent nanoparticle technology for therapeutic protein purification. We demonstrate the use of this technology for Fc-fusion protein purification, characterize key nanomaterial properties including binding capacity, stability, reusability, and particle integrity, and present an optimized processing scheme with reduced complexity and increased purity. Furthermore, we present a coupling of virus-based immunosorbent nanoparticles with magnetic particles as a strategy to overcome limitations of the immunosorbent nanoparticle sedimentation-based affinity capture methodology. We report magnetic separation results which exceed the binding capacity of current industry standards by an order of magnitude.",

The prediction is very fast compared with other protein sequence prediction servers - it takes only a few minutes for a query protein on average. Two models could be selected for different purposes: BBO for full sequence prediction, extendable for multiple sequence generation, and BBS for single position prediction with the type of other residues known. ProDCoNN-server outputs the predicted sequence and the probability matrix for each amino acid at each predicted residue. The probability matrix can also be visualized as a sequence logos figure (BBO) or probability distribution plot (BBS). The server is available at: https://prodconn.stat.fsu.edu/.",

A variety of targets and approaches have been utilized including assessments of LRRK2 itself (levels, phosphorylation), or its substrates (e.g. Rab10 or other Rab GTPases). We have previously shown that intrinsic kinase activity of LRRK2 isolated from PBMCs of G2019S carriers is elevated, irrespective of disease status. In the present study we find that phosphorylation of Rab10 is also elevated in G2019S carriers, but only those with PD. Additionally, phosphorylation of this substrate is also elevated in 2 separate idiopathic PD cohorts, but not in carriers of the A53T mutation in -synuclein. In contrast, Rab29 phosphorylation was specifically reduced in urinary exosomes from A53T and idiopathic PD patients. Taken together, our findings highlight the need for the assessment of multiple complimentary targets for a more comprehensive picture of the disease.",

Structural modeling of the SU of several retroviruses and related endogenous retroviral elements with AlphaFold identifies a TM-proximal SU {beta}-sandwich structure that has been conserved in the orthoretroviruses for at least 110 million years. The SU of orthoretroviruses diversified by differential expansion of the {beta} -sandwich core to form domains involved in virus-host interactions. The {beta}-sandwich domain is also conserved in the SU equivalent GP1 of Ebola virus although with a significantly different orientation in the trimeric envelope protein structure. The unified structural view of orthoretroviral SU and filoviral GP1 identifies an ancient, structurally conserved and evolvable domain underlying the structural diversity of orthoretroviral SU and filoviral GP1.",

    "abstract": "Species of the genus Klebsiella are among the most important multidrug resistant human pathogens, though they have been isolated from a variety of environments. Given the need for quickly and accurately classifying newly sequenced Klebsiella genomes, we compared 982 Klebsiella genomes using different species-delimiting measures: Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), which is becoming a standard for species delimitation, as well as Mash, Dashing, and DNA compositional signatures, which can be run in a fraction of the time required to run ANI. ROC analyses showed equal quality in species delimitation for ANI, Mash and Dashing (AUC: 0.99), followed by DNA signatures (AUC: 0.96). The groups obtained at optimal cutoffs were largely in agreement with species designation. Using optimized cutoffs, we obtained 17 species-level groups using either ANI, Mash, or Dashing, all containing the same genomes, unlike DNA signatures which broke the dataset into 38 groups. Further use of Mash to map species after adding draft genomes to the dataset also showed excellent results (AUC: 0.99), producing a total of 28 Klebsiella species in the publicly available genome collection. The ecological niches of Klebsiella strains were found to neither be related to species delimitation, nor to protein functional content, suggesting that a single Klebsiella species can have a wide repertoire of ecological functions.",

    "abstract": "Tropical mountain ecosystems are threatened by land use pressures, reducing the capacity of ecosystems to provide a large diversity of benefits to people and to be able to achieve them in the long term. The analysis of land use pressures is often superficial and very general, although they are characterized by numerous interactions and strong differences in their local dynamics. We used a variety of freely available geospatial and temporal data and methods to assess and explain patterns of land use land cover (LULC) change, focusing on native ecosystem dynamics, in a sensitive region of the northern Ecuadorian Andes. Our results demonstrate a dynamic and clear geographical pattern of distinct LULC transitions through time, explained by different combination of socio-economic factors, pressure variables and environmental parameters, from which ecological context variables, such as slope and elevation, were the main drivers of change in this landscape. We found that deforestation of remnant native forest and agricultural expansion still occur in higher elevations located, while land conversion toward anthropic environments were observed in lower elevations to the east of the studied territory. Our findings also reveal an unexpected stability trend of paramo and a successional recovery of previous agricultural land to the west and center of the territory which could be explained by agricultural land abandonment. However, the very low probability of persistence of montane forests in most of the studied landscape, highlights the risk that the remnant montane forests will be permanently lost in a few years, posing a greater threat to the already vulnerable biodiversity and limiting the capacity ecosystem service provisioning. The dynamic patterns through space and time and their explanatory drivers, found in our study, could help improve sustainably resource land management in vulnerable landscapes such as the tropical Andes in northern Ecuador.",
