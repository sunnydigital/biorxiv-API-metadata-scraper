    "abstract": "BackgroundSulfoglycolysis pathways enable the breakdown of the sulfosugar sulfoquinovose and environmental recycling of its carbon and sulfur content. Several pathways exist for the breakdown of sulfoquinovose that usually lead to production of C3-sulfonates (sulfolactate and 2,3-dihydroxypropanesulfonate) that are excreted and sustain secondary bacterial communities. The prototypical sulfoglycolytic pathway is a variant of the classical Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway that has been described in gram-negative Escherichia coli and results in production of 2,3-dihydroxypropanesulfonate.\n\nResultsWe used enrichment cultures to discover new sulfoglycolytic bacteria from Australian soil samples. Two gram-positive Arthrobacter spp. were isolated that produced sulfolactate as the metabolic end-product. Genome sequences identified a modified sulfoglycolytic Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (sulfo-EMP) gene cluster that retained the core sulfoglycolysis genes encoding metabolic enzymes, but featuring the replacement of the gene encoding sulfolactaldehyde (SLA) reductase with SLA dehydrogenase, and the absence of sulfoquinovosidase and sulfoquinovose mutarotase genes. The gene clusters were broadly conserved across a range of other sequenced Actinobacteria.\n\nConclusionsWe report the first gram-positive soil bacteria that utilize sulfo-EMP pathways to metabolize SQ. Excretion of sulfolactate is consistent with an aerobic saprophytic lifestyle. This work broadens our knowledge of the sulfo-EMP pathway to include soil bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Shiga toxin (Stx) is the major virulence factor of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), and the stx genes are carried by temperate bacteriophages (Stx phages). The switch between lysogenic and lytic life cycle of the phage, which is crucial for Stx production and for severity of the disease, is regulated by the CI repressor. CI maintain latency by preventing transcription of the replication proteins. Three EHEC phage replication units (Eru1-3) in addition to the classical lambdoid replication region have been described previously, and Stx phages carrying the Eru1 replication region were associated with highly virulent EHEC strains. In this study, we have classified the Eru replication region of 419 Stx phages. In addition to the lambdoid replication region and the three already described Erus, ten novel Erus (named Eru4 to Eru13) were detected. The lambdoid type, Eru1, Eru4 and Eru7 seem to be widely distributed in Western Europe. Notably, EHEC strains involved in severe outbreaks in England and Norway carry Stx phages with Eru1, Eru2, Eru5 and Eru7 replication regions. Phylogenetic analysis of CI repressors from Stx phages revealed eight major clades that largely separate according to Eru type. The classification of replication regions and CI proteins of Stx phages provides an important platform for further studies aimed to assess how characteristics of the replication region influence the regulation of phage life cycle and, consequently, the virulence potential of the host EHEC strain.\n\nIMPORTANCEEHEC is an emerging health challenge worldwide and outbreaks caused by this pathogen tend to be more frequent and severe. Increased knowledge on how characteristics of the replication region influence the virulence of E. coli may be used for more precise identification of high-risk EHEC strains.",

    "abstract": "Nitrification by aquarium biofilters transforms toxic ammonia waste (NH3/NH4+) to less toxic nitrate (NO3-) via nitrite (NO2-). Ammonia oxidation is mediated by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and the recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizing (comammox) Nitrospira. Prior to the discovery of comammox Nitrospira, previous research revealed that AOA dominate among ammonia oxidizers in freshwater biofilters. Here, we characterized the composition of aquarium filter microbial communities and quantified the abundance of all three known groups of ammonia oxidizers. Aquarium biofilter and water samples were collected from representative freshwater and saltwater systems in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Using extracted DNA, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to assess community composition and quantify the abundance of amoA genes, respectively. Our results show that aquarium biofilter microbial communities were consistently represented by putative heterotrophs of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroides phyla, with distinct profiles associated with fresh versus saltwater biofilters. Among nitrifiers, comammox Nitrospira amoA genes were detected in all 38 freshwater aquarium biofilter samples and were the most abundant ammonia oxidizer in 30 of these samples, with the remaining biofilters dominated by AOA, based on amoA gene abundances. In saltwater biofilters, AOA or AOB were differentially abundant, with no comammox Nitrospira detected. These results demonstrate that comammox Nitrospira play an important role in biofilter nitrification that has been previously overlooked and such microcosms are useful for exploring the ecology of nitrification for future research.",

In this study, we investigated several virological features of Delta spike protein (SPDelta), including protein maturation and its impact on viral entry of cell-free pseudotyped virus, cell-cell fusion ability and its induction of inflammatory cytokine production in human macrophages and dendritic cells. The results showed that SP{Delta}CDelta exhibited enhanced S1/S2 cleavage in cells and pseudotyped virus-like particles (PVLPs). We further showed that SP{Delta}CDelta elevated pseudovirus infection in human lung cell lines and mediated significantly enhanced syncytia formation. Furthermore, we revealed that SP{Delta}CDelta-PVLPs had stronger effects on stimulating NF-{kappa}B and AP-1 signaling in human monocytic THP1 cells and induced significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as TNF-, IL-1{beta} and IL-6, released from human macrophages and dendritic cells. Overall, these studies provide evidence to support the important role of SP{Delta}CDelta during virus infection, transmission and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the entry receptor ACE2. Although attachment factors and co-receptors facilitating entry are extensively studied, cellular entry factors inhibiting viral entry are largely unknown. Using a surfaceome CRISPR activation screen, we identified human LRRC15 as an inhibitory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. LRRC15 directly binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with a moderate affinity and inhibits spike-mediated entry. Analysis of human lung single cell RNA sequencing dataset reveals that expression of LRRC15 is primarily detected in fibroblasts and particularly enriched in pathological fibroblasts in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 and LRRC15 are not co-expressed in the same cell types in the lung. Strikingly, expression of LRRC15 in ACE2-negative cells blocks spike-mediated viral entry in ACE2+ cell in trans, suggesting a protective role of LRRC15 in a physiological context. Therefore, LRRC15 represents an inhibitory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 regulating viral entry in trans.",

    "abstract": "Several regulatory agencies have either licensed or given emergency use approval for treatment of patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19 with the anti-viral drug, Molnupiravir. Recent trials involving Molnupiravir suggested the drug was not as efficacious as earlier studies suggested. This study aimed to: (i) determine the effectiveness of the Molnupiravir active metabolite (NHC) against different SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VoCs), (ii) establish the therapeutic window of NHC in a human lung cell model, and (iii) and evaluate the genetic barrier to resistance. Dose response assays were performed in parallel to determine the IC50 (the concentration required to inhibit virus titre by 50%) of NHC against different variants. Human ACE-2 A549 cells were treated with NHC at different time points either before, during or after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Multiple passaging in the presence or absence of drug was used to evaluate whether resistance occurred. To obtain genomic information, virus was sequenced at regular intervals. After 20 passages in the presence of the drug, dose response assays and sequencing showed the virus did not appear to have developed resistance. The drug had equivalent activity against four VOCs ranging from 0.04 to 0.16M IC50. The efficacy of the drug diminished when applied after 24 hours post-infection. Our results suggest that earlier administration in patients, perhaps pre- or post-exposure rather than symptom onset, would be a more effective treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic inhibition of critical viral functions is important for curtailing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We sought to identify antiviral targets through genome-wide characterization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are crucial for viral pathogenesis and that cause harmful cytopathic effects. All twenty-nine viral proteins were tested in a fission yeast cell-based system using inducible gene expression. Twelve proteins including eight non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14 and NSP15) and four accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b) were identified that altered cellular proliferation and integrity, and induced cell death. Cell death correlated with the activation of cellular oxidative stress. Of the twelve proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study in mammalian cells. In human pulmonary and kidney epithelial cells, ORF3a induced cellular oxidative stress associated with apoptosis and necrosis, and caused activation of pro-inflammatory response with production of the cytokines TNF-, IL-6, and IFN-{beta}1, possibly through the activation of NF-{kappa}B. To further characterize the mechanism, we tested a natural ORF3a Beta variant, Q57H, and a mutant with deletion of the highly conserved residue, {Delta}G188. Compared to wild type ORF3a, the {Delta}G188 variant yielded more robust activation of cellular oxidative stress, cell death, and innate immune response. Since cellular oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to cell death and tissue damage linked to the severity of COVID-19, our findings suggest that ORF3a is a promising, novel therapeutic target against COVID-19.\n\nSignificanceThe ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has claimed over 5 million lives with more than 250 million people infected world-wide. While vaccines are effective, the emergence of new viral variants could jeopardize vaccine protection. Antiviral drugs provide an alternative to battle against COVID-19. Our goal was to identify viral therapeutic targets that can be used in antiviral drug discovery. Utilizing a genome-wide functional analysis in a fission yeast cell-based system, we identified twelve viral candidates, including ORF3a, which cause cellular oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and necrosis that contribute to COVID-19. Our findings indicate that antiviral agents targeting ORF3a could greatly impact COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "A prion-like RNA-binding protein, CPEB3, can regulate local translation in dendritic spines. CPEB3 monomers repress translation, whereas CPEB3 aggregates activate translation of its target mRNAs. However, the CPEB3 aggregates, as long-lasting prions, may raise the problem of unregulated translational activation. Here, we propose a computational model of the complex structure between CPEB3 RNA-binding domain (CPEB3-RBD) and small ubiquitin-like modifier protein 2 (SUMO2). Free energy calculations suggest that the allosteric effect of CPEB3-RBD/SUMO2 interaction can amplify the RNA-binding affinity of CPEB3. Combining with previous experimental observations on the SUMOylation mode of CPEB3, this model suggests an equilibrium shift of mRNA from binding to deSUMOylated CPEB3 aggregates to binding to SUMOylated CPEB3 monomers in basal synapses. This work shows how a burst of local translation in synapses can be silenced following a stimulation pulse, and explores the CPEB3/SUMO2 interplay underlying the structural change of synapses and the formation of long-term memories.",

    "abstract": "The role of ER Ca2+ release via ryanodine receptors (RyR) in pancreatic {beta}-cell function is not well defined. Deletion of RyR2 from the rat insulinoma INS-1 (RyR2KO) enhanced the Ca2+ integral (AUC) stimulated by 7.5 mM glucose, and rendered it sensitive to block by the IP3 receptor inhibitor xestospongin C, coincident with reduced levels of the protein IP3 Receptor Binding protein released with Inositol 1,4,5 Trisphosphate (IRBIT; aka AHCYL1). Deletion of IRBIT from INS-1 cells (IRBITKO) increased the Ca2+ AUC in response to 7.5 mM glucose and induced xestospongin sensitivity. Insulin content and basal (2.5 mM glucose) and 7.5 mM glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were reduced in RyR2KO cells and more modestly reduced in IRBITKO cells compared to controls. INS2 mRNA levels were reduced in both RyR2KO and IRBITKO cells, but INS1 mRNA levels were specifically decreased in RyR2KO cells. Nuclear localization of S-adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) was increased in RyR2KO and IRBITKO cells. DNA methylation of the INS1 and INS2 gene promotor regions was very low, and not different among RyR2KO, IRBITKO, and controls. In contrast, exon 2 of the INS1 and INS2 genes was more extensively methylated in RyR2KO and IRBITKO cells than in controls. Proteomics analysis using LC-MS/MS revealed that deletion of RyR2 or IRBIT resulted in differential regulation of 314 and 137 proteins, respectively, with 41 in common. These results suggest that RyR2 regulates IRBIT levels and activity in INS-1 cells, and together maintain insulin content and secretion, and regulate the proteome, perhaps via DNA methylation.\n\nOne sentence SummaryDeletion of RyR2 from INS-1 cells had the unanticipated effect of reducing IRBIT proteins levels, and both RyR2 and IRBIT contribute to maintenance of glucose- stimulated insulin secretion.",

However, bona fide interaction partners of hemicentins have not been described as yet. Here, applying surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and co-immunoprecipitation, we identify the basement membrane protein nidogen-2 (NID2) as a binding partner of mouse and zebrafish hemicentin-1 (HMCN1), in line with the formerly described essential role of mouse HMCN1 in basement membrane integrity. We show that HMCN1 binds to the same protein domain of NID2 (G2) as formerly shown for laminins, but with an approximately ten-fold lower affinity and in a competitive manner. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling revealed that HMCN1/Hmcn1 is localized close to basement membranes and in partial overlap with NID2/Nid2a in different tissues of mouse and zebrafish. Genetic knockout and antisense-mediated knockdown studies in zebrafish further show that loss of Nid2a leads to similar defects in fin fold morphogenesis as the loss of Laminin-5 (Lama5) or Hmcn1. Finally, combined partial loss-of-function studies indicated that nid2a genetically interacts with both hmcn1 and lama5. Together, these findings suggest that despite their mutually exclusive physical binding, hemicentins, nidogens, and laminins tightly cooperate and support each other during formation, maintenance, and function of basement membranes to confer tissue linkage.",

Mussels were automatically (and safely) supplied with a maximum stable level of ~60 {micro}M methane in seawater using a novel methane-air mixing system. Experimental animals also received daily doses of live microalgae. Condition indices of cultured G. childressi remained high over years, and low shell thickness growth could be detected, which is indicative of positive energy budgets. Using stable isotope data, we demonstrate that G. childressi in our culture system gained energy, both, from digestion of methane oxidizing endosymbionts and from digesting particulate food (microalgae).

    "abstract": "Human gut microbial dynamics are highly individualized, making it challenging to link microbiota to health and to design universal microbiome therapies. This individuality is typically attributed to variation in host genetics, diets, environments, and medications, but it could also emerge from fundamental ecological forces that shape microbiota more generally. Here we leverage extensive gut microbial time series from wild baboons--hosts who experience little interindividual dietary and environmental heterogeneity--to test whether gut microbial dynamics are synchronized across hosts or largely idiosyncratic. Despite their shared lifestyles, baboon microbiome dynamics were only weakly synchronized. The strongest synchrony occurred among baboons living in the same social group, likely because group members range over the same habitat and simultaneously encounter the same sources of food and water. However, this synchrony was modest compared to each hosts personalized dynamics. Indeed, host-specific factors, especially host identity, explained 10 times the deviance in longitudinal microbial dynamics, compared to factors shared across hosts. These results contribute to mounting evidence that highly idiosyncratic gut microbiomes are not an artifact of modern human environments, and that synchronizing forces in the gut microbiome (e.g., shared environments, diets, and microbial dispersal) are often not strong enough to overwhelm drivers of microbiome personalization, including host genetics, priority effects, horizontal gene transfer, and functional redundancy.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax sporozoites reside in the salivary glands of a mosquito before infecting a human host. Previous transcriptome-wide studies in populations of these forms were limited in their ability to elucidate cell-to-cell variation, thereby masking cellular states potentially important in understanding transmission outcomes. In this study, we performed transcription profiling on 9,947 P. vivax sporozoites to assess the extent to which they differ at single-cell resolution. We show that sporozoites residing in the mosquitos salivary glands exist in distinct developmental states, as defined by their transcriptomic signatures. Additionally, relative to P. falciparum, P. vivax displays overlapping and unique gene usage patterns, highlighting conserved and species-specific gene programs. Notably, distinguishing P. vivax from P. falciparum were a subset of P. vivax sporozoites expressing genes associated with translational regulation and repression. Finally, our comparison of single-cell transcriptomic data from P. vivax sporozoite and erythrocytic forms reveals gene usage patterns unique to sporozoites. In defining the transcriptomic signatures of individual P. vivax sporozoites, our work provides new insights into the factors driving their developmental trajectory and lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive P. vivax cell atlas.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is primarily known as a respiratory disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. However, neurological symptoms such as memory loss, sensory confusion, cognitive and psychiatric issues, severe headaches, and even stroke are reported in as many as 30% of cases and can persist even after the infection is over (so-called  long COVID). These neurological symptoms are thought to be caused by brain inflammation, triggered by the virus infecting the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients, however we still dont fully understand the mechanisms for these symptoms. The neurological effects of COVID-19 share many similarities to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons in which the presence of cytotoxic protein-based amyloid aggregates is a common etiological feature. Following the hypothesis that some neurological symptoms of COVID-19 may also follow an amyloid etiology we performed a bioinformatic scan of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, detecting peptide fragments that were predicted to be highly amyloidogenic. We selected two of these peptides and discovered that they do rapidly self-assemble into amyloid. Furthermore, these amyloid assemblies were shown to be highly toxic to a neuronal cell line. We introduce and support the idea that cytotoxic amyloid aggregates of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are causing some of the neurological symptoms commonly found in COVID-19 and contributing to long COVID, especially those symptoms which are novel to long COVID in contrast to other post-viral syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Stabilizing antigenic proteins as vaccine immunogens or diagnostic reagents is a stringent case of protein engineering and design as the exterior surface must maintain recognition by receptor(s) and antigen--specific antibodies at multiple distinct epitopes. This is a challenge, as stability-enhancing mutations must be focused on the protein core, whereas successful computational stabilization algorithms typically select mutations at solvent-facing positions. In this study we report the stabilization of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Hu-1 Spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) using a combination of deep mutational scanning and computational design, including the FuncLib algorithm. Our most successful design encodes I358F, Y365W, T430I, and I513L RBD mutations, maintains recognition by the receptor ACE2 and a panel of different anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies, is between 1-2{degrees}C more thermally stable than the original RBD using a thermal shift assay, and is less proteolytically sensitive to chymotrypsin and thermolysin than the original RBD. Our approach could be applied to the computational stabilization of a wide range of proteins without requiring detailed knowledge of active sites or binding epitopes, particularly powerful for cases when there are multiple or unknown binding sites.",

    "abstract": "MYC is dysregulated in >50% of cancers, but direct targeting of MYC has been clinically unsuccessful. Targeting downstream MYC effector pathways represents an attractive alternative. MYC regulates alternative mRNA splicing, a hallmark of cancer, but the mechanistic links between MYC and the splicing machinery remain underexplored. Here, we identify a network of splicing factors (SFs) co-expressed as SF-modules in MYC-active breast tumors. Of these, one is a pan-cancer SF-module, correlating with MYC-activity across 33 tumor types. In mammary cell models, MYC activation leads to co-upregulation of pan-cancer module SFs and to changes in >4,000 splicing events. In breast cancer organoids, co-overexpression of the pan-cancer SF-module is sufficient to induce splicing events that are also MYC-regulated in patient tumors and to increase organoid size and invasiveness, while its knockdown decreases organoid size. Finally, we uncover a pan-cancer splicing signature of MYC activity which correlates with survival in multiple tumor types. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms and function of MYC-regulated splicing and for the development of therapeutics for MYC-driven tumors.",

The T cell paracortical zone is a major site of macrophage efferocytosis of apoptotic cells, but key factors controlling this niche are undefined. Here we show that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are an essential component of the LN macrophage niche. Macrophages co-localised with FRCs in human LNs, and murine single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that most reticular cells expressed master macrophage regulator CSF1. Functional assays showed that CSF1R signalling was sufficient to support macrophage development. In the presence of LPS, FRCs underwent a mechanistic switch and maintained support through CSF1R-independent mechanisms. These effects were conserved between mouse and human systems. Rapid loss of macrophages and monocytes from LNs was observed upon genetic ablation of FRCs. These data reveal a critically important role for FRCs in the creation of the parenchymal macrophage niche within LNs.",

Parenteral and intranasal prime and boost vaccinations with mPSM-RBD elicited potent systemic and lung resident memory T and B cells and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA responses, and markedly diminished viral loads and inflammation in the lung following SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infection.

One characteristic of these variants are changes within the Spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD). From a public health perspective these changes have important implications for increased transmissibility and immune escape; however, their presence could also modify the intrinsic host-range of the virus. Using viral pseudotyping we examined whether the variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta have differing host ACE2 receptor usage patterns, focusing on a range of relevant mammalian ACE2 proteins. All four VOCs were able to overcome a previous restriction for mouse ACE2, with demonstrable differences also seen for individual VOCs with rat, ferret or civet ACE2 receptors, changes which we subsequently attribute to N501Y and E484K substitutions within the Spike RBD.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) is a leading cause of multidrug-resistant human infections. To better understand the potential contribution of food as a vehicle of KpSC, we conducted a multicentric study to define an optimal culture method for its recovery from food matrices, and to characterize food isolates phenotypically and genotypically. Chicken meat (n=160) and salad (n=145) samples were collected in five European countries and screened for KpSC presence using culture-based and ZKIR qPCR methods. Enrichment using buffered peptone water followed by streaking on Simmons citrate agar with inositol (44{degrees}C/48h) was defined as the most suitable selective culture method for KpSC recovery. High prevalence of KpSC was found in chicken meat (60% and 52% by ZKIR qPCR and culture approach, respectively) and salad (30% and 21%, respectively) samples. Genomic analyses revealed high genetic diversity with the dominance of phylogroups Kp1 (91%) and Kp3 (6%). 82% of isolates presented a natural antimicrobial susceptibility phenotype and genotype, with only four CTX-M-15-producing isolates detected. Notably, identical genotypes were found across samples: same food type and same country (15 cases); different food types and same country (1); same food type and two countries (1), suggesting high rates of transmission of KpSC within the food sector. Our study provides a novel isolation strategy for KpSC from food matrices and reinforces the view of food as a potential source of KpSC colonization in humans.\n\nImportanceBacteria of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) are ubiquitous and K. pneumoniae (Kp) is a leading cause of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans and animals. Despite the urgent public health threat represented by Kp, there is a lack of knowledge on the contribution of food sources to colonization and subsequent infection in humans. This is partly due to the absence of standardized methods for characterizing KpSC presence in food matrices. Our multicentric study provides and implements a novel isolation strategy for KpSC from food matrices and shows that KpSC members are highly prevalent in salads and chicken meat, reinforcing the view of food as a potential source of KpSC colonization in humans. Despite the large genetic diversity and the low-levels of resistance detected, the occurrence of identical genotypes across samples suggests high rates of transmission of KpSC within the food sector, which need to be further explored to define possible control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Yellow fever virus (YFV) exhibits a sylvatic cycle of transmission involving wild mosquitoes and non-human primates (NHP). In Brazil, YFV is endemic in the Amazon region, from where waves of epidemic expansion towards other Brazilian states eventually occur. During such waves, the virus usually follows the route from North to the Central-West and Southeast Brazilian regions. Amidst these journeys, outbreaks of Yellow Fever (YF) in NHPs, with spillovers to humans have been observed. In the present work, we describe a surveillance effort encompassing the technology of smartphone applications and the coordinated action of several research institutions and health services that succeeded in the first confirmation of YFV in NHPs in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), Southeast region, in 2021, followed by genome sequencing in an interval of only ten days. Samples from two NHPs (one of the species Alouatta caraya in the municipality of Icarai de Minas and the other of the species Callithrix penicillata in the municipality of Ubai) were collected and the presence of YFV was confirmed by RT-qPCR. We generated three near-complete by Nanopore sequencer MinION. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all viral genomes recovered are equal and related to lineage South America 1, clustering with a genome detected in the Amazon region (Para state) in 2017. These findings reveal the occurrence of a new wave of viral expansion in MG, six years after the beginning of the major outbreak in the state, between 2015-2018. No human cases were reported to date, showing the importance of coordinated work between local surveillance based on available technologies and support laboratories to ensure a quick response and implementation of contingency measures towards avoiding the occurrence of YF cases in humans.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is associated with essential brain functions such as learning and memory. Human hippocampal volume is significantly greater than expected when compared to non-human apes, suggesting a recent expansion. Intermediate progenitors, which are able to undergo multiple rounds of proliferative division before a final neurogenic division, may have played a role in the evolutionary hippocampal expansion. To investigate the evolution of gene regulatory networks underpinning hippocampal neurogenesis in apes, we leveraged the differentiation of human and chimpanzee induced Pluripotent Stem Cells into TBR2-positive hippocampal intermediate progenitors (hpIPCs). We find that the gene networks active in hpIPCs are significantly different between humans and chimpanzees, with [~]2,500 genes differentially expressed. We demonstrate that species-specific transposon-derived enhancers contribute to these transcriptomic differences. Young transposons, predominantly Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) and SINE-Vntr-Alus (SVAs), were co-opted as enhancers in a species-specific manner. Human-specific SVAs provided substrates for thousands of novel TBR2 binding sites, and CRISPR-mediated repression of these SVAs attenuates the expression of [~]25% of the genes that are upregulated in human intermediate progenitors relative to the same cell population in the chimpanzee.\n\nSummary statementEvolution of human and chimpanzee hippocampal development was mediated by co-option of young retrotransposons into species-specific enhancers.",

    "abstract": "Avian influenza A virus (AIV) is ubiquitous in waterfowl, and detected annually at high prevalence in waterfowl during the Northern Hemipshere autumn. Some AIV subtypes are globally common in waterfowl, such as H3N8, H4N6, and H6N2, and are detected in the same populations at high frequency, annually. In order to investigate genetic features associated to the long-term maintenance of common subtypes in migratory ducks, we sequenced 248 H4 viruses isolated across 8 years (2002-2009) from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled in southeast Sweden. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both H4 and N6 sequences fell into in three distinct lineages, structured by year of isolation. Specifically, across the eight years of the study, we observed lineage replacement, whereby a different HA lineage circulated in the population each year. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences of the HA lineages illustrated key differences in regions of the globular head of hemagglutinin that overlap with established antigentic sites in homologous hemagglutinin H3, suggesting the possibility of antigenic differences among these HA lineages. Beyond HA, lineage replacement was common to all segments, such that novel genome constellations were detected across years. A dominant genome constellation would rapidly amplify in the duck population, followed by unlinking of gene segments as a result of reassortment within 2-3 weeks following introduction. These data help reveal the evolutionary dynamics exhibited by AIV on both annual and decadal scales in an important reservoir host.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClassical genetic crosses in malaria parasites involve isolation, genotyping, and phenotyping of multiple progeny parasites, which is time consuming and laborious. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) offers a powerful and efficient alternative to identify loci underlying complex traits in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nMethodsWe have used BSA, which combines genetic crosses using humanized mice with pooled sequencing of progeny populations to measure changes in allele frequency following selection with antimalarial drugs. We used dihydroartemisinin (DHA) drug selection in two genetic crosses (Mal31xKH004 and NF54xNHP1337). We specifically investigated how synchronization, cryopreservation, and the drug selection regimen of progeny pools impacted the success of BSA experiments.\n\nFindingsWe detected a strong and repeatable quantitative trait locus (QTL) at chr13 kelch13 locus in both crosses, but did not detect QTLs at ferredoxin (fd), the apicoplast ribosomal protein S10 (arps10), multidrug resistance protein 2 (mdr2). QTLs were detected using synchronized, but not unsynchronized pools, consistent with the stage-specific action of DHA. We also successfully applied BSA to cryopreserved progeny pools.\n\nInterpretationOur results provide proof-of-principal of the utility of BSA for rapid, robust genetic mapping of drug resistance loci. Use of cryopreserved progeny pools expands the utility of BSA because we can conduct experiments using archived progeny pools from previous genetic crosses. BSA provides a powerful approach that complements traditional QTL methods for investigating the genetic architecture of resistance to antimalarials, and to reveal new or accessory loci contributing to artemisinin resistance.\n\nFundingNational Institutes of Health (NIH); Wellcome trust.\n\nO_TEXTBOXResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGenetic crosses have been immensely successful for determining the genetic basis of drug resistance in malaria parasites, but require laborious cloning, characterization of drug resistance and genome-wide genotyping of individual progeny. This is a major limitation given that genetic crosses can now be conducted efficiently using humanized mice, rather than chimpanzees. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) provides an attractive alternative approach because (i) large numbers of uncloned recombinant progeny can be analyzed, increasing statistical power (ii) phenotyping is not required, because we identify QTLs by treatment of progeny bulks, and identifying genome regions that show skews in allele frequency after treatment (iii) genome sequencing of bulk samples provides a rapid, accurate readout of genome-wide allele frequencies. This approach has been effectively leveraged in yeast, rodent malaria and several model organisms.\n\nAdded value of this studyHere we validate and optimize this approach for P. falciparum genetic crosses, focusing on resistance to dihydroartemisin (DHA) a central component of the first-line antimalarial combination. Mutations in kelch13 are known to confer resistance to DHA, but several additional candidate loci have also been suggested to contribute. Our results confirm involvement of kelch13, but did not identify linkage with other putative candidate loci. We optimized methodology, showing that synchronization is critical, and that BSA can be successfully applied to cryopreserved progeny pools.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceBSA combined with recent advances in rapidly generating genetic crosses provides a powerful approach to investigate the genetic basis of drug resistance in P. falciparum.\n\nC_TEXTBOX",

    "abstract": "Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) (also known as ADAR1) promotes A-to-I conversion in double-stranded and highly structured RNAs. ADAR1 has two isoforms transcribed from different promoters: ADAR1p150, which is mainly cytoplasmic and interferon-inducible, and constitutively expressed ADAR1p110 that is primarily localized in the nucleus.\n\nMutations in ADAR1 cause Aicardi - Goutieres syndrome (AGS), a severe autoinflammatory disease in humans associated with aberrant IFN production. In mice, deletion of ADAR1 or selective knockout of the p150 isoform alone leads to embryonic lethality driven by overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes. This phenotype can be rescued by concurrent deletion of cytoplasmic dsRNA-sensor MDA5. These findings indicate that the interferon- inducible p150 isoform is indispensable and cannot be rescued by the ADAR1p110 isoform. Nevertheless, editing sites uniquely targeted by ADAR1p150 but also mechanisms of isoform- specificity remain elusive.\n\nHere we combine RIP-seq on human cells expressing ADAR1 isoforms and combine this with analysis of isoform-specific editing patterns in genetically modified mouse cells to extensively investigate ADAR1-isoform binding- and editing characteristics.\n\nMoreover, using mutated ADAR variants, we examine the effect of two unique features of ADAR1p150 on its target specificity: 1) cytoplasmic localization and 2) Z-DNA binding domain . Our findings indicate that ZBD contributes only minimally to p150 editing-specificity and that isoform-specific editing is directed mainly by the cytoplasmic localization of the editase.",
