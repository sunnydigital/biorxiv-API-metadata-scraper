    "abstract": "We examined a dataset of 590 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients treated with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy using a game-theoretic model that includes both the evolution of therapy resistance and a cost of resistance. We tested whether the game-theoretic model provides a better fit than classical mathematical models of population growth (exponential, logistic, classic Bertalanffy, general Bertalanffy, Gompertz, general Gompertz). To our knowledge, this is the first time a large clinical patient cohort (as opposed to only in-vitro data) has been used to apply a game-theoretic cancer model. The game-theoretic model provided a better fit to the tumor dynamics of the 590 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients than any of the non-evolutionary population growth models. This was not simply due to having more parameters in the game-theoretic model. The game-theoretic model was seemingly able to fit more accurately patients whose tumor burden exhibit a U-shaped trajectory over time. We explained how this game-theoretic model provides predictions of future tumor growth based on just a few initial measurements. Using the estimates for treatment-specific parameters, we then explored alternative treatment protocols and their expected impact on tumor growth and patient outcome. As such, the model could possibly be used to suggest patient-specific optimal treatment regimens with the goal of minimizing final tumor burden. Therapeutic protocols based on game-theoretic modeling can help to predict tumor growth, and could potentially improve patient outcome in the future. The model invites evolutionary therapies that anticipate and steer the evolution of therapy resistance.",

    "abstract": "Thin-film freeze-drying (TFFD) is a rapid freezing and then drying technique used to prepare inhalable dry powders from the liquid form for drug delivery to the lungs. We report the preparation of aerosolizable dry powders of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by TFFD. We first formulated IgG with lactose/leucine (60:40 w/w) or trehalose/leucine (75:25). IgG 1% (w/w) formulated with lactose/leucine (60:40 w/w) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (IgG-1-LL-PBS) and processed by TFFD was found to produce the powder with the most desirable aerosol properties. We then replaced IgG with a specific antibody, anti-programmed cell death protein (anti-PD-1 mAb), to prepare a dry powder (anti-PD1-1-LL-PBS), which performed similarly to the IgG-1-LL-PBS powder. The aerosol properties of anti-PD1-1-LL-PBS were significantly better when TFFD was used to prepare the powder as compared to conventional shelf freeze-drying (shelf FD). The dry powder had a porous structure with nanoaggregates. The dry powder had a Tg value between 39-50 {degrees}C. When stored at room temperature, the anti-PD-1 mAb in the TFFD powder was more stable than that of the same formulation stored as a liquid. The addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K40 in the formulation was able to raise the Tg to 152 {degrees}C, which is expected to further increase the storage stability of the mAbs. The PD-1 binding activities of the anti-PD-1 mAbs before and after TFFD were not different. While protein loss, likely due to protein binding to glass or plastic vials and the TFF apparatus, was identified, we were able to minimize the loss by increasing mAb content in the powders. Lastly, we show that another mAb, anti-TNF-, can also be converted to a dry powder with a similar composition by TFFD. We conclude that TFFD can be applied to produce stable aerosolizable dry powders of mAbs for pulmonary delivery.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the pyruvate inside plant mitochondria is either transported into the matrix from the cytosol via the mitochondria pyruvate carrier (MPC) or synthesised in the matrix by alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) or NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME). Pyruvate from these origins could mix into a single pool in the matrix and contribute indistinguishably to respiration, or they could maintain a degree of independence in metabolic regulation. Here, we demonstrated that feeding isolated mitochondria with U-13C-pyruvate and unlabelled malate enables the assessment of pyruvate contribution from different sources to TCA cycle intermediate production. Imported pyruvate is the preferred source for citrate production even when the synthesis of NAD-ME-derived pyruvate was optimised. Genetic or pharmacological elimination of MPC activity removed this preference and allowed an equivalent amount of citrate to be generated from the pyruvate produced by NAD-ME. Increasing mitochondrial pyruvate pool size by exogenous addition only affected metabolites from pyruvate transported by MPC whereas depleting pyruvate pool size by transamination to alanine only affected metabolic products derived from NAD-ME. Together, these data reveal respiratory substrate supply in plants involves distinct pyruvate pools inside the matrix that can be flexibly mixed based on the rate of pyruvate transport from the cytosol. These pools are independently regulated and contribute differentially to organic acids export from plant mitochondria.\n\nSignificance statementPyruvate is the primary respiratory substrate for energy production to support plant growth and development. However, it is also the starting material of many other pathways. Prioritisation of respiratory use over other competing pathways would enable a level of control when pyruvate is delivered to mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter. We demonstrated the existence of two distinct pyruvate pools in plant mitochondria suggesting inner mitochondrial organisation allows metabolic heterogeneity, hence metabolic specialisation. This explains why NAD-ME flux into plant respiration is low and confirms the prominent link between imported pyruvate and energy production. This compartmentation also reveals how NAD-ME supplies substrate to the mitochondrial pyruvate exporter in plants, especially during C4 metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The virome of plants is dominated by RNA viruses 1 and several of these cause devastating diseases in cultivated plants leading to global crop losses 2. To infect plants, RNA viruses engage in complex interactions with compatible plant hosts. In cells at the spreading infection front, RNA viruses replicate their genome through double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates and interact with cellular transport processes to achieve cell-to-cell movement of replicated genome copies through cell wall channels called plasmodesmata (PD) 3. In order to propagate, viruses also must overcome host defense responses. In addition to triggering the antiviral RNA silencing response, RNA virus infection also elicits pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) 4 whereby dsRNA, a hallmark of virus replication, acts as an important elicitor 5. This innate antiviral immune response is also triggered when dsRNA is applied externally and does not require sequence homology to the virus 5. However, the mechanism by which PTI restricts virus infection is not known. Here, we show that dsRNA inhibits the progression of virus infection by triggering callose deposition at plasmodesmata and the inhibition of transport through these cell-to-cell communication channels. The dsRNA-induced signaling pathway leading to callose deposition is independent of ROS production and thus distinguished from pathways triggered by bacterial and fungal elicitors. The dsRNA-induced host response at plasmodesmata is suppressed by the Tobacco mosaic virus movement protein (MP). Thus, the virus uses MP to inhibit innate dsRNA-induced immunity at plasmodesmata, which could be a general strategy of phytoviruses to overcome plant defenses and spread infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeat Shock Protein 101 (HSP101) in plants and orthologs in bacteria (Caseinolytic peptidase B, ClpB) and yeast (Hsp104) are essential for thermotolerance. To investigate molecular mechanisms of thermotolerance involving HSP101, we performed a suppressor screen in Arabidopsis thaliana of a semi-dominant, missense HSP101 allele, hot1-4 (A499T). Plants carrying the hot1-4 mutation are more heat-sensitive than an HSP101 null mutant (hot1-3), indicating the toxicity of hot1-4 allele.\n\nResultsWe report that one suppressor (shot2, suppressor of hot1-4 2) has a temperature-sensitive, missense mutation (E170K) in the CstF77 (Cleavage stimulation factor 77) subunit of the polyadenylation complex, which is critical for 3 end maturation of pre-mRNA. RNA-Seq analysis of total RNA depleted of ribosomes reveals that heat treatment causes transcriptional readthrough events in shot2, specifically in highly heat-induced genes, including the toxic hot1-4 gene. In addition, failure of correct transcript processing leads to reduced accumulation of many HSP RNAs and proteins, suppressing heat sensitivity of the hot1-4 mutant, due to reduction of the toxic mutant HSP101 protein. Notably, the shot2 mutation makes plants more sensitive to heat stress in the HSP101 null (hot1-3) and wild-type backgrounds correlated with the reduced expression of other heat-inducible genes required for thermotolerance.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals the critical function of CstF77 for 3 end formation of mRNA during heat stress, as well as the dominant role of HSP101 in dictating the outcome of severe heat stress in plants.",

    "abstract": "PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are transcription factors that interact with the photoreceptors phytochromes and integrate multiple signaling pathways related to light, temperature, defense and hormone responses. PIFs have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis thaliana, but less is known about their roles in other species. Here, we investigate the role of the two homologs of PIF1 found in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), namely PIF1a and PIF1b. Analysis of gene expression showed very different patterns, indicating a potential evolutionary divergence in their roles. At the protein level, light regulated the stability of PIF1a, but not PIF1b, further supporting a functional divergence. Phenotypic analyses of CRISPR-Cas9-generated tomato mutants defective in PIF1a or PIF1b or both revealed conserved and newly acquired roles compared to Arabidopsis PIF1. Both PIF1a or PIF1b were found to regulate seed germination, photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis and fruit production. However, only PIF1a-defective mutants showed defects on root hair elongation, flowering time and fruit growth and softening. We did not identify any process altered only in plants lacking PIF1b. Together, these data show that neofunctionalization has taken place in tomato, illustrating the potential of these transcription factors to acquiring new roles in different species.",

The open mesh structure forms a stable interwoven structure with the neural network, preventing probe drifting and showing no immune response and neuron loss during the yearlong implantation. Using the implanted nanoelectronics, we can track single-unit action potentials from the same neurons over the entire adult life of mice.

    "abstract": "Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mbTBI) is the most common cause of TBI in US service members and veterans. Those exposed to TBI are at greater risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, and substance use disorders following TBI [1, 2]. Previously, we have demonstrated that mbTBI increases anxiety-like behaviors in mice and dysregulates the stress at the level of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). To expand on how mTBI may dysregulate the stress axis centrally, here PVN CRF neuronal activity was evaluated using whole cell-patch clamp recordings in hypothalamic slices from sham and mbTBI adult male CRF:tdTomato mice 7 days post-injury. We found that mbTBI generally did not affect the neuronal excitability and intrinsic membrane properties of PVN CRF neurons; this injury selectively increased the frequency of spontaneous neuronal firing of PVN CRF neurons localized to the dorsal PVN (dPVN) but not ventral PVN (vPVN). Consistently, mbTBI-induced dPVN CRF hyperactivity was associated with pre- and post-synaptic depression of spontaneous GABAergic transmission onto dPVN CRF neurons suggesting that mbTBI-induced GABAergic synaptic dysfunction may underlie dPVN CRF neuronal hyperactivity and increases in dPVN CRF signaling. The present results provide the first evidence for mbTBI-induced alterations in PVN CRF neuronal activity and GABAergic synaptic function that could mediate hypothalamic CRF dysregulation following mbTBI contributing to stress psychopathology associated with blast injury.",

We synthesize many-decade time-series across ecosystems to resolve shared changes in seven key features following invasion by quagga and zebra mussels, two widespread congeners that re-engineer and increasingly co-invade freshwaters. Six polymictic shallow lakes with long-term data sets reveal remarkably similar trends, with the strongest ecosystem impacts occurring within 5-10 years of zebra mussel invasion. Surprisingly, plankton communities then exhibited a partial, significant recovery. This recovery was absent, and impacts of initial invasion amplified, in lakes where quagga mussels outcompeted zebra mussels and more completely depleted phytoplankton. Thus, invasion impacts subside over time but can amplify with serial introductions of competing, even closely similar, taxa.",

They show the unique ability to go beyond variant-level genetic association evidence and implicate critical functional units, e.g., genes, in disease etiology. However, in practice, when the two approaches are applied to the same molecular and complex trait data, the inference results can be markedly different. This paper systematically investigates the inferential reproducibility between the two approaches through theoretical derivation, numerical experiments, and analyses of 4 complex trait GWAS and GTEx eQTL data. We identify two classes of inconsistent inference results. We find that the first class of inconsistent results may suggest an interesting biological phenomenon, i.e., horizontal pleiotropy; thus, the two approaches are truly complementary. The inconsistency in the second class can be understood and effectively reconciled. To this end, we propose a novel approach for locus-level colocalization analysis. We demonstrate that the joint TWAS and locus-level colocalization analysis improves specificity and sensitivity for implicating biological-relevant genes.",

Applications of them -- such as alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and troponins -- in clinics have raised certain concerns of their organ specificity. The dynamics and diversity of protein expression in heterogeneous human population are well known, yet their effects on OSPs are less addressed. Here we use mouse as a model and implemented a scheme of breadth study to examine the pan-organ proteome for potential variations of organ specificity in different genetic backgrounds. Using reasonable resources, we generated pan-organ proteomes of four in-bred mouse strains. The results revealed a large diversity that is more profound among OSPs than the overall proteomes. We defined a robustness score to quantify such variation and derived three sets of OSPs with different stringencies. In the meantime, we found that the enriched biological functions of OSPs are also organ specific that are sensitive and useful to assess the quality of OSPs. We hope our breadth study can open doors to explore the molecular diversity and dynamics of organ specificity at the protein level.",

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed progressive mixing of luminal-basal lineage features after tumor suppressor gene deletion, accompanied by activation of Jak/Stat and Fgfr pathway signaling and interferon-a and -g gene expression programs prior to any morphologic changes. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Jak1/2 in combination with FGFR blockade restored luminal differentiation and sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy in models with residual AR expression. Collectively, we show lineage plasticity initiates quickly as a largely cell-autonomous process and, through newly developed computational approaches, identify a pharmacological strategy that restores lineage identity using clinical grade inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVisceral obesity is a critical determinant of severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this study, we performed a comprehensive histomorphologic analysis of autoptic visceral adipose tissues (VAT), lungs and livers of 19 COVID-19 and 23 non-COVID-19 subjects.\n\nResultsAlthough there were no between-groups differences in body-mass-index and adipocytes size, higher prevalence of CD68+ macrophages in COVID-19 subjects VAT was detected (p=0.005) and accompanied by crown-like structures presence, signs of adipocytes stress and death. Consistently, human adipocytes were successfully infected by SARS-CoV2 in vitro and displayed lower cell viability. Being VAT inflammation associated with lipids spill-over from dead adipocytes, we studied lipids distribution employing Oil-Red-O staining (ORO). Lipids were observed within lungs and livers interstitial spaces, macrophages, endothelial cells, and vessels lumen, features suggestive of fat embolism syndrome, more prevalent among COVID-19 individuals (p<0.001). Notably, signs of fat embolism were more prevalent among obese (p=0.03) independently of COVID-19 diagnosis, suggesting that such condition may be an obesity complication, exacerbated by SARS-CoV2 infection. Importantly, all infected subjects lungs presented lipids-rich (ORO+) hyaline membranes, formations associated with COVID-19-related pneumonia, present only in one control with non-COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nConclusionsThis study describes for the first time novel COVID-19-related features possibly underlying the unfavorable prognosis in obese SARS-CoV2-infected-subjects.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their role in cellular energy production, mitochondria are increasingly recognized as regulators of the innate immune response of phagocytes. Here, we demonstrate that altering expression levels of the mitochondria associated enzyme, cytidine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2), disrupts mitochondrial physiology and significantly de-regulates the resting immune homeostasis of macrophages. Both CMPK2 silenced as well as constitutively over expressing macrophage lines portray mitochondrial stress with marked depolarization of their membrane potential, enhanced ROS and disturbed architecture culminating in the enhanced expression of the pro-inflammatory genes-IL1{beta}, TNF and IL8. Interestingly, the long-term modulation of CMPK2 expression resulted in an increased glycolytic flux of macrophages akin to the altered physiological state of activated M1 macrophages. While infection induced inflammation for restricting pathogens is regulated, our observation of a total dysregulation of basal inflammation by bidirectional alteration of CMPK2 expression, only highlights a critical role of this gene in mitochondria mediated control of inflammation.",

This study curated an atlas of human viruses from public databases and literatures, and built the Human Virus Database (HVD) available at http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/. The HVD contains 1,131 virus species of 54 viral families which were more than twice the number of the human-infecting virus species reported in previous studies. These viruses were identified in human samples including 68 human tissues, the excreta and body fluid. The viral diversity in humans was age-dependent with a peak in the infant and a valley in the teenager. The tissue range of viruses was found to be associated with several factors including the viral group (DNA, RNA or reverse-transcribing viruses), enveloped or not, viral genome length and GC content, viral receptors and the virus-interacting proteins. Finally, the tissue range of DNA viruses was predicted using a random-forest algorithm with a medium performance. Overall, the study not only provides a valuable resource for further studies of human viruses, but also deepens our understanding towards the diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism is key to cellular processes that underlie the ability of a virus to productively infect. Polyamines are small metabolites vital for many host cell processes including proliferation, transcription, and translation. Polyamine depletion also inhibits virus infection via diverse mechanisms, including inhibiting polymerase activity and viral translation. We showed that Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) attachment requires polyamines; however, the mechanism was unknown. Here, we report polyamines involvement in translation, through a process called hypusination, promotes expression of cholesterol synthesis genes by supporting SREBP2 translation, the master transcriptional regulator of cholesterol synthesis genes. Measuring bulk transcription, we found polyamines support expression of cholesterol synthesis genes, regulated by SREBP2. Polyamine depletion inhibits CVB3 by depleting cellular cholesterol. Exogenous cholesterol rescues CVB3 attachment, and mutant CVB3 resistant to polyamine depletion exhibits resistance to cholesterol perturbation. This study provides a novel link between polyamine and cholesterol homeostasis, a mechanism through which polyamines impact CVB3 infection.",

    "abstract": "Genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes expressing anti-plasmodial effectors propagating through wild mosquito populations by means of gene drive is a promising tool to support current malaria control strategies. The process of generating GM mosquitoes involves genetic transformation of mosquitoes from a laboratory colony and, often, interbreeding with other GM lines to cross in auxiliary traits. These mosquito colonies and GM lines thus often have different genetic backgrounds and GM lines are invariably highly inbred, which in conjunction with their independent rearing in the laboratory may translate to differences in their susceptibility to malaria parasite infection and life history traits. Here, we show that laboratory Anopheles gambiae colonies and GM lines expressing Cas9 and Cre recombinase vary greatly in their susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum NF54 infection. Therefore, the choice of mosquitoes to be used as a reference when conducting infection or life history trait assays requires careful consideration. To address these issues, we established an experimental pipeline involving genetic crosses and genotyping of mosquitoes reared in shared containers throughout their lifecycle. We used this protocol to examine whether GM lines expressing the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) Scorpine in the mosquito midgut interfere with parasite infection and mosquito survival. We demonstrate that Scorpine expression in the Peritrophin 1 (Aper1) genomic locus reduces both P. falciparum sporozoite prevalence and mosquito lifespan; both these phenotypes are likely to be associated with the disturbance of the midgut microbiota homeostasis. These data lead us to conclude that the Aper1-Sco GM line could be used in proof-of-concept experiments aimed at mosquito population replacement, although the impact of its reduced fitness on the spread of the transgene through wild populations requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic tolerance is typically associated with a phenotypic change within a bacterial population, resulting in a transient decrease in antibiotic susceptibility that can contribute to treatment failure and recurrent infections. Although tolerant cells may emerge prior to treatment, the stress of prolonged antibiotic exposure can also promote tolerance. Here, we sought to determine how Yersinia pseudotuberculosis responds to doxycycline exposure, to then verify if these gene expression changes could promote doxycycline tolerance in culture and in our mouse model of infection. Only four genes were differentially regulated in response to a physiologically-relevant dose of doxycycline: osmB and ompF were upregulated, tusB and cnfy were downregulated; differential expression also occurred during doxycycline treatment in the mouse. ompF, tusB and cnfy were also differentially regulated in response to chloramphenicol, indicating these could be general responses to ribosomal inhibition. cnfy has previously been associated with persistence and was not a major focus here. We found deletion of the OmpF porin resulted in increased antibiotic accumulation, suggesting expression may promote diffusion of doxycycline out of the cell, while OsmB lipoprotein had a minor impact on antibiotic permeability. Overexpression of tusB significantly impaired bacterial survival in culture and in the mouse, suggesting that tRNA modification by tusB, and the resulting impacts on translational machinery, may play an important role in promoting tolerance. We believe this is the first observation of bactericidal activity of doxycycline, which was revealed by reversing tusB downregulation.",

Broad-spectrum antibiotics and vancomycin alone accelerated disease in weanling SPF mdr2-/- mice, indicating that vancomycin-sensitive resident microbiota protect against hepatobiliary disease. Vancomycin treatment selectively decreased Lachnospiraceae and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) but expanded Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. Antibiotics increased cytolysin-expressing E. faecalis and E. coli liver translocation; colonization of gnotobiotic mdr2-/- mice with translocated E. faecalis and E. coli strains accelerated liver inflammation and mortality. Lachnospiraceae colonization of antibiotic pre-treated mdr2-/- mice reduced liver fibrosis, inflammation and translocation of pathobionts, while Lachnospiraceae-produced SCFA decreased fibrosis. Fecal E. faecalis/ Enterobacteriaceae was positively and Lachnospiraceae was negatively associated with PSC patients clinical severity Mayo risk scores.\n\nConclusionsWe identified specific functionally protective and detrimental resident bacterial species in mdr2-/- mice and PSC patients with associated clinical outcomes.

    "abstract": "Many animal species are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially act as reservoirs, yet transmission of the virus in non-human free-living animals has not been documented. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), the predominant cervid in North America, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and experimentally infected fawns can transmit the virus. To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may be circulating in deer, we tested 283 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples collected from 151 free-living and 132 captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through December of 2020 for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Ninety-four of the 283 deer (33.2%; 95% CI: 28, 38.9) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as assessed by RT-PCR. Notably, between November 23, 2020 and January 10, 2021, 80 of 97 (82.5%; 95% CI 73.7, 88.8) RPLN samples had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Whole genome sequencing of the 94 positive RPLN samples identified 12 SARS-CoV-2 lineages, with B.1.2 (n = 51; 54.5%), and B.1.311 (n = 19; 20%) accounting for ~75% of all samples. The geographic distribution and nesting of clusters of deer and human lineages strongly suggest multiple zooanthroponotic spillover events and deer-to-deer transmission. The discovery of sylvatic and enzootic SARS-CoV-2 transmission in deer has important implications for the ecology and long-term persistence, as well as the potential for spillover to other animals and spillback into humans. These findings highlight an urgent need for a robust and proactive \"One Health\" approach to obtaining a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOne-Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 was detected in one-third of sampled white-tailed deer in Iowa between September 2020 and January of 2021 that likely resulted from multiple human-to-deer spillover and deer-to-deer transmission events.",

We used Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 virus and meat processing facility drain samples to develop mixed-species biofilms on commonly found materials in processing facilities (Stainless-Steel (SS), PVC and tiles).

There was no significate difference between the viral-environmental biofilm biovolumes developed on different materials SS, PVC, and tiles. There was a 2-fold increase in the virus-environmental biofilm biovolume when compared to environmental biofilm by itself.

Here, we generated 13,437 yeast variants, each with an ATG triplet placed downstream (dATGs) of the annotated ATG (aATG) codon of green fluorescent protein. We found that out-of-frame dATGs could inhibit translation at the aATG, but with diminishing strength over increasing distance between aATG and dATG, undetectable beyond [~]17 nt. Computational simulations revealed that each triplet is scanned back and forth approximately [~]10 times until an AUG codon is recognized. Collectively, our findings uncover the basic process by which eukaryotic ribosomes scan for initiation codons, and how this process could shape eukaryotic genome evolution and influence cancer development.",

    "abstract": "The widely expressed microfibril-forming collagen VI is subject to proteolytic cleavage and it has been proposed that the cleaved off C-terminal Kunitz domain (C5) of the 3 chain is an adipokine important for tumor progression and fibrosis. Under the name \"endotrophin\" the C5 fragment has also been shown to be a potent biomarker for fibro-inflammatory diseases. However, the biochemical mechanisms behind endotrophin activity have not been investigated. In earlier studies, the anthrax toxin receptor 1 was found to bind to C5, but this potential interaction has not been further studied. Given the proposed physiological role of endotrophin we aimed to determine how the endotrophin signal is transmitted to the recipient cells. Surprisingly, we could not detect any interaction between endotrophin and anthrax toxin receptor 1 or its close relative, anthrax toxin receptor 2. Moreover, we could not detect binding of fully assembled collagen VI to either anthrax toxin receptor. We also performed similar experiments with the collagen VI surface receptor NG2 (CSPG4). We could confirm that NG2 is a collagen VI receptor that binds to assembled collagen VI, but not to the cleaved C5/endotrophin. A cellular receptor for C5/endotrophin therefore still remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Competitive interactions between pathogen strains drive infection risk. Vaccines are thought to perturb strain diversity through shifts in immune pressures, however, this has rarely been measured due to inadequate data and analytical tools. Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), responsible for 160,000 deaths annually1, provides a rare natural experiment as many countries have switched from whole cell vaccines to acellular vaccines, which have very different immunogenic properties2,3. Here we use 3,344 sequences from 23 countries and build phylogenetic models to reveal that B. pertussis has substantial diversity within communities, with the relative fitness of local genotypes changing in response to switches in vaccine policy. We demonstrate that the number of transmission chains circulating within subnational regions is strongly associated with host population size. It takes 5-10 years for individual lineages to be homogeneously distributed throughout Europe or the United States. Increased fitness of pertactin-deficient strains following implementation of acellular vaccines, but reduced fitness otherwise, can explain long-term genotype dynamics. These findings highlight the role of national vaccine policies in shifting local diversity of a pathogen that still poses a large burden on global public health.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to characterize the genetic relationships within and among four neighboring populations in northern Kenya in light of cultural relationships to understand the extent to which geography and culture shape patterns of genetic variation.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe collected DNA and demographic information pertaining to aspects of social identity and heritage from 572 individuals across the Turkana, Samburu, Waso Borana, and Rendille of northern Kenya. We sampled individuals across a total of nine clans from these four groups and, additionally, three territorial sections within the Turkana and successfully genotyped 376 individuals.\n\nResultsHere we report that geography predominately shapes genetic variation within and among human groups in northern Kenya. We observed a clinal pattern of genetic variation that mirrors the overall geographic distribution of the individuals we sampled. We also found relatively higher rates of intermarriage between the Rendille and Samburu and evidence of gene flow between them that reflect these higher rates of intermarriage. Among the Turkana, we observed strong recent genetic substructuring based on territorial section affiliation. Within ethnolinguistic groups, we found that Y chromosome haplotypes do not consistently cluster by natal clan affiliation. Finally, we found that sampled populations that are geographically closer have lower genetic differentiation, and that cultural similarity does not predict genetic similarity as a whole across these northern Kenyan populations.\n\nDiscussionOverall, the results from this study highlight the importance of geography, even on a local geographic scale, in shaping observed patterns of genetic variation in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are organelles that produce cellular energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, and this primary function is conserved between many taxa. Locomotion is a trait that is highly reliant on metabolic function and expected to be greatly affected by disruptions to mitochondrial performance. To this end, we aimed to examine how activity and sleep vary between Drosophila melanogaster strains with different geographic origins, how these patterns are affected by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation, and how breaking up co-evolved mito-nuclear gene combinations affect the studied activity traits. The results demonstrate that Drosophila strains from different locations differ in sleep and activity, and the extent of variation differs between sexes, females in general being more active. By comparing activity and sleep of mtDNA variants introgressed onto a common nuclear background in cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) strains, we establish that mtDNA variation affects both traits, sex specifically. Furthermore, by using previously published mtDNA copy number data, we detected a positive correlation between mtDNA copy number and the activity levels of the cybrid flies. Altogether, our study shows that both mtDNA variation and mitonuclear interactions affect activity and sleep patterns, highlighting the important role that both genomes play on life-history trait evolution.",

    "abstract": "Programmable and multiplexed genome integration of large, diverse DNA cargo independent of DNA repair remains an unsolved challenge of genome editing. Current gene integration approaches require double-strand breaks that evoke DNA damage responses and rely on repair pathways that are inactive in terminally differentiated cells. Furthermore, CRISPR-based approaches that bypass double stranded breaks, such as Prime editing, are limited to modification or insertion of short sequences. We present Programmable Addition via Site-specific Targeting Elements, or PASTE, which achieves efficient and versatile gene integration at diverse loci by directing insertion with a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase fused to both a reverse transcriptase and serine integrase. Without generating double stranded breaks, we demonstrate integration of sequences as large as [~]36 kb with rates between 10-50% at multiple genomic loci across three human cell lines, primary T cells, and quiescent non-dividing primary human hepatocytes. To further improve PASTE, we discover thousands of novel serine integrases and cognate attachment sites from metagenomes and engineer active orthologs for high-efficiency integration using PASTE. We apply PASTE to fluorescent tagging of proteins, integration of therapeutically relevant genes, and production and secretion of transgenes. Leveraging the orthogonality of serine integrases, we engineer PASTE for multiplexed gene integration, simultaneously integrating three different genes at three genomic loci. PASTE has editing efficiencies comparable to or better than those of homology directed repair or non-homologous end joining based integration, with activity in non-dividing cells and fewer detectable off-target events. For therapeutic applications, PASTE can be delivered as mRNA with synthetically modified guides to programmably direct insertion of DNA templates carried by AAV or adenoviral vectors. PASTE expands the capabilities of genome editing via drag-and-drop gene integration, offering a platform with wide applicability for research, cell engineering, and gene therapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA new technology combining CRISPR-mediated genome editing and site-specific integrases enables efficient programmable gene integration at any targeted genomic locus without double-strand DNA breaks, leading to broad applications in basic science research, cell engineering, and gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Intractable cancers such as osteosarcoma (OS) and oral cancer (OC) are highly refractory, recurrent, and metastatic once developed, and their prognosis is still disappointing. Tumor-targeted therapy eliminating cancers effectively and safely is the current clinical choice. Since aggressive tumors have inherent or acquired resistance to multidisciplinary therapies targeting apoptosis, tumor-specific induction of another cell death modality is a promising avenue to meet the goal. Here, we report that a cold atmospheric air plasma-activated medium (APAM) can induce cell death in OS and OC via a unique mitochondrial clustering. This event was named monopolar perinuclear mitochondrial clustering (MPMC) because of the characteristic unipolar mitochondrial perinuclear aggregation. APAM had potent antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. APAM caused apoptosis, necrotic cell death, and autophagy. APAM contained hydrogen peroxide and increased mitochondrial ROS (mROS), while the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented cell death. MPMC occurred following mitochondrial fragmentation coinciding with nuclear damages. MPMC was accompanied by the tubulin network remodeling and mitochondrial lipid peroxide (mLPO) accumulation and prevented by NAC and the microtubule inhibitor, Nocodazole. Increased Cardiolipin (CL) oxidation was also seen, and NAC and the peroxy radical scavenger Ferrostatin-1 prevented it. In contrast, in fibroblasts, APAM induced minimal cell death, mROS generation, mLPO accumulation, CL oxidation, and MPMC. These results suggest that MPMC is a tumor-specific cause of cell death via mitochondrial oxidative stress and microtubule-driven mitochondrial motility. MPMC might serve as a promising target for exerting tumor-specific cytotoxicity.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/466636v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1118e2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18cf99corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57a7edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d1f447_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

As the public health burden of NASH worsens due to evolving lifestyle habits, pathology laboratory resources will become increasingly strained due to rising demand for specialized stains. Virtual staining processes, computational methods which can synthesize the application of chemical staining reagents, can potentially provide resource savings by obviating the need to acquire specialized stains. Virtual staining technologies are assessed by comparing virtual and real tissue stains for their realism and ability to stage. However, these assessment methods are rife with statistical mistreatment of observed phenomena that are difficult to account for. Bridge category ratings represent a phenomenon where a pathologist may assign two adjacent stages simultaneously, which may bias and/or reduce the power of research findings. Such stage assignments were frequently reported in a large-scale assessment of Virtual Trichrome technologies yet were unaccounted for since no statistical adjustment procedures existed. In this work, we provide an updated assessment of Virtual Trichrome technologies using Bridge Category Models, which account for these bridge ratings. We report that two of four pathologists tended to assign lower Fibrosis stages to virtually stained tissue while the other two pathologists assigned similar stages. These research findings differ when bridge ratings are not accounted for. While promising, these results indicate further room for algorithmic finetuning of Virtual Trichrome technologies.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTargeted regulation of transfected extra-chromosomal plasmid DNA typically requires the integration of 9 - 20 bp docking sites into the plasmid. Here, we report an elegant approach, The Dpn Adaptor Linked Effector (DAL-E) system, to target fusion proteins to 6-methyladenosine in GATC, which appears frequently in popular eukaryotic expression vectors and is absent from endogenous genomic DNA. Methods: The DNA-binding region from the DpnI endonuclease binds 6-methyladenosine within the GATC motif. We used a Dpn-transcriptional activator (DPN7-TA) fusion to induce gene expression from transiently transfected pDNAs.\n\nResultsWe validated methylation-dependent activity of DPN7-TA with a panel of target pDNAs. We observed stronger transactivation when GATC targets were located upstream of the transcriptional start site in the target pDNA. Conclusion: DAL-E, consisting of a 108 aa, 12 kD DNA-binding adaptor and a 4 bp recognition site, offers a genetically-tractable, tunable system that can potentially be redesigned to recruit a variety of regulators (e.g. activators, silencers, epigenome editors) to transfected plasmid DNA.\n\nLAY SUMMARYTransfection of plasmid DNA (pDNA) is a commonly used method for introducing exogenous genetic material into mammalian cells. Once introduced into cells not all pDNAs express this genetic material at sufficient levels. Current techniques to improve transgene expression are limited and are not always feasible for all plasmids. This report presents a new method to improve gene expression from pDNA. The Dpn Adaptor Linked Effector (DAL-E) binds to methylated adenines in the pDNA resulting in increased expression. This technique has exciting implications for improved genetic engineering of mammalian cells.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=124 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/466616v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1116db0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1386f99org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26c63corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a09673_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 appears to be a robust mechanistic correlate of protection across the three vaccine platforms although not capturing the whole biological vaccine effect. The model shows that RBD/ACE2 binding inhibition represents a strong mechanism of protection which required significant reduction in blocking potency to effectively compromise the control of viral replication.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA framework for modelling the immune control of viral dynamics is applied to quantify the effect of several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms and to define mechanistic correlates of protection.",

    "abstract": "The ability of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) to switch between latent and lytic infection is key to its long-term persistence, yet the molecular mechanisms behind this switch remain unclear. To investigate transcriptional events during the latent to lytic switch we utilized Precision nuclear Run On followed by deep Sequencing (PRO-Seq) to map cellular RNA polymerase (Pol) activity to single-nucleotide resolution on the host and EBV genome in three different models of EBV latency and reactivation. In latently infected Mutu I Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) cells, Pol activity was enriched at the Qp promoter, the EBER region and the BHLF1/LF3 transcripts. Upon reactivation with phorbol ester and sodium butyrate, early phase Pol activity occurred bidirectionally at CTCF sites within the LMP-2A, EBER-1 and RPMS1 loci. PRO-Seq analysis of Akata cells reactivated from latency with anti-IgG and a lymphoblastoid cell-line (LCL) reactivated with small molecule C60 showed a similar pattern of early bidirectional transcription initiating around CTCF binding sites, although the specific CTCF sites and viral genes were different for each latency model. The functional importance of CTCF binding, transcription and reactivation was confirmed using an EBV mutant lacking the LMP-2A CTCF binding site. This virus was unable to reactivate and had disrupted Pol activity at multiple CTCF binding sites relative to WT virus. Overall, these data suggest that CTCF regulates the viral early transcripts during reactivation from latency. These activities likely help maintain the accessibility of the viral genome to initiate productive replication.\n\nAuthor summaryThe ability of EBV to switch between latent and lytic infection is key to its long-term persistence in memory B-cells and its ability to persist in proliferating cells is strongly linked to oncogenesis. During latency, most viral genes are epigenetically silenced, and the virus must overcome this repression to reactivate lytic replication. Reactivation occurs once the immediate early (IE) EBV lytic genes are expressed. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the switch from the latent transcriptional program to begin transcription of the IE genes remain unknown. In this study, we mapped RNA polymerase (Pol) positioning and activity during latency and reactivation. Unexpectedly, Pol activity was not enriched at the IE genes immediately after reactivation but accumulated at distinct regions characteristic of transcription initiation on the EBV genome previously shown to be associated with CTCF. We propose that CTCF binding at these regions retains Pol to maintain a stable latent chromosome conformation and a rapid response to various reactivation signals.",

    "abstract": "African trypanosomes, such as Trypanosoma brucei, are flagellated protozoa which proliferate in mammals and cause a variety of diseases in people and animals. In a mammalian host, the external face of the African trypanosome plasma membrane is covered by a densely packed coat formed of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which counteracts the host adaptive immune response by antigenic variation. The VSG is attached to the external face of the plasma membrane by covalent attachment of the C-terminus to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol. As the trypanosome grows, newly synthesised VSG is added to the plasma membrane by vesicle fusion to the flagellar pocket, the sole location of exo- and endocytosis. Snake venoms contain dozens of components including proteases and phospholipases. Here, we investigated the effect of Naja nigricollis on T. brucei with the aim of describing the response of the trypanosome to hydrolytic attack on the VSG. We found no evidence for VGS hydrolysis however N. nigricollis venom caused: (i) an enlargement of the flagellar pocket, (ii) the Rab11 positive endosomal compartments to adopt an abnormal dispersed localisation, and (iii) a cell cycle arrest prior to cytokinesis. A single protein family, the phospholipases A2s present in N. nigricollis venom, was necessary and sufficient for the effects. This study provides new molecular insight into T. brucei biology and possibly describes mechanisms that could be exploited for T. brucei targeting.",

    "abstract": "In response to environmental stresses such as starvation, many bacteria facultatively aggregate into multicellular structures that can attain new metabolic functions and behaviors. Despite the ubiquity and relevance of this form of collective behavior, we lack an understanding of how the spatiotemporal dynamics of aggregate development emerge from cellular physiology. Here, we show that the coupling between growth and spatial gradient formation leads to the emergence of a complex lifecycle, akin to those known for multicellular bacteria. Under otherwise carbon-limited growth conditions, the marine bacterium Vibrio splendidus 12B01 forms multicellular groups to collectively harvest carbon from the brown-algal polysaccharide alginate. This is achieved during growth on dissolved alginate polymer through formation of spherical, clonal clusters of cells that grow up to 40 {micro}m in radius. Clusters develop striking spatial patterning as they grow due to phenotypic differentiation of sub-populations into a  shell of static cells surrounding a motile  core. Combining in situ measurements of cell physiology with transcriptomics, we show that shell cells express adhesive type IV pili, while motile core cells express carbon storage granules. The emergence of shell and core phenotypes is cued by opposing gradients of carbon and nitrogen that form within cell clusters due to local metabolic activity. Eventually, the shell ruptures, releasing the carbon-storing core, and we show that carbon-storing cells more readily propagate on alginate than non-carbon storing cells. We propose that phenotypic differentiation promotes the resilience of 12B01 groups by enabling clonal groups to grow larger and propagate more effectively. Phenotypic differentiation may be a widespread, but overlooked, strategy among bacteria to enhance resilience in the context of resource limitation.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends artemisinin (ART) combinations for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Understanding the interaction between co-administered drugs within combination therapies is clinically important to prevent unintended consequences. The WHO guidelines recommend second line treatments that combine artesunate with tetracycline, doxycycline, or clindamycin--antibiotics that target the Plasmodium relict plastid, the apicoplast. In addition, antibiotics can be used simultaneously against other infectious diseases, leading to their inadvertent combination with ARTs. One consequence of apicoplast inhibition is a perturbation to haemoglobin uptake and trafficking--a pathway required for activation of ART derivatives. Here, we show that apicoplast-targeting antibiotics reduce the abundance of the catalyst of ART activation (free haem) in P. falciparum, likely through diminished haemoglobin digestion. We demonstrate antagonism between ART and these antibiotics, suggesting that apicoplast inhibitors reduce ART activation. These data have potential clinical implications due to the reliance on--and widespread use of--both ARTs and these antibiotics in malaria endemic regions.",

    "abstract": "N-terminal acetylation is a common eukaryotic protein modification that involves the addition of an acetyl group to the N-terminus of a polypeptide. This modification is largely performed by cytosolic N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). Most associate with the ribosome, acetylating nascent polypeptides co-translationally. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, exported effectors are translated into the ER, processed by the aspartic protease plasmepsin V and then N-acetylated, despite having no clear access to cytosolic NATs. Here, we used post-transcriptional knockdown to investigate the most obvious candidate, Pf3D7_1437000. We found that it co-localizes with the ER-resident plasmepsin V and is required for parasite growth. However, depletion of Pf3D7_1437000 had no effect on protein export or acetylation of the exported proteins HRP2 and HRP3. Pf3D7_1437000-depleted parasites arrested later in their development cycle than export-blocked parasites, suggesting the proteins essential role is distinct from protein export.",

Orthoreoviruses, one of the 15 recognized genera in the Reoviridae family, can infect humans and nearly all mammals, and birds. Genomic characterization of reoviruses has not been adopted on a large-scale due to the complexity of obtaining sequences for all 10 segments.\n\nResultsIn this study, we developed a time-efficient, and practical method to enrich reovirus sequencing reads from isolates that allowed for full genome recovery using single-primer amplification method coupled with next generation sequencing. We refer to this protocol as reovirus-Single Primer Amplification (R-SPA). Our results demonstrated that most of the genes were covered with at least 500 reads per base space. Furthermore, R-SPA covered both 5 and 3 end of each reovirus genes.\n\nConclusionA universal and fast amplification protocol that yields double-stranded cDNA in sufficient abundance and facilitates and expedites the whole genome sequencing of reoviruses was presented in this study.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria have massively contributed to carbonate deposit formation over the geological history. They are traditionally thought to biomineralize CaCO3 extracellularly as an indirect byproduct of photosynthesis. However, the recent discovery of freshwater cyanobacteria forming intracellular amorphous calcium carbonates (iACC) challenges this view. Despite the geochemical interest of such a biomineralization process, its molecular mechanisms and evolutionary history remain elusive. Here, using comparative genomics, we identify a new gene (ccyA) and protein (calcyanin) family specifically associated with cyanobacterial iACC biomineralization. Calcyanin is composed of a conserved C-terminal domain, which likely adopts an original fold, and a variable N-terminal domain whose structure allows differentiating 4 major types among the 35 known calcyanin homologues. Calcyanin lacks detectable full-length homologs with known function. Yet, genetic and comparative genomic analyses suggest a possible involvement in Ca homeostasis, making this gene family a particularly interesting target for future functional studies. Whatever its function, this new gene family appears as a gene diagnostic of intracellular calcification in cyanobacteria. By searching for ccyA in publicly available genomes, we identified 13 additional cyanobacterial strains forming iACC. This significantly extends our knowledge about the phylogenetic and environmental distribution of cyanobacterial iACC biomineralization, especially with the detection of multicellular genera as well as a marine species. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that iACC biomineralization is ancient, with independent losses in various lineages and some HGT cases that resulted in the broad but patchy distribution of calcyanin across modern cyanobacteria. Overall, iACC biomineralization emerges as a new case of genetically controlled biomineralization in bacteria.\n\nSignificance statementFew freshwater species of Cyanobacteria have been known to mineralize amorphous CaCO3 (ACC) intracellularly. Despite the geochemical interest of this biomineralization, its evolutionary history and molecular mechanism remain poorly known. Here, we report the discovery of a new gene family that has no homolog with known function, which proves to be a good diagnostic marker of this process. It allowed to find cyanobacteria in several phyla and environments such as seawater, where ACC biomineralization had not been reported before. Moreover, this gene is ancient and was independently lost in various lineages with some later horizontal transfers, resulting in a broad and patchy phylogenetic distribution in modern cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Living organisms are typically composed of various tissues with microscopic cell-scale stiffness-heterogeneity, in which some cells receive dynamically fluctuating mechanical stimuli from the heterogeneous extracellular milieu during long-term movement. Although intracellular stress dynamics (ISD), which are closely related to the regulation of cell functions such as proliferation and differentiation, can be characteristically modulated in cells migrating on a matrix with stiffness-heterogeneity, it has been unclear how the mode of fluctuation of ISD affects cell functions. In the present study, we demonstrate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) dual-durotaxing (i.e., both forward and reverse durotaxis) on microelastically-patterned gels with stiff triangular domains markedly amplify the fluctuation of ISD, nuclear shape, and the spatial distribution of chromatins, which makes the cells remain far from tensional equilibrium. We provide evidence that amplified chromatin fluctuation in the dual-durotaxing MSCs can cause activation of cellular vigor and maintenance of the stemness.",

Remarkably, IT rMVA depletes OX40hi regulatory T cells via OX40L/OX40 interaction and IFNAR signaling.

    "abstract": "Sandy beaches are biogeochemical hotspots that bridge marine and terrestrial ecosystems via the transfer of marine organic matter, such as seaweed (termed wrack). A keystone of this unique ecosystem is the microbial community, which helps to degrade wrack and re-mineralize nutrients. However, little is known about the wrackbed microbiome, its composition, trophic ecology, or how it varies over time and space. Here we characterize the wrackbed microbiome as well as the microbiome of a primary consumer, the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida, and examine how they change along one of the most studied ecological gradients in the world, the transition from the marine North Sea to the brackish Baltic Sea. We found that polysaccharide degraders dominated both the wrackbed and seaweed fly microbiomes but there were still consistent differences between wrackbed and fly samples. Furthermore, we observed a shift in both microbial communities and functionality between the North and Baltic Sea. These shifts were mostly due to changes in the frequency of different groups of known polysaccharide degraders (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota). We hypothesize that microbes were selected for their abilities to degrade different polysaccharides corresponding to a shift in polysaccharide content in the seaweed communities of the North vs. Baltic Sea. Our results reveal the complexities of both the wracked microbial community, with different groups specialized to different roles, and the cascading trophic consequences of shifts in the near shore algal community.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria in the coral microbiome play a crucial role in determining coral health and fitness, and the coral host often restructures its microbiome composition in response to external factors. An important but often neglected factor determining this microbiome restructuring is the capacity of microbiome members to adapt to a new environment. To address this issue, we examined how the microbiome structure of Acropora muricata corals changed over 9 months following a reciprocal transplant experiment. Using a combination of metabarcoding, genomics, and comparative genomics approaches, we found that coral colonies separated by a small distance harbored different dominant Endozoicomonas related phylotypes belonging to two different species, including a novel species, Candidatus Endozoicomonas penghunesis 4G, whose chromosome level (complete) genome was also sequenced in this study. Furthermore, the two dominant Endozoicomonas species showed varied adaptation capabilities when coral colonies were transplanted in a new environment. The differential adaptation capabilities of dominant members of the microbiome can a) provide distinct advantages to coral hosts when subjected to changing environmental conditions and b) have positive implications for future reefs.",
