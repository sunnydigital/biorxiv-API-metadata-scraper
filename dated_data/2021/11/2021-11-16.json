    "abstract": "It has been proposed that semantic systems evolve under pressure for efficiency. This hypothesis has so far been supported largely indirectly, by synchronic cross-language comparison, rather than directly by diachronic data. Here, we directly test this hypothesis in the domain of color naming, by analyzing recent diachronic data from Nafaanra, a language of Ghana and Cote dIvoire, and comparing it with quantitative predictions derived from the mathematical theory of efficient data compression. We show that color naming in Nafaanra has changed over the past four decades while remaining near-optimally efficient, and that this outcome would be unlikely under a random drift process that maintains structured color categories without pressure for efficiency. To our knowledge, this finding provides the first direct evidence that color naming evolves under pressure for efficiency, supporting the hypothesis that efficiency shapes the evolution of the lexicon.",

    "abstract": "Chemolithoautotrophic manganese oxidation has long been theorized, but only recently demonstrated in a bacterial co-culture. The majority member of the co-culture, Candidatus Manganitrophus noduliformans, is a distinct but not yet isolated lineage in the phylum Nitrospirota (Nitrospirae). Here, we established two additional MnCO3-oxidizing cultures using inocula from Santa Barbara (USA) and Boetsap (South Africa). Both cultures were dominated by strains of a new species, designated Candidatus Manganitrophus morganii. The next abundant members differed in the available cultures, suggesting that while Ca. Manganitrophus species have not been isolated in pure culture, they may not require a specific syntrophic relationship with another species. Phylogeny of cultivated Ca. Manganitrophus and related metagenome-assembled genomes revealed a coherent taxonomic family, Candidatus Manganitrophaceae, from both freshwater and marine environments and distributed globally. Comparative genomic analyses support this family being Mn(II)-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs. Among the 895 shared genes were a subset of those hypothesized for Mn(II) oxidation (Cyc2 and PCC_1) and oxygen reduction (TO_1 and TO_2) that could facilitate Mn(II) lithotrophy. An unusual, plausibly reverse Complex 1 containing 2 additional pumping subunits was also shared by the family, as were genes for the reverse TCA carbon fixation cycle, which could enable Mn(II) autotrophy. All members of the family lacked genes for nitrification found in Nitrospira species. The results suggest that Ca. Manganitrophaceae share a core set of candidate genes for the newly discovered manganese dependent chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle, and likely have a broad, global distribution.\n\nImportanceManganese (Mn) is an abundant redox-active metal that cycled in many of Earths biomes. While diverse bacteria and archaea have been demonstrated to respire Mn(III/IV), only recently have bacteria been implicated in Mn(II) oxidation dependent growth. Here, two new Mn(II)-oxidizing enrichment cultures originated from two continents and hemispheres were examined. By comparing the community composition of the enrichments and performing phylogenomic analysis on the abundant Nitrospirota therein, new insights are gleaned on cell interactions, taxonomy, and machineries that may underlie Mn(II)-based lithotrophy and autotrophy.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays important roles in forming cellular membraneless organelles. However, how host factors regulate LLPS of viral proteins during negative-sense RNA (NSR) virus infections is largely unknown. Here, we used Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV) as a model to demonstrate regulation of host casein kinase 1 in phase separation and infection of NSR viruses. We first found that the BYSMV phosphoprotein (P) formed spherical granules with liquid properties and recruited viral nucleotide (N) and polymerase (L) proteins in vivo. Moreover, the P-formed granules were tethered to the ER/actin network for trafficking and fusion. BYSMV P alone formed droplets and incorporated the N protein and genomic RNA in vitro. Interestingly, phase separation of BYSMV P was inhibited by host casein kinase 1 (CK1)-dependent phosphorylation of an intrinsically disordered P protein region. Genetic assays demonstrated that the unphosphorylated mutant of BYSMV P exhibited condensed phase, which promoted virus replication through concentrating the N, L proteins, and genome RNA into viroplasms. Whereas, the phosphorylation-mimic mutant existed in diffuse phase state leading to enhanced virus transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate that host CK1 modulates phase separation of viral P protein and virus infection.",

    "abstract": "Locusts and grasshoppers are one of the most dangerous agricultural pests. Environmentally benign microbial pesticides are increasingly desirable for controlling locust outbreaks in fragile ecosystems. Here we use metagenomic sequencing to profile the rich viral communities in 34 grasshopper species and report 322 viruses, including 202 novel species. Most of the identified viruses are related to other insect viruses and some are targeted by antiviral RNAi pathway, indicating they infect grasshoppers. Some plant/fungi/vertebrate associated viruses are also abundant in our samples. Our analysis of relationships between host and virus phylogenies suggests that the composition of viromes is closely allied with host evolution, and there is significant phylogenetic relatedness between grasshoppers and viruses from Lispiviridae, Partitiviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Virgaviridae and Flaviviridae. Overall, this study is a thorough exploration of viruses in grasshoppers and provide an essential evolutionary and ecological context for host-virus interaction in Acridoidea.\n\nAuthor SummaryLocusts are the most destructive migratory pest in the world and continue to cause massive damages that endanger food security and threaten millions of people in 21st century. While chemical pesticides are still heavily relied on, biological pesticides developed from natural pathogens offer a reliable, less harmful alternative for controlling locust outbreaks in fragile ecosystems. Unfortunately, little is known about natural pathogens infecting this pest. In this study, we profile the viral communities in 34 grasshopper species include some major swarming species. While we identified as many as 202 novel viral species associated with grasshoppers, some of them are of potential to be developed as biocontrol agents. Our analysis of relatedness of phylogenies of grasshoppers and associated viruses helps to shed light on the eco-evolutionary interactions between insects and viruses. This work provides a valuable dataset of both academic and applied interest.",

    "abstract": "1.Inhibition of human topoisomerase I (TOP1) by camptothecin and topotecan has been shown to reduce excessive transcription of PAMP (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern) - induced genes in prior studies, preventing death from sepsis in animal models of bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections. The TOP1 catalytic activity likely resolves the topological constraints on DNA that encodes these genes to facilitate the transcription induction that leads to excess inflammation. The increased accumulation of TOP1 covalent complex (TOP1cc) following DNA cleavage is the basis for the anticancer efficacy of the TOP1 poison inhibitors developed for anticancer treatment. The potential cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of TOP1 targeting cancer drugs pose serious concerns for employing them as therapies in sepsis prevention. The aim of this study is to develop a novel yeast-based screening system that employs yeast strains expressing wild-type or a dominant lethal mutant recombinant human TOP1. This yeast-based screening system can identify human TOP1 poison inhibitors for anticancer efficacy as well as catalytic inhibitors that can inhibit TOP1 DNA binding or cleavage activity in steps prior to the formation of the TOP1cc. In addition to distinguishing between such TOP1 catalytic inhibitors and TOP1 poison inhibitors, results from this yeast-based screening system will also allow elimination of compounds that are likely to be cytotoxic based on their effect on yeast cell growth that is independent of recombinant human TOP1 overexpression.",

    "abstract": "The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (Cas) system protects bacteria and archaea from the invasion of foreign genetic elements. To cope with the host CRISPR systems, phages have evolved many strategies, including the anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins, to inactivate the Cas nucleases. Recently, it has been reported that the type V-A Cas12a effector can be acetylated and inactivated by AcrVA5, which is a GNAT-family acetyltransferase. However, it is unclear whether the host has any coping strategies to reactivate the defense system. Here we show that the AcrVA5-acetylated Cas12a can be deacetylated by bacterial deacetylase CobB, reactivating Cas12a for both in vitro cleavage of target DNA sequences and in vivo protection of the host from invasion of foreign nucleic acids. Therefore, this study not only shows the reversible regulation of Cas12a activities by post-translational modification but also reveals CobB as a secondary safeguard to bacterial CRISPR defense systems. In addition, we demonstrate that AcrVA5 is a wide-spectrum acetyltransferase, acetylating a large number of target proteins besides Cas12a, and the AcrVA5-acetylated targets can also be deacetylated by CobB.",

    "abstract": "\"Metamorphic\" proteins challenge state-of-the-art structure prediction methods reliant on amino acid similarity. Unfortunately, this obviates a more effective thermodynamic approach necessary to properly evaluate the impact of amino acid changes on the stability of two different folds. A vital capability of such a thermodynamic approach would be the quantification of the free energy differences between 1) the energy landscape minima of each native fold, and 2) each fold and the denatured state. Here we develop an energetic framework for conformational specificity, based on an ensemble description of protein thermodynamics. This energetic framework was able to successfully recapitulate the structures of high-identity enginerered sequences experimentally shown to adopt either Streptococcus protein GA or GB folds, demonstrating that this approach indeed reflected the energetic determinants of fold. Residue-level decomposition of the conformational specificity suggested several testable hypotheses, notably among them that fold-switching could be affected by local de-stabilization of the populated fold at positions sensitive to equilibrium perturbation. Since this ensemble-based compatibility framework is applicable to any structure and any sequence, it may be practically useful for the future targeted design, or large-scale proteomic detection, of novel metamorphic proteins.\n\nImpact StatementMetamorphic proteins are single amino acid sequences capable of adopting more than one structure at equilibrium. Detection and design of these molecules hold great promise for biological understanding and materials engineering, but to do so requires a thermodynamic framework capable of estimating the free energy differences between the two structures and the denatured state. We present such a framework, show it to be effective for the well-studied metamorphic protein GA/GB system, and suggest testable hypotheses for engineering novel fold-switch proteins.",

    "abstract": "Kinases are important cancer biomarkers and are conventionally detected based on their catalytic activity. Kinases regulate cellular activities by phosphorylation of motif-specific multiple substrate proteins, resulting in lack of selectivity of activity-based kinase biosensors. We present an alternative approach of sensing kinases based on the interactions of their allosteric docking sites with a specific partner protein. The new approach was demonstrated for the ERK2 kinase and its substrate ELK-1. A peptide derived from ELK-1 was bound to a gold electrode and ERK2 sensing was performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The sensors showed high level of target selectivity for ERK2 when compared with p38{gamma} kinase and BSA. ERK2 was detected in its cellular concentration range, 0.2-8.0 M. Using the flexibility of peptide design, our method is generic for developing sensitive and substrate-specific biosensors and other disease-related enzymes based on their interactions.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/468793v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@277550org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@870467org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@32098aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1104840_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genetic alterations influence the malignant potential of cancer cells, and so does the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we combined the study of KRAS oncogenic effects in colorectal cancer cells with the influence of fibroblasts-derived factors. Results revealed that mutant KRAS regulates cell fate through both autonomous and non-autonomous signaling mechanisms. Specifically, processes such as proliferation and cell-cell aggregation were autonomously controlled by mutant KRAS independently of the stimulation with fibroblasts conditioned media. However, cancer cell invasion revealed to be a KRAS-dependent non-autonomous effect, resulting from the cooperation between fibroblasts-derived HGF and mutant KRAS regulation of C-MET expression. C-MET downregulation upon KRAS silencing rendered cells less responsive to HGF and thus less invasive. Yet, in one cell line, KRAS inhibition triggered invasion upon stimulation with fibroblasts conditioned media. Inhibition of PIK3CA oncogene did not promoted invasion, thus showing a KRAS-specific effect. Moreover, the invasive capacity also depended on the HGF-C-MET axis. Overall, our study awards oncogenic KRAS an important role in modulating the response to fibroblast-secreted factors either by promoting or impairing invasion, and depicts the HGF-C-MET axis as a putative therapeutic target to impair the invasive properties of mutant KRAS cancer cells.\n\nSignificanceTargeting mutant KRAS cancers is an urgent clinical need. HGF-C-MET axis inhibition arises as a possible strategy to target mutant KRAS CRC, both primary and metastatic tumors.\n\nAdditional informationO_ST_ABSFinancial supportC_ST_ABSThis work was supported through FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors (COMPETE 2020), Programa Operacional de Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI), Programa Operacional Regional do Norte (Norte 2020), European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and by National Funds through the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) (PTDC/MED-ONC/31354/2017).

    "abstract": "Synthetic RNA systems offer unique advantages such as faster response, increased specificity, and programmability compared to conventional protein-based networks. Here, we demonstrate an in-vitro RNA-based toggle switch using RNA aptamers capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of T7 or SP6 RNA polymerases. The activities of both polymerases are monitored simultaneously by using Broccoli and Malachite green light-up aptamer systems. In our toggle switch, a T7 promoter drives the expression of SP6 inhibitory aptamers, and an SP6 promoter expresses T7 inhibitory aptamers. We show that the two distinct states originating from the mutual inhibition of aptamers can be toggled by adding DNA sequences to sequester the RNA inhibitory aptamers. Finally, we assessed our RNA-based toggle switch in cell-like conditions by introducing controlled degradation of RNAs using a mix of RNases. Our results demonstrate that the RNA-based toggle switch could be used as a control element for nucleic acid networks in synthetic biology applications.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/468831v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5df108org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b653borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@33315borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed81c8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Infection was limited to grey matter of sensory systems in wildtype mice, but extended into white matter, meninges and choroid plexus in Ifnar-/-mice. Cells in wildtype displayed strong type I and II IFN responses, likely due to Ifnb expressing astrocytes, infiltration of macrophages and Ifng-expressing CD8+NK cells, whereas in Ifnar-/-, the absence of this response contributed to a shift in cellular tropism towards non-activated resident microglia.

    "abstract": "Rabies infection is nearly 100% lethal if untreated and kills over 50,000 people annually, many of them children. Existing rabies vaccines target the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G) but generate short-lived immune responses, likely because the protein is heterogeneous under physiological conditions. Here, we report the 3.39[A] cryo-EM structure of trimeric, pre-fusion RABV-G complexed with RVA122, a potently neutralizing human antibody. RVA122 binds to a quaternary epitope at the top of RABV-G, bridging domains and stabilizing RABV-G protomers in a prefusion state. RABV-G trimerization involves side-to-side interactions between the central -helix and adjacent loops, rather than contacts between central helices, and interactions among the fusion loops at the glycoprotein base. These results provide a basis to develop improved rabies vaccines based on RABV-G stabilized in the prefusion conformation.\n\nOne sentence summaryWe report the structure and trimeric interface of pre-fusion rabies virus glycoprotein bound to the neutralizing antibody RVA122.",

    "abstract": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and chronic sleep fragmentation (CSF) are two cardinal pathological features of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Dietary obesity is a crucial risk intermediator for OSA and metabolic disorders. Gut microbiota affect hepatic and adipose tissue morphology under conditions of CIH or CSF through downstream metabolites. However, the exact relationship is unclear. Herein, chow and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were subjected to CIH or CSF for 10 weeks each and compared to normoxia (NM) or normal sleep (NS) controls. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and histological assessment of liver and adipose tissues were used to investigate the correlations between the microbiome, metabolome, and lipid metabolism under CIH or CSF condition. Our results demonstrated that CIH and CSF regulate the abundance of intestinal microbes (such as Akkermansia mucinphila, Clostridium spp., Lactococcus spp., and Bifidobacterium spp.) and functional metabolites, such as tryptophan, free fatty acids, branched amino acids, and bile acids, which influence adipose tissue and hepatic lipid metabolism, and the level of lipid deposition in tissues and peripheral blood. In conclusion, CIH and CSF adversely affect fecal microbiota composition and function, and host metabolism; these findings provide new insight into the independent and synergistic effects of CIH, CSF, and HFD on lipid disorders.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation is an energy intensive process that contributes significantly towards supporting life on this planet. Among nitrogen-fixing organisms, cyanobacteria remain unrivaled in their ability to fuel the energetically expensive nitrogenase reaction with photosynthetically harnessed solar energy. In heterocystous cyanobacteria light-driven, photosystem I (PSI)-mediated ATP synthesis plays a key role in propelling the nitrogenase reaction. Efficient light transfer to the photosystems rely on phycobilisomes (PBS), the major antenna protein complexes. PBS undergo degradation as a natural response to nitrogen starvation. Upon nitrogen availability, these proteins are resynthesized back to normal levels in vegetative cells, but their occurrence and function in heterocysts remains inconclusive. Anabaena 33047 is a heterocystous cyanobacterium that thrives under high light, harbors higher amounts of PBS in its heterocysts and fixes nitrogen at higher rates compared to other heterocystous cyanobacteria. To assess the relationship between PBS in heterocysts and nitrogenase function, we engineered a strain that retains high amounts of the antenna proteins in its heterocysts. Intriguingly, under high light intensities the engineered strain exhibited unusually high rates of nitrogenase activity compared to the wild type. Spectroscopic analysis revealed altered PSI kinetics in the mutant, with increased cyclic electron flow around PSI, a route that contributes to ATP generation and nitrogenase activity in heterocysts. Retaining higher levels of PBS in heterocysts appears to be an effective strategy to enhance nitrogenase function in cyanobacteria that are equipped with the machinery to operate under high light intensities.\n\nImportanceThe function of phycobilisomes, the large antenna protein complexes in heterocysts has long been debated. This study provides direct evidence of the involvement of these proteins in supporting nitrogenase activity in Anabaena 33047, a heterocystous cyanobacterium that has affinity for very high light intensities. This strain was previously known to be recalcitrant to genetic manipulation and hence despite its many appealing traits, remained largely unexplored. We developed a genetic modification system for this strain and generated a {Delta}nblA mutant that exhibited resistance to phycobilisome degradation upon nitrogen starvation. Physiological characterization of the strain indicated that PBS degradation is not essential for acclimation to nitrogen deficiency and retention of PBS is advantageous for nitrogenase function.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial cell-cell communication process called quorum sensing enables groups of bacteria to synchronously alter behavior in response to changes in cell population density. Quorum sensing relies on the production, release, accumulation, and detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Here, we investigate a mechanism employed by a vibriophage to surveil host quorum sensing and tune its lysogeny-lysis decision to host cell density. The phage possesses a gene called vqmAPhage encoding a quorum-sensing receptor homologous to vibrio VqmA. Both VqmA receptors can detect the host bacteria-produced autoinducer called DPO. DPO-bound VqmAPhage launches the phage lysis process. We discover that the bacterial host produces an inducer of the VqmAPhage-directed quorum-sensing lysogeny-lysis transition. Production of the inducer appears to be widespread among bacteria. A screen of the Escherichia coli Keio collection for mutants impaired for inducer production revealed lomR, located in a prophage, and encoding a poorly understood protein. In the E. coli screening strain, lomR is interrupted by DNA encoding an insertion element. The 3 domain of this LomR protein is sufficient to induce VqmAPhage-directed lysis. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis showed that substitution at either of two key residues abrogates inducer activity. Full-length LomR is similar to the outer membrane porin OmpX in E. coli and Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3:K6, and OmpT in Vibrio cholerae C6706, and indeed, OmpX and OmpT can induce VqmAPhage-directed activity. Possibly, development of the LomR, OmpX, or OmpT proteins as tools to direct phage lysis of host cells could be used to control bacteria in medical or industrial settings.\n\nABSTRACT IMPORTANCEBacteria communicate with chemical signal molecules using a process called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to track their cell numbers and orchestrate collective behaviors. Recently, we discovered that a virus that infects and kills bacteria \"eavesdrops\" on its hosts quorum-sensing process. Specifically, the virus monitors host cell growth by detecting the accumulation of host quorum-sensing signal molecules. In response to the garnered quorum-sensing information, the virus kills the host bacterial cells when the bacterial population has reached a high cell density. This strategy presumably enhances transmission of viruses to new host cells. Here, we discover and characterize three closely-related bacterial host-produced proteins called LomR, OmpX, and OmpT that are capable of inducing the viral quorum-sensing-mediated killing program. Development of this class of inducer proteins as tools to drive \"on demand\" virus-mediated lysis of pathogenic host bacterial cells could be used to control bacteria in medical or industrial settings.",

    "abstract": "Polymicrobial infections are challenging to treat because we dont fully understand how pathogens interact during infection and how these interactions affect drug efficacy. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are opportunistic pathogens that can be found in similar sites of infection such as in burn wounds and most importantly in the lungs of CF and mechanically ventilated patients. C. albicans is particularly difficult to treat because of the paucity of antifungal agents, some of which lack fungicidal activity. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of anti-fungal treatment during C. albicans-P. aeruginosa co-culture in vitro and co-infection in the mucosal zebrafish infection model analogous to the lung. We find that P. aeruginosa enhances the activity of fluconazole (FLC), an anti-fungal drug that is fungistatic in vitro, to promote both clearance of C. albicans during co-infection in vivo and fungal killing in vitro. This synergy between FLC treatment andbacterial antagonism is partly due to iron piracy, as it is reduced upon iron supplementation and knockout of bacterial siderophores. Our work demonstrates that FLC has enhanced activity in clinically relevant contexts and highlights the need to understand antimicrobial effectiveness in the complex environment of the host with its associated microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator that is secreted by several cell types to induce signaling. We recently showed that Mfsd2b is an S1P transporter from hematopoietic cells, which contributes approximately 50% plasma S1P. To further determine the sources of plasma S1P, here, we report the characterizations of compound deletions of Mfsd2b and Spns2, another S1P transporter from endothelial cells. Global deletion of Mfsd2b and Spns2 (gDKO) resulted in embryonic lethality between E13.5 and E14.5 with severe hemorrhage that largely recapitulated the phenotypes from global S1P1 knockout mice, indicating that together with Mfsd2b, Spns2 also provides embryonic source of S1P for S1P1 stimulation. The hemorrhagic phenotypes in gDKO embryos were accompanied by increased angiogenesis and defects of tight junction proteins, indicating that S1P from Mfsd2b and Spns2 is essential for blood vessel integrity and maturation. The various sources of S1P in postnatal stages are yet to be fully understood. Postnatal ablation of S1P synthesis enzymes using Mx1Cre shows that Mx1Cre-sensitive cells provide most of plasma S1P. Interestingly, we showed that compound postnatal deletion of Mfsd2b and Spns2 using Mx1Cre (ctDKO-Mx1Cre) resulted in maximal reduction of 80% plasma S1P. Thus, a small amount of plasma S1P is supplied from other sources independent of Mfsd2b and Spns2. Nevertheless, the vasculature in the lung of ctDKO-Mx1Cre mice was compromised. Furthermore, ctDKO-Mx1Cre mice also exhibited severe susceptibility to anaphylaxis, indicating that S1P from Mfsd2b and Spns2 is indispensable during vascular stress. Together, our results show that Mfsd2b and Spns2 provide a critical source of S1P for embryonic development and they also provide a majority of plasma S1P for vascular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Immunity-linked genes (ILGs) are activated by pathogens but also may respond to imbalances in lipids. Why pathogen attack and metabolic changes both impact ILG activation is unclear. We find that ILGs are activated when membrane phosphatidylcholine ratios change in secretory organelles in C. elegans. RNAi targeting of the ADP-ribosylation factor ARF-1, which disrupts the Golgi, also activates ILG expression, suggesting that activation of this membrane stress response could occur outside the ER. Our data argue that ILG upregulation is a coordinated response to changes in trafficking resulting from intrinsic cues (changes in membrane lipids) or extrinsic stimulation (increased secretion during immune response). Indeed, a focused RNAi screen of ILGs uncovered defects in secretion of two GFP reporters as well as accumulation of a pathogen-responsive CUB-domain fusion protein. These results also suggests that genes shared between the classical pathogen responses and lipid stress may act to counteract stress on secretory function.\n\nTeaserPathogen response genes are also activated by lipid imbalances, which we suggest occurs because both processes put stress on the secretory pathway.",

Rev is imported into the nucleus by the host protein Importin {beta} (Imp{beta}), but how Rev associates with Imp{beta} is poorly understood. Here we report biochemical, biophysical and structural studies of the Imp{beta}/Rev complex. Gel shift, native mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry data reveal that Imp{beta} binds two Rev monomers through independent binding sites. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data suggest that the HEAT repeats of Imp{beta} retain an extended conformation upon binding Rev, which according to NMR data is primarily recognized through its helical hairpin domain. Peptide scanning data and charge-reversal mutations identify the N-terminal tip of Rev helix 2 within Revs Arginine-Rich Motif (ARM) as a primary Imp{beta} binding epitope. Crosslinking mass spectrometry and compensatory mutagenesis data combined with molecular docking simulations suggest a structural model in which one Rev monomer binds to the C-terminal half of Imp{beta} with Rev helix 2 roughly parallel to the HEAT-repeat superhelical axis while the other monomer binds to the N-terminal half. These findings shed light on the molecular basis of Rev recognition by Imp{beta} and highlight an atypical binding behaviour that distinguishes Rev from canonical cellular Imp{beta} cargos.",

Despite its vastly successful application, noise from drift and fluctuation of the optics, and Brownian motion of the trapped beads still hinder the techniques ability to directly visualize folding of small biomolecules or the single nucleotide stepping of polymerases, especially at low forces (<10 pN) and sub-millisecond timescales. Rigid DNA nanotubes have been used to replace the conventional dsDNA linker to reduce optical tweezers noise in the low force range. However, optical tweezers are used to study a wide range of biophysical events, with timescales ranging from microseconds to seconds, and length changes ranging from sub nanometers to tens of nanometers. In this study, we systematically evaluate how noise is distributed across different frequencies in dual trap optical tweezers systems-and show that rigid DNA nanotube tethers suppress only high frequency noise (kHz), while the low frequency noise remains the same when compared to that of dsDNA tethers.",

We developed a tunable genetic system that allows us to activate cAMP signaling in specific microdomains. We uncovered a previously unappreciated nuclear cAMP microdomain that functionally activates a tumor suppressive pathway in a broad range of cancers by inhibiting YAP, a key effector protein of the Hippo pathway, inside the nucleus. We show that nuclear cAMP induces a LATS-dependent pathway leading to phosphorylation of nuclear YAP solely at serine 397, export of YAP from the nucleus, without YAP protein degradation. Thus, nuclear cAMP inhibition of nuclear YAP is distinct from other known mechanisms of Hippo regulation. Pharmacologic targeting of specific cAMP microdomains remains an untapped therapeutic approach for cancer, and since Hippo pathway deregulation can lead to oncogenesis and chemotherapeutic resistance, drugs directed at the nuclear cAMP microdomain may provide new avenues for the treatment of cancer.",

Moreover, ESAT-6, the membrane-disrupting virulence factor of M. marinum, was less associated with membranes when vacuolins were absent.

We found that VFs co-localized with 5-ethynyl uridine in the presence of actinomycin D, confirming they were the site of de novo RNA synthesis, and VFs were visible in infected cells that were fixed and permeabilized with digitonin, demonstrating that they were not membrane bound. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) a region of interest within the VFs occurred rapidly, recovering from approximately 25% to 87% the original intensity over 146 seconds, and VFs were dissolved by 1,6-hexanediol treatment, demonstrating they showed properties consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation. There was a lower co-localization of the VF GFP signal with the capsid protein VP2 (Manders coefficient (MC) 0.6), compared to VP3 (MC, 0.9), which prompted us to investigate the VF ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In infected cells, paracrystalline arrays (PAs) of virions were observed in the cytoplasm, as well as discrete electron dense regions. Using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), we observed that the electron dense regions correlated with the GFP signal of the VFs, which were distinct from the PAs. In summary, Birnaviridae VFs are sites of de novo RNA synthesis, are not bound by a membrane, show properties consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation, and are distinct from the PAs observed by TEM.\n\nImportanceMembers of the Birnaviridae infect birds, fish and insects, and are responsible for diseases of significant economic importance to the poultry industry and aquaculture.

Transcript quantitative evaluation indicated that the transcription of genes such as ctrA and gcrA was up-regulated, while the transcription of genes such as dnaA and ftsZl was down-regulated in the insertion mutant and the strain of Sm1021 expressing ntrXD53E. Correspondingly, inducible transcription of ntrX activates the expression of dnaA and ftsZ1, but represses ctrA and gcrA in the depletion strain. The expression levels of CtrA and GcrA were confirmed by western blotting, which were consistent with the transcription data. The transcriptional regulation of these genes requires phosphorylation of the conserved 53rd aspartate in the NtrX protein. The NtrX protein binds directly to the promoter regions of ctrA, gcrA, dnaA and ftsZ1 by recognizing the characteristic sequence CAAN2-5TTG Our findings reveal that NtrX is a novel transcriptional regulator of the CtrA signaling pathway genes, and positively affects bacterial cell division, associated with nitrogen metabolism.\n\nIMPORTANCESinorhizobium meliloti infects the host alfalfa and induces formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules. Proliferation of rhizobia in plant tissues and cells is strictly controlled in the early stage of symbiotic interactions. However, the control mechanism is not very clear. Cell division of S. meliloti in the free-living state is regulated by the CtrA signaling network, but molecular mechanisms by which the CtrA system is associated with environmental nutrient signals (e.g., ammonia nitrogen) need to be further explored. This study demonstrates that NtrX, a regulator of nitrogen metabolism, required for symbiotic nodulation and nitrogen fixation by S. meliloti 1021, can act as a transcriptional regulator of the CtrA signaling system. It may link nitrogen signaling to cell cycle regulation in Rhizobium species.",

    "abstract": "Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection of microglial cells in the brain leads to chronic neuroinflammation, which is antecedent to the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in the majority of patients. Productively HIV infected microglia release multiple neurotoxins including proinflammatory cytokines and HIV proteins such as envelope glycoprotein (gp120) and transactivator of transcription (Tat). However, powerful counteracting silencing mechanisms in microglial cells result in the rapid shutdown of HIV expression to limit neuronal damage. Here we investigated whether the Nerve Growth Factor IB-like nuclear receptor Nurr1 (NR4A2), which is a repressor of inflammation in the brain, acts to directly restrict HIV expression. HIV silencing was substantially enhanced by Nurr1 agonists in both immortalized human microglial cells (h{micro}glia) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived human microglial cells (iMG). Overexpression of Nurr1 led to viral suppression, whereas by contrast, knock down (KD) of endogenous Nurr1 blocked HIV silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Nurr1 mediates recruitment of the CoREST/HDAC1/G9a/EZH2 transcription repressor complex to HIV promoter resulting in epigenetic silencing of active HIV. Transcriptomic studies demonstrated that in addition to repressing HIV transcription, Nurr1 also downregulated numerous cellular genes involved in inflammation, cell cycle, and metabolism, thus promoting HIV latency and microglial homoeostasis. Thus, Nurr1 plays a pivotal role in modulating the cycles of proviral reactivation by cytokines and potentiating the proviral transcriptional shutdown. These data highlight the therapeutic potential of Nurr1 agonists for inducing HIV silencing and microglial homeostasis and amelioration of the neuroinflammation associated with HAND.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHIV enters the brain almost immediately after infection where it infects perivascular macrophages, microglia and, to a less extent, astrocytes. In previous work using an immortalized human microglial cell model, we observed that integrated HIV constantly underwent cycles of reactivation and subsequent silencing. In the present study, we found that the Nurr1 nuclear receptor is a key mediator of HIV silencing. The functional activation of Nurr1 by specific agonists, or the over expression of Nurr1, resulted in rapid silencing of activated HIV in microglial cells. Global gene expression analysis confirmed that Nurr1 not only repressed HIV expression but also regulated numerous genes involved in microglial homeostasis and inflammation. Thus, Nurr1 is pivotal for HIV silencing and repression of inflammation in the brain and is a promising therapeutic target for treatment of HAND.",

    "abstract": "Poor lipid degradation limits low-temperature anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater even when psychrophiles are used. We combined metagenomics and metaproteomics to find lipolytic bacteria and their potential, and actual, cold-adapted extracellular lipases in anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating domestic wastewater at 4{degrees}C and 15{degrees}C. Of the 40 recovered putative lipolytic metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), only three (Chlorobium, Desulfobacter, and Mycolicibacterium) were common and abundant (relative abundance [&ge;] 1%) in all reactors. Notably, some MAGs that represented aerobic autotrophs contained lipases. Therefore, we hypothesised that the lipases we found are not always associated with exogenous lipid degradation and can have other roles such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) accumulation/degradation and interference with the outer membranes of other bacteria. Metaproteomics did not provide sufficient proteome coverage for relatively lower abundant proteins such as lipases though the expression of fadL genes, long-chain fatty acid transporters, was confirmed for four genera (Dechloromonas, Azoarcus, Aeromonas and Sulfurimonas), none of which were recovered as putative lipolytic MAGs. Metaproteomics also confirmed the presence of 15 relatively abundant ([&ge;]1%) genera in all reactors, of which at least 6 can potentially accumulate lipid/polyhydroxyalkanoates. For most putative lipolytic MAGs, there was no statistically significant correlation between the read abundance and reactor conditions such as temperature, phase (biofilm and bulk liquid), and feed type (treated by ultraviolet light or not). Results obtained by metagenomics and metaproteomics did not confirm each other and further work is required to identify the true lipid degraders in these systems.",

    "abstract": "We compared the efficiency of gene knockout (KO) and precision of insertion (knock-in, KI) of the RNA-guided AsCas12a nuclease of Acidaminococcus sp. with that of SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, aiming to enhance the functional genomics toolkit for Schistosoma mansoni. Programmed DNA cleavages catalyzed by Cas12a and Cas9 result in staggered and blunt ended strand breaks, respectively. TTTV, the optimal protospacer adjacent motif for AsCas12a would occur frequently within the AT-rich genome of this platyhelminth. We deployed optimized conditions for the ratio of guide RNAs to the nuclease, donor templates, and electroporation parameters, to target a key enzyme termed omega-1 that is secreted by the schistosome egg. AsCas12a was more efficient than SpCas9 for gene knockout of omega-1 as determined by tracking of indels by decomposition (P < 0.001). Resulting from CRISPREsso2 analysis, most mutations were deletions; SpCas9 induced short deletions of 3 nt in length whereas AsCas12a induced deletions of 2 to 26 nt. Knockout efficiency of both nucleases markedly increased in the presence of short, single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor templates. With AsCas12a, ssODNs representative of both the non-CRISPR target (NT) and target (T) strands of the targeted gene were tested, resulting in KO efficiencies of 15.67, 28.71 and 21.43% in the SpCas9 plus donor ssODN, AsCas12a plus NT-ssODN, and AsCas12a plus T-ssODN groups, respectively. Trans cleavage activity against the ssODNs by activated AsCas12a was not apparent in vitro. Programmed SpCas9 editing led to more precise transgene insertion than AsCas12a, with KI efficiencies of 17.07% for the KI_SpCas9 group, 14.58% for KI_AsCas12a-NT-ssODN and 12.37% for KI_AsCas12a-T-ssODN. Although AsCas12a induced fewer mutations per genome than SpCas9, the phenotypic impact on transcription and expression of omega-1 was similar for both nucleases. These findings revealed that AsCas12a and SpCas9 both provide tractable routes for RNA-guided programmed mutation of the genome of the schistosome egg.",

    "abstract": "Several mutations identified in phospholamban (PLN) have been linked to familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure, yet the underlying molecular mechanism remains controversial. PLN interacts with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and regulates calcium uptake, which is modulated by the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of PLN during the fight-or-flight response. Here, we present the crystal structures of the catalytic domain of PKA in complex with wild-type and DCM-mutant PLNs. Our structures, combined with the results from other biophysical and biochemical assays, reveal a common disease mechanism: the mutations in PLN reduce its phosphorylation level by changing its conformation and weakening its interactions with PKA. In addition, we demonstrate that another more ubiquitous SERCA-regulatory peptide, called another-regulin (ALN), shares a similar mechanism mediated by PKA in regulating SERCA activity.\n\nSignificanceDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common type of heart disease. Familial DCM is associated with mutations on phospholamban (PLN), but the mechanism remains elusive. Phosphorylation of PLN is known to influence its physiological function. We hypothesize that the connection between such mutations and DCM may involve decreased PLN phosphorylation levels due to less efficient binding to protein kinase A. We utilize x-ray crystallography, SPR, enzyme kinetic assays, thermal melt assays, and NMR to examine the structural and energetic consequences for PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of PLN variants containing DCM-associated mutations. Our results provide a foundation to understand the general working mechanism of PKA and the physiological regulation of PLN by PKA, and also provide important insight into the pathological mechanism of DCM.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas programmable nuclease systems have become ubiquitous in the field of gene editing. With progressing development, applications in in vivo therapeutic gene editing are increasingly within reach, yet limited by possible adverse side effects from unwanted edits. Recent years have thus seen continuous development of off-target prediction algorithms trained on in vitro cleavage assay data gained from immortalised cell lines. It has been shown that in contrast to experimental epigenetic features, computed physically informed features are so far underutilised despite bearing considerably larger correlation with cleavage activity. Here, we implement state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and feature encodings for off-target prediction with emphasis on physically informed features that capture the biological environment of the cleavage site, hence terming our approach piCRISPR. Features were gained from the large, diverse crisprSQL off-target cleavage dataset. We find that our best-performing models highlight the importance of sequence context and chromatin accessibility for cleavage prediction and compare favourably with literature standard prediction performance. We further show that our novel, environmentally sensitive features are crucial to accurate prediction on sequence-identical locus pairs, making them highly relevant for clinical guide design.

We show the proposed model fits well with epidemiological historical data world health over a long period.

    "abstract": "Global climate change is having a significant effect on agriculture by causing greater precipitation variability and an increased risk of drought. To mitigate these effects, it is important to identify specific traits, adaptations, and germplasm that improve tolerance to soil water deficit. Local varieties, known as landraces, have undergone generations of farmer-mediated selection and can serve as sources of variation, specifically for tolerance to abiotic stress. Landraces can possess local adaptations, where accessions adapted to a particular environment will outperform others grown under the same conditions. We explore adaptations to water deficit in chile pepper landraces from across an environmental gradient in Mexico, a center of crop domestication and diversity, as well in improved varieties bred for the US. In the present study, we evaluated 25 US and Mexico accessions in a greenhouse experiment under well-watered and water deficit conditions and measured morphological, physiological, and agronomic traits. Accession and irrigation regime influenced biomass and height, while branching, CO2 assimilation, and fruit weight were all influenced by an interaction between accession and irrigation. A priori group contrasts revealed possible adaptations to water deficit for primary branching, CO2 assimilation, and plant height associated with geographic origin, domestication level, and pepper species. Additionally, within the Mexican landraces, the number of primary branches had a strong relationship with precipitation from the environment of origin. This work provides insight into chile pepper response to water deficit and adaptation to drought and identifies possibly tolerant germplasm.",

    "abstract": "Engaging the Ly-6A protein, an inhibitory signaling protein, on CD4+ T cell lines triggers apoptosis. Signaling through Ly-6A activates cell-intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway as indicated by release of cytochrome C, activation of caspase 3 and 9. In addition Ly-6A induces cytokine production and growth inhibition. The mechanism underlying simultaneous distinct cellular responses has remained unknown. To examine the relatedness of distinct responses generated by engaging Ly-6A, we have quantified the secretion of TNF, TGF{beta} and a related protein GDF10, the three pro-apoptotic, growth inhibitory and tumor suppressive cytokines. While low levels of TGF{beta} and GDF10 were detected after engaging Ly-6A, the production of TNF- was elevated in cell cultures stimulated the Ly-6A protein. Blocking the biological activity of TNF resulted in reduced apoptosis induced by engaging Ly-6A. In contrast, growth inhibition/apoptosis in response to antigen receptor complex stimulation was not observed. Engaging the antigen receptor through activating the epsilon ({varepsilon}) chain of CD3 generated high levels of TGF-{beta} and GDF10 while decreasing TNF. These results suggest that the TNF- cytokine contributes to the Ly-6A-induced growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic response in CD4+ T cells and provides mechanistic explanation of the observed biologically distinct responses initiated after engaging Ly-6A protein. These findings aid in understanding the inhibitory signaling initiated by Ly-6A protein, especially in the context of its potential immune checkpoint inhibitory role in T cells.",

Considering that IL-6 ais a critical pro-inflammatory signal, we explored a novel approach whereby the parasite itself encodes for the murine IL-6 gene.

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic and emerging foodborne zoonotic pathogen that encompasses a diversity of strains with varied virulence and can cause serious human and animal infections worldwide with low incidence but high hospitalization and case fatality rates. A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2016 to June 2017 to estimate the molecular epidemiology of L. monocytogenes and its serotypes, and antimicrobial resistance pattern of isolates in Mekelle City. A total of 768 (384 of milk and 384 meat) samples of bovine origin were collected using a purposive random sampling technique. Isolation and identification of L. monocytogenes was done according to standard and recommended bacteriological procedures. Genome-based confirmation of each isolate was performed at species and serovar levels by targeting Iap, Imo0737, ORF2819 and ORF2110 genes using specific primers. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using agar plate antibiotic disk diffusion method. The overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 26 (3.39%). Sample type prevalence rates of L. monocytogenes were 4.17 % and 2.6% in meat and milk samples, respectively. There was a statically significant difference (p<0.05) on the prevalence rates of the organism in meat samples collected from abattoir (1.67%), butcher shops (8.33%), and restaurants (8.33%). Serovars that were identified were belonged to 1/2b and 4b. Large proportions of isolates were highly susceptible to Ampicillin (88.46%) and Vancomycin (84.62%). However, the isolates had shown the highest level of resistance against Nalidixic Acid (96.15%). The highest intermediate was observed to Amoxicillin (57.69%). Moreover, 42.31% of the isolates were developed resistance for more than two drugs. Hence, both its occurrence and development of a multi-drug resistance indicated that, a coordinated effort is imperative to reduce or eliminate the risk posed by this pathogen in food chains and on controlled and careful use of antimicrobials both in veterinary and human treatment regimes.",
