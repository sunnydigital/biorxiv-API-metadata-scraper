    "abstract": "SummaryQuantitative proteomics has become an increasingly prominent tool in the study of life sciences. A substantial hurdle for many biologists are, however, the intricacies involved in the associated high throughput data analysis. In order to facilitate this task for users with limited background knowledge, we have developed amica, a freely available open-source web-based software that accepts proteomic input files from different sources and provides quality control, differential expression, biological network and over-representation analysis on the basis of minimal user input. Scientists can use amica interactively to compare proteins across multiple groups, create customized output graphics, and ultimately export the results in a tab-separated format that can be shared with collaborators.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe code for the application, input data and documentation can be accessed online at https://github.com/tbaccata/amica and is also incorporated in the web application. A freely available version of amica is available at https://bioapps.maxperutzlabs.ac.at/app/amica.",

    "abstract": "Surveillance of circulating variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance in controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We propose an alignment-free in silico approach for classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their genomic sequences. A deep learning model was constructed utilizing a stacked 1-D convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pre-processed genomic sequencing data of the four SARS-CoV-2 variants were first fed to three stacked convolution-pooling nets to extract local linkage patterns in the sequences. Then a 2-layer MLP was used to compute the correlations between the input and output. Finally, a logistic regression model transformed the output and returned the probability values. Learning curves and stratified 10-fold cross-validation showed that the proposed classifier enables robust variant classification. External validation of the classifier showed an accuracy of 0.9962, precision of 0.9963, recall of 0.9963 and F1 score of 0.9962, outperforming other machine learning methods, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest. By comparing our model with an MLP model without the convolution-pooling network, we demonstrate the essential role of convolution in extracting viral variant features. Thus, our results indicate that the proposed convolution-based multi-class gene classifier is efficient for the variant classification of SARS-CoV-2.",

The powerful ability to infer quantitative kinetic information from smFRET data is, however, complicated by experimental limitations. Diverse analysis tools have been developed to overcome these hurdles but a systematic comparison is lacking. Here, we report the results of a blind benchmark study assessing eleven analysis tools used to infer kinetic rate constants from smFRET trajectories. We tested them against simulated and experimental data containing the most prominent difficulties encountered in analyzing smFRET experiments: different noise levels, varied model complexity, non-equilibrium dynamics, and kinetic heterogeneity. Our results highlight the current strengths and limitations in inferring kinetic information from smFRET trajectories. In addition, we formulate concrete recommendations and identify key targets for future developments, aimed to advance our understanding of biomolecular dynamics through quantitative experiment-derived models.",

    "abstract": "The earth has become increasingly overcrowded as a result of rapid urbanization and population growth, predicting that its carrying capacity could be overstretched. As a result, it is important to test the possibilities of growing plants under space exploration conditions, especially gravitational balance. Since microgravity impedes plant development, to what extent can plant growth stimulators reverse or enhance this trend? A total of 12 maize seeds were weighed and placed sideways in petri dish and inoculated with plant growth stimulators such as indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA), and ascorbate (AA) and the clinorotated at different rates (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 rpm), while control seeds were just placed on a table. Results showed that at 72 hrs, the maize seeds under microgravity showed reduced germination percentage with increasing clinorotation rates as against the control. But when stimulated with IAA, GA and AA, improved germination percentage was observed as against the control even under microgravity condition. The seedling dry weight, germination time and other germination parameters also showed similar improvements. Comparatively, the three growth stimulators showed no major variations in their ability to improve germination percentage under microgravitational impact. However, IAA showed more improvement on seedling vigor as against others, while GA showed more effect on the peak time and rate of germination. This research confirmed the possibilities of improving germinability of maize seeds under space exploration condition.",

    "abstract": "Class IV homeodomain leucine-zipper transcription factors (HD-Zip IV TFs) are key regulators of epidermal differentiation that are characterized by a DNA-binding homeodomain (HD) in conjunction with a lipid-binding domain termed START (Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR)-related lipid Transfer). Previous work established that the START domain of GLABRA2 (GL2), a HD-Zip IV member from Arabidopsis, is required for transcription factor activity. Here, we address the functions and possible interactions of START and the HD in DNA binding, dimerization, and protein turnover. Deletion analysis of the HD and missense mutations of a conserved lysine (K146) result in phenotypic defects in leaf trichomes, root hairs and seed mucilage, similar to those observed for START domain mutants, despite nuclear localization of the respective proteins. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that while HD mutations impair binding to target DNA, the START domain is dispensable for DNA binding. Vice versa, protein interaction assays reveal impaired GL2 dimerization for multiple alleles of START mutants, but not HD mutants. Using in vivo cycloheximide chase experiments, we provide evidence for the role of START, but not HD, in maintaining protein stability. This work advances our mechanistic understanding of HD-Zip TFs as multidomain regulators of epidermal development in plants.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to interact flexibly with the surrounding environment and achieve an adaptive goal-directed response is one of the necessities of balance control. This study aimed to examine the interaction between cognitive demand and the necessity for keeping balance in unstable conditions. We examined the effects of performing two cognitive tasks, namely the Stroop test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), on postural balance in healthy young adults. Stroop and the WCST test assess selective attention and cognitive flexibility in shifting between rules, respectively. Thirty-two healthy adults were included in two experimental conditions (control and treatment) in random order, separated by at least seven days. Standing balance was evaluated by the Sway Medical Mobile application in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) in different stance positions: feet apart, feet together, semi-tandem, tandem, and single-leg stance (SLS). Balance was evaluated before and after the cognitive test in each experimental condition. Our findings indicate that performing cognitively demanding tasks adversely affected the balance ability in more demanding balance tests such as the SLS with EC (P {square} 0.05). However, no significant changes were seen in other balance tests (P {square} 0.05). Additionally, no significant changes were seen in balance ability after the Stroop or Wisconsin card sorting test alone. These results confirm that performing cognitively demanding tasks significantly reduced the ability to keep balance in less stable conditions. These findings have significant implications in understanding and preventing falls and incidents resulting from an impaired balance in complex and cognitively demanding conditions.",

    "abstract": "Variability in the detection and discrimination of weak visual stimuli has been linked to oscillatory neural activity. In particular, the amplitude of activity in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) has been shown to impact upon the objective likelihood of stimulus detection, as well as measures of subjective visibility, attention, and decision confidence. We aimed to clarify how preparatory alpha influences performance and phenomenology, by recording simultaneous subjective measures of attention and confidence (Experiment 1), or attention and visibility (Experiment 2) on a trial-by-trial basis in a visual detection task. Across both experiments, alpha amplitude was negatively and linearly correlated with the intensity of subjective attention. In contrast to this linear relationship, we observed a quadratic relationship between the strength of alpha oscillations and subjective ratings of confidence and visibility. We find that this same quadratic relationship links alpha amplitude to the strength of stimulus evoked responses. Visibility and confidence judgements corresponded to the strength of evoked responses, but confidence, uniquely, incorporated information about attentional state. As such, our findings reveal distinct psychological and neural correlates of metacognitive judgements of attentional state, stimulus visibility, and decision confidence.",

PNS injuries initiate transcriptional reprograming in both Schwann cells and sensory neurons that promotes regeneration. While the factors that initiate the transcriptional reprograming in Schwann cells are well characterized, the full range of stimuli that initiate this reprograming in sensory neurons remain elusive. Here, using a genetic model of Schwann cell ablation, we find that Schwann cell loss results in transient PNS demyelination without overt axonal loss. By profiling sensory ganglia at single-cell resolution we show that this demyelination induces transcriptional reprogramming preferably in proprioceptive and A{beta} RA-LTMR neurons. Transcriptional reprograming is assumed to be a cell autonomous response of sensory neurons to mechanical axonal injury.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the sensory modality used to identify the position of proprioceptive targets hidden from sight, but frequently viewed, influences the type of the body representation employed for reaching them with the finger. The question then arises as to whether this observation also applies to proprioceptive targets which are hidden from sight, and rarely, if ever, viewed. We used an established technique for pinpointing the type of body representation used for the spatial encoding of targets which consisted of assessing the effect of peripheral gaze fixation on the pointing accuracy. More precisely, an exteroceptive, visually dependent, body representation is thought to be used if gaze deviation induces a deviation of the pointing movement. Three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were positioned at the participants eye level at -25 deg, 0 deg and +25 deg with respect to the cyclopean eye. Without moving the head, the participant fixated the lit LED before the experimenter indicated one of the three target head positions: topmost point of the head (vertex) and two other points located at the front and back of the head. These targets were either verbal-cued or tactile-cued. The goal of the subjects (n=27) was to reach the target with their index finger. We analysed the accuracy of the movements directed to the topmost point of the head, which is a well-defined, yet out of view anatomical point. Based on the possibility of the brain to create visual representations of the body areas that remain out of view, we hypothesized that the position of the vertex is encoded using an exteroceptive body representation, both when verbally or tactile-cued. Results revealed that the pointing errors were biased in the opposite direction of gaze fixation for both verbal-cued and tactile-cued targets, suggesting the use of a vision-dependent exteroceptive body representation. The enhancement of the visual body representations by sensorimotor processes was suggested by the greater pointing accuracy when the vertex was identified by tactile stimulation compared to verbal instruction. Moreover, we found in a control condition that participants were more accurate in indicating the position of their own vertex than the vertex of other people. This result supports the idea that sensorimotor experiences increase the spatial resolution of the exteroceptive body representation. Together, our results suggest that the position of rarely viewed body parts are spatially encoded by an exteroceptive body representation and that non-visual sensorimotor processes are involved in the constructing of this representation.",

    "abstract": "The brain is in a state of perpetual reverberant neural activity, even in the absence of specific tasks or stimuli. Shedding light on the origin and functional significance of such a dynamical state is essential to understanding how the brain transmits, processes, and stores information. An inspiring, albeit controversial, conjecture proposes that some statistical characteristics of empirically observed neuronal activity can be understood by assuming that brain networks operate in a dynamical regime near the edge of a phase transition. Moreover, the resulting critical behavior, with its concomitant scale invariance, is assumed to carry crucial functional advantages. Here, we present a data-driven analysis based on simultaneous high-throughput recordings of the activity of thousands of individual neurons in various regions of the mouse brain. To analyze these data, we synergistically combine cutting-edge methods for the study of brain activity (such as a phenomenological renormalization group approach and techniques that infer the general dynamical state of a neural population), while designing complementary tools. This strategy allows us to uncover strong signatures of scale invariance that is \"quasi-universal\" across brain regions and reveal that all these areas operate, to a greater or lesser extent, near the edge of instability. Furthermore, this framework allows us to distinguish between quasi-universal background activity and non-universal input-related activity. Taken together, this study provides strong evidence that brain networks actually operate in a critical regime which, among other functional advantages, provides them with a scale-invariant substrate of activity covariances that can sustain optimal input representations.",

A prime-boost immunisation with PHH-1V in BALB/c and K18-hACE2 mice induced a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response and RBD-binding antibodies with neutralising activity against several variants, and also showed a good tolerability profile. Significantly, RBD fusion heterodimer vaccination conferred 100% efficacy, preventing mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice, but also reducing Beta, Delta and Omicron infection in lower respiratory airways. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of this recombinant vaccine strategy.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative cell envelope is an essential structure that not only protects the cell against lysis from the internal turgor, but also forms a barrier to limit entry of antibiotics. Some of our most potent bactericidal antibiotics, the {beta}-lactams, exploit the essentiality of the cell envelope by inhibiting its biosynthesis, typically inducing lysis and rapid death. However, many Gram-negative bacteria exhibit \"antibiotic tolerance\", the ability to sustain viability in the presence of {beta}-lactams for extended time periods. Despite several studies showing that antibiotic tolerance contributes directly to treatment failure, and is a steppingstone in acquisition of true resistance, the molecular factors that promote intrinsic tolerance are not well-understood. Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical-threat nosocomial pathogen notorious for its ability to rapidly develop multidrug resistance. While typically reserved to combat multidrug resistant infections, carbapenem {beta}-lactam antibiotics (i.e., meropenem) are first-line prescriptions to treat A. baumannii infections. Meropenem tolerance in Gram-negative pathogens is characterized by morphologically distinct populations of spheroplasts, but the impact of spheroplast formation is not fully understood. Here, we show that susceptible A. baumannii clinical isolates demonstrate high intrinsic tolerance to meropenem, form spheroplasts with the antibiotic and revert to normal growth after antibiotic removal. Using transcriptomics and genetics screens, we characterized novel tolerance factors and found that outer membrane integrity maintenance, drug efflux and peptidoglycan homeostasis collectively contribute to meropenem tolerance in A. baumannii. Furthermore, outer membrane integrity and peptidoglycan recycling are tightly linked in their contribution to meropenem tolerance in A. baumannii.\n\nImportanceCarbapenem treatment failure associated with \"superbug\" infections has rapidly increased in prevalence, highlighting an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies. Antibiotic tolerance can directly lead to treatment failure but has also been shown to promote acquisition of true resistance within a population. While some studies have addressed mechanisms that promote tolerance, factors that underlie Gram-negative bacterial survival during carbapenem treatment are not well-understood. Here, we characterized a role for peptidoglycan recycling in outer membrane integrity maintenance and carbapenem tolerance in A. baumannii. These studies suggest that the pathogen limits antibiotic concentrations in the periplasm and highlights physiological processes that could be targeted to improve antimicrobial treatment.",

    "abstract": "KRAS is a proto-oncogene encoding a small GTPase. Mutations contribute up to 30% of human solid tumours including lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic and colorectal carcinomas. Most KRAS activating mutations interfere with GTP hydrolysis, essential for its role as a molecular switch, leading to alterations in their molecular environment and oncogenic signalling. Here, APEX-2 proximity labelling was used to profile the molecular environment of wild type and G12D, G13D and Q61H activating mutants of KRAS under both, starvation and stimulation conditions. We demonstrate by quantitative proteomics the presence of known interactors of KRAS including a-RAF and LZTR1, which varied in abundance with wildtype and KRAS mutants. Notably, the KRAS mutations G12D, G13D and Q61H abrogate association with LZTR1. Wildtype KRAS and LZTR1, as part of the CUL3 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, affect each others protein stability, revealing a direct feedback loop mechanism. KRAS mutations disconnect this regulatory circuit, thereby contributing to oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic variants in TREM2 are strongly associated with Alzheimers Disease (AD) risk but alternative splicing in TREM2 transcripts has not been comprehensively described.\n\nObjectiveRecognizing that alternative splice variants can result in reduced gene expression and/or altered function, we sought to fully characterize splice variation in TREM2.\n\nMethodsHuman blood and anterior cingulate autopsy tissue from 61 donors were used for end-point and quantitative PCR and Western blotting to identify and quantify novel TREM2 isoforms.\n\nResultsIn addition to previously described transcripts lacking exon 3 or exon 4, or retaining part of intron 3, we identified novel isoforms lacking exon 2, along with isoforms lacking multiple exons. Isoforms lacking exon 2 were predominant at approximately 10% of TREM2 mRNA in the brain. Expression of TREM2 and frequency of exon 2 skipping did not differ between AD samples and non-AD controls (p = 0.1268 and p = 0.4909, respectively). Further, these novel splice isoforms were also observed across multiple tissues with similar frequency (range 5.3 - 13.0%). We found that the exon 2 skipped isoform D2-TREM2 is translated to protein and localizes similarly to full-length TREM2 protein, that both proteins are primarily retained in the Golgi complex, and that D2-TREM2 is expressed in AD and non-AD brain.\n\nConclusionSince the TREM2 ligand binding domain is encoded by exon 2, and skipping this exon retains reading frame while conserving localization, we hypothesize that D2-TREM2 acts as an inhibitor of TREM2 and targeting TREM2 splicing may be a novel therapeutic pathway for AD.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of transcription is critical for the survival under cellular stress. Heat shock has provided an excellent model to investigate nascent transcription in stressed cells, but the molecular mechanisms orchestrating RNA synthesis during other types of stress are unknown. We utilized PRO-seq and ChIP-seq to study how Heat Shock Factors, HSF1 and HSF2, coordinate transcription at genes and enhancers upon oxidative stress and heat shock. We show that pause-release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a universal mechanism regulating gene transcription in stressed cells, while enhancers are activated at the level of Pol II recruitment. Moreover, besides functioning as conventional promoter-binding transcription factors, HSF1 and HSF2 bind to stress-induced enhancers to trigger Pol II pause-release from poised gene promoters. Importantly, HSFs act at distinct genes and enhancers in a stress type-specific manner. HSF1 binds to many chaperone genes upon oxidative and heat stress but activates them only in heat-shocked cells. Under oxidative stress, HSF1 and HSF2 trans-activate genes independently of each other, demonstrating, for the first time, that HSF2 is a bona fide transcription factor. Taken together, we show that HSFs function as multi-stress-responsive factors that activate specific genes and enhancers when encountering changes in temperature and redox state.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor, causative agent of the ongoing seventh cholera pandemic, is native to the aquatic environment of the Ganges Delta, Bay of Bengal (GDBB). Recent studies traced pandemic strains to the GDBB and proposed global spread of cholera had occurred via intercontinental transmission. In the research presented here, NotI-digested genomic DNA extracted from V. cholerae O1 clinical and environmental strains isolated in Bangladesh during 2004 - 2014 was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results of cluster analysis showed 94.67% of the V. cholerae isolates belonged to clade A and included the majority of clinical isolates of spatio-temporal origin and representing different cholera endemic foci. The rest of the strains were estuarine, all environmental isolates from Mathbaria, Bangladesh, and occurred as singletons, clustered in clades B and C, or in the small clades D and E. Cluster analysis of the Bangladeshi strains and including 157 El Tor strains from thirteen countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas revealed 85% of the total set of isolates belonged to clade A, indicating all were related, yet did not form an homogeneous cluster. Overall, 15% of the global strains comprised multiple small clades or segregated as singletons. Three sub-clades could be discerned within the major clade A, reflecting distinct lineages of V. cholerae El Tor associated with cholera in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The presence in Asia and the Americas of non-pandemic V. cholerae El Tor populations differing by PFGE and from strains associated with cholera globally suggests different ecotypes are resident in distant geographies.\n\nAuthor SummaryCholera is a major health threat, especially in the Ganges Delta, Bay of Bengal (GDBB). Vibrio cholerae, causative agent of cholera, is native to the GDBB aquatic environment. Recent genomic studies suggest GDBB is the cholera hotspot where the disease spreads globally via human activity. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of NotI-digested genomic DNA from V. cholerae El Tor endemic cholera strains was done, including Bangladesh aquatic environment and clinical strains from distant geographical regions representing three cholera-prone continents. Results showed the majority of pandemic strains belonged to a major cluster, suggesting clonal relatedness. Ecotypes were detected, indicating geographically specific lineages. It is concluded that epidemic strains in Bangladesh and thirteen countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas are geographically adapted, with independent evolution of the bacterium in respective geographical regions.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessel formation generates unique vascular patterns in each individual. The principles governing the apparent stochasticity of this process remain to be elucidated. Using mathematical methods, we find that the transition between two fundamental vascular morphogenetic programs - sprouting angiogenesis and vascular remodeling - is established by a shift on collective front-rear polarity of endothelial cells. We demonstrate that the competition between biochemical (VEGFA) and mechanical (blood flow-induced shear stress) cues controls this collective polarity shift. Shear stress increases tension at focal adhesions overriding VEGFA-driven collective polarization, which relies on tension at adherens junctions. We propose that vascular morphogenetic cues compete to regulate individual cell polarity and migration through tension shifts that translates into tissue-level emergent behaviors, ultimately leading to uniquely organized vascular patterns.",

    "abstract": "Hair cells are the sensory receptors in the auditory and vestibular systems of all vertebrates, and in the lateral-line system of aquatic vertebrates. During development, spontaneous activity in hair cells shapes the formation of these sensory systems. In auditory hair cells of mice, coordinated waves of spontaneous activity can be triggered by concomitant activity in nearby supporting cells. But in mammals, developing auditory and vestibular hair cells can also autonomously generate spontaneous events independent of supporting cell activity. To date, significant progress has been made studying spontaneous activity in the auditory and vestibular systems of mammals, in isolated cultures. The purpose of this work is to explore the zebrafish lateral-line system as a model to study and understand spontaneous activity in vivo. Our work applies genetically encoded calcium indicators along with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize spontaneous calcium activity in the developing lateral-line system. Consistent with our previous work, we show that spontaneous calcium activity is present in developing lateral-line hair cells. We now show that supporting cells that surround hair cells, and cholinergic efferent terminals that directly contact hair cells are also spontaneously active. Using two-color functional imaging we demonstrate that spontaneous activity in hair cells does not correlate with activity in either supporting cells or cholinergic terminals. We find that during lateral-line development, hair cells autonomously generate spontaneous events. Using localized calcium indicators, we show that within hair cells, spontaneous calcium activity occurs in two distinct domains-the mechanosensory bundle and the presynapse. Further, spontaneous activity in the mechanosensory bundle ultimately drives spontaneous calcium influx at the presynapse. Comprehensively, our results indicate that in developing lateral-line hair cells, autonomously generated spontaneous activity originates with spontaneous mechanosensory events. Overall, with robust spontaneous activity three different cell types, the developing lateral line is a rich model to study these activities in an intact sensory organ. Future work studying this model may further our understanding of these activities and their role in sensory system formation, function and regeneration.",

Mutations in either of the two transcripts of Rorb cause defects in multiple systems, including abnormal photoreceptor abundance and morphology in the retina and a characteristic \"high-stepper\" or \"duck-like\" gait arising from dysfunction of interneurons in the spinal cord. Rorb is also important for cortical development and cell fate specification in mice. Rorb variants segregate with epilepsy and comorbidities such as intellectual disability in numerous clinical cases. Here we describe five mouse strains with spontaneous mutations in Rorb identified by their gait phenotype. These mutations affect different domains and isoforms of Rorb, which correspond to the spectrum of anatomical and physiological phenotypes exhibited by these mice. Gene set analysis in Rorb mutants implicates pathways associated with development and nervous system function, and differential gene expression analysis indicates changes in numerous genes related to epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many of these genes and their protein products are known to interact during synapse formation and neuronal activity. These findings further illuminate the role of Rorb in nervous system development, provide further evidence for an association between Rorb and several neurological conditions, and describe an allelic series of Rorb mutant mice that will be useful for dissecting thalamocortical afferent (TCA) development, neural cell fate determination, and as animal models exhibiting transcriptomic shifts in neurological conditions such as epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and ASD.\n\n{blacksquare}Five mutant mice with a characteristic high-stepper gait phenotype have mutations in Rorb\n{blacksquare}These allelic series mutations manifest in a spectrum of anatomical and physiological abnormalities\n{blacksquare}Gene expression data suggest involvement of pathways related to neurodevelopmental disorders",

Here we report a protonation-dependent sequencing reaction for detection of 5-formylcytidine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytidine (5caC) in RNA. First, we evaluate how protonation combined with electron-withdrawing substituents alters the molecular orbital energies and reduction of modified cytidine nucleosides, highlighting 5fC and 5caC as reactive species. Next, we apply this reaction to detect these modifications in synthetic oligonucleotides as well as endogenous human tRNA. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method to characterize a patient-derived model of 5fC-deficiency, where it enables facile monitoring of both pathogenic loss and exogenous rescue of NSUN3-dependent 5fC within the wobble base of human mitochondrial tRNAMet. These studies showcase the ability of protonation to enhance the reactivity and sensitive detection of 5fC in RNA, and provide a molecular foundation for applying optimized sequencing reactions to better understand the role of oxidized RNA cytidine nucleobases in disease.",

SVs are often overlooked due to difficult detection from short-read sequencing. Most algorithms yield low recall on humans, but the performance in other organisms is unclear. Similarly, despite remarkable differences across species genomes, most approaches use parameters optimized for humans. To overcome this and enable species-tailored approaches, we developed perSVade (personalized Structural Variation Detection), a pipeline that identifies SVs in a way that is optimized for any input sample. Starting from short reads, perSVade uses simulations on the reference genome to choose the best SV calling parameters. The output includes the optimally-called SVs and the accuracy, useful to assess the confidence in the results. In addition, perSVade can call small variants and copy-number variations. In summary, perSVade automatically identifies several types of genomic variation from short reads using sample-optimized parameters. We validated that perSVade increases the SV calling accuracy on simulated variants for six diverse eukaryotes, and on datasets of validated human variants. Importantly, we found no universal set of \"optimal\" parameters, which underscores the need for species-specific parameter optimization.

    "abstract": "Sendai virus (SeV, formally murine respirovirus) is a membrane-enveloped, negative sense RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family, and is closely related to human parainfluenza viruses. SeV has long been utilized as a model paramyxovirus and has recently gained attention as a viral vector candidate for both laboratory and clinical applications. To infect host cells, SeV must first bind to sialic-acid glycolipid or glycoprotein receptors on the host cell surface via its hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein. Receptor binding induces a conformational change in HN, which allosterically triggers the viral fusion (F) protein to catalyze membrane fusion. While it is known that SeV binds to 2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, and there has been some study into the chemical requirements of those receptors, key mechanistic features of SeV binding remain unknown, in part because traditional approaches often convolve binding and fusion. Here, we develop and employ a fluorescence microscopy-based assay to observe SeV binding to supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) at the single particle level, which easily disentangles binding from fusion. Using this assay, we investigate mechanistic questions of SeV binding. We identify chemical structural features of ganglioside receptors that influence viral binding and demonstrate that binding is cooperative with respect to receptor density. We measure the characteristic decay time of unbinding and provide evidence supporting a \"rolling\" mechanism of viral mobility following receptor binding. We also study the dependence of binding on target cholesterol concentration. Interestingly, we find that while SeV binding shows striking parallels in cooperative binding with a prior report of Influenza A virus, it does not demonstrate a similar sensitivity to cholesterol concentration and receptor nano-cluster formation.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEParamyxoviruses are a family of membrane-enveloped viruses with many notable human and animal pathogens. In this study, we develop and use an assay to observe the initial step of infection - virus binding to the host membrane - for Sendai virus, the prototypical paramyxovirus, at the single virus level. This assay uses cell membrane mimics - supported lipid bilayers - as targets for virus binding to enable easy control of the membrane components with which the virus interacts. Using our assay, we gain insight into basic biophysical questions about Sendai virus binding, including the chemical characteristics of the receptor, the cooperative nature of binding, the influence of cholesterol, and the mechanism of viral mobility following binding.",

This is achieved by rapid cooling in liquid nitrogen or propane. Protocols for protein crystal cryoprotection are based on either increasing environmental pressure or reducing the water fraction in the solvent. This study presents a new protocol for cryoprotecting crystals. It is based on vapour diffusion dehydration of the crystal drop to reduce the water fraction in the solvent by adding a highly concentrated salt solution, 13 M potassium formate (KF13), directly to the reservoir. Cryoprotection by the KF13 protocol is non-invasive to the crystal, high throughput, not labour intensive, can benefit diffraction resolution and ligand binding, and is very useful in cases with high redundancy such as drug discovery projects which utilize very large compound or fragment libraries. Moreover, an application of KF13 to discover new crystal hits from clear drops of equilibrated crystallization screening plates is also shown.",

    "abstract": "We earlier reported that cell-projection pumping transfers fibroblast contents to cancer cells, and this alters cancer cell phenotype. We now report on single-cell tracking of time lapse recordings from co-cultured fluorescent fibroblasts and SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells, tracking 5,201 cells across 7 experiments. The fluorescent lipophilic marker DiD was used to label fibroblast organelles, and to trace transfer of fibroblast cytoplasm into SAOS-2. We related SAOS-2 phenotypic change to levels of fluorescence transfer from fibroblasts to SAOS-2, and also to what we term  compensated fluorescence, that numerically projects mother cell fluorescence post-mitosis, into daughter cells. Comparison of absolute with compensated fluorescence, allowed deduction if phenotypic effects in mother SAOS-2, were inherited by their daughters. SAOS-2 receipt of fibroblast fluorescence correlated by Kendalls tau: with cell-profile area, and without evidence for persistence in daughter cells (median tau = 0.51, p < 0. 016); negatively and weakly with cell circularity, and with evidence for persistence (median tau = -0.19, p < 0.05); and very weakly with cell migration velocity, and without evidence for persistence (median tau = 0.01, p < 0.016). Also, mitotic SAOS-2 had higher rates of prior fluorescence uptake (median = 64.9 units/day), compared with non dividing cells (median = 35.6 units/day, p < 0.016), and there was no evidence for persistence post-mitosis. We conclude there is appreciable impact of cell-projection pumping on cancer cell phenotype, relevant to cancer histopathological diagnosis, clinical spread, and growth, with most effects  reset by cancer cell mitosis.",

    "abstract": "The lymphatic vasculature is critical for lung function, but defects in lymphatic function in the pathogenesis of lung disease is understudied. In mice, lymphatic dysfunction alone is sufficient to cause lung injury that resembles human emphysema. Whether lymphatic function is disrupted in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced emphysema is unknown. In this study, we investigated lung lymphatic function in the pathogenesis of CS-induced emphysema. Analysis of human lung tissue revealed significant lung lymphatic thrombosis in patients with emphysema compared to control smokers that increased with disease severity. In vitro assays demonstrated a direct effect of CS on lymphatic endothelial cell integrity. In a mouse model, CS exposure led to lung lymphatic thrombosis, decreased lymphatic drainage, and impaired leukocyte trafficking that preceded emphysema. Proteomic analysis of lymph confirmed upregulation of coagulation and inflammatory pathways in the lymphatics of CS-exposed mice compared to control mice. These data suggest that CS exposure results in lung lymphatic dysfunction with thrombosis, impaired leukocyte trafficking, and changes in the composition of lymph. In patients with emphysema, lung lymphatic thrombosis is seen with increasing disease severity. These studies for the first time demonstrate lung lymphatic dysfunction after cigarette smoke exposure and suggest a novel component in the pathogenesis of emphysema.",

    "abstract": "Proteome-wide crosslinking mass spectrometry studies have coincided with the advent of MS-cleavable crosslinkers that can reveal the individual masses of the two crosslinked peptides. However, recently such studies have also been published with non-cleavable crosslinkers suggesting that MS-cleavability is not essential. We therefore examined in detail the advantages and disadvantages of using the most popular MS-cleavable crosslinker, DSSO. Indeed, DSSO gave rise to signature peptide fragments with a distinct mass difference (doublet) for nearly all identified crosslinked peptides. Surprisingly, we could show that it was not these peptide masses that proved the main advantage of MS-cleavability of the crosslinker, but improved peptide backbone fragmentation that allowed for more confident peptide identification. We also show that the more intricate MS3-based data acquisition approaches lack sensitivity and specificity, causing them to be outperformed by the simpler and faster stepped HCD method. This understanding will guide future developments and applications of proteome-wide crosslinking mass spectrometry.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical nuclei and other deep brain structures are known to play an important role in the regulation of the central and peripheral nervous systems. It can be difficult to identify and delineate many of these nuclei and their finer subdivisions in conventional MRI due to their small size, buried location, and often subtle contrast compared to neighboring tissue. To address this problem, we applied a multi-modal approach in ex vivo non-human primate (NHP) brain that includes high-resolution mean apparent propagator (MAP)-MRI and five different histological stains imaged with high-resolution microscopy in the brain of the same subject. By registering these high-dimensional MRI data to high-resolution histology data, we can map the location, boundaries, subdivisions, and micro-architectural features of subcortical gray matter regions in the macaque monkey brain. At high spatial resolution, diffusion MRI in general, and MAP-MRI in particular, can distinguish a large number of deep brain structures, including the larger and smaller white matter fiber tracts as well as architectonic features within various nuclei. Correlation with histology from the same brain enables a thorough validation of the structures identified with MAP-MRI. Moreover, anatomical details that are evident in images of MAP-MRI parameters are not visible in conventional T1-weighted images. We also derived subcortical template \"SC21\" from segmented MRI slices in three-dimensions and registered this volume to a previously published anatomical template with cortical parcellation (Reveley et al., 2017; Saleem and Logothetis, 2012), thereby integrating the 3D segmentation of both cortical and subcortical regions into the same volume. This newly updated three-dimensional D99 digital brain atlas (V2.0) is intended for use as a reference standard for macaque neuroanatomical, functional, and connectional imaging studies, involving both cortical and subcortical targets. The SC21 and D99 digital templates are available as volumes and surfaces in standard NIFTI and GIFTI formats.",

The gut microbiome is an essential modulator of the immune system, impacting in the brain. AD has been related with reduced diversity and alterations in the community composition of the gut microbiota. This study aimed to determine whether the gut microbiota from AD mice exacerbates neurological deficits after TBI in control mice. We prepared fecal microbiota transplants from 18-24 months old 3xTg-AD (FMT-AD) and from healthy controls (FMT-young) mice. FMTs were administered orally to young control C57BL/6 (wild-type, WT) mice after they underwent controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, as a model of TBI. Then, we characterized the microbiota composition of the fecal samples by full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. We collected the blood, brain, and gut tissues for protein and immunohistochemical analysis. Our results showed that FMT-AD administration stimulates a higher relative abundance of the genus Muribaculum and a decrease in Lactobacillus johnsonii compared to FMT-young in WT mice. Furthermore, WT mice exhibited larger lesion, increased activated microglia/macrophages, and reduced motor recovery after FMT-AD compared to FMT-young one day after TBI. In summary, we observed gut microbiota from AD mice to have a detrimental effect and aggravate the neuroinflammatory response and neurological outcomes after TBI in young WT mice.",

    "abstract": "Aging impairs the ability of neural stem cells to transition from quiescence to activation (proliferation) in the adult mammalian brain. Neural stem cell (NSC) functional decline results in decreased production of new neurons and defective regeneration upon injury during aging1-9, and this is exacerbated in Alzheimers disease10. Many genes are upregulated with age in NSCs3, 11-13, and the knockout of some of these boosts old NSC activation and rejuvenates aspects of old brain function14-18. But systematic functional testing of genes in old NSCs - and more generally in old cells - has not been done. This has been a major limiting factor in identifying the most promising rejuvenation interventions. Here we develop in vitro and in vivo high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screening platforms to systematically uncover gene knockouts that boost NSC activation in old mice. Our genome-wide screening pipeline in primary cultures of young and old NSCs identifies over 300 gene knockouts that specifically restore old NSC activation. Interestingly, the top gene knockouts are involved in glucose import, cilium organization and ribonucleoprotein structures. To determine which gene knockouts have a rejuvenating effect for the aging brain, we establish a scalable CRISPR-Cas9 screening platform in vivo in old mice. Of the 50 gene knockouts we tested in vivo, 23 boost old NSC activation and production of new neurons in old brains. Notably, the knockout of Slc2a4, which encodes for the GLUT4 glucose transporter, is a top rejuvenating intervention for old NSCs. GLUT4 protein expression increases in the stem cell niche during aging, and we show that old NSCs indeed uptake [~]2-fold more glucose than their young counterparts. Transient glucose starvation increases the ability of old NSCs to activate, which is not further improved by knockout of Slc2a4/GLUT4. Together, these results indicate that a shift in glucose uptake contributes to the decline in NSC activation with age, but that it can be reversed by genetic or external interventions. Importantly, our work provides scalable platforms to systematically identify genetic interventions that boost old NSC function, including in vivo in old brains, with important implications for regenerative and cognitive decline during aging.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurologic disability; the most common deficits affect prefrontal cortex-dependent functions such as attention, working memory, social behavior, and mental flexibility. Despite this prevalence, little is known about the pathophysiology that develops in frontal cortical microcircuits after TBI. We investigated if alterations in subtype-specific inhibitory circuits are associated with cognitive inflexibility in a mouse model of frontal lobe contusion that recapitulates aberrant mental flexibility as measured by deficits in rule reversal learning. Using patch clamp recordings and optogenetic stimulation, we identified selective vulnerability in the non-fast spiking, somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) subtype of inhibitory neurons in layer V of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) two months after injury. These neurons exhibited reduced intrinsic excitability and a decrease in their synaptic output onto pyramidal neurons. By contrast, fast spiking, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons did not show changes in intrinsic excitability or synaptic output. Impairments in SOM+ inhibitory circuit function were also associated with network hyperexcitability. These findings provide evidence for selective disruptions within specific inhibitory microcircuits that may guide the development of novel therapeutics for TBI.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on visual working memory (VWM) have shown that visual information can be stored in VWM as continuous (e.g., a specific shade of red) as well as categorical representations (e.g., the general category red). It has been widely assumed, yet never directly tested, that continuous representations require more VWM mental effort than categorical representations; given limited VWM capacity, this would mean that fewer continuous, as compared to categorical, representations can be maintained simultaneously. We tested this assumption by measuring pupil size, as a proxy for mental effort, in a delayed estimation task. Participants memorized one to four ambiguous (boundaries between adjacent color categories) or prototypical colors to encourage continuous or categorical representations, respectively; after a delay, a probe indicated the location of the to-be-reported color. We found that, for set size 1, pupil size was larger while maintaining ambiguous as compared to prototypical colors, but without any difference in memory precision; this suggests that participants relied on an effortful continuous representation to maintain a single ambiguous color, thus resulting in pupil dilation while preserving precision. In contrast, for set size 2 and higher, pupil size was equally large while maintaining ambiguous and prototypical colors, but memory precision was now substantially reduced for ambiguous colors; this suggests that participants now also relied on categorical representations for ambiguous colors (which are by definition a poor fit to any category), thus reducing memory precision but not resulting in pupil dilation. Taken together, our results suggest that continuous representations are more effortful than categorical representations, and that very few continuous representations (perhaps only one) can be maintained simultaneously.\n\nSignificance statementVisual working memory (VWM) can store visual information in two more-or-less distinct formats: continuous and categorical representations. It is widely assumed that VWM capacity for continuous representations is more limited than for categorical representations, yet this assumption has never been explicitly tested. Here we address this crucial question of whether continuous representations cost more resources, and as a consequence limits VWM capacity, as compared to categorical representations. To do so, we measured pupil size (as a proxy for mental effort) and memory performance in a delayed estimation task. Crucially, our results suggest that continuous representations are more effortful than categorical representations, and that only one continuous representation can be maintained in VWM at one time.",

Mice were sacrificed seven days post-injection and bladder proteins isolated and processed for proteome profiling using mass spectrometry.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that biological processes including carcinogenesis, immune and inflammatory responses, increased protein translation or turnover, oxidative stress responses, reduced cell adhesion and epithelial barrier integrity, and increased glucose metabolism were significantly enriched in S. haematobium infection.\n\nConclusionS. haematobium egg deposition in the bladder results in significant changes in proteins and pathways that play a role in pathology. Our findings highlight the potential bladder protein indicators for host-parasite interplay and provide new insights into the complex dynamics of pathology and characteristic bladder tissue changes in urogenital schistosomiasis. The findings will be relevant for development of improved interventions for disease control.\n\nAuthor summaryThe molecular mechanisms underlying the urinary and genital pathology from urogenital schistosomiasis have not been well-defined. This has mainly been due to limited mechanistic studies and the lack of a suitable animal model for S. haematobium infection. We leveraged a mouse model of urogenital schistosomiasis, along with proteomics analysis, to determine the early molecular events that occur in the bladder after exposure to S. haematobium eggs, and to define protein pathways that may be involved in morbidity from urogenital schistosomiasis infection. Our results show that S. haematobium egg deposition in the bladder results in significant changes in proteins and pathways that play a role in pathology. Biological processes including carcinogenesis, immune and inflammatory responses, increased protein translation or turnover, oxidative stress responses, reduced cell adhesion and epithelial barrier integrity, and increased glucose metabolism are significantly enriched in S. haematobium infection. Our findings highlight important protein indicators of host-parasite interactions in the bladder and their association with tissue changes in urogenital schistosomiasis. The findings presented here will be relevant for development of improved interventions for disease control, and contribute to realizing the 2021-2030 NTD goals by demonstrating evidence on the early events that occur during schistosome infection.",

CRISPR-Cas immune systems in prokaryotes manage this task by following two criteria: extensive guide:target complementarity and a defined target-flanking motif. Here we report an additional requirement for RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 systems: expression of the target transcript exceeding a threshold. This finding is based on targeting endogenous non-essential transcripts, which rarely elicited dormancy through collateral RNA degradation. Instead, eliciting dormancy required over-expressing targeted transcripts above a threshold. A genome-wide screen confirmed target expression levels as the principal determinant of cytotoxic autoimmunity and revealed that the threshold shifts with the guide:target pair. This expression threshold ensured defense against a lytic bacteriophage yet allowed tolerance of a targeted beneficial gene expressed from an invading plasmid. These findings establish target expression levels as a third criterion for immune activation by RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems, buffering against autoimmunity and distinguishing pathogenic and benign invaders.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICas13-induced dormancy requires RNA target levels to exceed an expression threshold\nC_LIO_LIThe expression threshold can prevent cytotoxic self-targeting for endogenous transcripts\nC_LIO_LIThe threshold shifts depending on the CRISPR RNA guide:target pair\nC_LIO_LIThe threshold allows cells to distinguish pathogenic and benign infections\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes highly conserved among prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, where their role is to catalyse protein cross-linking. One of the putative TGases of Phytophthora infestans has previously been shown to be localised to the cell wall. Based on sequence similarity we were able to identify six more genes annotated as putative TGases and show that these seven genes group together in phylogenetic analysis. All of the seven proteins are predicted to contain transmembrane helices and both a TGase domain and a MANSC domain, the latter of which was previously shown to play a role in protein stability. Chemical inhibition of transglutaminase activity and silencing of the entire family of the putative cell wall TGases are both lethal to P. infestans indicating the importance of these proteins in cell wall formation and stability. The intermediate phenotype obtained with lower drug concentrations and less efficient silencing displays a number of deformations to germ tubes and appressoria. Both chemically treated and silenced lines show lower pathogenicity than the wild type in leaf infection assays. Finally, we show that appressoria of P. infestans possess the ability to build up turgor pressure and that this ability is decreased by chemical inhibition of TGases.",

This study aimed to induce cell tenogenesis using stable Scleraxis (Scx) overexpression in combination with uniaxial mechanical stretch of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of different origins. Scleraxis (Scx) is the single direct molecular regulator of tendon differentiation known to date. Mechanoregulation is known to be a central element guiding tendon development and healing. Cells explored were bone marrow-derived (BM-)MSCs as well as MSCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iMSCs). Mechanical stimulation combined with Scx overexpression resulted in morphometric and cytoskeleton-related changes, upregulation of early and late tendon markers, increased ECM deposition and alignment, and tenomodulin perinuclear localization in iMSCs, which was greater compared to BM-MSCs and controls. Our findings suggest that these cells can be differentiated into tenocytes and may be a better candidate for tendon cell therapy applications than BM-MSCs.",

    "abstract": "To maintain a balance of self-renewal versus neurogenesis, neural stem cells (NSCs) undergo asymmetric cell division along an invariant polarity axis instructed by centrosomes. In the NSCs of the third instar Drosophila larval brain, the interphase centrosomes are defined by marked asymmetries in protein composition and functional activity as microtubule-organizing centers. Here we show that a conserved RNA-binding protein, Orb2, supports NSC centrosome asymmetry by localizing to the cytoplasm, where it promotes robust apical centrosome maturation and transient basal centrosome inactivation, required for centrosome segregation and spindle morphogenesis. Orb2 is required cell autonomously within NSCs to support centrosome asymmetry and maintenance of the stem cell pool. We suggest Orb2 plays opposing roles in centrosome activation and inactivation at the apical versus basal centrosomes respectively, possibly through the translational regulation of multiple mRNAs. Conversely, loss of orb2 manifests in microcephaly independent of Orb2 function in NSCs. Bioinformatics uncovers a significant overlap among RNA targets between Drosophila Orb2 and human CPEB4, consistent with a conserved role for CPEB proteins in centrosome regulation and neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough the widespread expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has only been recognized recently, increasing evidence has suggested their important roles in health and disease. To identify clinically relevant circRNAs with potential for wound diagnosis and therapy, an in-depth characterization of circRNA expression in human healing and non-healing wounds is a prerequisite that has not been attained yet.\n\nMethodsWe collected wound-edge biopsies through the healing process of healthy donors and in chronic non-healing venous ulcers (VU). Paired total RNA- and small RNA-sequencing were performed to profile circRNAs, protein-coding mRNAs, and microRNA expression. We analyzed the co-expression relationship between circRNAs and mRNAs with weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and constructed circRNA-microRNA-mRNA networks. For the circRNAs surfaced in the in-silico analysis, after validating their expression with RT-PCR and sequencing, we silenced hsa-CHST15_0003 and hsa-TNFRSF21_0001 expression in keratinocytes with siRNAs and studied their function with transcriptomic profiling and live-cell monitoring.\n\nResultsOur study unravels the dynamically changed expression patterns of circRNAs during human skin wound healing and their abnormal expression signature in VU, which are presented as a searchable web resource (http://130.229.28.87/shiny/circRNA_wholebiopsy-shinyApp/). In silico analysis deciphers the circRNA-miRNAs-mRNA networks specific to the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound repair and VU, the biological processes that circRNAs are involved, and the circRNAs that could act as miRNAs sponge in human wounds. Importantly, we found that hsa-CHST15_0003 and hsa-TNFRSF21_0001, two circRNAs upregulated in VU, hampered keratinocyte migration while promoting proliferation through modulating gene networks underpinning these cellular processes.\n\nConclusionBy integrating circRNA, mRNA, and miRNA expression profiles in a unique collection of clinical samples, we identify the circRNAs that are relevant to human wound healing physiology and pathology. This study paves the way to decipher the functional significance of circRNAs in tissue repair.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDepositing eggs in an area with adequate temperature is often crucial for mothers and their offspring, as the eggs are immobile and therefore cannot avoid exposure to sub-optimal temperatures. However, the importance of temperature on oviposition site selection is less clear when mothers can avoid these potential adverse effects by both moving their eggs after oviposition and providing other forms of egg care. In this study, we addressed this question in the European earwig, an insect in which mothers care for the eggs during several months in winter, frequently moving them during this period. We set up 60 females from two random natural populations (as this species often exhibits population-specific life-history traits and behaviours) under controlled thermal gradients, and recorded the temperature at which they built their nests, tested whether they moved their eggs after an experimental temperature change, and measured the effects on egg development and hatching rate. Our results demonstrate that females indeed select oviposition sites according to temperature, and can move their eggs to reach warmer temperatures. We also show that these warmer temperatures are necessary to ensure egg hatching. Although this set of behavioural thermoregulations is present in the two tested populations, we found a population-specific modality of expression. These included the range of temperatures explored before oviposition, temperature selected at oviposition and dynamics of egg transport following a temperature change. Overall, our study sheds light on a new post-oviposition strategy in female insects that overwinter with their eggs for coping with temperature changes. More generally, it also reveals that egg care and/or egg transport do not prevent behavioural thermoregulation via oviposition site selection and highlights the diversity of behaviours that insects can adopt to enhance their tolerance to global climate change.",

Many Dipodomys species are experiencing strong population declines due to increasing habitat fragmentation, with two species listed as federally endangered. The precarious state of many Dipodomys populations, including those occupying extreme environments, make species of this genus valuable subjects for studying the impacts of habitat degradation and fragmentation on population genomic patterns and for characterizing the genomic bases of adaptation to harsh conditions. To facilitate exploration of such questions, we assembled and annotated a reference genome for the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (D. spectabilis) using PacBio HiFi sequencing reads, providing a more contiguous genomic resource than two previously assembled Dipodomys genomes. Using the HiFi data for D. spectabilis and publicly available sequencing data for two other Dipodomys species (D. ordii and D. stephensi), we demonstrate the utility of this new assembly for studies of congeners by conducting inference of historic effective population sizes (Ne) and linking these patterns to the species current extinction risk statuses. The genome assembly presented here will serve as a valuable resource for population and conservation genomic studies of Dipodomys species, comparative genomic research within mammals and rodents, and investigations into genomic adaptation to extreme environments and changing landscapes.\n\nSignificance statementKangaroo rats in the genus Dipodomys occur in a wide variety of habitat types, ranging from scrublands to arid deserts, and are increasingly impacted by habitat fragmentation with populations of many species in strong decline.

The PSB with PGP properties used in this research were Bacillus cereus strain GGBSU-1, Proteus mirabilis strain TL14-1 and Klebsiella variicola strain AUH-KAM-9 that were previously isolated and characterized following the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Biosafety analysis of the PSB isolates was conducted using blood agar. The rice seeds were then bio-primed with the PSBs at 3, 12 and 24 hours priming durations and then sown in a composite FU soil sample. Differences in germination bioassay involving SEM, morphology, physiology and biomass parameters were investigated for 15 weeks after bio-priming. The composite FU soil used in the study had high pH, low bioavailable phosphorus, low water holding capacity and high iron levels which has led to a low growth properties of rice seeds without bio-priming in FU soil. Germination parameters was better in seeds bio-primed with the PSBs, especially at 12h priming duration as against seeds without priming. SEM showed more bacterial colonization in the PSB bio-primed seeds. Seed bio-priming of rice seed with Bacillus cereus strain GGBSU-1, Proteus mirabilis strain TL14-1 and Klebsiella variicola strain AUH-KAM-9 under FU soil condition significantly improved seed microbiome, rhizocolonization and soil nutrient properties, thereby enhancing growth properties of the rice plant.

    "abstract": "Both aging and neuromuscular diseases lead to significant changes in the morphology and functionality of the neuromuscular synapse. Skeletal muscles display a remarkable regenerative capacity, however, are still susceptible to diseases of aging and peripheral nerve perturbations. In this study, we assessed how neuromuscular synapses differ in aged and injured skeletal muscle using an improved neuromuscular junction (NMJ) staining and imaging method. We found that both aged and ischemic skeletal muscle display Wallerian degeneration of the presynaptic motor axons and fragmentation of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Quantifiable measurements of various metrics of the NMJs provide a more concrete idea of the dynamics that are occurring in the muscle microenvironment. We questioned whether neuronal degradation precedes myofiber atrophy or vice versa. Previously, it was shown that a cellular crosstalk exists among the motor neurons, myofibers, vasculature, and mitochondria within the muscle microdomain. It is apparent that lack of blood flow to motor neurons in ischemic skeletal muscle disrupts the structure of NMJs, however it is unclear if the aging condition experiences similar dynamics. We demonstrated that both aged and ischemic skeletal muscle demonstrate similar patterns of degeneration, characterized by a smaller percentage overlap of presynaptic and postsynaptic sides, greater fragmentation of AChRs, and a smaller area of AChR clusters. Together, these results reveal high resolution, precise parallels between the aged and ischemic NMJs.\n\nImpact StatementThe goal of this study was to assess changes in presynaptic motor neurons and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors following an ischemic injury model and compare this with an aging model. This was accomplished by characterizing key components of NMJ morphology, including overlap and size of the receptors. There is currently limited research investigating the cellular communication between skeletal muscle fibers and motor neurons. Additionally, there is limited work comparing neuromuscular remodeling in aged and young models. With the substantial prevalence of neuromuscular disorders, especially in the aging population, it is essential to understand nerve-muscle interactions in order to promote increased mobility and improved quality of life in both injury and aging models.",

CA1 SOM cells receive major excitatory inputs from pyramidal cells (PC-SOM synapses) which show mGluR1a- and mTORC1-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP). PC-SOM synapse LTP contributes to CA1 network metaplasticity and memory consolidation, but whether it is sufficient to regulate these processes remains unknown. Here we used optogenetic stimulation of CA1 pyramidal cells and whole cell recordings in slices to show that optogenetic theta burst stimulation (TBSopto) produces LTP at PC-SOM synapses. At the network level, we found that TBSopto differentially regulates metaplasticity of pyramidal cell inputs: enhancing LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses and depressing LTP at temporo-ammonic synapses. At the behavioral level, we uncovered that in vivo TBSopto regulates learning-induced LTP at PC-SOM synapses, as well as contextual fear memory. Thus, LTP of PC-SOM synapses is a long-term feedback mechanism controlling pyramidal cell synaptic plasticity, sufficient to regulate memory consolidation.",

To date, over a hundred COVID-19 vaccines are known to be under development and the few that have been approved to fight the disease are using the spike protein as the primary target antigen. Although virus neutralizing epitopes are mainly located within the RBD of the spike protein, the presence of T cell epitopes, particularly the CTL epitopes that are likely to be needed for killing infected cells, has received comparatively little attention. In this study, we predicted several potential T cell epitopes with web-based analytic tools, and narrowed them down from several potential MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes by ELIspot and cytolytic assays to a conserved MHC-I epitope. The epitope is highly conserved in current viral variants including the most recent Omicron and compatible with presentation by most HLA alleles worldwide. In conclusion, we identified a CTL epitope suitable for evaluating the CD8+ T cell-mediated cellular response and potentially for addition into future COVID-19 vaccine candidates to maximize CTL responses against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial biogenesis has two major steps: the transcriptional activation of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins and the import of nascent mitochondrial proteins that are synthesized in the cytosol. These nascent mitochondrial proteins are aggregation-prone and can cause cytosolic proteostasis stress. The transcription factor-dependent transcriptional regulations and the TOM-TIM complex-dependent import of nascent mitochondrial proteins have been extensively studied. Yet, little is known regarding how these two steps of mitochondrial biogenesis coordinate with each other to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of these aggregation-prone nascent mitochondrial proteins. Here we show that in budding yeast, Tom70, a conserved receptor of the TOM complex, moonlights to regulate the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins. Tom70s transcription regulatory role is conserved in Drosophila. The dual roles of Tom70 in both transcription/biogenesis and import of mitochondrial proteins allow the cells to accomplish mitochondrial biogenesis without compromising cytosolic proteostasis. The age-related reduction of Tom70, caused by reduced biogenesis and increased degradation of Tom70, is associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA, and mitochondrial proteins.

    "abstract": "PurposePlants and soil microbes both influence how ecosystems respond to environmental change. Yet, we lack the ability to generalize how plants and soil microbes influence each other in the same or varying soil conditions. This limitation thwarts ecologists ability to understand and predict effects of environmental changes such and elevated anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition. Accordingly, we examined the specificity of plant species influence on soil microbial community composition.\n\nMethodsWe tested (1) whether congeneric grass species have unique effects on soil microbial communities, (2) how relative abundances of microbial taxa can be explained by Poa phylogeny, plant traits, and range-wide traits (annual temperature and soil pH), and (3) whether N addition alters associations between Poa species and soil microbes, and (4) whether the magnitude of microbial community change in response to elevated N can be explained by plant growth responses to N. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with seven Poa species and native soils.\n\nResultsWe found that individual Poa species were associated with different soil fungi but similar soil bacteria. Differences in microbial composition were not attributable to Poa phylogeny, plant traits, or range-wide traits. Nitrogen addition enhanced the unique effects of Poa species on fungal and bacterial community compositions.\n\nConclusionThese results demonstrate how ecological interactions of related plant species vary depending on resource supply, revealing important context dependency for accurately predicting microbially-mediated nutrient cycling and ecosystem responses to changes in nutrient availability.",

    "abstract": "Recombination contributes to the genetic diversity found in coronaviruses and is known to be a prominent mechanism whereby they evolve. It is apparent, both from controlled experiments and in genome sequences sampled from nature, that patterns of recombination in coronaviruses are non-random and that this is likely attributable to a combination of sequence features that favour the occurrence of recombination breakpoints at specific genomic sites, and selection disfavouring the survival of recombinants within which favourable intra-genome interactions have been disrupted. Here we leverage available whole-genome sequence data for six coronavirus subgenera to identify specific patterns of recombination that are conserved between multiple subgenera and then identify the likely factors that underlie these conserved patterns. Specifically, we confirm the non-randomness of recombination breakpoints across all six tested coronavirus subgenera, locate conserved recombination hot- and cold-spots, and determine that the locations of transcriptional regulatory sequences are likely major determinants of conserved recombination breakpoint hot-spot locations. We find that while the locations of recombination breakpoints are not uniformly associated with degrees of nucleotide sequence conservation, they display significant tendencies in multiple coronavirus subgenera to occur in low guanine-cytosine content genome regions, in non-coding regions, at the edges of genes, and at sites within the Spike gene that are predicted to be minimally disruptive of Spike protein folding. While it is apparent that sequence features such as transcriptional regulatory sequences are likely major determinants of where the template-switching events that yield recombination breakpoints most commonly occur, it is evident that selection against misfolded recombinant proteins also strongly impacts observable recombination breakpoint distributions in coronavirus genomes sampled from nature.",

We transplanted cardiomyocytes with an optogenetic off-on switch in a guinea pig cardiac injury model. Light-induced inhibition of engrafted cardiomyocyte contractility resulted in a rapid decrease of left ventricular function that was fully reversible with the offset of photostimulation. Hence, our optogenetic approach demonstrated that transplanted cardiomyocytes actively participate in heart function, supporting the hypothesis that the delivery of new force-generating myocardium can serve as a regenerative therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Acute pain events have been associated with persistent pain sensitization of nociceptive pathways increasing the risk of transition from acute to chronic pain. However, it is unclear whether injuryinduced persistent pain sensitization can promote long-term mood disorders. The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is causally required for pain chronification after peripheral nerve injury, questioning its role in the development of pain-induced mood alterations. Here, we evaluated the emotional and sensorial components of pain after a single (SI) or double paw incision (DI). We then investigated the role of FLT3 either by inhibition using transgenic knock-out mice and functional antibodies or by activation with FLT3 ligand (FL) administrations.\n\nDI mice showed significant anxiodepressive-like and spontaneous pain behaviors as opposed to SI mice. DI also promoted and extended mechanical pain hypersensitivity compared to SI. This emotional and sensorial pain exaggeration correlated with spinal changes especially by increased microglia activation after DI versus SI. Intrathecal minocycline, a microglial inhibitor, specifically reversed DI inducedmechanical hypersensitivity in males. Repeated treatment with the microglia proliferation inhibitor GW2580 not only eliminated the exaggerated pain hypersensitivity produced by DI but also prevented anxiodepressive-related behaviors in DI animals. Finally, FL injections in naive animals provoked mechanical allodynia and anxiodepressive-like disorders concomitant with a strong microglial activation while Flt3 silencing in a genetic mouse line or FLT3 blocking via functional antibodies, blunted the development of persistent pain and depression after DI. Altogether our results show that the repetition of peripheral lesions facilitate not only exaggerated nociceptive behaviors but also induced anxiodepressive disorders supported by spinal central changes. The inhibition of FLT3 could thus become a promising therapy in the management of pain sensitization and related mood alterations.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of malaria, continues to remain a global health threat since these parasites have developed increasing resistance to all anti-malaria drugs used throughout the world. Accordingly, drugs with novel modes of action are desperately required to combat malaria. P. falciparum parasites infect human red blood cells where they digest the hosts main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase PfA-M17 is one of several aminopeptidases that have been implicated in the last step of this digestive pathway. Here we utilize both reverse genetics and a compound specifically designed to inhibit the activity of PfA-M17 to show that PfA-M17 is essential for P. falciparum survival as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth, many of which are highly likely to originate from hemoglobin. We further show that our inhibitor is on-target for PfA-M17 and has the ability to kill parasites at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, in contrast to other hemoglobin-degrading proteases that have overlapping redundant functions, we validate PfA-M17 as a potential novel drug target.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration after severe peripheral nerve injury is often poor. Knowledge of human nerve regeneration and the growth microenvironment is greatly lacking. We aimed to identify the regenerative proteins in human peripheral nerve by comparing the proteome before and after a transection injury. In a unique study design, we collected from the same participants, samples from naive and degenerating sural nerve. Naive and degenerating (two weeks after injury) samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry and immunoassays. Using a correlation matrix, we found significantly altered levels following the nerve injury. Mass spectrometry revealed that post-injury samples had 672 proteins significantly upregulated and 661 significantly downregulated compared to naive samples (q < 0.05, |FC| > 2). We used Gene Ontology pathways to highlight groups of proteins that were significantly upregulated or downregulated with injury-induced degeneration and regeneration. Significant protein changes in key pathways were identified including growth factor levels, Schwann cell de-differentiation, myelination downregulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and axonal regeneration pathways. Having proteome signatures of human peripheral nerves of both the uninjured and the degenerating/regenerating state may serve as biomarkers to aid in the future development of repair strategies and in monitoring neural tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Defects in primary or motile cilia result in a variety of human pathologies, and retinal degeneration is frequently associated with these so-called ciliopathies. We show that homozygosity for a truncating variant in CEP162, a centrosome and microtubule-associated protein required for transition zone (TZ) assembly during ciliogenesis and neuronal differentiation in the retina, causes late-onset retinitis pigmentosa in 2 unrelated families. The mutant CEP162-E646R*5 protein is expressed and properly localized to the mitotic spindle but missing from the basal body in primary and photoreceptor cilia. This impairs recruitment of TZ components to the basal body and corresponds to complete loss of CEP162 function at the ciliary compartment, reflected by delayed formation of dysmorphic cilia. In contrast, rescue of increased cell death in the developing mouse retina after shRNA knockdown of Cep162 by expression of CEP162-E646R*5 indicates that the mutant retains its role for retinal neurogenesis. Human retinal degeneration thus results from specific loss of ciliary CEP162 function.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/469779v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@593dccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e84d7forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137ce56org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cba1f7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
