    "abstract": "Individuals differ in average phenotypes and in sensitivity to environmental variation. Such context-sensitivity can be modelled as random-slope variation. Random-slope variation implies that the proportion of between-individual variation varies across the range of a covariate (environment/context/time/age) and has thus been called  conditional repeatability. We propose to put conditional repeatabilities in perspective of the total phenotypic variance and suggest a way of standardization using the random-slope coefficient of determination [Formula]. Furthermore, we illustrate that the marginalized repeatability Rmar averaged across an environmental gradient offers a biologically relevant description of between-individual variation. We provide simple equations for calculating key descriptors of conditional repeatabilities, clarify the difference between random-intercept variation and average between-individual variation and make recommendations for comprehensive reporting. While we introduce the concept with individual variation in mind, the framework is equally applicable to other type of between-group/cluster variation that varies across some (environmental) gradient.",

    "abstract": "The concept of pictorial balance as a visual center-of-mass effect originated at the beginning of the 20th century to explain why some paintings evoke feelings of unity and harmony. It had never been mentioned in art commentary of the previous 500 years and is an unsubstantiated but widely assumed illusion. However, the visual basis for this illusion exists, and it is the object of this paper to explain what balance is and what it says about the visual system. A computer model was created of an unnamed pictorial effect known to painters when a picture feels unusually unified and harmonious. It was first described by a 17th century critic Roger de Piles, and there are descriptions of it by renowned artists. It was thought by the author that this effect was due to the painting being in a state of perfect balance. Computer modeling found that it had bilateral luminance symmetry with a lighter lower half by [~]1.07 and that balance is based solely on luminosity. A study was done in which the identical picture in two different frames could seem different to subjects who viewed them in sequence; the sole difference being the total balance of the image. The study did not show that the subjects could see the effect but did show that the method of calculating balance using an algorithm was correct. It was found that low averaged balanced pairs could be distinguished from high averaged balanced pairs. This method views an organism as a collection of lights all moving together against a ground. This is divided by a vertical line into two equally luminous parts and further divided in half by a horizontal line. Four virtual lines are drawn parallel to the above two to create a picture. Light from each quadrant is spread to fill its respective quadrant, and the upper half is arbitrarily filtered to make it darker so that organisms illuminated from above would appear more balance. Balance is calculated by a center of quadrant luminance equation analogous to a center-of-mass calculation. It is suggested that object balance is a residual primitive visual processing system identifying organisms. An ecological explanation of the study is presented. Balance and the visual concepts involved can help painters create more visually attractive paintings if desired and for everyone to understand the neuro-aesthetic effects of paintings.",

Furthermore, we provide a collection of 283,874 lineage-specific genes of unknown function for Cand.

    "abstract": "Type I collagen is the major structural component of bone where it exists as an (1)2(2)1 heterotrimer in all vertebrates. The osteogenesis imperfecta (oim) mouse model comprising solely homotrimeric (1)3 type I collagen, due to a dysfunctional 2 chain, has a brittle bone phenotype implying that the heterotrimeric form is required for physiological bone function. However, humans with rare null alleles preventing synthesis of the 2 chain have connective tissue and cardiovascular abnormalities (cardiac valvular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome), without evident bone fragility. Conversely a prevalent human single nucleotide polymorphism leading to increased homotrimer synthesis is associated with osteoporosis. Whilst the oim line is well-studied, whether homotrimeric type I collagen is functionally equivalent to the heterotrimeric form in bone has not been demonstrated. Col1a2 null and oim mouse lines were used in this study and bones analysed by microCT and 3-point bending. RNA was also extracted from heterozygote tissues and allelic discrimination analyses performed using qRT-PCR. Here we comprehensively show for the first time that mice lacking the 2(I) chain do not have impaired bone biomechanical or structural properties, unlike oim homozygous mice. However Mendelian inheritance was affected in male mice of both lines and male mice null for the 2 chain exhibited age-related loss of condition. The brittle bone phenotype of oim homozygotes could result from detrimental effects of the oim mutant allele, however, the phenotype of oim heterozygotes is known to be less severe. We used allelic discrimination to show that the oim mutant allele is not downregulated in heterozygotes. We then tested whether gene dosage was responsible for the less severe phenotype of oim heterozygotes by generating compound heterozygotes. Data showed that compound heterozygotes had impaired bone structural properties as compared to oim heterozygotes, albeit to a lesser extent than oim homozygotes. Hence, we concluded that the presence of heterotrimeric collagen-1 in oim heterozygotes alleviates the effect of the oim mutant allele but a genetic interaction between homotrimeric collagen-1 and the oim mutant allele leads to bone fragility.",

    "abstract": "The ability to make decisions based on external information, prior knowledge and evidence, is a crucial aspect of cognition and may determine the success and survival of an organism. Despite extensive work on decision-making mechanisms/models, understanding the effects of alertness on neural and cognitive processes remain limited. Here we use electroencephalography and behavioural modelling to characterise cognitive and neural dynamics of perceptual decision-making in awake/low alertness periods in humans (14 male, 18 female) and characterise the compensatory mechanisms as alertness decreases. Well-rested human participants, changing between full-wakefulness and low alertness, performed an auditory tone-localisation task and its behavioural dynamics was quantified with psychophysics, signal detection theory and drift-diffusion modelling, revealing slower reaction times, inattention to the left side of space, and a lower rate of evidence accumulation in periods of low alertness. Unconstrained multivariate pattern analysis (decoding) showed a ~280ms delayed onset driven by low alertness of the neural signatures differentiating between left and right decision, with a spatial reconfiguration from centro-parietal to lateral frontal regions 150-360ms. To understand the neural compensatory mechanisms with decreasing alertness, we connected the evidence-accumulation behavioural parameter to the neural activity, showing in the early periods (125-325ms) a shift in the associated patterns from right parietal regions in awake, to right fronto-parietal during low alertness. This change in the neurobehavioural dynamics for central accumulation related cognitive processes define a clear reconfiguration of the brain networks regions and dynamics needed for the implementation of decision-making, revealing mechanisms of resilience of cognition when challenged by decreased alertness.\n\nSignificance statementMost living organisms make multiple daily decisions and these require a degree of evidence from both the environment and the internal milieu. Such decisions are usually studied under sequential sampling models and involve making a behavioural choice based on sensory encoding, central accumulation, and motor implementation processes. Since there is little research on how decreasing alertness affects such cognitive processes, this study has looked at the cognitive and neural dynamics of perceptual decision-making in people while fully awake and in drowsy periods. Using computational modelling of behaviour and neural dynamics on human participants performing an auditory tone-localisation task, we reveal how low alertness modulates evidence accumulation related processes and its corresponding compensatory neural signatures.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) are thought to contribute to decision-making and motor control by influencing action selection based on consequences. These functions are critically dependent on timing information that can be extracted from the evolving state of neural populations in the striatum, the major input area of the BG. However, it is debated whether striatal activity underlies latent, dynamic decision processes or kinematics of overt movement. Here, we measured the impact of temperature on striatal population activity and the behavior of rats and compared the observed effects to neural activity and behavior collected in multiple versions of a temporal categorization task. Cooler temperatures caused dilation, and warmer temperatures contraction, of both neural activity and patterns of judgment in time, mimicking endogenous decision-related variability in striatal activity. However, temperature did not similarly affect movement kinematics. These data provide compelling evidence that the time course of evolving striatal population activity dictates the speed of a latent process that is used to guide choices, but not moment by moment kinematics. More broadly, they establish temporal scaling of population activity as a likely cause and not simply a correlate of timing behavior in the brain.",

However, causes of early-stage population declines and the susceptibility of small residual populations to extirpation are typically studied in isolation.

We show that reconciling ancient DNA data on woolly mammoth population decline with fossil evidence of location and timing of extinction requires process-explicit models with specific demographic and niche constraints, and a constrained synergy of climatic change and human impacts. Validated models needed humans to hasten climate-driven population declines by many millennia, and to allow woolly mammoths to persist in mainland Arctic refugia until the mid-Holocene. Our results show that the role of humans in the extinction dynamics of woolly mammoth began well before the Holocene, exerting lasting effects on the spatial pattern and timing of its range-wide extinction.",

    "abstract": "In preimplantation embryos, an abnormal chromosome number causes developmental failure and a reduction in the pregnancy rate. Conventional chromosome testing methods requiring biopsy reduce the risk of associated genetic diseases; nevertheless, the reduction in cell number also reduces the pregnancy rate. Therefore, we attempted to count the chromosomes in mouse (Slc:ICR) embryos using super-resolution live-cell imaging as a new method of chromosome counting that does not reduce the cell number or viability. We counted the forty chromosomes at the first mitosis by injecting embryos with histone H2B-mCherry mRNA under conditions by which pups could be obtained; however, the results were often an underestimation of chromosome number and varied by embryo and time point. Therefore, we developed a method to count the chromosomes via CRISPR/dCas-mediated live-cell fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the sequence of the centromere region, enabling us to count the chromosomes more accurately in mouse embryos. The methodology presented here may provide useful information for assisted reproductive technologies, such as those used in livestock animals/humans, as a technique for assessing the chromosomal integrity of embryos prior to transfer.\n\nImpact StatementLow-toxic super-resolution observation enables chromosome counting in preimplantation embryos without cell collection.",

    "abstract": "Altered host-microbe interactions and increased intestinal permeability have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a range of diseases. However, the mechanisms by which gut microbes affect epithelial barrier integrity remain unclear. Few host-produced metabolites that protect against epithelial damage have been identified, and whether microbial metabolism of host factors alters intestinal barrier function is unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of bacterial metabolism of host-produced bile acid (BA) metabolites on epithelial barrier integrity. We observe that rats fed a choline-deficient, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) exhibit reduced abundance of host-produced conjugated BAs in the intestine at early timepoints coinciding with increased permeability. We show that in vitro, conjugated BAs protect gut epithelial monolayers from damage caused by bacterially produced unconjugated BAs through micelle formation. We then demonstrate that inhibition of BA deconjugation using a small molecule inhibitor of gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes prevents development of pathologic intestinal permeability and hepatic inflammation in CDAHFD-fed rats. Finally, we show that the predominant conjugated BAs in humans protect against epithelial barrier disruption in vitro. Our study identifies a protective role for conjugated BAs in intestinal epithelial barrier function and suggests that rational manipulation of microbial BA metabolism could be leveraged to regulate gut barrier integrity.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization can result in novel allelic combinations which can impact the hybrid phenotype through changes in gene expression. While mis-expression in F1 hybrids is well documented, how gene expression evolves in stabilized hybrid taxa remains an open question. As gene expression evolves in a stabilizing manner, break-up of co-evolved cis- and trans-regulatory elements could lead to transgressive patterns of gene expression in hybrids. Here, we address to what extent gonad gene expression has evolved in an established and stable homoploid hybrid, the Italian sparrow (Passer italiae). Through comparison of gene expression in gonads from individuals of the two parental species (i.e., house and Spanish sparrow) to that of Italian sparrows, we find evidence for strongly transgressive expression in male Italian sparrows - 22% of testis genes exhibit expression patterns outside the range of both parent species. In contrast, Italian sparrow ovary expression was similar to that of one of the parent species, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Moreover, the Italian sparrow testis transcriptome is 26 times as diverged from those of the parent species as the parental transcriptomes are from each other, despite being genetically intermediate. This highlights the potential for regulation of gene expression to produce novel variation following hybridization. Genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and protein synthesis are enriched in the subset that is over-dominantly expressed in Italian sparrow testis, suggesting that selection on key functions have molded the hybrid Italian sparrow transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation can be modeled at the single cell level as a stochastic process resulting from the dynamical functioning of an underlying Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), driving stem or progenitor cells to one or many differentiated cell types. Metastability seems inherent to differentiation process as a consequence of the limited number of cell types. Moreover, mRNA is known to be generally produced by bursts, which can give rise to highly variable non-Gaussian behavior, making the estimation of a GRN from transcriptional profiles challenging. In this article, we present CARDAMOM (Cell type Analysis from scRna-seq Data achieved from a Mixture MOdel), a new algorithm for inferring a GRN from timestamped scRNA-seq data, which crucially exploits these notions of metastability and transcriptional bursting. We show that such inference can be seen as the successive resolution of as many regression problem as timepoints, after a preliminary clustering of the whole set of cells with regards to their associated bursts frequency. We demonstrate the ability of CARDAMOM to infer a reliable GRN from in silico expression datasets, with good computational speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a method which uses the concept of metastability for performing GRN inference.",

    "abstract": "During development, remodeling of the cellular transcriptome and proteome underlies cell fate decisions and, in somatic lineages, transcription control is a major determinant of fateful biomolecular transitions. By contrast, early germline fate specification in numerous vertebrate and invertebrate species relies extensively on RNA-level regulation, exerted on asymmetrically inherited maternal supplies, with little-to-no zygotic transcription. However delayed, a maternal-to-zygotic transition is nevertheless poised to complete the deployment of pre-gametic programs in the germline. Here, we focused on early germline specification in the tunicate Ciona to study zygotic genome activation. We first demonstrate that a peculiar cellular remodeling event excludes localized postplasmic mRNAs, including Pem-1, which encodes the general inhibitor of transcription. Subsequently, zygotic transcription begins in Pem-1-negative primordial germ cells (PGCs), as revealed by histochemical detection of elongating RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), and nascent transcripts from the Mef2 locus. Using PGC-specific Mef2 transcription as a read-out, we uncovered a provisional antagonism between JAK and MEK/BMPRI/GSK3 signaling, which controls the onset of zygotic gene expression, following cellular remodeling of PGCs. We propose a 2-step model for the onset of zygotic transcription in the Ciona germline, which relies on successive cellular remodeling and JAK inhibition, and discuss the significance of germ plasm dislocation and remodeling in the context of developmental fate specification.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy, defective differentiation, and inactivation of the tumor suppressor TP53 all occur frequently during tumorigenesis. Here, we probe the potential links among these cancer traits by inactivating TP53 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). TP53-/- hESCs exhibit increased proliferation rates, mitotic errors, and low-grade structural aneuploidy; produce poorly differentiated immature teratomas in mice; and fail to differentiate into neural progenitor cells (NPC) in vitro. Genome-wide CRISPR screen reveals requirements of ciliogenesis and sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathways for hESC differentiation into NPCs. TP53 deletion causes abnormal ciliogenesis in neural rosettes. In addition to restraining cell proliferation through CDKN1A, TP53 activates the transcription of BBS9, which encodes a ciliogenesis regulator required for proper Shh signaling and NPC formation. This developmentally regulated transcriptional program of TP53 promotes ciliogenesis, restrains Shh signaling, and commits hESCs to neural lineages.",

    "abstract": "The increasing integration between protein engineering and machine learning has led to many interesting results. A problem still to solve is to evaluate the likelihood that a sequence will fold into a target structure. This problem can be also viewed as sequence prediction from a known structure.\n\nIn the current work, we propose improvements in the recent architecture of Geometric Vector Perceptrons [1] in order to optimize the sampling of sequences from a known backbone structure. The proposed model differs from the original in that there is: (i) no updating in the vectorial embedding, only in the scalar one, (ii) only one layer of decoding. The first aspect improves the accuracy of the model and reduces the use of memory, the second allows for training of the model with several tasks without incurring data leakage.\n\nWe treat the trained classifier as an Energy-Based Model and sample sequences by sampling amino acids in a non-autoreggresive manner in the empty positions of the sequence using energy-guided criteria and followed by random mutation optimization. We improve the median identity of samples from 40.2% to 44.7%.\n\nAn additional question worth investigating is whether sampled and original sequences fold into similar structures independent of their identity. We chose proteins in our test set whose sampled sequences show low identity (under 30%) but for which our model predicted favorable energies. We used AlphaFold [2, 3] and observed that the predicted structures for sampled sequences highly resemble the predicted structures for original sequences, with an average TM-score of 0.84.",

    "abstract": "Determining the forces that shape diversity in host-associated bacterial communities is critical to understanding the evolution and maintenance of metaorganisms. To gain deeper understanding of the role of host genetics in shaping gut microbial traits, we employed a powerful genetic mapping approach using inbred lines derived from the hybrid zone of two incipient house mouse species. Further, we uniquely performed our analysis on microbial traits measured at the gut mucosal interface, which is in more direct contact with host cells and the immune system. A high number of mucosa-associated bacterial taxa have significant heritability estimates; heritabilities are greater for 16S rRNA transcript-compared to gene copy-based traits, and interestingly, are positively correlated with cospeciation rate estimates. Genomewide association mapping identifies 443 loci influencing 123 taxa, with narrow genomic intervals pinpointing promising candidate genes and pathways. Importantly, we identified an enrichment of candidate genes associated with several human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, and functional categories including innate immunity and G-protein-coupled receptors. These results highlight key features of the genetic architecture of mammalian host-microbe interactions and how they diverge as new species form.",

To mechanistically predict behaviour and understand the emergence of self-motion perception in vertebrate brains, it is essential to systematically characterize the motion receptive fields (RFs) of optic flow processing neurons. Here, we present the fine-scale RFs of thousands of motion-sensitive neurons studied in the diencephalon and the midbrain of zebrafish. We found neurons that serve as linear filters and robustly encode directional and speed information of translation-induced optic flow. These neurons are topographically arranged in pretectum according to translation direction. The unambiguous encoding of translation enables the decomposition of translational and rotational self-motion information from mixed optic flow. In behavioural experiments, we successfully demonstrated the predicted decomposition in the optokinetic and optomotor responses. Together, our study reveals the algorithm and the neural implementation for self-motion estimation in a vertebrate visual system.",

    "abstract": "The human ability to introspect on thoughts, perceptions or actions - metacognitive ability - has become a focal topic of both cognitive basic and clinical research. At the same time it has become increasingly clear that currently available quantitative tools are limited in their ability to make unconfounded inferences about metacognition. As a step forward, the present work introduces a comprehensive modeling framework of metacognition that allows for inferences about metacognitive noise and metacognitive biases during the readout of decision values or at the confidence reporting stage. The model assumes that confidence results from a continuous but noisy and potentially biased transformation of decision values, described by a confidence link function. A canonical set of metacognitive noise distributions is introduced which differ, amongst others, in their predictions about metacognitive sign flips of decision values. Successful recovery of model parameters is demonstrated, and the model is validated on an empirical data set. In particular, it is shown that metacognitive noise and bias parameters correlate with conventional behavioral measures. Crucially, in contrast to these conventional measures, metacognitive noise parameters inferred from the model are shown to be independent of performance. This work is accompanied by a toolbox (ReMeta) that allows researchers to estimate key parameters of metacognition in confidence datasets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly metabolic reorganization was only recently recognized as essentially integrated part of immunology. In this context, unbalanced ROS/RNS levels that connected to increased aerobic fermentation, which linked to alpha-tubulin-based cell restructuration and control of cell cycle progression, was identified as major complex trait for early de novo programming ( CoV-MAC-TED) during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This trait was highlighted as critical target for developing early anti-viral/anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies. To obtain this result, analyses had been performed on transcriptome data from diverse experimental cell systems. A call was released for wide data collection of the defined set of genes for transcriptome analyses, named  ReprogVirus, which should be based on strictly standardized protocols and data entry from diverse virus types and variants into the  ReprogVirus Platform. This platform is currently under development. However, so far an in vitro cell system from primary target cells for virus attacks that could ideally serve for standardizing data collection of early SARS-CoV-2 infection responses was not defined.\n\nResultsHere, we demonstrate transcriptome level profiles of the most critical  ReprogVirus gene sets for identifying  CoV-MAC-TED in cultured human nasal epithelial cells. Our results (a) validate  Cov-MAC-TED as crucial trait for early SARS-CoV-2 reprogramming for both tested virus variants and (b) demonstrate its relevance in cultured human nasal epithelial cells.\n\nConclusionIn vitro-cultured human nasal epithelial cells proved to be appropriate for standardized transcriptome data collection in the  ReprogVirus Platform. Thus, this cell system is highly promising to advance integrative data analyses by help of Artificial Intelligence methodologies for designing anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptome studies of a selected gene set (ReprogVirus) had identified unbalanced ROS/RNS levels, which connected to increased aerobic fermentation that linked to alpha-tubulin-based cell restructuration and cell cycle control, as a major complex trait for early de novo programming (CoV-MAC-TED) upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, CoV-MAC-TED was confirmed as promising marker by using primary target human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) infected by two SARS-CoV-2 variants with different effects on disease severity. To further explore this marker/cell system as a standardized tool for identifying anti-viral targets in general, testing of further virus types is required. Results: Transcriptome level profiles of H3N2 influenza-infected NECs indicated ROS/RNS level changes and increased transcript accumulation of genes related to glycolysis, lactic fermentation and -tubulin at 8 hours post infection. These early changes linked to energy-dependent, IRF9-marked rapid immunization. However, ReprogVirus-marker genes indicated the absence of initial cell cycle progress, which contrasted our findings during infections with two SARS-CoV-2 variants, where cell cycle progress was linked to delayed IRF9 response. Our results point to the possibility of CoV-MAC-TED-assisted, rapid individual host cell response identification upon virus infections. Conclusion: The complex trait CoV-MAC-TED can identify similar and differential early responses of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H3N2 viruses. This indicates its appropriateness to search for anti-viral targets in view of therapeutic design strategies. For standardization, human NECs can be used. This marker/cell system is promising to identify differential early cell responses upon viral infections also depending on cell origins.",

    "abstract": "Music exists in almost every society, has universal acoustic features, and is processed by distinct neural circuits in humans even with no experience of musical training. These characteristics suggest an innateness of the sense of music in our brain, but it is unclear how this innateness emerges and what functions it has. Here, using an artificial deep neural network that models the auditory information processing of the brain, we show that units tuned to music can spontaneously emerge by learning natural sound detection, even without learning music. By simulating the responses of network units to 35,487 natural sounds in 527 categories, we found that various subclasses of music are strongly clustered in the embedding space, and that this clustering arises from the music-selective response of the network units. The music-selective units encoded the temporal structure of music in multiple timescales, following the population-level response characteristics observed in the brain. We confirmed that the process of generalization is critical for the emergence of music-selectivity and that music-selectivity can work as a functional basis for the generalization of natural sound, thereby elucidating its origin. These findings suggest that our sense of music can be innate, universally shaped by evolutionary adaptation to process natural sound.\n\nOne-sentence summaryMusic-selectivity can arise spontaneously in deep neural networks trained for natural sound detection without learning music.",

    "abstract": "Cloning genes and operons encoding heterologous functions in bacterial hosts is almost exclusively carried out today using plasmid vectors. This has multiple drawbacks, including the need for constant selection and the variation in copy numbers. Chromosomal integration of transgenes has always offered a viable alternative, however, to date it has been of limited use due to its tedious nature and to being limited often to a single copy. We introduce here a strategy that uses bacterial insertion sequences, the simplest autonomous transposable elements to insert and amplify genetic cargo into a bacterial chromosome. Transgene insertion can take place either as transposition or homologous recombination, and copy-number amplification is achieved using controlled copy-paste transposition. We display successful use of IS1 and IS3 for this purpose in Escherichia coli cells, using various selection markers. We demonstrate the insertion of selectable genes, an unselectable gene, and a five-gene operon in up to two copies in a single step. We continue with the amplification of the inserted cassette to double-digit copy numbers within two rounds of transposase induction and selection. Finally, we analyze the stability of the cloned genetic constructs in the lack of selection and find it to be superior to all investigated plasmid-based systems. Due to the ubiquitous nature of transposable elements, we believe that with proper design, this strategy can be adapted to numerous further bacterial species.",

Structural and dynamic data have shown that S can adopt multiple conformations, which controls the exposure of the ACE2-binding site in the RBD. Here, using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging we report the effects of ACE2 and antibody binding on the conformational dynamics of S from the Wuhan-1 strain and the B.1 variant (D614G). We find that D614G modulates the energetics of the RBD position in a manner similar to ACE2 binding. We also find that antibodies that target diverse epitopes, including those distal to the RBD, stabilize the RBD in a position competent for ACE2 binding. Parallel solution-based binding experiments using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) indicate antibody-mediated enhancement of ACE2 binding.

    "abstract": "Connecting protein sequence to function is becoming increasingly relevant since high-throughput sequencing studies accumulate large amounts of genomic data. In order to go beyond the existing database annotation, it is fundamental to understand the mechanisms underlying functional inheritance and divergence. If the homology relationship between proteins is known, can we determine whether the function diverged?\n\nIn this work, we analyze different possibilities of protein sequence evolution after gene duplication and identify \"residue inversions\", i.e., sites where the relationship between the ancestry and the functional signal is decoupled. Residues in these sites are masked from being recognized by other prediction tools. Still, they play a role in functional divergence and could indicate a shift in protein function. We develop a method to specifically recognize residue inversions in a phylogeny and test it on real and simulated datasets. In a dataset built from the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) sequences found in 88 fish species, we identify 19 positions that went through inversion after gene duplication, mostly located at the ligand-binding extracellular domain.\n\nOur work uncovers a rare event of protein divergence that has direct implications in protein functional annotation and sequence evolution as a whole. The developed method is optimized to work with large protein datasets and can be readily included in a targeted protein analysis pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Recent microbial genome sequencing efforts have revealed a vast reservoir of mobile genetic elements containing integrases that could be useful genome engineering tools. Large serine recombinases (LSRs), such as Bxb1 and PhiC31, are bacteriophage-encoded integrases that can facilitate the insertion of phage DNA into bacterial genomes. However, only a few LSRs have been previously characterized and they have limited efficiency in human cells. Here, we developed a systematic computational discovery workflow that identifies thousands of new LSRs and their cognate DNA attachment sites by. We validate this approach via experimental characterization of LSRs in human cells, leading to three classes of LSRs distinguished from one another by their efficiency and specificity. We identify landing pad LSRs that efficiently integrate into synthetically installed attachment sites orthogonal to the human genome, human genome-targeting LSRs with computationally predictable pseudosites, and multi-targeting LSRs that can unidirectionally integrate cargos at with similar efficiency and superior specificity to commonly used transposases. LSRs from each category were functionally characterized in human cells, overall achieving up to 7-fold higher plasmid recombination than Bxb1 and genome insertion efficiencies of 40-70% with cargo sizes over 7 kb. Overall, we establish a paradigm for large-scale discovery of microbial recombinases and reconstruction of their target sites directly from microbial sequencing data. This strategy provides a rich resource of over 60 experimentally characterized LSRs that can function in human cells and thousands of additional candidates for large-payload genome editing without exposed DNA double-stranded breaks.",

    "abstract": "During development, state transitions are coordinated through changes in the identity of molecular regulators in a cell state- and dose specific manner. The ability to rationally engineer such functions in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) will enable numerous applications in regenerative medicine. Herein we report the generation of synthetic gene circuits that can detect a discrete cell state, and upon state detection, produce fine-tuned effector proteins in a programmable manner. Effectively, these gene circuits convert a discrete (digital-like) cell state into an analog signal by merging AND-like logic integration of endogenous miRNAs (classifiers) with a miRNA-mediated output fine-tuning technology (miSFITs). Using an automated miRNA identification and model-guided circuit optimization approach, we were able to produce robust cell state specific and graded output production in undifferentiated hPSC. We further finely controlled the levels of endogenous BMP4 secretion, which allowed us to document the effect of endogenous factor secretion in comparison to exogenous factor addition on early tissue development using the hPSC-derived gastruloid system. Our work provides the first demonstration of a discrete-to-analog signal conversion circuit operating in living hPSC, and a platform for customized cell state-specific control of desired physiological factors, laying the foundation for programming cell compositions in hPSC-derived tissues and beyond.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467377v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@150da71org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135554borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72b5b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f70f84_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Hearing thresholds are commonly used to quantify a listeners ability to detect sound. In the presence of masking sounds, hearing thresholds can vary depending on the signal properties of the target and the masker, commonly referred to as auditory cues. Target detection can be facilitated with comodulated masking noise and interaural phase disparity (IPD). This can be quantified with a decrease in detection thresholds or masking release: comodulation masking release (CMR, for comodulation) and binaural masking level difference (BMLD, for IPD). As these measures only reflect the low limit of levels for target detection, the relevance of masking release at supra-threshold levels is still unclear. Here, we used psychoacoustic and electrophysiological measures to investigate the effect of masking release for a masked tone at supra-threshold levels. Behaviorally, we investigated how the amount of masking release affects the salience at supra-threshold levels. We used intensity just-noticeable difference (JND) to quantify level-dependent changes in the salience of the tonal signal. As a physiological correlate, we investigated late auditory evoked potentials (LAEPs) with electroencephalography (EEG). The results showed that the intensity JNDs were equal at the same physical target tone level, regardless of the presence or absence of masking release. Estimated salience was correlated with the amount of masking release. However, salience measures across conditions converged with the target tone level above 70 dB SPL. For the LAEPs, the P2 amplitudes were more closely linked to behavioral measures than the N1 amplitudes. Both behavioral and electrophysiological measures suggest that the salience of a masked tone at supra-threshold levels is correlated with the amount of masking release.",

    "abstract": "Diversity studies on moths in Australia are rare, presenting various shortfalls in knowledge that impedes and understanding of their biodiversity values and their conservation. In particular, the Wet Tropics of Australia deserves attention, given the paucity of systematic moth surveys in the region and its World Heritage Area status. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a study to observe moths on 191 nights over a main one-year survey period at an upland rainforest locality, and uploaded all observations on iNaturalist. We also compiled other incidental observations in the general locality by other observers and observations outside the survey period. In total, we document 4,434 observations of moths represented by 1041 distinct moth morphospecies. Of these, 703 are formally named species of moths, 146 to genus and 255 to higher taxonomic designations above genus level. Despite the rather intensive main survey effort, our results suggest that we have yet to reach a plateau in documenting the moth species richness of the locality. Using this study as a model, we show that the iNaturalist platform serves as an effective means to document and digitally curate biodiversity values at a locality, whilst providing complete data transparency and enabling broader community engagement of citizen scientists. We recommend the use of iNaturalist for future moth inventories, and as a resource for follow up meta-analyses of regional moth diversity and distributions.",

    "abstract": "The S209F variant of Abelson Interactor Protein 3 (ABI3) increases risk for Alzheimers disease (AD), but little is known about ABI3 function. RNAscope showed Abi3 is expressed in microglial and non-microglial cells, though its increased expression appears to be driven in plaque-associated microglia. Here, we evaluated Abi3-/- mice and document that both Abi3 and its overlapping gene, Gngt2, are disrupted in these mice. Expression of Abi3 and Gngt2 are tightly correlated, and elevated, in rodent models of AD. RNA-seq of the Abi3-Gngt2-/- mice revealed robust induction of an AD-associated neurodegenerative signature, including upregulation of Trem2, Plcg2 and Tyrobp. In APP mice, loss of Abi3-Gngt2 resulted in a gene dose- and age-dependent reduction in A{beta} deposition. Additionally, in Abi3-Gngt2-/- mice, expression of a pro-aggregant form of human tau exacerbated tauopathy and astrocytosis. Further, the AD-associated S209F mutation alters the extent of ABI3 phosphorylation. These data provide an important experimental framework for understanding the role of Abi3-Gngt2 function in AD. Our studies also demonstrate that manipulation of glial function could have opposing effects on amyloid and tau pathology, highlighting the unpredictability of targeting such pathways in AD.",

This study aims to characterize mitochondrial dysfunctions in a human MAFLD Huh7 cell model triggered by free fatty acid (FFA) (palmitate and oleate) overload for 24 hours. We investigate its impact on cellular energy metabolism and identify potential targets for MAFLD treatment. FFA-treated cells displayed an accumulation of lipid droplets and slightly decreased viability but no significant changes in mitochondrial superoxide levels. Bioenergetic analysis showed a shift to more respiration and less glycolytic fermentation. Comprehensive transcriptomics and proteomics analyses identified changes in the expression of genes prominently involved in fatty acid handling and metabolism. The expressions of seven genes were consistently and significantly (p < 0.05) altered (4 upregulated and 3 downregulated genes) in both proteomics and transcriptomics. The FFA-treated Huh7 cell model is an appropriate in vitro model to study fatty acid metabolism and suitable to investigate the role of mitochondria, glycolysis, and multiple metabolic pathways in MAFLD. Our comprehensive analyses form a basis for drug discovery and screening using this model.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSeveral recently developed single-cell DNA sequencing technologies enable whole-genome sequencing of thousands of cells. However, the ultra-low coverage of the sequenced data (< 0.05x per cell) mostly limits their usage to the identification of copy number alterations in multi-megabase segments. Many tumors are not copy number-driven, and thus single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based subclone detection may contribute to a more comprehensive view on intra-tumor heterogeneity. Due to the low coverage of the data, the identification of SNVs is only possible when superimposing the sequenced genomes of hundreds of genetically similar cells. Thus, we have developed a new approach to efficiently cluster tumor cells based on a Bayesian filtering approach of relevant loci and exploiting read overlap and phasing.\n\nResultsWe developed Single Cell Data Tumor Clusterer (SECEDO, lat.  to separate), a new method to cluster tumor cells based solely on SNVs, inferred on ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data. We applied SECEDO to a synthetic dataset simulating 7,250 cells and eight tumor subclones from a single patient, and were able to accurately reconstruct the clonal composition, detecting 92.11% of the somatic SNVs, with the smallest clusters representing only 6.9% of the total population. When applied to four real single-cell sequencing datasets from a breast cancer patient, each consisting of {approx}2,000 cells, SECEDO was able to recover the major clonal composition in each dataset at the original coverage of 0.03x, achieving an ARI score of {approx}0.6. The current state-of-the-art SNV-based clustering method achieved an ARI score of {approx}0, even after increasing the coverage in silico by a factor of 10, and was only able to match SECEDOs performance when pooling data from all four datasets, in addition to artificially increasing the sequencing coverage by a factor of 7. Variant calling on the resulting clusters recovered more than twice as many SNVs as would have been detected if calling on all cells together. Further, the allelic ratio of the called SNVs on each subcluster was more than double relative to the allelic ratio of the SNVs called without clustering, thus demonstrating that calling variants on subclones, in addition to both increasing sensitivity of SNV detection and attaching SNVs to subclones, significantly increases the confidence of the called variants.\n\nAvailabilitySECEDO is implemented in C++ and is publicly available at https://github.com/ratschlab/secedo.",

    "abstract": "For precision medicine to reach its full potential for treatment of cancer and other diseases, protein variant effect prediction tools are needed that characterize variants of unknown significance (VUS) in a patients genome with respect to their likelihood to influence treatment response and outcomes. However, the performance of most variant prediction tools is limited by the difficulty of acquiring sufficient training and validation data. To overcome these limitations, we applied an iterative active learning approach starting from available biochemical, evolutionary, and functional annotations. The potential of active learning to improve variant interpretation was first demonstrated by applying it to synthetic and deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets for four cancer-relevant proteins. We then probed its utility to guide interpretation and functional validation of tumor VUS in a potential biomarker for cancer therapy sensitivity, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein Xeroderma Pigmentosum Complementation Group A (XPA). A quantitative high-throughput cell-based NER activity assay, fluorescence-based multiplex flow-cytometric host cell reactivation (FM-HCR), was used to validate XPA VUS selected by the active learning strategy. In all cases, selecting VUS for validation by active learning yielded an improvement in performance over traditional learning. These analyses suggest that active learning is well-suited to significantly improve interpretation of VUS and cancer patient genomes.",

The mechanisms underlying context-dependent flexibility in odor valence are not fully understood. Here we show that the behavioral response of C. elegans to bacterially-produced medium-chain alcohols switches from attraction to avoidance when presented in the background of a subset of additional attractive chemicals. This context-dependent reversal of odorant preference is driven by cell-autonomous inversion of the response to alcohols in the single AWC olfactory neuron pair. We find that while medium-chain alcohols inhibit the AWC olfactory neurons to drive attraction, these alcohols instead activate AWC to promote avoidance when presented in the background of a second AWC-sensed odorant. We show that these opposing responses are driven via engagement of different odorant-directed signal transduction pathways within AWC. Our results indicate that context-dependent recruitment of alternative intracellular signaling pathways within a single sensory neuron type conveys opposite hedonic valences, thereby providing a robust mechanism for odorant encoding and discrimination at the periphery.",

    "abstract": "DNA nanostructures are a promising tool for delivery of a variety of molecular payloads to cells. DNA origami structures, where 1000s of bases are folded into a compact nanostructure, present an attractive approach to package genes; however, effective delivery of genetic material into cell nuclei has remained a critical challenge. Here we describe the use of DNA nanostructures encoding an intact human gene and a fluorescent-protein encoding gene as compact templates for gene integration by CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Our design includes CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) binding sites on the DNA nanostructures to increase shuttling of structures into the nucleus. We demonstrate efficient shuttling and genomic integration of DNA nanostructures using transfection and electroporation. These nanostructured templates display lower toxicity and higher insertion efficiency compared to unstructured double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates in human primary cells. Furthermore, our study validates virus-like particles (VLPs) as an efficient method of DNA nanostructure delivery, opening the possibility of delivering DNA nanostructures in vivo to specific cell types. Together these results provide new approaches to gene delivery with DNA nanostructures and establish their use as large HDR templates, exploiting both their design features and their ability to encode genetic information. This work also opens a door to translate other DNA nanodevice functions, such as measuring biophysical properties, into cell nuclei.\n\nTeaser SentenceCRISPR-Cas9 mediates nuclear transport and integration of nanostructured genes in human primary cells",

Their atomic details are critical to the study of their molecular mechanisms but fewer than 5% of hundreds of thousands of human interactions have been structurally characterized. Here, we test the potential and limitations of recent progress in deep-learning methods using AlphaFold2 to predict structures for 65,484 human interactions. We show that higher confidence models are enriched in interactions supported by affinity or structure-based methods and can be orthogonally confirmed by spatial constraints defined by cross-link data. We identify 3,137 high confidence models, of which 1,371 have no homology to a known structure, from which we identify interface residues harbouring disease mutations, suggesting potential mechanisms for pathogenic variants. We find groups of interface phosphorylation sites that show patterns of co-regulation across conditions, suggestive of coordinated tuning of multiple interactions as signalling responses. Finally, we provide examples of how the predicted binary complexes can be used to build larger assemblies. Accurate prediction of protein complexes promises to greatly expand our understanding of the atomic details of human cell biology in health and disease.",

In this study, shotgun metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing were performed on fecal samples collected from 13 COVID-19 patients and controls. We analyzed the structure of gut microbiota, identified the characteristic bacteria and selected biomarkers. Further, GO, KEGG and eggNOG annotation were employed to correlate the taxon alteration and corresponding functions. The gut microbiota of COVID-19 patients was characterized by the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of commensals. The abundance of Bacteroides spp. displayed an inverse relationship to COVID-19 severity, whereas Actinomyces oris, Escherichia coli, and Gemmiger formicilis were positively correlated with disease severity. The genes encoding oxidoreductase were significantly enriched in SARS-CoV-2 infection. KEGG annotation indicated that the expression of ABC transporter was up regulated, while the synthesis pathway of butyrate was aberrantly reduced. Furthermore, increased metabolism of lipopolysaccharide, polyketide sugar, sphingolipids and neutral amino acids was found. These results suggested the gut microbiome of COVID-19 patients was correlated with disease severity and in a state of excessive inflammatory response. Healthy gut microbiota may enhance antiviral defenses via butyrate metabolism, whereas the accumulation of opportunistic and inflammatory bacteria may exacerbate the disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The response by vaccine developers to the COVID-19 pandemic has been extraordinary with effective vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. within one year of the appearance of the first COVID-19 cases. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and obstacles with the global rollout of new vaccines highlight the need for platforms that are amenable to rapid tuning and stable formulation to facilitate the logistics of vaccine delivery worldwide. We developed a \"designer nanoparticle\" platform using phage-like particles (PLPs) derived from bacteriophage lambda for multivalent display of antigens in rigorously defined ratios. Here, we engineered PLPs that display the receptor binding domain (RBD) protein from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, alone (RBDSARS-PLPs, RBDMERS-PLPs) and in combination (hCoV-RBD PLPs). Functionalized particles possess physiochemical properties compatible with pharmaceutical standards and retain antigenicity. Following primary immunization, BALB/c mice immunized with RBDSARS- or RBDMERS-PLPs display serum RBD-specific IgG endpoint and live virus neutralization titers that, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, were comparable to those detected in convalescent plasma from infected patients. Further, these antibody levels remain elevated up to 6 months post-prime. In dose response studies, immunization with as little as one microgram of RBDSARS-PLPs elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses. Finally, animals immunized with RBDSARS-PLPs, RBDMERS-PLPs, and hCoV-RBD PLPs were protected against SARS-CoV-2 and/or MERS-CoV lung infection and disease. Collectively, these data suggest that the designer PLP system provides a platform for facile and rapid generation of single and multi-target vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Body temperature decrease, in mice administered with a drug that selectively inhibits F1F0 ATP hydrolysis (which doesnt inhibit F1F0 ATP synthesis), is evidence that F1F0 ATP hydrolysis is used for metabolic heat generation in vivo. It being pivotal to homeothermy, which is a new discovery. This drug, capable of dose-dependently lowering body temperature, might slow aging and extend lifespan (combating all age-related diseases thereby). Because slightly lower body temperature corresponds with a much longer lifespan in mice and humans. Alzheimers, a disease of aging, can cause a higher body temperature (that accelerates its progression), which this drug might counteract. Across twelve investigated species, less F1F0 ATP hydrolysis correlates with greater maximal lifespan. A case for causality is made. Selective drug inhibition of F1F0 ATP hydrolysis exerts potent anti-cancer activity in vitro. Teaching F1F0 ATP hydrolysis as a new cancer drug target.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDifferent species age at different rates, conferring different maximal lifespans. For example, the maximal lifespan of a mouse is 4 years, while that of a bowhead whale is 211 years. So, aging is modifiable. But how? A clue might be body size: smaller mammal species tend to age faster than larger ones. In geometry, smaller objects have a greater surface-area-to volume ratio than larger objects. Meaning smaller mammal species lose more of their metabolically generated heat. And so, each gram of a smaller mammal species needs to generate more metabolic heat than each gram of a larger mammal species. To keep their body temperature at 37{degrees}C. The chemical reactions that the body uses to obtain energy from food (e.g., to keep the body warm) produce harmful by-products: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). That cause molecular damage. The accumulation of which might be aging. Each gram of a smaller mammal species generates more metabolic heat, uses more food, produces more ROS, and ages faster.\n\nHerein reported is a chemical reaction (F1F0 ATP hydrolysis) that mammal species use to generate heat. Showing that each gram of smaller (shorter-living) mammal species use it more than each gram of larger (longer-living) mammal species. A drug that selectively inhibits it (which doesnt inhibit F1F0 ATP synthesis) is shown to decrease metabolic heat generation in mice. Higher doses decrease it more. The human body (in typical clothing) is most comfortable at an ambient temperature of around 20.3{degrees}C. But much of the world is hotter than that (for at least part of the year). Conceivably, this drug can, by decreasing metabolic heat production (in a dose-dependent manner), increase the ambient temperature that someone is comfortable at, increasing comfort in hot climates/seasons/rooms. If this drug is applied to only part of the body (e.g., in a face cream), heat transfer from the remainder of the body (via blood flow) is expected to maintain this part at 37{degrees}C, no matter the ambient temperature.\n\nIn the literature, lower body temperature extends the lifespan of mice (0.34{degrees}C lower increases lifespan by 20%) and corresponds with a longer human lifespan and healthspan. Moreover, calorie restriction, which slows aging and increases the lifespan of model organisms, reduces body temperature. This drug can (dose-dependently; if the ambient temperature is permissively low) reduce body temperature.\n\nThis drug is predicted to slow aging (whether reducing body temperature or not). Indeed, in mice, its mechanism of action (selectively inhibiting F1F0 ATP hydrolysis) is shown to safely decrease intracellular ROS concentration. This drug is shown to have anticancer activity in vitro. Thence (prospectively) here is an anticancer drug that helps, rather than harms, normal cells.",

The homologous prime-boost vaccination regimen of SAM at 3, 10 and 30 g induced potent neutralizing antibody titers in rhesus macaques following two SAM vaccinations at all dose levels, with the 10 g dose generating geometric mean titers (GMT) 48-fold greater than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human sera.

SAM vaccination provided protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge as both a homologous prime-boost and as a single boost following ChAd prime, demonstrating reduction of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Protection was most effective with a SAM prime-boost vaccination regimen at 10 and 30 g and with a ChAd/SAM heterologous prime-boost regimen.

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a chemical communication process in which bacteria produce, release, and detect extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. Via combined transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, QS allows bacteria to collectively alter gene expression on a population-wide scale. Recently, the TetR-family transcriptional regulator LuxT was shown to control V. harveyi qrr1, encoding the Qrr1 small RNA that functions at the core of the QS regulatory cascade. Here, we use RNA-Sequencing to reveal that, beyond control of qrr1, LuxT is a global regulator of 414 V. harveyi genes including those involved in type III secretion, siderophore production, and aerolysin toxin biosynthesis. Importantly, LuxT directly represses swrZ, encoding a GntR-family transcriptional regulator, and LuxT control of type III secretion, siderophore, and aerolysin genes occurs by two mechanisms, one that is SwrZ-dependent and one that is SwrZ-independent. All of these target genes specify QS-controlled behaviors that are enacted when V. harveyi is at low cell density. Thus, LuxT and SwrZ function in parallel with QS to drive particular low cell density behaviors. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that luxT is highly conserved among Vibrionaceae, but swrZ is less well conserved. In a test case, we find that in Aliivibrio fischeri, LuxT also represses swrZ. SwrZ is a repressor of A. fischeri siderophore production genes. Thus, LuxT repression of swrZ drives activation of A. fischeri siderophore gene expression. Our results indicate that LuxT is a major regulator among Vibrionaceae, and, in the species that also possess swrZ, LuxT functions with SwrZ to control gene expression.\n\nImportanceBacteria precisely tune gene expression patterns to successfully react to changes that occur in the environment. Defining the mechanisms that enable bacteria to thrive in diverse and fluctuating habitats, including in host organisms, is crucial for a deep understanding of the microbial world and also for development of effective applications to promote or to combat particular bacteria. In this study, we show that a regulator called LuxT controls over 400 genes in the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi and, moreover, that LuxT is highly conserved among Vibrionaceae species, ubiquitous marine bacteria that often cause disease. We characterize the mechanisms by which LuxT controls genes involved in virulence and nutrient acquisition. We show that LuxT functions in parallel with a set of regulators of the bacterial cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing to promote V. harveyi behaviors at low cell density.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), triggers enhanced accumulation of lipids to generate foamy macrophages (FMs). This process has been often attributed to the surge in the expression of lipid influx genes with a concomitant decrease in those involved in lipid efflux genes. Here, we define an Mtb-orchestrated modulation of the ubiquitination mechanism of lipid accumulation markers to enhance lipid accretion during infection. We find that Mtb infection represses the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, ITCH, resulting in the sustenance of key lipid accrual molecules viz. ADRP and CD36, that are otherwise targeted by ITCH for proteasomal degradation. In line, overexpressing ITCH in Mtb-infected cells was found to suppress Mtb-induced lipid accumulation. Molecular analyses including loss-of-function and ChIP assays demonstrated a role for the concerted action of the transcription factor YY1 and the arginine methyl transferase PRMT5 in restricting the expression of Itch gene by conferring repressive symmetrical H4R3me2 marks on its promoter. Consequently, siRNA-mediated depletion of YY1 or PRMT5 rescued ITCH expression, thereby compromising the levels of Mtb-induced ADRP and CD36 and limiting FM formation during infection. Accumulation of lipids within the host has been implicated as a pro-mycobacterial process that aids in pathogen persistence and dormancy. In our study, perturbation of PRMT5 enzyme activity resulted in compromised lipid levels and reduced mycobacterial survival in primary murine macrophages (ex vivo) and in a therapeutic mouse model of TB infection (in vivo). These findings provide new insights on the role of PRMT5 and YY1 in augmenting mycobacterial pathogenesis. Thus, we posit that our observations could help design novel adjunct therapies and combinatorial drug regimen for effective anti-TB strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryMycobacterium tuberculosis generates lipid-laden cells (foamy macrophages-FMs) that offer a favorable shelter for its persistence. During infection, we observe a significant reduction in the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, ITCH. This repression allows the sustenance of key lipid accretion molecules (ADRP and CD36), by curbing their proteasomal degradation. Further, we show the repression of ITCH to be dependent on the concerted action of the bifunctional transcription factor, YY1 and the arginine methyl transferase, PRMT5. NOTCH signaling pathway was identified as a master-regulator of YY1 expression. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed the significance of PRMT5 in regulating FM formation and consequently mycobacterial burden.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a prevalent betaherpesvirus that is asymptomatic in healthy individuals but can cause serious disease in immunocompromised patients. HCMV is also the leading cause of viral-mediated birth defects. Many of these defects manifest within the central nervous system and include microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, and cognitive developmental delays. Nitric oxide is a critical effector molecule produced as a component of the innate immune response during infection. Using a 3-dimensional cortical organoid model, we demonstrate that nitric oxide inhibits HCMV spread and simultaneously disrupts neural rosette structures resulting in tissue disorganization. Nitric oxide also attenuates HCMV replication in 2-dimensional cultures of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), a prominent cell type in cortical organoids that differentiate into neurons and glial cells. The multipotency factor SOX2 was decreased during nitric oxide exposure, suggesting early neural differentiation is affected. Maximal mitochondrial respiration was also reduced in both uninfected and infected NPCs. We determined this reduction likely influences neural differentiation as neurons (Tuj1+GFAP-Nestin-) and glial populations (Tuj1-GFAP+Nestin-) were reduced following differentiation. We also observed changes in calcium signaling during exposure to nitric oxide with increased cellular response to ATP (purinergic receptors) and KCl (voltage gated calcium channels). Importantly, nitric oxide could not rescue HCMV-mediated defects in calcium response. Our studies indicate a prominent, immunopathogenic role of nitric oxide in promoting developmental defects within the brain despite its antiviral activity during congenital HCMV infection.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection can result in serious disease to immunocompromised individuals. HCMV is also the leading cause of viral-mediated congenital birth defects. Congenitally-infected infants can have a variety of symptoms, including microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delays. The use of 3-dimensional (3-D) cortical organoids to model infection of the fetal brain has advanced the current understanding of developmental defects and allowed a broader investigation of the mechanisms behind disease. Here, we investigate the effect of nitric oxide, a critical effector molecule, on cortical development and HCMV infection. We demonstrate that nitric oxide plays an antiviral role during infection yet results in significant disorganization to cortical tissue. Despite inhibiting viral replication in neural progenitor cells, nitric oxide contributes to differentiation defects of these cells and does not rescue functional consequences of HCMV infection on calcium signaling. Our results indicate that immunopathogenic consequences of nitric oxide during congenital infection promote developmental defects that undermine its antiviral activity.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with nitrate/nitrite as the terminal electron acceptor may play an important role in mitigating methane emissions from lacustrine environments to the atmosphere. We investigated AOM in the water column of two connected but hydrodynamically contrasting basins of a south-alpine lake in Switzerland (Lake Lugano). The North Basin is permanently stratified with year-round anoxic conditions below 120 m water depth, while the South Basin undergoes seasonal stratification with the development of bottom water anoxia during summer. We show that below the redoxcline of the North Basin a substantial fraction of methane was oxidized coupled to nitrite reduction by Candidatus Methylomirabilis. Incubation experiments with 14CH4 and concentrated biomass from showed at least 43-52%-enhanced AOM rates with added nitrate/nitrite as electron acceptor. Multiannual time series data on the population dynamics of Candidatus Methylomirabilis in the North Basin following an exceptional mixing event in 2005/2006 revealed their requirement for lasting stable low redox-conditions to establish. In the South Basin, on the other hand, we did not find molecular evidence for nitrite-dependent methane oxidizing bacteria. Our data suggest that here the dynamic mixing regime with fluctuating redox conditions is not conducive to the development of a stable population of relatively slow-growing Candidatus Methylomirabilis, despite a hydrochemical framework that seems more favorable for nitrite-dependent AOM than in the North Basin. We predict that the importance of N-dependent AOM in freshwater lakes will likely increase in future because of longer thermal stratification periods and reduced mixing caused by global warming.",

    "abstract": "Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have advanced pest management, but their benefits are diminished when pests evolve resistance. Elucidating the genetic basis of pest resistance to Bt toxins can improve resistance monitoring, resistance management, and design of new insecticides. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in the lepidopteran Helicoverpa zea, one of the most damaging crop pests in the United States. To facilitate this research, we built the first chromosome-level genome assembly for this species, which has 31 chromosomes containing 375 Mb and 15,482 predicted proteins. Using a genome-wide association study, fine-scale mapping, and RNA-seq, we identified a 250-kb quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 13 that was strongly associated with resistance in a strain of H. zea that had been selected for resistance in the field and lab. The mutation in this QTL contributed to but was not sufficient for resistance, which implies alleles in more than one gene contributed to resistance. This QTL contains no genes with a previously reported role in resistance or susceptibility to Bt toxins. However, in resistant insects, this QTL has a premature stop codon in a kinesin gene which is a primary candidate as a mutation contributing to resistance. We found no changes in gene sequence or expression consistently associated with resistance for 11 genes previously implicated in lepidopteran resistance to Cry1Ac. Thus, the results reveal a novel and polygenic basis of resistance.",

    "abstract": "The Kv family of voltage-gated potassium channels regulate neuronal excitability. The biophysical characteristic of Kv channels can be matched to the needs of different neurons by forming homotetrameric or heterotetrameric channels within one of four subfamilies. The cytoplasmic tetramerization (T1) domain plays a major role in dictating the compatibility of different Kv subunits. The only Kv subfamily missing a representative structure of the T1 domain is the Kv2 family. We used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the human Kv2.1 T1 domain. The structure is similar to other T1 domains but surprisingly formed a pentamer instead of a tetramer. In solution the Kv2.1 T1 domain also formed a pentamer as determined with in-line SEC-MALS-SAXS and negative stain EM. The Kv2.1 T1-T1 interface involves electrostatic interactions including a salt bridge formed by the negative charges in a previously described CDD motif, and inter-subunit coordination of zinc. We show that zinc binding is important for stability. In conclusion, the Kv2.1 T1 domain behaves differently from the other Kv T1 domains which may reflect the versatility of Kv2.1, the only Kv subfamily that can assemble with the regulatory KvS subunits and scaffold ER-plasma membrane contacts.",

    "abstract": "Vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases) are rotary enzymes that acidify intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. These multi-subunit complexes consist of a cytoplasmic V1 region that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane-embedded VO region that transports protons. V-ATPase activity is regulated by reversible dissociation of the two regions, with the isolated V1 and VO complexes becoming autoinhibited upon disassembly and subunit C subsequently detaching from V1. In yeast, assembly of the V1 and VO regions is mediated by the RAVE complex through an unknown mechanism. We used cryoEM of yeast V-ATPase to determine structures of the intact enzyme, the dissociated but complete V1 complex, and the V1 complex lacking subunit C. Upon separation, V1 undergoes a dramatic conformational rearrangement, with its rotational state becoming incompatible for reassembly with VO. Loss of subunit C allows V1 to match the rotational state of VO, suggesting how RAVE could reassemble V1 and VO by recruiting subunit C.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in protein-design methodology have led to a dramatic increase in reliability and scale. With these advances, dozens and even thousands of designed proteins are automatically generated and screened. Nevertheless, the success rate, particularly in design of functional proteins, is low and fundamental goals such as reliable de novo design of efficient enzymes remain beyond reach. Experimental analyses have consistently indicated that a major reason for design failure is inaccuracy and misfolding relative to the design model. To address this challenge, we describe complementary methods to diagnose and ameliorate suboptimal regions in designed proteins: first, we develop a Rosetta atomistic computational mutation scanning approach to detect energetically suboptimal positions in designs (available on a web server https://pSUFER.weizmann.ac.il); second, we demonstrate that AlphaFold2 ab initio structure prediction flags regions that may misfold in designed enzymes and binders; and third, we focus FuncLib design calculations on suboptimal positions in a previously designed low-efficiency enzyme improving its catalytic efficiency by 330 fold. Furthermore, applied to a de novo designed protein that exhibited limited stability, the same approach markedly improved stability and expressibility. Thus, foldability analysis and enhancement may dramatically increase the success rate in design of functional proteins.",

This study assessed differences in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary biomarkers between rats receiving VAN and those receiving VAN+TZP. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=26) were randomized to receive 96 hours of intravenous VAN at 150mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal TZP at 1400 mg/kg/day, or VAN+TZP. Kidney function was evaluated using fluorescein-isothiocyanate sinistrin and a transdermal sensor to estimate real-time glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Kidney injury was evaluated via urinary biomarkers including kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), clusterin, and osteopontin. Compared to a saline control, only rats in the VAN group showed significant declines in GFR by day 4 (-0.39 mL/min/100 g body weight, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.10, p=0.008). When the VAN+TZP and VAN alone treatment groups were compared, significantly higher urinary KIM-1 was observed in the VAN alone group on day 1 (18.4 ng, 95% CI: 1.4 to 35.3, p=0.03), day 2 (27.4 ng, 95% CI: 10.4 to 44.3, p=0.002), day 3 (18.8 ng, 95% CI: 1.9 to 35.8, p=0.03), and day 4 (23.2 ng, 95% CI: 6.3 to 40.2, p=0.007).

    "abstract": "To date there are no therapies for patients with congenital myopathies, muscle disorders causing poor quality of life of affected individuals. In approximately 30% of the cases, patients with congenital myopathies carry either dominant or recessive mutations in the RYR1 gene; recessive RYR1 mutations are accompanied by reduction of RyR1 expression and content in skeletal muscles and are associated with fiber hypotrophy and muscle weakness. Importantly, muscles of patients with recessive RYR1 mutations exhibit increased content of class II histone de-acetylases and of DNA genomic methylation. We recently created a mouse model knocked-in for the p.Q1970fsX16+p.A4329D RyR1 mutations, which are isogenic to those carried by a severely affected child suffering from a recessive form of RyR1-related multi-mini core disease. The phenotype of the RyR1 mutant mice recapitulates many aspects of the clinical picture of patients carrying recessive RYR1 mutations. We treated the compound heterozygous mice with a combination of two drugs targeting DNA methylases and class II histone de-acetylases. Here we show that treatment of the mutant mice with drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes improves muscle strength, RyR1 protein content and muscle ultrastructure. This study provides proof of concept for the pharmacological treatment of patients with congenital myopathies linked to recessive RYR1 mutations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn protein sequences--as there are 61 sense codons but only 20 standard amino acids-- most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. Although such synonymous codons do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence, their selection can dramatically affect the expression of the resulting protein. Codon optimization of synthetic DNA sequences is important for heterologous expression. However, existing solutions are primarily based on choosing high-frequency codons only, neglecting the important effects of rare codons. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent-neural-network based codon optimization tool, ICOR, that aims to learn codon usage bias on a genomic dataset of Escherichia coli. We compile a dataset of over 7,000 non-redundant, high-expression, robust genes which are used for deep learning. The model uses a bidirectional long short-term memory-based architecture, allowing for the sequential context of codon usage in genes to be learned. Our tool can predict synonymous codons for synthetic genes toward optimal expression in Escherichia coli.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that sequential context achieved via RNN may yield codon selection that is more similar to the host genome. Based on computational metrics that predict protein expression, ICOR theoretically optimizes protein expression more than frequency-based approaches. ICOR is evaluated on 1,481 Escherichia coli genes as well as a benchmark set of 40 select DNA sequences whose heterologous expression has been previously characterized. ICORs performance is measured across five metrics: the Codon Adaptation Index, GC-content, negative repeat elements, negative cis-regulatory elements, and codon frequency distribution.\n\nConclusionsThe results, based on in silico metrics, indicate that ICOR codon optimization is theoretically more effective in enhancing recombinant expression of proteins over other established codon optimization techniques. Our tool is provided as an open-source software package that includes the benchmark set of sequences used in this study.",

    "abstract": "Functional genetic elements are one of the most essential units for synthetic biology. However, both knowledge-driven and data-driven methodology can hardly accomplish the complicated task of genetic elements design efficiently due to the lack of explicit regulatory logics and training samples. Here, we proposed a knowledge-constraint deep learning model named PccGEO to automatically design functional genetic elements with high success rate and efficiency. PccGEO utilized a novel \"fill-in-the-flank\" strategy with a conditional generative adversarial network structure to optimize the flanking regions of known functional sequences derived from the biological prior knowledge, which can efficiently capture the implicit patterns with a reduced searching space. We applied PccGEO in the design of Escherichia coli promoters, and found that the implicit patterns in flanking regions matter to the properties of promoters such as the expression level. The PccGEO-designed constitutive and inducible promoters showed more than 91.6% chance of success by in vivo validation. We further utilized PccGEO by setting a limited frequency of nucleotide modifications and surprisingly found that the expression level of E. coli sigma 70 promoters could show up to a 159.3-fold increase with only 10-bp nucleotide modifications. The results supported that the implicit patterns are important in the design of functional gene elements and validated the strong capacity of our method in the efficient design of functional genetic elements.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/WangLabTHU/PccGEO",

    "abstract": "Generation of oligodendrocytes in the adult brain enables both adaptive changes in neural circuits and regeneration of myelin sheaths destroyed by injury, disease, and normal aging. This transformation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes requires processing of distinct mRNAs at different stages of cell maturation. Although mislocalization and aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 occur in both neurons and glia in neurodegenerative diseases, the consequences of TDP-43 loss within different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage are not well understood. By performing stage-specific genetic inactivation of Tardbp in vivo, we show that oligodendrocyte lineage cells are differentially sensitive to loss of TDP-43. While OPCs depend on TDP-43 for survival, with conditional deletion resulting in cascading cell loss followed by rapid regeneration to restore their density, oligodendrocytes become less sensitive to TDP-43 depletion as they mature. Deletion of TDP-43 early in the maturation process led to eventual oligodendrocyte degeneration, seizures and premature lethality, while oligodendrocytes that experienced late deletion survived and mice exhibited a normal lifespan. At both stages, TDP-43 deficient oligodendrocytes formed fewer and thinner myelin sheaths and extended new processes that inappropriately wrapped neuronal somata and blood vessels. Transcriptional analysis revealed that in the absence of TDP-43, key proteins involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination were misspliced leading to aberrant incorporation of cryptic exons. Inducible deletion of TDP-43 from oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS induced the same progressive morphological changes and mice acquired profound hindlimb weakness, suggesting that loss of TDP-43 function in oligodendrocytes may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo identify key disease pathways driving conventional dendritic cell (cDC) alterations in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).\n\nMethodsTranscriptomic profiling was performed on peripheral blood CD1c+ cDCs (cDC2s) isolated from 12 healthy donors and 48 SSc patients with all major disease subtypes. Differential expression analysis comparing the different SSc subtypes and healthy donors was performed to uncover genes dysregulated in SSc. To identify biologically relevant pathways, a gene co-expression network was built using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis. We validated the role of key transcriptional regulators using ChIP-sequencing and in vitro functional assays.\n\nResultsWe identified 17 modules of co-expressed genes in cDC2s that correlated with SSc subtypes and key clinical traits including auto-antibodies, skin score, and occurrence of interstitial lung disease. A module of immune regulatory genes was markedly down regulated in patients with the diffuse SSc subtype characterized by severe fibrosis. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis performed on this module predicted NR4A (nuclear receptor 4A) subfamily (NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3) genes as the key transcriptional mediators of inflammation. Indeed, ChIP-sequencing analysis supported that these NR4A members target numerous differentially expressed genes in SSc cDC2s. Inclusion of NR4A receptor agonists in culture-based experiments provided functional proof that dysregulation of NR4As affects cytokine production by cDC2s and modulates downstream T-cell activation.\n\nConclusionsNR4A1, NR4A2 and NR4A3 are important regulators of immunosuppressive and fibrosis-associated pathways in SSc cDC2s.

    "abstract": "Extreme Antarctic conditions provide one of the closest analogues of extraterrestrial environments. Since air and snow samples, especially from polar regions, yield DNA amounts in the lower picogram range, binning of prokaryotic genomes is challenging and renders studying the dispersal of biological entities across these environments difficult. Here, we hypothesized that dispersal of host-associated bacteriophages (adsorbed, replicating or prophages) across the Antarctic continent can be tracked via their genetic signatures aiding our understanding of virus and host dispersal across long distances. Phage genome fragments (PGFs) reconstructed from surface snow metagenomes of three Antarctic stations were assigned to four host genomes, mainly Betaproteobacteria including Ralstonia spp. We reconstructed the complete genome of a temperate phage with near-complete alignment to a prophage in the reference genome of Ralstonia pickettii 12D. PGFs from different stations were related to each other at the genus level and matched similar hosts. Metagenomic read mapping and nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed a wide dispersal of highly identical PGFs, 13 of which were detected in seawater from the Western Antarctic Peninsula in distance of 5538 km to the snow sampling stations. Our results suggest that host-associated phages, especially of Ralstonia sp., disperse over long distances despite harsh conditions of the Antarctic continent. Given that 14 phages associated with two R. pickettii draft genomes isolated from space equipment were identified, we conclude that Ralstonia phages are ideal mobile genetic elements to track dispersal and contamination in ecosystems relevant for Astrobiology.\n\nImportanceHost-associated phages of the bacterium Ralstonia identified in snow samples can be used to track microbial dispersal over thousands of kilometers across the Antarctic continent, which functions as an extraterrestrial analogue because of its harsh environmental conditions. Due to presence of these bacteria carrying genome-integrated prophages on space-related equipment, and the here demonstrated potential for dispersal of host-associated phages, our work has implications for Planetary Protection, a discipline in Astrobiology interested in preventing contamination of celestial bodies with alien biomolecules or forms of life.",

    "abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum, which causes bacterial wilt disease of many crops, needs denitrifying respiration to succeed inside its plant host. In the hypoxic environment of plant xylem vessels this pathogen confronts toxic oxidative radicals like nitric oxide (NO), which is generated by both bacterial denitrification and host defenses. R. solanacearum has multiple distinct mechanisms that could mitigate this stress, including Repair of Iron Cluster (RIC) homolog NorA, nitric oxide reductase NorB, and flavohaemoglobin HmpX. During denitrification and tomato pathogenesis and in response to exogenous NO, R. solanacearum upregulated norA, norB, and hmpX. Single mutants lacking{Delta} norB, {Delta}norA, or{Delta} hmpX increased expression of many iron and sulfur metabolism genes, suggesting that losing even one NO detoxification system demands metabolic compensation. Single mutants suffered only moderate fitness reductions in host plants, possibly because they upregulated their remaining detoxification genes. However,{Delta} norA/norB, {Delta}norB/hmpX, and{Delta} norA/hmpX double mutants grew poorly in denitrifying culture and in planta. Loss of norA, norB, and hmpX may be lethal, since the methods used to construct the double mutants did not generate a triple mutant. Aconitase activity assays showed that NorA, HmpX and especially NorB are important for maintaining iron-sulfur cluster proteins. Additionally, plant defense genes were upregulated in tomatoes infected with the NO-overproducing{Delta} norB mutant, suggesting that bacterial detoxification of NO reduces pathogen visibility. Thus, R. solanacearums three NO detoxification systems each contribute to and are collectively essential for overcoming metabolic oxidative stress during denitrification, for virulence and growth in tomato, and for evading host plant defenses.\n\nImportanceThe soilborne plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) causes bacterial wilt, a serious and widespread threat to global food security. Rs is metabolically adapted to low oxygen conditions, using denitrifying respiration to survive in the host and cause disease. However, bacterial denitrification and host defenses generate nitric oxide (NO), which is toxic and also alters signaling pathways in both plants and the pathogen. Rs mitigates NO with a trio of mechanistically distinct proteins: NO-reductase NorB, Repair of Iron Centers NorA, and oxidoreductase HmpX. This redundancy, together with analysis of mutants and in-planta dual transcriptomes, indicates that maintaining low NO levels is integral to Rs fitness in tomatoes (because NO damages iron-cluster proteins) and to evading host recognition (because bacterially produced NO can trigger plant defenses).",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection with critical impact on disease development and outcome is the marked heterogeneity that exists, spanning differences in lesion types to changes in microenvironment as the infection progresses1-7. A mechanistic understanding of how this heterogeneity affects Mtb growth and treatment efficacy necessitates single bacterium-level studies in the context of intact host tissue architecture; however, such an evaluation has been technically challenging. Here, we exploit fluorescent reporter Mtb strains and the C3HeB/FeJ murine model in an integrated imaging approach to study microenvironment heterogeneity within a single lesion in situ, and analyze how these differences relate to non-uniformity in Mtb replication state, activity, and drug efficacy. We show that the pH and chloride environments differ spatially in a caseous necrotic lesion, with increased acidity and chloride levels in the lesion cuff versus the necrotic core. Conversely, a higher percentage of Mtb in the necrotic core versus the lesion cuff were in an actively replicating state, and correspondingly active in transcription and translation. Finally, examination of three first-line anti-tubercular drugs showed that efficacy of isoniazid was strikingly poor against bacteria in the lesion cuff. Our study reveals spatial relationships of intra-lesion heterogeneity, sheds light on important considerations in the development of anti-tubercular treatment strategies, and establishes a foundational framework for Mtb infection heterogeneity analysis at the single cell level in situ.",

    "abstract": "LINE-1 (L1) are autonomous retroelements that have retained their ability to mobilize. Mechanisms regulating L1 mobility include DNA methylation in somatic cells and the Piwi-interacting RNA pathway in the germline. During pre-implantation stages of mouse embryonic development, however, both pathways are inactivated leading to a critical window necessitating alternate means of L1 regulation. We previously reported an increase in L1 levels in Dicer_KO mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Intriguingly this was accompanied by only a marginal increase in retrotransposition, suggestive of additional mechanisms suppressing L1 mobility. Here, we demonstrate that L1 Ribonucleoprotein complexes (L1 RNP) accumulate as aggregates in Dicer_KO cytoplasm along with the RNA helicase MOV10. The combined overexpression of L1 RNAs and MOV10 is sufficient to create L1 RNP aggregates in stem cells. In Dicer_KO mESCs, MOV10 is upregulated due to the loss of its direct regulation by miRNAs. The newly discovered post-transcriptional regulation of Mov10 expression, and its role in preventing L1 retrotransposition by driving novel cytosolic aggregation affords alternate routes to explore for therapy and disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of deleterious mutations through domestication has fascinated evolutionary biologists and breeders alike. Some domesticated organisms have been reported to accumulate deleterious mutations, i.e. radical amino acid changes, through their domestication history (\"cost of domestication\"). However, more recent evidence paints a more complex picture of this phenomenon in different domesticated organisms. In this study, we used genomic sequences of 253 tomato accessions to investigate the evolution of deleterious mutations and genomic structural variants (SVs) through tomato domestication history. Specifically, we used phylogeny-based methods to identify deleterious mutations in the cultivated tomato as well as its closely related semi-wild and wild populations. We also explored a potential correlation between deleterious mutations and SVs. To create a functional link between deleterious alleles and phenotypes of interest for tomato breeding, we also conducted Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) on several fruit volatiles.\n\nOur results implicate a downward trend, throughout tomato domestication history, in diversity of most alleles, regardless of their functional impact. This suggests that demographic factors, such as bottleneck events and inbreeding, have reduced overall genetic diversity, leading to lower deleterious load and SVs as well as loss of some beneficial alleles during tomato domestication. We also detected an increase in proportions of nonsynonymous and deleterious alleles (relative to synonymous and neutral nonsynonymous alleles, respectively) during the initial stage of tomato domestication in Ecuador, although the final stage of tomato domestication in Mexico did not seem to involve such an increase. However, deleterious alleles in cultivated tomato seem to be more frequent than expected by neutral theory of molecular evolution. Additionally, for all tomato populations, we found a higher proportion of deleterious mutations in genomic regions impacted by SVs.\n\nOur analyses also revealed frequent deleterious alleles in several well-studied tomato genes, probably involved in response to biotic and abiotic stress as well as fruit development and flavor regulation. Also, through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we discovered deleterious alleles associated with two volatiles: isobutyl acetate, which is important for tomato fruit flavor, and methyl salicylate, involved in disease resistance and regulating flowering time. To provide a practical guide for breeding experiments, we created TomDel, a public searchable database of 21,162 deleterious alleles identified in this study (https://github.com/hrazif/TomDel-0.1)",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a central role in metabolic homeostasis; hence, dysfunction of this organelle underpins the etiology of many heritable and aging-related diseases. Mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptides with alternating cationic and aromatic residues, such as SS-31 (Elamipretide), show promise as therapeutic compounds. In this study, we conducted a quantitative structure-activity analysis of three alternative tetrapeptide analogs that differed with respect to aromatic side chain composition and sequence register, benchmarked against SS-31. Using NMR and molecular dynamics approaches, we obtained the first structural models for this class of compounds, showing that all analogs except for SS-31 form compact reverse turn conformations in the membrane-bound state. All peptide analogs bound cardiolipin-containing membranes, yet they had significant differences in equilibrium binding behavior and membrane interactions. Notably, the analogs had markedly different effects on membrane surface charge, supporting a mechanism in which modulation of membrane electrostatics is a key feature of their mechanism of action. All peptide analogs preserved survival and energy metabolism more effectively than SS-31 in cell stress models. Within our peptide set, the analog containing tryptophan side chains, SPN10, had the strongest impact on most membrane properties and showed greatest efficacy in cell culture studies. Taken together, these results show that side chain composition and register strongly influence the activity of these mitochondria-targeted peptides. Furthermore, this work helps provide a framework for the rational design of next-generation therapeutics with enhanced potency.",

    "abstract": "Effector and memory CD8+ T cells accumulate in large numbers in the liver where they play key roles in the control of liver pathogens including Plasmodium. It has also been proposed that liver may act as the main place for elimination of effector CD8+ T cells at the resolution of immune responses. Platelets and the integrin LFA-1 have been proposed to be critical for the accumulation of protective CD8+ T cells in the liver; conversely, asialo-glycoprotein (ASGP) expression on the surface of CD8+ T cells has been proposed to assist in elimination of effector T cells in the liver. Here we investigated the contributions of these interactions in the accumulation of CD8+ T cells activated in vitro or in vivo by immunization with Plasmodium parasites. Using Mpl-/- mice with constitutive thrombocytopaenia and antibody-mediated platelet depletion models we found that severe reduction in platelet concentration in circulation did not strongly influence the accumulation and protective function of CD8+ T cells in the liver in these models. Surprisingly, inhibition of ASGP receptors did not inhibit the accumulation of effector cells in the liver, but instead prevented these cells from accumulating in the spleen. We further found that enforced expression of ASGP on effector CD8+ T cells using ST3GalI knockout cells lead to their loss from the spleen. These data suggest that platelets play a marginal role in CD8+ T cell function in the liver. Furthermore, ASGP-expressing effector CD8+ T cells are retained in the liver but are lost from the spleen.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) were recently shown to inhibit P22 bacteriophage infection. Furthermore, despite there being several published reports now independently describing (1) the marked prevalence of tRFs within secreted vesicle transcriptomes and (2) roles for specific tRFs in facilitating/inhibiting viral replication, there have been no examinations of the effects of vesicle-secreted tRFs on viral infection reported to date. Notably, while specific tRFs have been reported in a number of bacteria, the tRFs expressed by salmonellae have not been previously characterized. As such, we recently screened small RNA-seq datasets for the presence of recurrent, specifically excised tRFs and identified 31 recurrent, relatively abundant tRFs expressed by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (SL1344). Whats more, we find S. Typhimurium OMVs contain significant levels of tRFs highly complementary to known Salmonella enterica-infecting bacteriophage with 17 of 31 tRFs bearing marked complementarity to at least one known Salmonella enterica-infecting phage (averaging 97.4% complementarity over 22.9 nt). Most notably, tRNA-Thr-CGT-1-1, 44-73, bears 100% sequence complementary over its entire 30 nt length to 29 distinct, annotated Salmonella enterica-infecting bacteriophage including P22. Importantly, we find inhibiting this tRF in secreted OMVs improves P22 infectivity in a dose dependent manner whereas raising OMV tRF levels conversely inhibits P22 infectivity. Furthermore, we find P22 phage pre-incubation with OMVs isolated from naive, control SL1344 S. Typhimurium, successfully rescues the ability of S. Typhimurium transformed with a specific tRNA-Thr-CGT-1-1, 44-73 tRF inhibitor to defend against P22. Collectively, these experiments confirm tRFs secreted in S. Typhimurium OMVs are directly involved with and required for the ability of OMVs to defend against bacteriophage predation. As we find the majority of OMV tRFs are highly complementary to an array of known Salmonella enterica-infecting bacteriophage, we suggest OMV tRFs may primarily function as a broadly acting, previously uncharacterized innate antiviral defense.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract. It is known as the \"king of cancer\" in the field of cancer, and is one of the worst prognosis malignant tumors. Pyroptosis is a kind of programmed cell death, which can promote the inflammatory response of cells. Studies have shown that the effect of pyroptosis-related genes in cancer is significant. However, the role of pyroptosis in pancreatic cancer is not clear. The aim of this study is to establish a prognostic model based on pyroptosis. The gene expression and clinical data of pancreatic cancer patients were obtained from TCGA and verified in GEO. The differential expression of 33 pyroptosis-related genes in pancreatic cancer and normal tissues was analyzed, of which 6 genes were up-regulated and 12 genes were down regulated. Then, it was analyzed that pyroptosis-related genes were mainly enriched in the defense against bacteria and pyroptosis pathways. A concise and reliable model is established by lasso-cox regression analysis. Km curve shows that there are differences between high-risk group and low-risk group. And the nomogram has reliable prediction ability. In conclusion, pyroptosis an important role in pancreatic cancer, which can be used for the prediction of pancreatic cancer and provide a new perspective for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nAUTHOR APPROVALSThe authors have seen and approved the manuscript, and that it hasnt been accepted or published elsewhere.\n\nCOMPETING INTERESTSThe authors declare no competing interests.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has affected people worldwide as the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus is related to the highly lethal SARS-CoV responsible for the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Asia. Research is ongoing to understand why both viruses have different spreading capacities and mortality rates. Like other beta coronaviruses, RNA-RNA interactions occur between different parts of the viral genomic RNA, resulting in discontinuous transcription and production of various sub-genomic RNAs. These sub-genomic RNAs are then translated into other viral proteins. In this work, we performed a comparative analysis for novel long-range RNA-RNA interactions that may involve the Spike region. Comparing predictions between reference sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 revealed several predictions amongst which a thermodynamically stable long-range RNA-RNA interaction between (23660-23703 Spike) and (28025-28060 ORF8) unique to SARS-CoV-2 was observed. Using data gathered worldwide, sequence variation patterns observed in the population support the in-silico RNA-RNA base-pairing predictions within these regions, suggesting further evidence for the interaction. The predicted interactions can potentially be related to the regulation of sub-genomic RNA production rates in SARS-CoV-2 and their subsequent accessibility to the host transcriptome.",
