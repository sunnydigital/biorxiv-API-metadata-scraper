    "abstract": "Electric fields (E-fields) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs). Using state-of-the-art finite-element methods (FEM), it often takes tens of seconds to solve the PDEs for computing a high-resolution E-field, hampering the wide application of the E-field modeling in practice and research. To improve the E-field modelings computational efficiency, we developed a self-supervised deep learning (DL) method to compute precise TMS E-fields. Given a head model and the primary E-field generated by TMS coils, a DL model was built to generate a E-field by minimizing a loss function that measures how well the generated E-field fits the governing PDE. The DL model was trained in a self-supervised manner, which does not require any external supervision. We evaluated the DL model using both a simulated sphere head model and realistic head models of 125 individuals and compared the accuracy and computational speed of the DL model with a state-of-the-art FEM. In realistic head models, the DL model obtained accurate E-fields that were significantly correlated with the FEM solutions. The DL model could obtain precise E-fields within seconds for whole head models at a high spatial resolution, faster than the FEM. The DL model built for the simulated sphere head model also obtained an accurate E-field whose average difference from the analytical E-fields was 0.0054, comparable to the FEM solution. These results demonstrated that the self-supervised DL method could obtain precise E-fields comparable to the FEM solutions with improved computational speed.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the reliability of individual differences of four quantities measured by magnetic resonance imaging based multiparameter mapping (MPM): magnetization transfer (MT), proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*). A total of four MPM datasets, two on each of two consecutive days, were acquired in healthy young adults. On Day 1, no repositioning occurred; on Day 2, participants were repositioned between MPM datasets. Using intra-class correlation effect decomposition (ICED), we assessed the contributions of session-specific, day-specific, and residual sources of measurement error. For whole-brain gray and white matter, all four MPM parameters showed high reproducibility and high reliability, as indexed by the coefficient of variation (CoV) and the intra-class correlation (ICC). However, MT, PD, R1, and R2* differed markedly in the extent to which reliability varied across brain regions. MT and PD showed high reliability in almost all regions. In contrast, R1 and R2* showed low reliability in some regions outside the basal ganglia, such that the sum of the measurement error estimates in our structural equation model was higher than estimates of between-person differences. In sum, in this sample of healthy young adults, the four MPM parameters showed very little variability over four measurements over two days but differed in how well they could assess between-person differences. We conclude that R1 and R2* might carry only limited person-specific information in samples of healthy young adults, and, by implication, might be of restricted utility for studying associations to between-person differences in behavior.",

    "abstract": "Age is the main risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In the aged brain, axonal degeneration is an early pathological event, preceding neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive disabilities in humans, primates, rodents, and invertebrates. Necroptosis mediates degeneration of injured axons, but whether necroptosis triggers neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment along aging is unknown. Here we show that the loss of the necroptotic effector Mlkl was sufficient to delay age-associated axonal degeneration and neuroinflammation, protecting against decreased synaptic transmission and memory decline in aged mice. Moreover, short-term pharmacologic inhibition of necroptosis in aged mice reverted structural and functional hippocampal impairment, both at the electrophysiological and behavioral level. Finally, a quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that necroptosis inhibition leads to an overall improvement of the aged hippocampal proteome, including a subclass of molecular biofunctions associated with brain rejuvenation, such as long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity. Our results demonstrate that necroptosis contributes to the age-dependent brain degeneration, disturbing hippocampal neuronal connectivity, and cognitive function. Therefore, necroptosis inhibition constitutes a potential geroprotective strategy to treat age-related disabilities associated with memory impairment and cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrosophila melanogaster Lipophorin Receptors (LpRs), LpR1 and LpR2, mediate lipid uptake. The orthologs of these receptors in vertebrates, ApoER2 and VLDL-R, bind Reelin, a glycoprotein not present in flies. These receptors are associated with the development and function of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, important association areas in the mammalian brain. It is currently unknown whether LpRs play similar roles in the Drosophila brain.\n\nResultsWe report that LpR-deficient flies exhibit impaired olfactory memory and sleep patterns, which seem to reflect anatomical defects found in a critical brain association area, the Mushroom Bodies (MB). Moreover, cultured MB neurons respond to mammalian Reelin by increasing the complexity of their neurites. This effect depends on LpRs and Dab, the Drosophila ortholog of the reelin signaling adaptor protein Dab1. In vitro, two of the long isoforms of LpRs allow the internalization of Reelin.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that LpRs contribute to MB development and function, supporting the existence of LpR-dependent signaling in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memories are not static but can be modified on the basis of new experiences, potentially allowing us to make valid predictions in the face of an ever-changing environment. Recent research has identified prediction errors during retrieval as a possible trigger for such changes. In the present study, we used modified episodic cues to investigate whether different types of mnemonic prediction errors modulate brain activity and subsequent memory performance. Participants encoded different episodes which consisted of short toy stories. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session, participants were then presented videos showing the original episodes, or modified versions thereof. In modified videos, either the order of two subsequent action steps was changed or an object was exchanged for another. Content modifications recruited inferior frontal, parietal, and temporo-occipital areas reflecting the processing of the new object information, while brain responses to structure modifications in right dorsal premotor and inferior frontal areas remained subthreshold. In a post-fMRI memory test, the participants tendency to accept modified episodes as originally encoded increased significantly when they had been presented modified versions already during the fMRI session. Our study provides valuable initial insights into the neural processing of different types of episodic prediction errors and their influence on subsequent memory.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe use of multiple data formats in the MRS community currently hinders data sharing and integration. NIfTI-MRS is proposed as a standard MR spectroscopy data format, which is implemented as an extension to the neuroimaging informatics technology initiative (NIfTI) format.\n\nUsing this standardised format will facilitate data sharing, ease algorithm development, and encourage the integration of MRS analysis with other imaging modalities.\n\nMethodsA file format based on the NIfTI header extension framework was designed to incorporate essential spectroscopic metadata and additional encoding dimensions. A detailed description of the specification is provided. An open-source command-line conversion program is implemented to enable conversion of single-voxel and spectroscopic imaging data to NIfTI-MRS. To provide visualisation of data in NIfTI-MRS, a dedicated plugin is implemented for FSLeyes, the FSL image viewer.\n\nResultsAlongside online documentation, ten example datasets are provided in the proposed format. In addition, minimal examples of NIfTI-MRS readers have been implemented. The conversion software, spec2nii, currently converts fourteen formats to NIfTI-MRS, including DICOM and vendor proprietary formats.\n\nConclusionThe proposed format aims to solve the issue of multiple data formats being used in the MRS community. By providing a single conversion point, it aims to simplify the processing and analysis of MRS data, thereby lowering the barrier to use of MRS. Furthermore, it can serve as the basis for open data sharing, collaboration, and interoperability of analysis programs. It also opens possibility of greater standardisation and harmonisation. By aligning with the dominant format in neuroimaging, NIfTI-MRS enables the use of mature tools present in the imaging community, demonstrated in this work by using a dedicated imaging tool, FSLeyes, as a viewer.",

    "abstract": "It is humankinds unique wisdom to compose a limited number of words together through specific rules to convey endless information. Researchers have found that this composition process also plays a vital role in the comprehension of compounds. The specific manifestation is relation priming; that is, the previously used relation will promote subsequent word processing using the same relation. This priming phenomenon is bound to morpheme repetition (modifier or head). This study combines a self-paced priming paradigm with electrophysiological technology to explore whether relation priming will occur without sharing morphemes and its time course. We found that relation priming can occur independently of morpheme-repetition, which shows an independent representation of relation information. And it has been activated at a very early stage (about 200ms). As the word processing progresses, this activation gradually strengthens, indicating that the relations role is slowly increasing in the process of compound word recognition. It may first be used as a kind of context information to help determine the constituent morphemes meaning. After the meaning access of the constituent morphemes, they begin to play a role in the semantic composition process. This study uses electrophysiological technology to precisely describe the representation of relation and its time course for the first time. Which gives us a deeper understanding of the relation priming process, and at the same time, shed light on the meaning construction process of compounds.",

    "abstract": "Establishing preclinical models of Alzheimers disease that predict clinical outcomes remains a critically important, yet to date not fully realised, goal. Models derived from human cells offer considerable advantages over non-human models, including the potential to reflect some of the inter-individual differences that are apparent in patients. Here we report an approach using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons from people with early symptomatic Alzheimers disease where we sought a match between individual disease characteristics in cells with analogous characteristics in the people from whom they were derived. We show that the response to amyloid-{beta} burden in life, as measured by cognitive decline and brain activity levels, varies between individuals and this vulnerability rating correlates with the individual cellular vulnerability to extrinsic amyloid-{beta} in vitro as measured by synapse loss and function. Our findings indicate that patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons not only present key aspects of Alzheimers disease pathology, but also reflect key aspects of the clinical phenotypes of the same patients. Cellular models that reflect an individuals in-life clinical vulnerability thus represent a tractable method of Alzheimers disease modelling using clinical data in combination with cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "SignificancePhotothrombosis is a widely used model of ischemic stroke in rodent experiments. In the photothromboris model, the photosensitizer Rose Bengal is systemically introduced to the blood stream and activated by green light to induce aggregation of platelets that eventually cause vessel occlusion. Since the activation of Rose Bengal is a one-photon phenomenon and the molecules in the illuminated area (light path) are subject to excitation, targeting of thrombosis is unspecific especially in the depth dimension. We have developed a photothrombosis protocol that can target a single vessel in the cortical parenchyma by two-photon excitation.\n\nAimWe aim to induce a thrombotic stroke in the cortical parenchyma by two-photon activation of Rose Bengal so that we confine photothrombosis within a vessel of a target depth.\n\nApproachFITC-dextran is injected into the blood stream to visualize the cerebral blood flow in anesthetized adult mice with a cranial window. After a target vessel is chosen by two-photon imaging (950 nm), Rose Bengal is injected into the blood stream. The scanning wavelength is changed to 720 nm and photothrombosis was induced by scanning the target vessel.\n\nResultsTwo-photon depth-targeted single vessel photothrombosis was achieved with a success rate of 84.9{+/-}1.7% within 80 s. Attempts without Rose Bengal (i.e., only with FITC) did not result in photothrombosis at the excitation wavelength of 720 nm.\n\nConclusionsWe described a protocol that achieves depth-targeted single vessel photothrombosis by two-photon excitation. Simultaneous imaging of blood flow in the targeted vessel using FITC dextran enabled the confirmation of vessel occlusion and prevention of excess irradiation that possibly induces unintended photodamage.",

    "abstract": "Safety learning generates associative links between neutral stimuli and the absence of threat, promoting the inhibition of fear and security-seeking behaviours. Precisely how safety learning is mediated at the level of underlying brain systems, particularly in humans, remains unclear. Here, we integrated a novel Pavlovian conditioned inhibition task with ultra-high field (UHF) fMRI to examine the neural basis of inhibitory safety learning in 49 healthy participants. In our task, participants were conditioned to two safety signals: a conditioned inhibitor that predicted threat-omission when paired with a known threat signal (A+/AX-), and a standard safety signal that generally predicted threat-omission (BC-). Both safety signals evoked equivalent autonomic and subjective learning responses but diverged strongly in terms of underlying brain activation. The conditioned inhibitor was characterized by more prominent activation of the dorsal striatum, anterior insular and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the standard safety signal, whereas the latter evoked greater activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate and hippocampus, among other regions. Further analyses of the conditioned inhibitor indicated that its initial learning was characterized by consistent engagement of dorsal striatal, midbrain, thalamic, premotor, and prefrontal subregions. These findings suggest that safety learning via conditioned inhibition involves a distributed cortico-striatal circuitry, separable from broader cortical regions involved with processing standard safety signals (e.g., CS-). This cortico-striatal system could represent a novel neural substrate of safety learning, underlying the initial generation of  stimulus-safety associations, distinct from wider cortical correlates of safety processing, which facilitate the behavioral outcomes of learning.\n\nSignificance statementIdentifying safety is critical for maintaining adaptive levels of anxiety, but the neural mechanisms of human safety learning remain unclear. Using ultra-high field fMRI, we compared learning-related brain activity for a conditioned inhibitor, which actively predicted threat-omission, and a standard safety signal (CS-), which was passively unpaired with threat. The inhibitor engaged an extended circuitry primarily featuring the dorsal striatum, along with thalamic, midbrain, and premotor/prefrontal cortex regions. The CS-exclusively involved cortical safety-related regions observed in basic safety conditioning, such as the vmPFC. These findings extend current models to include learning-specific mechanisms for encoding stimulus-safety associations, which might be distinguished from expression-related cortical mechanisms. These insights may suggest novel avenues for targeting dysfunctional safety learning in psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "Covert spatial attention is associated with spatially specific modulation of neural activity as well as with directional biases in fixational eye-movements known as microsaccades. Recently, this link has been suggested to be obligatory, such that modulation of neural activity by covert spatial attention occurs only when paired with microsaccades toward the attended location. Here we revisited this link between microsaccades and neural modulation by covert spatial attention in humans. We investigated spatial modulation of 8-12 Hz EEG alpha activity and microsaccades in a context with no incentive for overt gaze behaviour: when attention is directed internally within the spatial layout of visual working memory. In line with a common attentional origin, we show that spatial modulations of alpha activity and microsaccades co-vary: alpha lateralisation is stronger in trials with microsaccades toward compared to away from the memorised location of the to-be-attended item and occurs earlier in trials with earlier microsaccades toward this item. Critically, however, trials without attention-driven microsaccades nevertheless showed clear spatial modulation of alpha activity - comparable to the neural modulation observed in trials with attention-driven microsaccades. Thus, directional biases in microsaccades are correlated with neural signatures of covert spatial attention, but they are not a prerequisite for neural modulation by covert spatial attention to be manifest.",

We conducted translaminar recordings in mouse auditory cortex (AC) during an audiovisual (AV) attention shifting task. Attending to sound elements in an AV stream reduced both pre-stimulus and stimulus-evoked spiking activity, primarily in deep layer neurons. Despite reduced spiking, stimulus decoder accuracy was preserved, suggesting improved sound encoding efficiency. Similarly, task-irrelevant probe stimuli during intertrial intervals evoked fewer spikes without impairing stimulus encoding, indicating that these attention influences generalized beyond training stimuli. Importantly, these spiking reductions predicted trial-to-trial behavioral accuracy during auditory attention, but not visual attention. Together, these findings suggest auditory attention facilitates sound discrimination by filtering sound-irrelevant spiking in AC, and that the deepest cortical layers may serve as a hub for integrating extramodal contextual information.",

At low pH, protonation of an extracellular histidine results in a cascade of conformational changes that close the channel by sealing the top of the selectivity filter, displacing the helical cap to block extracellular ion access pathways, and opening gaps for lipid block of the intracellular cavity. These data provide a mechanistic understanding for extracellular pH-gating of TWIK1 and show how diverse mechanisms have evolved to gate the selectivity filter of K+ channels.",

    "abstract": "Many age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimers and Parkinsons, are characterised by abundant inclusions of amyloid filaments. Filamentous inclusions of the proteins tau, amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), -synuclein and TDP-43 are the most common. Here, we used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination to show that residues 120-254 of the lysosomal type II transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) also form amyloid filaments in the human brain. We solved cryo-EM structures of TMEM106B filaments from the brains of 22 individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, including sporadic and inherited tauopathies, A{beta}-amyloidoses, synucleinopathies and TDP-43opathies, as well as from the brains of two neurologically normal individuals. We observed three different TMEM106B folds, with no clear relationship between folds and diseases. The presence of TMEM106B filaments correlated with that of a 29 kDa sarkosyl-insoluble fragment of the protein on Western blots. The presence of TMEM106B filaments in the brains of older, but not younger, neurologically normal individuals indicates that they form in an age-dependent manner.",

Indeed, human and macaques have similar hands and homologous neural circuits to mediate manual behavior. However, few studies have systematically and quantitatively compared the manual behaviors of the two species. Such comparison is critical for assessing the validity of using the macaque sensorimotor system as a model of its human counterpart. In this study, we systematically compared the prehensile behaviors of humans and rhesus macaques using an identical experimental setup. We found human and macaque prehension kinematics to be generally similar with a few subtle differences. While the structure of the preshaping postures is similar in humans and macaques, human postures are more object-specific and human joints are less intercorrelated. Conversely, monkeys demonstrate more stereotypical grasping behaviors that are common across all grasp conditions and more variability in their postures across repeated grasps of the same object. Despite these subtle differences in manual behavior between humans and monkeys, our results bolster the use of the macaque model to understand the neural mechanisms of manual dexterity in humans.\n\nNO_SCPLOWEWC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWANDC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWNEWSWORTHYC_SCPLOWMacaques have been a dominant animal model to study the neural mechanisms of human dexterity because they exhibit complex manual behavior.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesFollicular helper T cells (Tfh cells) provide key B cell help, and are essential in germinal center (GC) formation and (auto) antibody generation. To gain more insight into their role during the earliest phase of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) we analyzed their frequencies, phenotype and cytokine profile in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues.\n\nMethodsUsing flow cytometry, we studied the frequency of Tfh and B cells in peripheral blood and lymph node (LN) needle biopsies. Three donor groups were included and compared: healthy controls (HCs), autoantibody positive individuals at risk for developing RA (RA-risk individuals), and early RA patients. Ex vivo stimulation of lymphocytes with PMA/ionomycin was performed to assess cytokine secretion by Tfh cells.\n\nResultsIn blood, the frequency of circular Tfh cells (cTfh) did not differ between study groups. In lymphoid tissue, the frequency of Tfh cells correlated strongly with the frequency of CD19+ B cells. Compared to healthy controls, LN samples of RA patients and RA-risk individuals showed more CD19+ B cells and more CD4+CXCR5+ and CD8+CXCR5+ Tfh cells. These Tfh cells from LNs expressed less IL-21 upon ex vivo stimulation.\n\nConclusionLN tissue of early RA patients as well as part of RA-risk individuals exhibit increased frequencies of Tfh cells correlating with increased numbers of B cells. Interestingly, IL-21 production is already aberrant in the very early at risk phase of the disease. This suggests that Tfh cells may present a novel rationale for therapeutic targeting during the preclinical stage of the disease to prevent further disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of high-throughput microscopy images requires robust automated algorithms. Background estimation is usually the first step and has an impact on all subsequent analysis, in particular for foreground detection and calculation of ratiometric quantities. Most methods recover only a single background value, such as the median. Those that aim to retrieve a background distribution by dividing the intensity histogram yield a biased estimation in images in non-trivial cases. In this work, we present the first method to recover an unbiased estimation of the background distribution directly from an image and without any additional input. Through a robust statistical test, our method leverages the lack of local spatial correlation in background pixels to select a subset of pixels that accurately represent the background distribution. This method is both fast and simple to implement, as it only uses standard mathematical operations and an averaging filter. Additionally, the only parameter, the size of the averaging filter, does not require fine tuning. The obtained background distribution can be used to test for foreground membership of individual pixels, or to estimate confidence intervals in derived quantities. We expect that the concepts described in this work can help to develop a novel family of robust segmentation methods.",

    "abstract": "Given the role of E-cadherin (E-cad) in holding epithelial cells together, the inverse relationship between E-cad levels and cell invasion has been perceived as a principle underlying the invasiveness of tumor cells. In contrast, our study employing the Drosophila model of cell dissemination demonstrates that E-cad is necessary for the invasiveness of Rasv12-transformed cells in vivo. Drosophila E-cad/{beta}-catenin disassembles at adherens junctions and assembles at invasive protrusions--the actin- and cortactin-rich invadopodia-like protrusions associated with breach of the extracellular matrix (ECM)--during cell dissemination. Loss of E-cad attenuates dissemination of Rasv12-transformed cells by impairing their ability to compromise the ECM. Strikingly, the remodeling of E-cad/{beta}-catenin subcellular distribution is controlled by two discrete intracellular calcium signaling pathways: Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum via the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) disassembles E-cad at adherens junctions while Ca2+ entry via the mechanosensitive channel Piezo assembles E-cad at invasive protrusions. Thus, our study provides molecular insights into the unconventional role of E-cad in cell invasion during cell dissemination in vivo and describes the discrete roles of intracellular calcium signaling in the remodeling of E-cad/{beta}-catenin subcellular localization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLoss of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is common in COPD small airways and likely contributes to disease progression. We hypothesized loss of SIgA results from reduced expression of pIgR, a chaperone protein needed for SIgA transcytosis, in the COPD small airway epithelium.\n\nMethodspIgR-expressing cells were defined and quantified at single-cell resolution in human airways using RNA in-situ hybridization, immunostaining, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Complementary studies in mice utilized immunostaining, primary murine tracheal epithelial cell (MTEC) culture, and transgenic mice with secretory or ciliated cell-specific knockout of pIgR. SIgA degradation by human neutrophil elastase or secreted bacterial proteases from non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) was evaluated in vitro.\n\nResultsWe found that secretory cells are the predominant cell type responsible for pIgR expression in human and murine airways. Loss of SIgA in small airways was not associated with a reduction in secretory cells but rather a reduction in pIgR protein expression despite intact PIGR mRNA expression. Neutrophil elastase and NTHi-secreted proteases are both capable of degrading SIgA in vitro and may also contribute to a deficient SIgA immunobarrier in COPD.\n\nInterpretationLoss of the SIgA immunobarrier in small airways of patients severe COPD is complex and likely results from both pIgR-dependent defects in IgA transcytosis and SIgA degradation.\n\nKey MessagesWhat is the key question? Localized SIgA deficiency in small airways is an established driver of COPD pathogenesis, but the mechanism of loss remains unclear. We hypothesized loss of SIgA is due to reduced numbers of pIgR-expressing cells in SIgA-deficient small airways.\n\nWhat is the bottom line? pIgR is primarily expressed by secretory cells in human and murine airways. Although numbers of secretory cells are similar between SIgA-deficient and SIgA-replete airways in COPD, there is reduced expression of pIgR protein, but not mRNA, in SIgA-deficient airways. Additionally, host and bacterial proteases degrade SIgA in vitro, suggesting loss of SIgA may relate to both impaired transcytosis and increased degradation.\n\nWhy read on? This study highlights the complexity of SIgA immunobarrier maintenance and suggests that strategies aimed at restoring the SIgA immunobarrier will need to account for both impaired transcytosis and degradation by host and/or bacterial proteases.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that human trophoblast stem-like cells (hTS-like cells) can be derived from naive embryonic stem cells or be induced from somatic cells by the pluripotency factors, OSKM. This raises two main questions; (i) whether human induced TSCs (hiTSCs) can be generated independently to pluripotent state or factors and (ii) what are the mechanisms by which hTSC state is established during reprogramming. Here, we identify GATA3, OCT4, KLF4 and MYC (GOKM) as a pluripotency-independent combination of factors that can generate stable and functional hiTSCs, from both male and female fibroblasts. By using single and double knockout (KO) fibroblasts for major pluripotency genes (i.e. SOX2 or NANOG/PRDM14) we show that GOKM not only is capable of generating hiTSCs from the KO cells, but rather that the efficiency of the process is increased. Through H3K4me2 and chromatin accessibility profiling we demonstrate that GOKM target different loci and genes than OSKM, and that a significant fraction of them is related to placenta and trophoblast function. Moreover, we show that GOKM exert a greater pioneer activity compared to OSKM. While GOKM target many specific hTSC loci, OSKM mainly target hTSC loci that are shared with hESCs. Finally, we reveal a gene signature of trophoblast-related genes, consisting of 172 genes which are highly expressed in blastocyst-derived TSCs and GOKM-hiTSCs but absent or mildly expressed in OSKM-hiTSCs.\n\nTaken together, these results imply that not only is the pluripotent state, and SOX2 specifically, not required to produce functional hiTSCs, but that pluripotency-specific factors actually interfere with the acquisition of the hTSC state during reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Children of women with pre-eclampsia have increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic disease in adult life. Furthermore, the risk of pregnancy complications is higher in daughters born to women affected by pre-eclampsia than in daughters born after uncomplicated pregnancies. While aberrant inflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications, including pre-eclampsia, the contribution of maternal inflammation to subsequent risk of CV and metabolic disease as well as pregnancy complications in the offspring remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that 24-week-old female rats (F1) born to dams (F0) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during pregnancy (to induce inflammation) exhibited mild systolic dysfunction, increased cardiac growth-related gene expression, abnormal glucose tolerance and coagulopathy; whereas male F1 offspring exhibited abnormal glucose tolerance and increased visceral fat accumulation compared with F1 sex-matched offspring born to saline-treated dams. Both male and female F1 offspring born to LPS-treated dams had evidence of anemia. Fetuses (F2) from F1 females born to LPS-treated dams were growth restricted, and this reduction in fetal growth was associated with increased CD68 positivity and decreased expression of glucose transporter-1 in their utero-placental units. These results indicate that abnormal maternal inflammation can contribute to increased risk of CV and metabolic disease in offspring, and that the effects of inflammation may be transgenerational. This study provides evidence in support of early screening for CV and metabolic disease, as well as pregnancy complications in offspring affected by pre-eclampsia or other pregnancy complications associated with aberrant inflammation.",

We found that in spite of a low overall plasticity in monogenic species compared to D. melanogaster, the two monogenic species showed divergent plasticity patterns in respect to the response to temperature and to the degree of dominance in heterozygotes. Those results provide new insights on the dependence of the degree of plasticity on the genetic architecture as well as on the extent of phenotypic convergence.",

    "abstract": "Microalgae including diatoms are of interest for environmentally-friendly manufacturing such as biofuel production. However, only a very few of their genomes have been elucidated owing to their diversified and complex evolutionary history. The genome of the marine oleaginous diatom Fistulifera solaris, an allopolyploid diatom possessing two subgenomes, has been analyzed previously by pyrosequencing. However, many unsolved regions and unconnected scaffolds remained. Here we report the entire chromosomal structure of the genome of F. solaris strain JPCC DA0580 using a long-read nanopore sequencing platform. From just one single run using a MinION flow-cell, the chromosome scale assembly with telomere-to-telomere resolution was achieved for 41 out of 44 chromosomes. Centromere regions were also predicted from the chromosomes, and we discovered conserved motifs in the predicted regions. The function of the motifs was experimentally confirmed by successful transformation of the diatom via bacterial conjugation. This discovery provides insights into chromosome replication, facilitating the rational design of artificial chromosomes for large-scale metabolic engineering of diatoms. The chromosome scale assembly also suggests the potential existence of multi-copy mini-chromosomes and tandemly repeated lipogenesis genes related to the oleaginous phenotype of F. solaris. The nanopore sequencing also solved the sequential arrangement of the repeat region in the F. solaris mitochondrial genome. Findings of this study will be useful to understand and further engineer the oleaginous phenotype of F. solaris.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPangenome graphs provide a complete representation of the mutual alignment of collections of genomes. These models offer the opportunity to study the entire genomic diversity of a population, including structurally complex regions. Nevertheless, analyzing hundreds of gigabase-scale genomes using pangenome graphs is difficult as it is not well-supported by existing tools. Hence, fast and versatile software is required to ask advanced questions to such data in an efficient way.\n\nResultsWe wrote ODGI, a novel suite of tools that implements scalable algorithms and has an efficient in-memory representation of DNA pangenome graphs in the form of variation graphs. ODGI supports pre-built graphs in the Graphical Fragment Assembly format. ODGI includes tools for detecting complex regions, extracting pangenomic loci, removing artifacts, exploratory analysis, manipulation, validation, and visualization. Its fast parallel execution facilitates routine pangenomic tasks, as well as pipelines that can quickly answer complex biological questions of gigabase-scale pangenome graphs.\n\nAvailabilityODGI is published as free software under the MIT open source license.

    "abstract": "Phenotype prediction is a necessity in numerous applications in genetics. However, when the size of the individual-level data of the cohort of interest is small, statistical learning algorithms, from linear regression to neural networks, usually fail due to insufficient data. Fortunately, summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on other large cohorts are often publicly available. In this work, we propose a new regularization method, namely, main effect prior (MEP), for making use of GWAS summary statistics from external datasets. The main effect prior is generally applicable for machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and linear regression. With simulation and real-world experiments, we show empirically that MEP improves the prediction performance on both homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets. Moreover, deep neural networks with MEP outperform standard baselines even when the training set is small.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein design has become increasingly important for medical and biotechnological applications. Because of the complex mechanisms underlying protein formation, the creation of a novel protein requires tedious and time-consuming computational or experimental protocols. At the same time, machine learning has enabled the solving of complex problems by leveraging large amounts of available data, more recently with great improvements on the domain of generative modeling. Yet, generative models have mainly been applied to specific sub-problems of protein design.\n\nResultsHere we approach the problem of general purpose protein design conditioned on functional labels of the hierarchical Gene Ontology. Since a canonical way to evaluate generative models in this domain is missing, we devise an evaluation scheme of several biologically and statistically inspired metrics. We then develop the conditional generative adversarial network ProteoGAN and show that it outperforms several classic and more recent deep learning baselines for protein sequence generation. We further give insights into the model by analysing hyperparameters and ablation baselines. Lastly, we hypothesize that a functionally conditional model could generate proteins with novel functions by combining labels and provide first steps into this direction of research.\n\nAvailabilityCode and data is available at https://github.com/timkucera/proteogan\n\nContacttim.kucera@bsse.ethz.ch, mt@visium.ch, lpapaxanthos@google.com",

    "abstract": "NGLY1 deficiency, a rare disease with no effective treatment, is caused by autosomal recessive, loss-of-function mutations in the N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) gene and is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, alacrima, and seizures. We used an adult Drosophila model of NGLY1 deficiency to conduct an in vivo, unbiased, small molecule, repurposing screen of FDA-approved drugs to identify therapeutic compounds. Seventeen molecules rescued lethality in a patient-specific NGLY1 deficiency model, including multiple serotonin and dopamine modulators. Exclusive dNGLY1 expression in serotonin and dopamine neurons, in an otherwise dNGLY1-null fly, was sufficient to rescue lethality. Further, genetic modifier and transcriptomic data supports the importance of serotonin signaling in NGLY1 deficiency. Connectivity Map analysis identified glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibition as a potential therapeutic mechanism for NGLY1 deficiency, which we experimentally validated with TWS119 and lithium. Strikingly, GSK3 inhibitors and a serotonin modulator rescued size defects in dNGLY1 deficient larvae upon proteasome inhibition, suggesting that these compounds act through NRF1, a transcription factor that regulates proteasome expression. This study reveals the importance of the serotonin pathway in NGLY1 deficiency, and serotonin modulators or GSK3 inhibitors may be effective therapeutics for this rare disease.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that up to one billion cardiomyocytes (CMs) can be lost during myocardial infarction (MI), which results in contractile dysfunction, adverse ventricular remodeling, and systolic heart failure. Pharmacologic strategies that target factors having both pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative functions in CMs may be useful for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. One such multifunctional candidate for drug targeting is the acetyltransferase Tip60, which is a member of the MYST family of acetyltransferases known to acetylate both histone and non-histone protein targets that have been shown in cultured cancer cells to promote apoptosis and to initiate the DNA damage response (DDR) thereby limiting cellular expansion. Using a murine model, we recently published findings demonstrating that CM-specific disruption of the Kat5 gene encoding Tip60 markedly protected against the damaging effects of MI. In the experiments described here, in lieu of genetic targeting, we administered TH1834, an experimental drug designed to specifically inhibit the acetyltransferase domain of Tip60. We report that, similar to the effect of disrupting the Kat5 gene, daily systemic administration of TH1834 beginning 3 days after induction of MI and continuing for two weeks of a 4-week timeline resulted in improved systolic function assessed by echocardiography, reduced apoptosis and scarring, and increased activation of the CM cell-cycle. Our results support that idea that drugs that inhibit the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 may be useful agents for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.",

    "abstract": "While biodiversity decline continues and laypeoples knowledge about species is limited, especially in children, high-quality communication is needed to raise awareness. For this, communicators should be aware of current knowledge levels in their target groups. We compared biodiversity communicators' estimates of the average species literacy level in primary school children with the actual level. Moreover, we explored the importance that communicators placed on species literacy and the level that they desired. Estimations of childrens average knowledge level varied widely and differed from the actual level. In particular, communicators overestimated the species literacy level. Although most biodiversity communicators agreed that knowledge about species is important, their view differed as to why species literacy would be important. Moreover, communicators differed with respect to the relative importance attached to different knowledge components. Professionals may thus benefit from a detailed framework of species literacy that illustrates different aspects and values. Most importantly, our findings suggest that to bridge the gap between actual and desired knowledge levels in children effectively, biodiversity communicators first need to become more aware of current perceptions in young audiences.",

Currently, it is not well understood how the composition of the cell wall affects its mechanical properties. Using Arabidopsis mutants, we have investigated these interactions by combining experimental and simulation techniques to determine instantaneous and time-dependent mechanical parameters. This allowed, for the first time, the quantification of the effects of cell wall biochemistry on turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity and to predict their effects on growth rate.

    "abstract": "The hypoxia inducible factor (Hif) pathway is functionally conserved across metazoans in modulating cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, the functions of this pathway under aerobic physiological conditions are rarely investigated. Here, we show that Hif-12, a locust Hif-1 isoform, does not induce canonical hypoxic responses but functions as a specific regulator of locust flight, which is a completely aerobic physiological process. Two Hif-1 splice variants were identified in locusts, a ubiquitously expressed Hif-11 and a muscle-predominantly expressed Hif-12. Hif-11 that induces typical hypoxic responses upon hypoxia exposure, remains inactive during flight. By contrast, the expression of Hif-12, which lacks C-terminal transactivation domain, is less sensitive to oxygen-tension but induced extensively by flying. Hif-12 sustains flight endurance by promoting glucose oxidation while simultaneously maintaining redox homeostasis by upregulating the production of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) quencher, DJ-1. Overall, this study reveals a novel Hif-mediated mechanism underlying prolonged aerobic physiological activity.",

Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus [STN] exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal [STN-Globus Pallidus externus (GPe)] network, and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN \"conflict detector\" units, due to an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with schizophrenia reveal changes in information processing associated with external stimuli, which is reflected in the measurements of brain evoked potentials. We discuss actual knowledge on electro- (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) changes in schizophrenia.\n\nNew methodThe commonly used averaging technique entails the loss of information regarding the generation of evoked responses. We propose a methodology to describe single-trial (non-averaged) visual evoked potentials (VEP) using spectral and statistical analyses. We analysed EEG data registered in the O1-Cz and O2-Cz leads during unattended pattern-reversal stimulation, collected from a group of adult patients with chronic schizophrenia, and compared them to those of healthy individuals. Short-time single-trial VEP were transformed to the frequency domain using the FFT algorithm. Changes of the spectral power were visualized using spectrograms which were created by stacking single-trial spectra across all trials. Measures of the absolute and the relative spectral power were calculated and compared statistically.\n\nResultsIn schizophrenia, the energy density of VEP oscillations is shifted towards higher (gamma) frequencies, compared to healthy individuals. These differences are statistically significant in all analysed frequency bands for the relative power. This indicates distorted early processing of visual stimuli in schizophrenia.\n\nComparison with existing methodsThe main advantage of the presented methodology is its simplicity and ease of interpretation of obtained results. The presented observations complement the knowledge on gamma oscillations acquired from computationally more complex methods of time-frequency analysis.\n\nConclusionsHigh-frequency changes for single-trial VEPs are detected in chronic schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian hearing involves the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) of sound-induced fluid waves in the cochlea. Essential to this process are the specialised sensory cochlear cells, the inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). While genetic hearing loss is highly heterogeneous, understanding the requirement of each gene will lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of hearing and also to therapeutic opportunities for deafness. The Neuroplastin (Nptn) gene, which encodes two protein isoforms Np55 and Np65, is required for hearing, and homozygous loss-of-function mutations that affect both isoforms lead to profound deafness in mice. Here we have utilised several distinct mouse models to elaborate upon the spatial, temporal, and functional requirement of Nptn for hearing. While we demonstrate that both Np55 and Np65 are present in cochlear cells, characterisation of a Np65-specific mouse knockout shows normal hearing thresholds indicating that Np65 is functionally redundant for hearing. In contrast, we find that Nptn-knockout mice have significantly reduced maximal MET currents and MET channel open probabilities in mature OHCs, with both OHCs and IHCs also failing to develop fully mature basolateral currents. Furthermore, comparing the hearing thresholds and IHC synapse structure of Nptn-knockout mice with those of mice that lack Nptn only in IHCs and OHCs shows that the majority of the auditory deficit is explained by hair cell dysfunction, with abnormal afferent synapses contributing only a small proportion of the hearing loss. Finally, we show that continued expression of NEUROPLASTIN in OHCs of adult mice is required for membrane localisation of Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase 2 (PMCA2), which is essential for hearing function. Moreover, Nptn haploinsufficiency phenocopies Atp2b2 (encodes PMCA2) mutations, with heterozygous Nptn-knockout mice exhibiting hearing loss through genetic interaction with the Cdh23ahl allele. Together, our findings provide further insight to the functional requirement of Neuroplastin for mammalian hearing.\n\nAuthor SummarySensorineural hearing loss, caused by problems with sensory cells in the cochlea or the auditory nerve, is the most common type of hearing loss. Mutations in Neuroplastin have already been implicated in deafness in mice. We have used mutant mouse models to investigate where Neuroplastin is expressed in the cochlea and its function. When mice do not express a functioning copy of Neuroplastin they have disruptions to the primary sensory synapse. We show that although synaptic disruption contributes to the loss of hearing function it is not the primary cause. Instead, continued expression of Neuroplastin is needed to maintain the localisation of Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase 2 channels which help regulate calcium flow. We have also shown that two types of NEUROPLASTIN protein (isoforms) are both expressed within the cochlea, although only one of these isoforms needs to be expressed for normal hearing. Finally, we also demonstrate that the hearing loss caused by the absence of Neuroplastin is made worse when combined with a common mutation within a gene called Cadherin 23 (Cdh23ahl). This is an important finding as although there are currently no human patients with an identified NEUROPLASTIN mutation, it may be involved in human deafness in combination with other mutations.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has found that the frontal lobe is involved in higher-order sequential and statistical learning in young infants. Separate lines of work have found evidence of modulation of posterior sensory cortices during and after learning tasks. How do these processes relate? Here, we build evidence the infant frontal lobe was modulated during sequential learning and ask whether posterior perceptual cortices show corresponding modulation. First, replicating and extending past work, we found evidence of frontal lobe involvement in this task. Second, consistent with our hypotheses, we found that there is a corresponding attenuation of neural responses in the posterior perceptual cortices (temporal and occipital) to predictable compared to unpredictable audiovisual sequences. This study provides convergent evidence that the frontal lobe is crucial for higher-level learning in young infants but that it likely works as part of a large, distributed network of regions to modulate infant neural responses during learning. Overall, this work challenges the view that the infant brain is not dynamic and disconnected, lacking in long-range neural connections. Instead, this paper reveals patterns of a highly dynamic and interconnected infant brain that change rapidly as a result of new, learnable experiences.",

    "abstract": "Neural-mass modeling of neural population data (EEG, ECoG, or LFPs) has shown promise both in elucidating the neural processes underlying cortical rhythms and changes in brain state, as well as offering a framework for testing the interplay between these rhythms and information processing. Models of cortical alpha rhythms (8 - 12 Hz) and their impact in visual sensory processing have been at the forefront of this effort, with the Jansen-Rit being one of the more popular models in this domain. The Jansen-Rit model, however, fails in reproducing key physiological observations including the level of inputs that cortical neurons receive and their responses to visual transients. To address these issues we generated a neural mass model that complies better with synaptic mediated dynamics, intrinsic alpha behavior, and produces realistic responses. The model is robust to many changes in parameter values but critically depends on the ratio of excitation to inhibition, producing response transients whose features are dependent on this ratio and alpha phase and power. The model is sufficiently flexible so as to be able to easily replicate the range of low frequency oscillations observed in different studies. Consistent with experimental observations, we find phase-dependent response dynamics to both visual and electrical stimulation using this model. The model suggests that stimulation facilitates alpha at particular phases and suppresses it in others due to a phase dependent lag in inhibitory responses. Hence, the model generates insight into the physiological parameters responsible for intrinsic oscillations and testable hypotheses regarding the interactions between visual and electrical stimulation on those oscillations.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile there is increasing evidence of the fundamental role brain states play in shaping information processing in the cerebral cortex, a mechanistic understanding of how those brain states are manifested and alter the signals underlying sensory processing and decision making has proved challenging. To address this issue we have modeled a well established signature of inattention in visual cortex: synchronized low frequency (8 - 12 Hz) oscillations. To allow for inferences regarding the local generation of these rhythms within a cortical microcircuit we used a neural mass model approach that incorporates physiologically realistic interactions between 3 populations of neurons. Our model is able to explain a variety of experimental observations that previous neural mass models have not, including spontaneous rhythms in the absence of input, the faithful transmission of strong input transients, a range of oscillation frequencies, and phase dependent visual responses. The model is robust to a range of parameters, but critically depends on the balance between local excitation and inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Food intake behavior is regulated by a network of appetite-inducing and appetite-suppressing neuronal populations throughout the brain. The parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a relatively unexplored population of neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, has been hypothesized to regulate appetite due to its connectivity with other anorexigenic neuronal populations and because these neurons express Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, following a meal. However, the individual cell types that make up the PSTN are not well characterized, nor are their functional roles in food intake behavior. Here we identify and distinguish between two discrete PSTN subpopulations, those that express tachykinin-1 (PSTNTac1 neurons) and those that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PSTNCRH neurons), and use a panel of genetically encoded tools in mice to show that PSTNTac1 neurons play an essential role in appetite suppression. Both subpopulations increase activity following a meal and in response to administration of the anorexigenic hormones amylin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTNTac1, but not PSTNCRH neurons, reduces the appetite-suppressing effects of these hormones. Consistently, optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of PSTNTac1 neurons, but not PSTNCRH neurons, is sufficient to reduce food intake in hungry mice. PSTNTac1 and PSTNCRH neurons project to distinct downstream brain regions, and stimulation of PSTNTac1 projections to individual anorexigenic populations reduces food consumption. Taken together, these results reveal the functional properties and projection patterns of distinct PSTN cell types and demonstrate an essential, anorexigenic role for PSTNTac1 neurons in the hormonal and central regulation of appetite.",

    "abstract": "Infancy represents a critical period during which thalamocortical brain connections develop and mature. Deviations in the maturation of thalamocortical connectivity are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. There is a lack of early biomarkers to detect and localize neuromaturational deviations, which can be overcome with mapping through high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) assessed in sleep. Specifically, slow waves and spindles in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are generated by the thalamocortical system, and their characteristics, slow wave slope and spindle density, are closely related to neuroplasticity and learning. Recent studies further suggest that information processing during sleep underlying sleep-dependent learning is promoted by the temporal coupling of slow waves and spindles, yet slow wave-spindle coupling remains unexplored in infancy. Thus, we evaluated three potential biomarkers: 1) slow wave slope, 2) spindle density, and 3) the temporal coupling of slow waves with spindles. We use hdEEG to first examine the occurrence and spatial distribution of these three EEG features in healthy infants and second to evaluate a predictive relationship with later behavioral outcomes. We report four key findings: First, infants EEG features appear locally: slow wave slope is maximal in occipital and frontal areas, whereas spindle density is most pronounced frontocentrally. Second, slow waves and spindles are temporally coupled in infancy, with maximal coupling strength in the occipital areas of the brain. Third, slow wave slope, spindle density, and slow wave-spindle coupling are not associated with concurrent behavioral status (6 months). Fourth, spindle density in central and frontocentral regions at age 6 months predicts later behavioral outcomes at 12 and 24 months. Neither slow wave slope nor slow wave-spindle coupling predict behavioral development. Our results propose spindle density as an early EEG biomarker for identifying thalamocortical maturation, which can potentially be used for early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders in infants. These findings are complemented by our companion paper that demonstrates the linkage of spindle density to infant nighttime movement, framing the possible role of spindles in sensorimotor microcircuitry development. Together, our studies suggest that early sleep habits, thalamocortical maturation, and behavioral outcome are closely interwoven. A crucial next step will be to evaluate whether early therapeutic interventions may be effective to reverse deviations in identified individuals at risk.\n\nHighlightsO_LISlow waves and spindles occur in a temporally coupled manner in infancy\nC_LIO_LISlow wave slope, spindle density, and slow wave-spindle coupling are not related to concurrent behavioral development\nC_LIO_LISpindle density at 6 months predicts behavioral status at 12 and 24 months\nC_LIO_LISlow wave slope and slow wave-spindle coupling are not predictive of behavioral development\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Memory CD8+ T cells are characterized by their ability to persist long after the initial antigen encounter and their ability to generate a rapid recall response. Recent studies have identified a role for metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial function in promoting the longevity of memory T cells. However, detailed mechanisms involved in promoting the rapid recall response are incompletely understood. Here we identify a novel role for the initial and continued activation of the trifunctional rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) as critical in promoting the rapid recall response of previously-activated CD8+ T cells. CAD is rapidly phosphorylated upon T cell activation in an mTORC1-dependent manner yet remains phosphorylated long after initial activation. Previously-activated CD8+ T cells display continued de novo pyrimidine synthesis in the absence of mitogenic signals and interfering with this pathway diminishes the speed and magnitude of cytokine production upon rechallenge. Inhibition of CAD does not affect cytokine transcript levels, but diminishes available pre-rRNA, the polycistronic rRNA precursor whose synthesis is the rate-limiting step in ribosomal biogenesis. CAD inhibition additionally decreases levels of detectable ribosomal proteins in previously-activated CD8+ T cells. Overexpression of CAD improves both the cytokine response and proliferation of memory T cells. Overall, our studies reveal a novel and critical role for CAD-induced pyrimidine synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis in promoting the rapid recall response characteristic of memory T cells.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPyrimidine synthesis fuels ribosomal biogenesis to facilitate rapid recall responses in CD8+ T cells",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are signaling organelles essential for development and homeostasis. Loss of primary cilia is lethal, and decreased or defective cilia cause multisystemic conditions called ciliopathies. Down syndrome shares clinical overlap with ciliopathies. We previously showed that trisomy 21 diminishes primary cilia formation and function due to elevated Pericentrin, a centrosome protein encoded on chromosome 21. Pericentrin is mislocalized, creating aggregates that disrupt pericentrosomal trafficking and microtubule organization. Here, we examine the cilia-related molecules and pathways disrupted in trisomy 21 and their in vivo phenotypic relevance. Utilizing ciliogenesis time course experiments, we reveal how Pericentrin, microtubule networks, and components of ciliary vesicles are reorganized for ciliogenesis in euploid cells. Early in ciliogenesis, chromosome 21 polyploidy results in elevated Pericentrin and microtubule networks away from the centrosome that ensnare MyosinVA and EHD1, blocking mother centriole uncapping that is essential for ciliogenesis. Ciliated trisomy 21 cells have persistent trafficking defects that reduce transition zone protein localization, which is critical for Sonic hedgehog signaling. Sonic hedgehog signaling is decreased and anticorrelates with Pericentrin levels in trisomy 21 primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Finally, we observe decreased ciliation in vivo. A mouse model of Down syndrome with elevated Pericentrin has fewer primary cilia in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors and thinner external granular layers. Our work reveals that elevated Pericentrin in trisomy 21 disrupts multiple early steps of ciliogenesis and creates persistent trafficking defects in ciliated cells. This pericentrosomal crowding results in signaling defects consistent with the neurological deficits found in individuals with Down syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Hedgehog (Hh) secretion from apical and/or basolateral domains occurs in different epithelial cells impacting development and tissue homeostasis. Palmitoylation and cholestyrolation attach Hh proteins to membranes and Dispatched-1 (Disp-1) promotes their release. How these lipidated proteins are handled by the complex secretory and endocytic pathways of polarized epithelial cells remains unknown. We show that MDCK cells address newly synthesized sonic hedgehog (Shh) from the TGN to the basolateral cell surface and then to the apical domain through a transcytosis pathway that includes Rab11-apical recycling endosomes (Rab11-ARE). Both palmitoylation and cholestyrolation contribute to this sorting behavior, otherwise Shh lacking these lipid modifications is unpolarized. Disp-1 mediates first basolateral secretion from the TGN and then transcytosis from the Rab11-ARE. At steady state, Shh predominates apically and can be basolaterally transcytosed. This complex Shh trafficking provides several steps for regulation and variation in different epithelia, subordinating the apical to the basolateral secretion.",

    "abstract": "Female sex is increasingly associated to a loss of bone mass during aging and an increased risk for fractures developing nonunion. Hormonal factors and cell-intrinsic mechanisms are suggested to drive these sexual dimorphisms, although underlying molecular mechanisms are still a matter of debate. Here, we observed a decreased capacity of calvarial bone recovery in female rats and a profound sexually dimorphic osteogenic differentiation human adult neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs). Next to an elevated expression of pro-osteogenic regulators, global trancriptomics revealed Lysine Demethylase 5D (KDM5D) to be highly upregulated in differentiating male NCSCs. Loss of function by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of KDM5D significantly reduced the osteogenic differentiation capacity of male NCSCs. In summary, we demonstrate craniofacial osteogenic differentiation to be sexually dimorphic with the expression of KDM5D as a prerequisite for accelerated male osteogenic differentiation, emphasizing the analysis of sex-specific differences as a crucial parameter for treating bone defects.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the first three lineages during development are orchestrated by a network of transcription factors, which are best characterized in mice. However, the role and regulation of these factors are not completely conserved in other mammals, including human and cattle. Here, we establish a gene inactivation system by introducing premature codon with cytosine base editor in bovine embryos with a robust efficiency. Of interest, SOX2 is universally localized in early blastocysts but gradually restricted into the inner cell mass in cattle. SOX2 knockout results in a failure of the establishment of pluripotency. Indeed, OCT4 level is significantly reduced and NANOG was barely detectable. Furthermore, the formation of primitive endoderm is compromised with few SOX17 positive cells. Single embryo RNA-seq reveals a dysregulation of 2074 genes, among which 90% are up-regulated in SOX2-null blastocysts. Intriguingly, more than a dozen lineage-specific genes, including OCT4 and NANOG, are down-regulated. Moreover, SOX2 expression is sustained in the trophectoderm in absence of CDX2 in bovine late blastocysts. Overall, we propose that SOX2 is dispensable for OCT4 and NANOG expression and disappearance of SOX2 in the trophectoderm depends on CDX2 in cattle, which are all in sharp contrast with results in mice.\n\nSignificanceThe first and second cell fate decisions of a new life are important for subsequent embryonic and plancental development. These events are finely controlled by a network of transcriptional factors, which are extensively characterized in mice. Species-specific roles of these proteins are emerging in mammals. Here, we develop a gene loss-of-function system by using cytosine base editors in bovine embryos. We find that expression pattern, functional roles, and regulation of SOX2 are all different between mouse and bovine embryos. Remarkbly, SOX2 is required for OCT4 and NANOG, two well established pluripoteny genes. Furthermore, CDX2 is required to shut down SOX2 in the trophectoderm. Given similar expression pattern of SOX2 between human and bovine blastocysts, bovine embryos represents a putative model to investigate human pluripotency regulation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "During embryogenesis, the initial vascular network is thought to form by the process of vasculogenesis, or the specification of vascular progenitors de novo. After the initial blood circulation has been established, the majority of later-forming vessels are thought to arise by angiogenesis from the already established vasculature. Here we show that new vascular progenitors in zebrafish embryos contribute to functional vasculature even after blood circulation has been established. Based on the expression analysis of early vascular progenitor markers etv2 and tal1, we characterized a novel site of late vasculogenesis (termed secondary vascular field, SVF), located bilaterally along the yolk extension. Using time-lapse imaging of etv2 reporter lines, we show that SVF cells migrate and incorporate into functional blood vessels and contribute to the formation of the posterior cardinal vein and subintestinal vasculature, suggesting a novel mode of vascular growth. We further demonstrate that SVF cells participate in vascular recovery after chemical ablation of vascular endothelial cells. Inducible inhibition of etv2 function prevented SVF cell differentiation and resulted in the defective formation of subintestinal vasculature. In addition, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis to identify the transcriptional profile of SVF cells, which demonstrated similarities and differences between the transcriptomes of SVF cells and early vascular progenitors. Our results characterize a novel mechanism of how new vascular progenitors incorporate into established vasculature and revise our understanding of basic mechanisms that regulate vascular development.",

    "abstract": "Increased fragmentation caused by habitat loss represents a major threat to the persistence of animal populations. How fragmentation affects populations depends on the rate at which individuals move between spatially separated patches. Whereas negative effects of habitat loss on biodiversity are well-known, effects of fragmentation per se on population dynamics and ecosystem stability remain less understood. Here, we use a spatially explicit predator-prey model to investigate how the interplay between fragmentation and optimal foraging behavior affects predator-prey interactions and, subsequently, ecosystem stability. We study systems wherein prey occupies isolated patches and are consumed by predators that disperse following Levy random walks. Our results show that the Levy exponent and the degree of fragmentation jointly determine coexistence probabilities. In highly fragmented landscapes, Brownian and ballistic predators go extinct and only scale-free predators can coexist with prey. Furthermore, our results confirm that predation causes irreversible habitat loss in fragmented landscapes due to overexploitation of smaller patches of prey. Moreover, we show that predator dispersal can reduce, but not prevent nor minimize, the amount of lost habitat. Our results suggest that integrating optimal foraging theory into population- and landscape ecology is crucial to assessing the impact of fragmentation on biodiversity and ecosystem stability.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing is a powerful approach to study the adaptive architecture of selected traits, in particular when replicated experimental populations evolving in opposite selective conditions (e.g. hot vs. cold temperature) are compared. Nevertheless, such comparisons could be affected by environmental effects shared between selective regimes (e.g. laboratory adaptation), which complicate the interpretation of selection signatures. Here, we used an experimental design, which takes advantage of the simplicity of selection signatures from founder populations with reduced variation, to study the fitness consequences of the laboratory environment (culture conditions) at two temperature regimes. After 20 generations of adaptation at 18{degrees}C and 29{degrees}C, strong genome-wide selection signatures were observed. About one third of the selection signatures can be either attributed to temperature effects, laboratory adaptation or the joint effects of both. The fitness consequences reflecting the combined effects of temperature and laboratory adaptation were more extreme in the hot environment for 83% of the affected genomic regions, fitting the pattern of larger expression differences between founders at 29{degrees}C. We propose that evolve and resequence (E&R) with reduced genetic variation allows to study genome-wide fitness consequences driven by the interaction of multiple environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetics aims at untangling the genetic and environmental effects on phenotypic variation. Trait heritability, which summarizes the relative importance of genetic effects, is estimated at the intraspecific level, but theory predicts that heritability could influence long-term evolution of quantitative traits. The phylogenetic signal concept bears resemblance to heritability and it has often been called species-level heritability. Under certain conditions, such as trait neutrality or contribution to phylogenesis, within-species heritability and between-species phylogenetic signal should be correlated. Here, we investigate the potential relationship between these two concepts by examining the evolution of multiple morphological traits for which heritability has been estimated in Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, we analysed 42 morphological traits in both sexes on a phylogeny inferred from 22 nuclear genes for nine species of the melanogaster subgroup. We used Pagels {lambda} as a measurement of phylogenetic signal because it is the least influenced by the number of analysed taxa. Pigmentation traits showed the strongest concordance with the phylogeny, but no correlation was found between phylogenetic signal and heritability estimates mined from the literature. We obtained data for multiple climatic variables inferred from the geographical distribution of each species. Phylogenetic regression of quantitative traits on climatic variables showed a significantly positive correlation with heritability. Convergent selection, the response to which depends on the trait heritability, may have led to the null association between phylogenetic signal and heritability for morphological traits in Drosophila. We discuss the possible causes of discrepancy between both statistics and caution against their confusion in evolutionary biology.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic communication is widespread across vertebrates, including among fishes. We report robust acoustic displays during aggressive interactions for a laboratory colony of Danionella dracula, a relatively recently discovered miniature and transparent species of teleost fish closely related to zebrafish (Danio rerio). Males produce bursts of pulsatile, click-like sounds and a distinct postural display, extension of a hypertrophied lower jaw, during aggressive but not courtship interactions. Females lack a hypertrophied lower jaw and show no evidence of sound production or jaw extension in such contexts. Novel pairs of size-matched or -mismatched males were combined in resident-intruder assays where sound production and jaw extension could be linked to individuals. Resident males produce significantly more sound pulses and extend their jaw more often than intruders in both dyad contexts, and relatively larger males are significantly more sonic and exhibit more jaw extensions in size-mismatched pairs. The majority of highest sound producers in both contexts also show increased jaw extension during periods of heightened sonic activity. These studies firmly establish D. dracula as a sound-producing species that modulates both acoustic and postural displays during aggressive interactions based on either residency or body size, providing a foundation for further investigating the role of multimodal displays in a new model clade for neurogenomic studies of aggression, courtship, and other social interactions.",

    "abstract": "Most animal cells are surrounded by a cell membrane and an underlying actomyosin cortex. Both structures are linked, and they are under tension. In-plane membrane tension and cortical tension both influence many cellular processes, including cell migration, division, and endocytosis. However, while actomyosin tension is regulated by substrate stiffness, how membrane tension responds to mechanical substrate properties is currently poorly understood. Here, we probed the effective membrane tension of neurons and fibroblasts cultured on glass and polyacrylamide substrates of varying stiffness using optical tweezers. In contrast to actomyosin-based traction forces, both peak forces and steady state tether forces of cells cultured on hydrogels were independent of substrate stiffness and did not change after blocking myosin II activity using blebbistatin, indicating that tether and traction forces are not directly linked. Peak forces in fibroblasts on hydrogels were about twice as high as those in neurons, indicating stronger membrane-cortex adhesion in fibroblasts. Steady state tether forces were generally higher in cells cultured on hydrogels than on glass, which we explain by a mechanical model. Our results provide new insights into the complex regulation of effective membrane tension and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the biological processes it instructs.",

Such neuroprosthetic sensory information can be used as feedback from an invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic arm/hand, such that tactile and proprioceptive feedback from the sensorized robotic arm/hand is directly given to the BMI user. Microstimulation in the human somatosensory thalamus (Vc) has been shown to produce somatosensory perceptions. However, until recently, systematic methods for using thalamic stimulation to evoke naturalistic touch perceptions were lacking. We have recently presented rigorous methods for determining a mapping between ventral posterior lateral thalamus (VPL) MiSt, and neural responses in the somatosensory cortex (S1), in a rodent model (Choi et al., 2016; Choi and Francis, 2018). Our technique minimizes the difference between S1 neural responses induced by natural sensory stimuli and those generated via VPL MiSt. Our goal is to develop systems that know what MiSt will produce a given neural response and possibly a more natural \"sensation.\" To date, our optimization has been conducted in the rodent model and simulations. Here we present data from simple non-optimized thalamic MiSt during peri-operative experiments, where we MiSt in the VPL of macaques with a somatosensory system more like humans. We implanted arrays of microelectrodes across the hand area of the macaque S1 cortex as well as in the VPL thalamus. Multi and single-unit recordings were used to compare cortical responses to natural touch and thalamic MiSt in the anesthetized state. Post stimulus time histograms were highly correlated between the VPL MiSt and natural touch modalities, adding support to the use of VPL MiSt towards producing a somatosensory neuroprosthesis in humans.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome data has been proven to be a powerful tool to understand the human body in both health and disease conditions. However, understanding their complex interactions and impact on the human body remains a challenging task. Unravelling the species-level interactions could allow us to study the causality of the microbiome. Moreover, it could lead us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases and, subsequently, the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Given these challenges and benefits, it has become evident that a freely accessible and centralized platform for presenting gut microbiome interaction is essential to untangle the complexity and open multiple new paths and opportunities in disease- and drug-related research. Here, we present GutMicroNet, an interactive visualization platform of human gut microbiome interaction networks. We generated 45 gut microbiome co-abundance networks from various geographical origins, gender, and diseases based on the data presented in the Human Gut Microbiome Atlas. This interactive platform includes more than 1900 gut microbiome species and allows users to query multiple species at the same time based on their interests and adjust it based on the statistical properties. Moreover, users can download publication-ready figures or network information for further analysis. The platform can be accessed freely on https://gutmicro.net without any login requirements or limitations, including access to the full networks data.",

    "abstract": "China, especially the Xinjiang cotton area, is facing severe agricultural water shortages, which seriously restrain the development of the cotton industry. Discovering cotton drought resistance genes and cultivating high-quality and drought-resistant cotton materials through molecular breeding methods are of great significance to the development of the cotton industry. In this study, the drought-resistant cotton material Xinluzhong NO.82 and the drought-sensitive cotton material Kexin NO.1 were used to identify a batch of drought-resistant candidate genes through whole transcriptome sequencing. The main research results obtained were as follows: the ceRNA (competing endogenous RNAs) network was constructed using full transcriptional sequencing to screen the core genes in the core pathway; two drought-related candidate genes were obtained. Gohir.A11G156000 was upregulated at 0 h vs 12 h and downregulated at 12 h vs 24 h. Gohir.A07G220600 was downregulated at 0 h vs 12 h and upregulated at 12 h vs 24 h. The results for drought-resistant materials and drought-sensitive materials were similar. Gohir.A11G156000, encoding GABA-T, which is homologous to POP2 in Arabidopsis thaliana, affects the drought resistance of plants by regulating the GABA content. Gohir.A07G220600 encodes L-aspartate oxidase, which is homologous to AO in Arabidopsis thaliana, and is involved in the early steps of NAD biosynthesis and in plant antioxidant reactions. This study confirmed that the use of gene expression regulatory networks can quickly screen reliable drought-resistance genes and can be used for subsequent gene function verification.",

    "abstract": "Understanding both global and local patterns in the structure and interplay of microbial communities has been a fundamental question in ecological research. In this paper, we present a python toolbox that combines two emerging techniques that have been proposed as useful when analyzing compositional microbial data. On one hand, we introduce a visualization module that incorporates the use of UMAP, a recent dimensionality reduction technique that focuses on local patterns, and HDBSCAN, a clustering technique based on density. On the other hand, we have included a module that runs an enhanced version of the SparCC code, sustaining larger datasets than before, and we couple this with network theory analyses to describe the resulting co-occurrence networks, including several novel analyses, such as structural balance metrics and a proposal to discover the underlying topology of a co-occurrence network. We validated the proposed toolbox on 1) a simple and well described biological network of kombucha, consisting of 48 ASVs, and 2) using simulated community networks with known topologies to show that we are able to discern between network topologies. Finally, we showcase the use of the MicNet toolbox on a large dataset from Archean Domes, consisting of more than 2,000 ASVs. Our toolbox is freely available as a github repository (https://github.com/Labevo/MicNetToolbox), and it is accompanied by a web dashboard (http://micnetapplb-1212130533.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com) that can be used in a simple and straightforward manner with relative abundance data.\n\nAuthor SummaryMicrobial communities are complex systems that cannot be wholly understood when studied by its individual components. Hence, global pattern analyses seem to be a promising complement to highly focused local approaches. Here, we introduce the MicNet toolbox, an open-source collection of several analytical methods for visualizing abundance data and creating co-occurrence networks for further analysis. We include two modules: one for visualization and one for network analysis based on graph theory. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced version of SparCC, a method to estimate correlations for co-occurrence network construction, that is faster and can support larger datasets. We performed method validations using simulated data and a simple biological network. Our toolbox is freely available in a github repository at https://github.com/Labevo/MicNetToolbox, and it is accompanied by a web dashboard that could be easily accessed and manipulated by non-specialist users. With this implementation, we attempt to provide a simple and straightforward way to explore and analyze microbial relative abundance data.",
