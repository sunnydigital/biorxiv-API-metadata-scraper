    "abstract": "Extensive studies of growing axons have revealed many individual components and protein interactions that guide neuronal morphogenesis. Despite this, however, we lack any clear picture of the emergent mechanism by which this nanometer-scale biochemistry generates the multi-micron scale morphology and cell biology of axon growth and guidance in vivo. To address this, we studied the downstream effects of the Abl signaling pathway using a computer simulation software (MEDYAN) that accounts for mechanochemical dynamics of active polymers. Previous studies implicate two Abl effectors, Arp2/3 and Enabled, in Abl-dependent axon guidance decisions. We now find that Abl alters actin architecture primarily by activating Arp2/3, while Enabled plays a more limited role. Our simulations show that simulations mimicking modest levels of Abl activity bear striking similarity to actin profiles obtained experimentally from live-imaging of actin in wild type axons in vivo. Using a graph-theoretical filament-filament contact analysis, moreover, we find that networks mimicking hyperactivity of Abl (enhanced Arp2/3) are fragmented into smaller domains of actin that interact weakly with each other, consistent with the pattern of actin fragmentation observed upon Abl overexpression in vivo. Two perturbative simulations further confirm that high Arp2/3 actin networks are mechanically disconnected and fail to mount a cohesive response to perturbation. Taken together, these data provide a molecular-level picture of how the large-scale organization of the axonal cytoskeleton arises from the biophysics of actin networks.\n\nHighlight summaryHow do single-molecule dynamics produce multi-micron scale changes in actin organization in an extending axon? Comparison of computational simulations to in vivo data suggests that Abl kinase and Arp2/3 expand actomyosin networks by fragmenting into multiple domains, thus toggling the axon between states of local vs global internal connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Detrimental effect of males on female, often termed mate harm, is a hallmark of sexual conflict. Allowed to evolve unchecked, mate harming traits are predicted to bring down average fitness of a population, unless mitigated by the evolution of resistance in females. In addition, life history may also modulate sexual conflict, but the mechanism is not clearly understood. Here we investigated the evolution of mate harm in a set of experimentally evolved laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster wherein a faster aging has evolved in response to >1000 generations of selection for faster development and early reproduction. We quantified mortality and fecundity of Oregon R females held with evolved (ACO) and ancestral males (CO) to show that the evolved males are significantly less detrimental to their mates. We compared our results from the ACO males with that from a phenocopied version of the ancestral regime (CCO) to show that only part of the observed difference in mate harm can be attributed to the evolved difference in body size. We further show that the reduction in mate harming ability evolved despite an increase in courtship activity, especially early in life. We discuss the causative role of an evolved reproductive schedule and altered breeding ecology.\n\nSignificance statementSexually antagonistic male effects can significantly bring down female fitness. Along with female counter evolution of resistance traits, life history has been conjectured to impose constrains on the evolution of such harming ability in males. Here, we report the evolution of mate harming ability in males of a set of five replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations that evolved smaller size and faster aging as a result of >1000 generations of experimental evolution for faster development and early reproduction. We show that in spite of ample scope of sexual selection, the faster aging males have evolved reduced mate harming ability despite being more active in courting their mates. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first clear evidences demonstrating the causal relationship between evolution of life history and reduction in sexual antagonism in a population.",

    "abstract": "Molecular evolution studies, such as phylogenomic studies and genome-wide surveys of selection, often rely on gene families of single-copy orthologs (SC-OGs). Large gene families with multiple homologs in one or more species--a phenomenon observed among several important families of genes such as transporters and transcription factors--are often ignored because identifying and retrieving SC-OGs nested within them is challenging. To address this issue and increase the number of markers used in molecular evolution studies, we developed OrthoSNAP, a software that uses a phylogenetic framework to simultaneously split gene families into SC-OGs and prune species-specific inparalogs. We term SC-OGs identified by OrthoSNAP as SNAP-OGs because they are identified using a splitting and pruning procedure analogous to snapping branches on a tree. From 415,129 orthologous groups of genes inferred across seven eukaryotic phylogenomic datasets, we identified 9,821 SC-OGs; using OrthoSNAP on the remaining 405,308 orthologous groups of genes, we identified an additional 10,704 SNAP-OGs. Comparison of SNAP-OGs and SC-OGs revealed that their phylogenetic information content was similar, even in complex datasets that contain a whole genome duplication, complex patterns of duplication and loss, transcriptome data where each gene typically has multiple transcripts, and contentious branches in the tree of life. OrthoSNAP is useful for increasing the number of markers used in molecular evolution data matrices, a critical step for robustly inferring and exploring the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Chitinases are enzymes that digest the polysaccharide polymer chitin. Chitin is a major component of insect exoskeletons, which must be replaced multiple times during growth and development in a process known as molting. Insect genomes usually have multiple chitinase genes, some of which are required for molting and some whose functions are still unknown. Since knockdown of the chitinases required for molting causes high levels of lethality, chitinase genes have drawn interest as targets for RNAi-based pest control methods. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, carries the bacterium that causes Huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening disease, which is devastating the citrus industry worldwide. We have identified and annotated 12 chitinase family genes from D. citri as part of a community effort to create high quality gene models to facilitate the design of interdictory molecules for pest control. Using predicted protein domain content and phylogenetic analysis, we categorized the D. citri chitinases according to a previously established classification scheme and re-evaluated the classification of chitinases in other hemipterans. In addition to chitinases belonging to known groups, we identified a novel class of chitinases present in D. citri and several related hemipterans that appears to be the result of horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "A human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based assay was developed to identify antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) with the potential to activate a cellular innate immune response outside of an acceptable level. The development of this assay was initiated when ISIS 353512 targeting the mRNA for human C-reactive protein was tested in a phase I clinical trial in which healthy human volunteers unexpectedly experienced increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein. This level of immune stimulation was not anticipated following rodent and non-human primate safety studies in which no evidence of exaggerated proinflammatory effects were observed. The IL-6 increase induced by ISIS 353512 was caused by activation of B-cells. The IL-6 induction was inhibited by chloroquine pretreatment of the PBMC and the nature of the ASOs suggested that the response is mediated by a toll like receptor, in all likelihood TLR9. While assessing the inter PBMC donor variability, two class of responders to ISIS 353512 were identified (discriminator and non-discriminators). The discriminator source of PBMC was shown to produce low level of IL-6 after 24 hours in culture in absence of ASO treatment. The PBMC assay using discriminator donors was shown to be reproducible allowing to assess reliably the immune potential of ASOs via comparison to known benchmark ASO controls that were previously shown to be either safe or inflammatory in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock ensures that biological processes are phased to the correct time of day. In plants the circadian clock is conserved at both the level of transcriptional networks as well as core genes. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the core circadian singleMYB (sMYB) genes CCA1 and RVE4 are in genetic linkage with the PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) genes PRR9 and PRR7 respectively. Leveraging chromosome-resolved plant genomes and syntenic ortholog analysis it was possible to trace this genetic linkage back to the basal angiosperm Amborella and identify an additional evolutionarily conserved genetic linkage between PIF3 and PHYA. The LHY/CCA1-PRR5/9, RVE4/8-PRR3/7 and PIF3-PHYA genetic linkages emerged in the bryophyte lineage and progressively moved within several genes of each other across an array of higher plant families representing distinct whole genome duplication and fractionation events. Soybean maintains all but two genetic linkages, and expression analysis revealed the PIF3-PHYA linkage overlapping with the E4 maturity group locus was the only pair to robustly cycle with an evening phase in contrast to the sMYB-PRR morning and midday phase. While most monocots maintain the genetic linkages, they have been lost in the economically important grasses (Poaceae) such as maize where the genes have been fractionated to separate chromosomes and presence/absence variation results in the segregation of PRR7 paralogs across heterotic groups. The evolutionary conservation of the genetic linkage as well as its loss in the grasses provides new insight in the plant circadian clock, which has been a critical target of breeding and domestication.\n\nSummary SentenceThe genetic linkage of the core circadian clock components has evolutionary origins in bryophytes and sheds light on the current functioning and selection on the circadian clock in crops.",

    "abstract": "We previously described monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and synthetic cord factor, trehalose-6,6-dicorynomycolate (TDCM) significantly increases antibody (Ab) responses to T cell independent type 2 antigens (TI-2 Ags) in a manner dependent on B cell-intrinsic TLR4 expression as well as MyD88 and TRIF adapter proteins. Given the requirement for TRIF in optimal MPL/TDCM adjuvant effects and the capacity of MPL to drive type I IFN production, we aimed to investigate the extent to which adjuvant effects on TI-2 Ab responses depend on type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling. We found IFNAR-/- mice had impaired early TI-2 Ag-induced B cell activation and expansion and that B cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling on B cells was essential for normal antibody responses to TI-2 Ags, including haptenated Ficoll and the pneumococcal vaccine, Pneumovax23. However, MPL/TDCM significantly increased TI-2 IgM and IgG responses in IFNAR-/- mice. MPL/TDCM enhanced TI-2 Ab production primarily by activating innate B cells (B-1b and splenic CD23- B cells) as opposed to CD23+ enriched follicular B cells. In summary, our study highlights an important role for type I IFN in supporting early B cell responses to TI-2 Ags through B cell-expressed IFNAR, but nonetheless demonstrates an MPL/TDCM adjuvant significantly increases TI-2 Ab responses independently of type I IFN signaling and does so by predominantly supporting increased polysaccharide-specific Ab production by innate B cell populations.\n\nKey pointsO_LIB cell-intrinsic IFNAR expression promotes TI-2 Ab responses.\nC_LIO_LIMPL/TDCM adjuvant effects are independent of type 1 IFN.\nC_LIO_LIMPL/TDCM promotes TI-2 Ab responses by innate B cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "1.Childhood malnutrition affects physiology and development, it increases infection rate which may not present clinical signs in severe cases. To overcome this issue, the World Health Organization recommends prophylactic treatment with Cotrimoxazole (SXT) along with nutritional recovery. This treatment is controversial since evidence of reduction in morbidity and mortality is not a consensus and could induce the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Moreover, the impact of the use of this wide-spectrum antibiotic on gut microbiota, in a critical period of development and weakness, is unknown. To understand how SXT prophylaxis could affect gut microbiota in undernutrition, we induced protein-energy undernutrition in weaning C57BL/6 mice for three weeks and treated animals with SXT for two weeks. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing we compared the taxonomic composition and metabolic pathways of control mice, animals submitted to undernutrition (UND), treated with SXT, or undernourished and SXT treated (UND+SXT). Undernutrition protocol was responsible for increasing Bacteroidetes and decreasing Firmicutes abundance. We identified that UND mice had a significant increase in predicted pathways related to metabolic syndromes later in life. The prophylactic SXT treatment alone resulted in significant loss in community richness and beta diversity. In addition, we identified the reduction of 6 families in SXT treated mice, including the butyrate producers Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. The double challenge (UND+SXT) resulted in a reduction in Clostridiaceae family and in the urea cycle pathway, both related to the fermentation of amino acids, the intestinal epithelial permeability, and the healthy gut environment. Our results show that SXT prophylaxis during an undernourishment period in young mice did not re-establish the undernourished microbiota community composition similar to healthy controls, but induces a distinct dysbiotic profile, with functional metabolic consequences.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in lymphopenic patients. Pulmonary macrophages comprise the first line of host defense upon inhalation of fungal spores, whereby macrophages either aid in clearance or serve as a niche for its dissemination. Given that macrophages play a key role in the outcome of a cryptococcal infection, it is crucial to understand factors that mediate phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Since lipid rafts (high order plasma membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin) have been implicated in facilitating phagocytosis, we evaluated whether these ordered domains govern macrophages ability to phagocytose C. neoformans. We found that cholesterol or sphingomyelin depletion resulted in significantly deficient IgG-mediated phagocytosis of the fungus. Moreover, repletion of macrophage cells with a raft-promoting sterol (7-dehydrocholesterol) rescued this phagocytic deficiency while a raft-inhibiting sterol (coprostanol) significantly decreased IgG-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Using a photoswitchable sphingomyelin (AzoSM), we observed that the raft-promoting conformation (trans-AzoSM) resulted in efficient phagocytosis whereas raft-inhibiting conformation (cis-AzoSM) significantly blunted phagocytosis in a reversible manner. We observed that the effect on phagocytosis may be mediated by facilitating Fc{gamma} receptor (Fc{gamma}R) function, whereby IgG immune complexes cross-link to Fc{gamma}RIII, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR {gamma}-subunit (FcR{gamma}), an important accessory protein in the Fc{gamma}R signaling cascade. Correspondingly, cholesterol or sphingomyelin depletion resulted in decreased FcR{gamma} phosphorylation. Repletion with 7-dehydrocholesterol restored phosphorylation, whereas repletion with coprostanol showed FcR{gamma} phosphorylation comparable to unstimulated cells. Together, these data suggest that lipid rafts are critical for facilitating Fc{gamma}RIII-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans.",

CTAB protocol was used for the isolation of DNA and both the quality and quantity of this DNA was validated through gel electrophoresis, Qubit quantification and PCR amplifications. The result showed that DNA could be successfully extracted from all tissues of plants and the yield of DNA obtained was variable ranging from 179ng l-1 in stem to 750ng l-1 in young leave.

    "abstract": "The field of population genomics has grown rapidly in response to the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population-genetic insights out-paced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous non-adaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model-fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Traditional (genome-scale) metabolic models of cellular growth involve an approximate biomass \"reaction\", which specifies biomass composition in terms of precursor metabolites (such as amino acids and nucleotides). On the one hand, biomass composition is often not known exactly and may vary drastically between conditions and strains. On the other hand, the predictions of computational models crucially depend on biomass. Also elementary flux modes (EFMs), which generate the flux cone, depend on the biomass reaction.\n\nTo better understand cellular phenotypes across growth conditions, we introduce and analyze new classes of elementary vectors for comprehensive (next-generation) metabolic models, involving explicit synthesis reactions for all macromolecules. Elementary growth modes (EGMs) are given by stoichiometry and generate the growth cone. Unlike EFMs, they are not support-minimal, in general, but cannot be decomposed \"without cancellations\". In models with additional (capacity) constraints, elementary growth vectors (EGVs) generate a growth polyhedron and depend also on growth rate. However, EGMs/EGVs do not depend on the biomass composition. In fact, they cover all possible biomass compositions and can be seen as unbiased versions of elementary flux modes/vectors (EFMs/EFVs) used in traditional models.\n\nTo relate the new concepts to other branches of theory, we consider autocatalytic sets of reactions. Further, we illustrate our results in a small model of a self-fabricating cell, involving glucose and ammonium uptake, amino acid and lipid synthesis, and the expression of all enzymes and the ribosome itself. In particular, we study the variation of biomass composition as a function of growth rate. In agreement with experimental data, low nitrogen uptake correlates with high carbon (lipid) storage.\n\nAuthor summaryNext-generation, genome-scale metabolic models allow to study the reallocation of cellular resources upon changing environmental conditions, by not only modeling flux distributions, but also expression profiles of the catalyzing proteome. In particular, they do no longer assume a fixed biomass composition. Methods to identify optimal solutions in such comprehensive models exist, however, an unbiased understanding of all feasible allocations is missing so far. Here we develop new concepts, called elementary growth modes and vectors, that provide a generalized definition of minimal pathways, thereby extending classical elementary flux modes (used in traditional models with a fixed biomass composition). The new concepts provide an understanding of all possible flux distributions and of all possible biomass compositions. In other words, elementary growth modes and vectors are the unique functional units in any comprehensive model of cellular growth. As an example, we show that lipid accumulation upon nitrogen starvation is a consequence of resource allocation and does not require active regulation. Our work puts current approaches on a theoretical basis and allows to seamlessly transfer existing workflows (e.g. for the design of cell factories) to next-generation metabolic models.",

    "abstract": "Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) supports a wide range of navigational and memory related behaviors. Well-known experimental results have revealed specialized cell types in MEC -- e.g. grid, border, and head-direction cells -- whose highly stereotypical response profiles are suggestive of the role they might play in supporting MEC functionality. However, the majority of MEC neurons do not exhibit stereotypical firing patterns. How should the response profiles of these more \"heterogeneous\" cells be described, and how do they contribute to behavior? In this work, we took a computational approach to addressing these questions. We first performed a statistical analysis that shows that heterogeneous MEC cells are just as reliable in their response patterns as the more stereotypical cell types, suggesting that they have a coherent functional role. Next, we evaluated a spectrum of candidate models in terms of their ability to describe the response profiles of both stereotypical and heterogeneous MEC cells. We found that recently developed task-optimized neural network models are substantially better than traditional grid cell-centric models at matching most MEC neuronal response profiles -- including those of grid cells themselves -- despite not being explicitly trained for this purpose. Specific choices of network architecture (such as gated nonlinearities and an explicit intermediate place cell representation) have an important effect on the ability of the model to generalize to novel scenarios, with the best of these models closely approaching the noise ceiling of the data itself. We then performed in silico experiments on this model to address questions involving the relative functional relevance of various cell types, finding that heterogeneous cells are likely to be just as involved in downstream functional outcomes (such as path integration) as grid and border cells. Finally, inspired by recent data showing that, going beyond their spatial response selectivity, MEC cells are also responsive to non-spatial rewards, we introduce a new MEC model that performs reward-modulated path integration. We find that this unified model matches neural recordings across all variable-reward conditions. Taken together, our results point toward a conceptually principled goal-driven modeling approach for moving future experimental and computational efforts beyond overly-simplistic single-cell stereotypes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding brain structure-function relationships, and their development and evolution, is central to neuroscience research. Here, we show that morphological differences in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a hub of functional brain networks, predict individual differences in macroanatomical, microstructural, and functional features of PCC. Manually labeling 4,319 sulci in 552 hemispheres, we discovered a consistently localized shallow cortical indentation (termed the inframarginal sulcus; ifrms) within PCC that is absent from neuroanatomical atlases, yet co-localized with a region within the cognitive control, but not default mode, network. Morphological analyses in humans and chimpanzees showed that unique properties of the ifrms differ across the lifespan and between hominoid species. Intriguingly, the consistency of the ifrms also debunks the uniqueness of the morphology of Einsteins PCC. These findings support a classic theory that shallow, tertiary sulci serve as landmarks in association cortices. They also beg the question: how many other cortical indentations have we missed?",

    "abstract": "Germ cells differentiate into oocytes that become totipotent upon fertilization. How the highly specialized oocyte acquires this distinct cell fate is poorly understood. During Drosophila oogenesis, H3K9me3 histone methyltransferase SETDB1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of germ cells concurrent with oocyte specification. Here, we discovered that nuclear SETDB1 is required to silence a cohort of differentiation-promoting genes by mediating their heterochromatinization. Intriguingly, SETDB1 is also required for the upregulation of 18 of the ~30 nucleoporins (Nups) that comprise the nucleopore complex (NPC). NPCs in turn anchor SETDB1-dependent heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery to maintain H3K9me3 and gene silencing in the egg chambers. Aberrant gene expression due to loss of SETDB1 or Nups results in loss of oocyte identity, cell death and sterility. Thus, a feedback loop between heterochromatin and NPCs promotes transcriptional reprogramming at the onset of oocyte specification that is critical to establish oocyte identity.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of mosquitoes and associated vector diseases (e.g., West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses) is likely a function of environmental conditions in the landscape. Urban environments are highly heterogeneous in the amount of vegetation, standing water, and concrete structures covering the land at a given time, each having the capacity to influence mosquito abundance and disease transmission. Previous research suggests that socioeconomic status is correlated with the ecology of the landscape, with lower-income neighborhoods generally having more concrete structures and standing water via residential abandonment, garbage dumps, and inadequate sewage. Whether these socio-ecological factors affect mosquito distributions across urban environments in the United States (US) remains unclear. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 22 paired observations from 15 articles testing how socioeconomic status relates to overall mosquito burden in urban landscapes in the United States. We then analyzed a comprehensive dataset from a socioeconomic gradient in Baltimore, Maryland to model spatiotemporal patterns of Aedes albopictus using a spatial regression model with socio-ecological covariates. The meta-analysis revealed that lower-income neighborhoods (regions making less than $50,000 per year on average) are exposed to 151% greater mosquito densities and mosquito-borne illnesses compared to higher-income neighborhoods ([&ge;]$50,000 per year). Two species of mosquito (Ae. albopictus and Aedes aegypti) showed the strongest relationship with socioeconomic status, with Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti being 62% and 22% higher in low-income neighborhoods, respectively. In the spatial regression analysis in Baltimore, we found that Ae. albopictus spatial spread of 1.2 km per year was significantly associated with median household income, vegetation cover, tree density, and abandoned buildings. Specifically, Ae. albopictus abundance was negatively correlated with median household income, vegetation cover, and tree density. Ae. albopictus abundance and the cover of abandoned buildings were positively correlated. Together, these results indicate that socio-ecological interactions can lead to disproportionate impacts of mosquitoes on humans in urban landscapes. Thus, concerted efforts to manage mosquito populations in low-income urban neighborhoods are required to reduce mosquito burden for the communities most vulnerable to human disease.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization and deforestation impose severe challenges to wildlife, particularly for forest-living vertebrates. Understanding how the peri-urban matrix impacts their survival is critical for designing strategies to promote their conservation. We investigated the threats faced by brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in peri-urban regions of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and Santa Catarina (SC) states, southern Brazil, by compiling negative interaction events (hereafter NIE) reported over more than two decades. We assessed the major NIEs, their distribution among age-sex classes, and the predictors of NIE-related mortality. After 20+ years of monitoring, we compiled 540 NIEs (RS = 248 and SC = 292). Electrocution by power lines was the most frequent cause of death or injury (37%), followed by dog attack (34%), vehicle collision (17%), and human mistreatment (12%). The occurrence of lethal injuries ranged from 5% to 69% depending on the type of NIE and on which state it occurred in. The overall post-NIE mortality was 56%. Adults of both sexes were the most affected individuals in both study regions. The minimal adequate GLM model explained 83% of the variation in NIE-related mortality. State, NIE type, and age-sex class were the main predictors of mortality. Overall, mortality was lower in SC and higher among adult females than in the other classes. We found that the survival of brown howler monkeys in the forest-urban interface is constrained by both the urban infrastructure and the growing interactions with humans and domestic and stray dogs (Canis familiaris). We propose the placement of aerial bridges, road signs and speed bumps in areas of frequent animal crossing, the sterilization of stray dogs, and the sensitization of local inhabitants on the importance of respecting and protecting wildlife to reduce their NIEs with humans and domestic animals in the forest-urban interface.",

    "abstract": "One strategy animals perform to cope scarcity of food resources is to shift in number of individuals according towards areas with available resources. This strategy can be more marked in species that are constrained by high energetic requirements such as hummingbirds. We aim to determine the extent to which the availability of food resources could be predictor of hummingbird numbers within and across hummingbird species in a temperate forest of central Mexico. We anticipate fluctuations in the number of hummingbirds grouped by species is best explained by monthly fluctuations in flowering resources species compared to pooled data. Our results indicate all seven hummingbird species fluctuate monthly in number across the year, which corresponds to monthly fluctuations of plant species they feed upon. The Basilinna leucotis and the Salvia elegans were present and interact in the study area almost all year-round, guiding the abundance pattern of both plants and hummingbirds in the study site. Generalized Linear Mixed Models indicate that although considering the abundance of the number of flowers for all plant species together could explain the fluctuation in all hummingbird species pooled together, considering both plant species and hummingbird species separately can provide a better explanation for changes in bird abundance. The model that analyzed species indicate that the interaction between the year-round species B. leucotis and S. elegans recorded the highest significant size effect. Our results highlight the fact that abundant species guiding abundance patterns could obscure by-species hummingbird trends and the processes guiding their patterns of abundance. We point out the need for performing adequate analytical approaches that can detect important biological interactions, and the likelihood of changes in habitat changing the pattern observed.\n\nRESUMENUna estrategia los colibries usan para lidiar con la escasez de alimento es realizar cambios en numero de individuos a zonas con recursos disponibles. Esta estrategia es mas marcada en especies que son limitadas por altos requerimientos energeticos como los colibries. Nuestro objetivo fue determinar el grado con el cual la disponibilidad de alimento puede ser un predictor de numero de individuos en un bosque templado del Centro de Mexico. Anticipamos fluctuaciones en numero de colibries agrupados por especies serian mejor explicadas por fluctuaciones mensuales en recursos florales al comparar con datos combinados. Nuestros resultados indican que las siete especies de colibries fluctuaron mensualmente en numeros a lo largo del ano de acuerdo a fluctuaciones mensuales de las especies de plantas que ellos se alimentan. Basilinna leucotis y Salvia elegans estuvieron presente e interactuaron en la zona de estudio casi todo el ano, guiando el patron de abundancia tanto de colibries como de plantas. Los Modelos Lineales Generalizados Mixtos indicaron que aunque considerar la abundancia del numero de flores para todas las especies juntas podria explicar la fluctuacion en todas las especies juntas, considerar las especies de colibries y de plantas por separado provee una mejor explicacion para los cambios en abundancia de aves. El modelo analizando especies indico que la interaccion entre las especies anuales B. leucotis y S. elegans tuvieron el tamano del efecto significativo mas alto.

However, a clear knowledge gap exists in arid biota of Asian drylands, where climate change and biological evolution demonstrate high regional specificity. We report here our phylogeographic study on the desert scorpion Mesobuthus mongolicus, attempting to narrow the gap. Range wide samples for one mitochondrial gene and three nuclear loci were subjected to phylogenetic inferences, molecular dating, Bayesian phylogeographic and demographic reconstructions, and population genetic analyses. Ecological niche modeling was employed to generate models of potential distribution range at present and during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Our results revealed that M. mongolicus represents a single coherent lineage that diverged with its most closely related lineage from Central Asia about 1.36 Ma and underwent radiation ever since. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction suggested the ancestral population of M. mongolicus dispersed gradually eastward through the Junngar Basin to the Gobi region during the late Pleistocene, strengthening the view that the Junggar Basin has constituted an important corridor for faunal exchange between Central Asian and East Asia. We found that the desert scorpion underwent demographic expansion while experiencing range contraction during the LGM. Development of sandy deserts in northwest China incurred by Eurasian aridification might have opened up substantial empty niches that sustained population expansion during the LGM. Our results suggested that organisms ecological adaptations have acted as an important determinant for their phylogeographic and demographic responses to past climate changes.",

    "abstract": "Pseudemys alabamensis is one of the most endangered turtle species in the United States due to its small population size and restricted geographic distribution in coastal Alabama and Mississippi. Increased urbanization and climate change impacts in the region further threaten this species. Populations of P. alabamensis are geographically isolated from one another by land and salt water, which could act as barriers to intraspecific gene flow. It is currently unknown how differentiated these isolated populations are from one another or whether they have experienced reductions in population size. Previous work found morphological differences between Alabama and Mississippi populations, suggesting that they may be evolutionarily distinct. Other Pseudemys turtles such as P. concinna and P. floridana occur within the same geographic area as P. alabamensis and are known to hybridize with each other. These more abundant species could further threaten the unique genetic identity of P. alabamensis through introgression. In order to evaluate the endangered status of P. alabamensis and the level of hybridization with other species, we used the mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region and nuclear microsatellite markers to assess genetic variation within and among populations of this species throughout its range and estimate admixture with co-occurring Pseudemys species. Genetic diversity of P. alabamensis was lower than expected at both markers (no variation in mtDNA and excess of homozygosity in microsatellites). We found evidence of genetic differentiation between Alabama and Mississippi populations as well as two populations (Fowl River, Alabama and Biloxi, Mississippi) with low estimated breeding sizes and signs of inbreeding. Finally, we found evidence of admixture of P. alabamensis with P. concinna/P. floridana and Pseudemys peninsularis (a species not native to Alabama or Mississippi). Our results indicate that P. alabamensis is highly endangered throughout its range and threatened by both low population sizes and hybridization. In order to improve the species chances of survival, focus should be placed on habitat preservation, maintenance of genetic diversity within both Mississippi and Alabama populations, and regular population monitoring activities such as nest surveillance and estimates of recruitment.",

    "abstract": "The CpG dinucleotide and its methylation play vital roles in gene regulation as well as 3D genome organization. Previous studies have divided genes into several categories based on the CpG intensity around transcription starting sites (TSS) and found that housekeeping genes tend to possess high CpG density while tissue-specific genes are generally characterized by low CpG density. In this study, we investigated how the CpG density distribution of a gene affects its transcription and regulation pattern. Based on the CpG density distribution around TSS, the human genes are clearly divided into different categories. Not only sequence properties, these different clusters exhibited distinctly different structural features, regulatory mechanisms, and correlation patterns between expression level and CpG/TpG density. These results emphasized that the usage of epigenetic marks in gene regulation is partially rooted in the sequence property of genes, such as their CpG density distribution.",

    "abstract": "In vivo functional imaging of human photoreceptors is an emerging field, with compelling potential applications in basic science, translational research, and clinical management of ophthalmic disease. Measurements of light-evoked changes in the photoreceptors has been successfully demonstrated using adaptive optics (AO) coherent flood illumination (CFI), AO scanning light ophthalmoscopy (SLO), AO optical coherence tomography (OCT), and full-field OCT with digital AO (dAO). While the optical principles and data processing of these systems differ greatly, and while these differences manifest in the resulting measurements, we believe that the underlying physiological processes involved in each of those techniques are likely the same. AO-CFI and AO-SLO systems are more widely used than OCT systems. However, those systems produce only two-dimensional images and so, less can be said about the anatomical and physiological origins of the observed signal. OCT signal, on the other hand, provides 3D imaging but at a cost of high volume of data, making it impractical to clinical purposes. In light of this, we employed a combined AO-OCT-SLO system-with point-for-point correspondence between the OCT and SLO images-to measure functional responses simultaneously with both and investigate SLO retinal functional biomarkers based on OCT response. The resulting SLO images reveal reflectance changes in the cones which are consistent with those previously reported using AO-CFI and AO-SLO. The resulting OCT volumes show phase changes in the cone outer segment (OS) consistent with those previously reported by us and others. We recapitulate a model of the cone OS previously proposed to explain AO-CFI reflectance changes, and show how this model can be used to predict the signal in AO-SLO. The limitations of the model is also discussed in this manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Robust cancer prognostication can enable more effective patient care and management, which may potentially improve health outcomes. Deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool to extract meaningful information from cancer patient data. In recent years it has displayed promise in quantifying prognostication by predicting patient risk. However, most current deep learning-based cancer prognosis prediction methods use only a single data source and miss out on learning from potentially rich relationships across modalities. Existing multimodal approaches are challenging to interpret in a biological or medical context, limiting real-world clinical integration as a trustworthy prognostic decision aid. Here, we developed a multimodal modeling approach that can integrate information from the central modalities of gene expression, DNA methylation, and histopathological imaging with clinical information for cancer prognosis prediction. Our multimodal modeling approach combines pathway and gene-based sparsely coded layers with patch-based graph convolutional networks to facilitate biological interpretation of the model results. We present a preliminary analysis that compares the potential applicability of combining all modalities to uni- or bi-modal approaches. Leveraging data from four cancer subtypes from the Cancer Genome Atlas, results demonstrate the encouraging performance of our multimodal approach (C-index=0.660 without clinical features; C-index=0.665 with clinical features) across four cancer subtypes versus unimodal approaches and existing state-of-the-art approaches. This work brings insight to the development of interpretable multimodal methods of applying AI to biomedical data and can potentially serve as a foundation for clinical implementations of such software. We plan to follow up this preliminary analysis with an in-depth exploration of factors to improve multimodal modeling approaches on an in-house dataset.",

Increasingly it is recognised that the function of G protein-coupled receptors can be regulated by their local plasma membrane lipid environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of experimentally modulating hepatocyte cholesterol content on the function of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). We found that glucagon-mediated cAMP production is inversely proportional to cholesterol content of human hepatoma and primary mouse hepatocytes after treatment with cholesterol-depleting and loading agents, with ligand internalisation showing the opposite trend. Mice fed a high cholesterol diet had increased hepatic cholesterol and a blunted hyperglycaemic response to glucagon, both of which were partially reversed by simvastatin. Molecular dynamics simulations identified potential membrane-exposed cholesterol binding sites on the GCGR. Overall, our data suggest that increased hepatocyte membrane cholesterol could directly contribute to glucagon resistance in NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects an estimated 330 million individuals worldwide. Approximately, 3 million individuals died of COPD in 2012 and it is predicted that COPD would be the third leading factor for deaths worldwide by 2020. In United Kingdom nearly one million individuals suffer from COPD.\n\nPurposeThere are no effective pharmacotherapies available for COPD. it is only managed by using bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids mostly. However, cardiovascular effects are associated with these drugs. Most importantly, there is an unmet need of COPD treatment worldwide. Our research aim was to identify Ipratropium and Tiotropium as novel anti-inflammatory agents in in vitro macrophage models.\n\nAimsTo investigate the LPS stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-  levels in THP-1 cells. To investigate whether the drugs Ipratropium and Tiotropium are capable of decreasing LPS-induced inflammation in THP-1 cells.\n\nMaterialsHuman monocytic cell line THP-1 cells, Rosewell Park Memorial Institute RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I, 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (PenStrep) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), Lipopolysaccharide 10l/ml, 0.05% Tween20, 0.4% Trypan blue, Reagent diluent (10% Bovine Serum Albumin in PBS), Budesonide Fenoterol, Ipratropium and Tiotropium. Human IL-6 DuoSet ELISA, Human TNF- ELISA, TMB ELISA Substrate solution and Stop solution.\n\nMethodsTHP-1 cells were cultured and challenges with LPS to stimulate the IL-6 and TNF- cytokines. The cells were treated with Budesonide, Fenoterol, Ipratropium and Tiotropium. ELISA was performed to determine the concentrations of cytokines.\n\nResultsThe results suggested that Ipratropium and Tiotropium reduce IL-6 and TNF-  concentrations in the cells. However, Budesonide and Fenoterol were found to reduce cytokines more effectively than Ipratropium and Tiotropium. The data was considered significant only when P <0.05.\n\nConclusionsThe anti-inflammatory or cytokine reducing properties of Ipratropium and Tiotropium were acknowledged. The research hypothesis was found to be true. Budesonide and Fenoterol substantially reduce cytokine levels. The receptor interactions of Ipratropium and Tiotropium may be responsible for their duration of action.

    "abstract": "Capturing individual differences in cognition is central to human neuroscience. Yet our ability to estimate cognitive abilities via brain MRI is still poor in both prediction and reliability. Our study tested if this inability can be improved by integrating MRI signals across the whole brain and across modalities, including task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) of different tasks along with other non-task MRI modalities, such as structural MRI, resting-state functional connectivity. Using the Human Connectome Project (n=873, 473 females, after quality control), we directly compared predictive models comprising different sets of MRI modalities (e.g., seven tasks vs. non-task modalities). We applied two approaches to integrate multimodal MRI, stacked vs. flat models, and implemented 16 combinations of machine-learning algorithms. The stacked model integrating all modalities via stacking Elastic Net provided the best prediction (r=.57), relatively to other models tested, as well as excellent test-retest reliability (ICC=~.85) in capturing general cognitive abilities. Importantly, compared to the stacked model integrating across non-task modalities (r=.27), the stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks led to significantly higher prediction (r=.56) while still providing excellent test-retest reliability (ICC=~.83). The stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks was driven by frontal and parietal areas and by tasks that are cognition-related (working-memory, relational processing, and language). This result is consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence. Accordingly, our results contradict the recently popular notion that tfMRI is not reliable enough to capture individual differences in cognition. Instead, our study suggests that tfMRI, when used appropriately (i.e., by drawing information across the whole brain and across tasks and by integrating with other modalities), provides predictive and reliable sources of information for individual differences in cognitive abilities, more so than non-task modalities.\n\nHighlightsO_LINon-task MRI (sMRI, rs-fMRI) are often used for the brain-cognition relationship.\nC_LIO_LITask-based fMRI has been deemed unreliable for capturing individual differences.\nC_LIO_LIWe tested if drawing task-based fMRI information across regions/tasks improves prediction and reliability of the brain-cognition relationship.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach boosts prediction of task-based fMRI over non-task MRI.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach renders task-based fMRI reliable over time.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach shows the importance of the fronto-parietal areas in cognition.\nC_LI",

AHDS is caused by inactivating mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), a specific TH transporter widely expressed in the central nervous system. MCT8 gene mutations cause impaired transport of TH across brain barriers, leading to insufficient neural TH supply. There is currently no successful therapy for the neurological symptoms. AAV9-based gene therapy is a promising approach to treat monogenic neurological disorders. Here, the potential of this approach was tested in the well-established double knockout (dKO) Mct8-/y;Oatp1c1-/- mouse model of AHDS, which displays disease-relevant neurological and TH phenotypes. Systemic intravenous delivery of AAV9-MCT8 at a juvenile stage led to improved locomotor and cognitive function, as well as rescue of T3-brain content and T3-related gene expression.

    "abstract": "A downside of upgrading MRI acquisition sequences is the discontinuity of technological homogeneity of the MRI data. It hampers combining new and old datasets, especially in a longitudinal design. Characterizing upgrading effects on multiple brain parameters and examining the efficacy of harmonization methods are essential. This study investigated the upgrading effects on three structural parameters, including cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), cortical volume (CV), and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) collected from 64 healthy volunteers. We used two evaluation metrics, Cohens d and classification accuracy, to quantify the effects. In classification analyses, we built classifiers for differentiating the protocols from brain parameters. We investigated the efficacy of three harmonization methods, including traveling subject (TS), TS-ComBat, and ComBat methods, and the sufficient number of participants for eliminating the effects on the evaluation metrics. Finally, we performed age prediction as an example to confirm that harmonization methods retained biological information. The results without harmonization methods revealed small to large mean Cohens d values on brain parameters (CT:0.85, SA:0.66, CV:0.68, and rs-FC:0.24) with better classification accuracy (>92% accuracy). With harmonization methods, Cohens d values approached zero. Classification performance reached the chance level with TS-based techniques when data from less than 26 participants were used for estimating the effects, while the Combat method required more participants. Furthermore, harmonization methods improved age prediction performance, except for the ComBat method. These results suggest that acquiring TS data is essential to preserve the continuity of MRI data.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBehavioural reports of sensory information are biased by stimulus history. The nature and direction of such serial-dependence biases can differ between experimental settings - both attractive and repulsive biases towards previous stimuli have been observed. How and when these biases arise in the human brain remains largely unexplored. They could occur either via a change in sensory processing itself and/or during post-perceptual processes such as maintenance or decision-making. To address this, we analysed behavioural and magnetoencephalographic data from a working-memory task in which participants were sequentially presented with two randomly oriented gratings, one of which was cued for recall at the end of the trial. Behavioural responses showed evidence for two distinct biases: 1) a within-trial repulsive bias away from the previously encoded orientation on the same trial, and 2) a between-trial attractive bias towards the task-relevant orientation on the previous trial. Multivariate classification of stimulus orientation revealed that neural representations during stimulus encoding were biased away from the previous grating orientation, regardless of whether we considered the within- or between-trial prior orientation - despite opposite effects on behaviour. These results suggest that repulsive biases occur at the level of sensory processing and can be overridden at post-perceptual stages to result in attractive biases in behaviour.",

They have provided insights into molecular mechanisms underlying fundamentally identical mechanisms in phylogenetically diverse animals, including vertebrates. Marine invertebrates have long fascinated researchers due to their abundance, diversity, adaptations, and impact on ecosystems and human economies. Here, we report a compendium and appraisal of 190 marine invertebrate genomes spanning 21 phyla, 43 classes, 92 orders, and 134 families. We identify a high proportion and long unit size of tandem repeats, likely contributing to reported difficulties in invertebrate genome assembly. A well-supported phylogenetic tree of marine invertebrates from 974 single-copy orthologous genes resolved topological controversies. We show that Ctenophora is at the basal phylum and Porifera is the sister group of Parahoxozoa; that Xenacoelomorpha is within Bilateria and is the sister group to Protostomia, rejecting three out of four hypotheses in the field; and that Bryozoa is at the basal position of Lophotrochozoa, not grouped into Lophophorata. We also present insights into the genetic underpinnings of metazoans from Hox genes, innate immune gene families, and nervous system gene families.

    "abstract": "Iron dysregulation has been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinsons Disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). One prominent feature of affected brain regions are iron-loaded microglia, but how iron overload influences microglia physiology and disease response is poorly understood. Here we show that microglia are highly susceptible to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. In a tri-culture of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, under ferroptosis-inducing conditions, microglia undergo a drastic shift in cell state, with increased ferritin levels, disrupted glutathione homeostasis, and altered cytokine signaling. Similar ferroptosis-associated signature (FAS) microglia were uncovered in PD, and the signature was also found in a large cohort of PD patient blood samples, raising the possibility that ferroptosis can be identified clinically. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen which revealed a novel regulator of ferroptosis, the vesicle trafficking gene SEC24B. A small molecule screen also nominated several candidates which blocked ferroptosis, some of which are already in clinical use. These data suggest that ferroptosis sits at the interface of cell death and inflammation, and inhibition of this process in microglia and other brain cells may provide new ways for treating neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "ScopeGarlic is a source of bioactive phytonutrients that may have anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory properties. The mechanism(s) underlying the bioactivity of these compounds and their ability to regulate responses to enteric infections remains unclear.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe investigated if a garlic-derived preparation (PTSO-PTS) containing two organosulfur metabolites, propyl-propane thiosulfonate (PTSO) and propyl-propane thiosulfinate (PTS), regulated inflammatory responses in murine macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in vitro, as well as in a model of enteric parasite-induced inflammation. PTSO-PTS decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of TNF, IL-6 and IL-27 in macrophages. RNA-sequencing demonstrated that PTSO-PTS strongly suppressed pathways related to immune and inflammatory signaling. PTSO-PTS induced the expression of a number of genes involved in antioxidant responses in IEC during exposure to antigens from the parasite Trichuris muris. In vivo, PTSO-PTS did not affect T. muris establishment or intestinal T-cell responses but significantly altered caecal transcriptomic responses. Notably, a reduction in T. muris-induced expression of Tnf, Saa2 and Nos2 was observed.\n\nConclusionGarlic-derived organosulfur compounds exert anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages and IEC, and regulate gene expression during intestinal infection. These compounds and related organic molecules may thus hold potential as functional food components to improve gut health in humans and animals.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and TLR ligands mobilize antitumor responses by NK cells and T cells, potentially serving as complementary therapies to immune checkpoint therapy. In the clinic thus far, however, CDN therapy has yielded mixed results, perhaps because it initiates responses potently, but does not provide signals to sustain activation and proliferation of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes. To improve efficacy, we combined CDNs with a half-life extended IL-2 superkine, H9-MSA. CDN/H9-MSA therapy induced dramatic long-term remissions of the most difficult-to-treat MHC I-deficient and MHC I+ tumor transplant models. H9-MSA combined with CpG oligonucleotide also induced potent responses. Mechanistically, tumor elimination required CD8 T cells and not NK cells in the case of MHC I+ tumors and NK cells but not CD8 T cells in the case of MHC-deficient tumors. Furthermore, combination therapy resulted in more prolonged and more intense NK cell activation, cytotoxicity and expression of cytotoxic effector molecules in comparison to monotherapy. Remarkably, in a primary autochthonous sarcoma model that is refractory to PD-1 checkpoint therapy, the combination of CDN/H9-MSA combined with checkpoint therapy yielded long-term remissions in the majority of animals, mediated by T cells and NK cells. This novel combination therapy has potential to activate responses in tumors resistant to current therapies and prevent MHC I-loss accompanying acquired resistance of tumors to checkpoint therapy.\n\nOne sentence summaryPowerful immunotherapy effects mediated by the combination of innate agonists and superkine.",

    "abstract": "Besides its functions in the skeletomuscular system, vitamin D also promotes protective immunity against viral pathogens. Viral sensing by mammalian cells triggers nuclear activation of RelA/NF-{kappa}B and IRF3 factors, which collaborate in mediating the early induction of antiviral type 1 interferons (T1-IFNs). Autocrine T1-IFN signaling further accumulates otherwise negligibly expressed IRF7 in virus-infected cells that then sustains T1-IFN production in a positive feedback. Surprisingly, prior cell-culture studies revealed that vitamin D actually suppresses signal-induced RelA activation. Indeed, it remains unclear how vitamin D limits viral multiplication in a cell-autonomous manner. Here, we examined the role of vitamin D in controlling cellular infections by the Chandipura virus (CHPV), a cytoplasmic RNA virus implicated in human epidemics. We found that vitamin D conditioning produced an altered cell state less permissive for CHPV multiplication because of the heightened expression of T1-IFNs. It is thought that viruses also induce a distinct RelB/NF-{kappa}B activity, which counteracts RelA-driven T1-IFN expressions in infected cells. Our analyses instead characterized a basal nuclear RelB activity, which was downregulated upon vitamin D-mediated suppression of RelB synthesis. Interestingly, this vitamin D-RelB pathway provoked IRF7-mediated positive autoregulation augmenting constitutive T1-IFN expressions even in the absence of viral infections. Accordingly, RelB deficiency rendered redundant, while IRF7 depletion abrogated antiviral vitamin D actions. In sum, our study suggests that the homeostatic state of the signaling circuitry comprising of the NF-{kappa}B and T1-IFN pathways connects micronutrients to antiviral immunity at the cellular level.\n\nSignificance statementVitamin D limits viral infections, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Linking micronutrients to antiviral immunity, Ratra et al. characterize an immune signaling circuitry engaged by vitamin D that generates a cellular state less permissive to infections by Chandipura virus, a pathogen of public health importance.",

    "abstract": "Germinal centres (GC) are lymphoid structures where vaccine-responding B cells acquire affinity-enhancing somatic hypermutations (SHM), with surviving clones differentiating into memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs)1-4. Induction of the latter is a hallmark of durable immunity after vaccination5. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces a robust GC response in humans6-8, but the maturation dynamics of GC B cells and propagation of their progeny throughout the B cell diaspora have not been elucidated. Here we show that anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-binding GC B cells were detectable in draining lymph nodes for at least six months in 10 out of 15 individuals who had received two doses of BNT162b2, a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Six months after vaccination, circulating S-binding MBCs were detected in all participants (n=42) and S-specific IgG-secreting BMPCs were detected in 9 out of 11 participants. Using a combined approach of single-cell RNA sequencing of responding blood and lymph node B cells from eight participants and expression of the corresponding monoclonal antibodies, we tracked the evolution of 1540 S-specific B cell clones. SHM accumulated along the B cell differentiation trajectory, with early blood plasmablasts showing the lowest frequencies, followed by MBCs and lymph node plasma cells whose SHM largely overlapped with GC B cells. By three months after vaccination, the frequency of SHM within GC B cells had doubled. Strikingly, S+ BMPCs detected six months after vaccination accumulated the highest level of SHM, corresponding with significantly enhanced anti-S polyclonal antibody avidity in blood at that time point. This study documents the induction of affinity-matured BMPCs after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in humans, providing a foundation for the sustained high efficacy observed with these vaccines.",

GapMind includes 62 compounds and identifies potential transporters and enzymes by their similarity to experimentally-characterized proteins. To improve GapMinds coverage, we used high-throughput genetic data from 29 bacteria and systematically examined the gaps. We identified novel pathways or enzymes for the utilization of glucosamine, citrulline, myo-inositol, lactose, and phenylacetate, and we annotated 299 diverged enzymes and transporters. We also curated 125 proteins from published reports. For the 29 bacteria with genetic data, GapMind finds high-confidence paths for 85% of utilized carbon sources. In diverse bacteria and archaea, 38% of utilized carbon sources have high-confidence paths, which was improved from 27% by incorporating the fitness-based annotations and our curation. GapMind for carbon sources is available as a web server (http://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/carbon) and takes just 30 seconds for the typical genome.",

    "abstract": "Signalling through TNFR1 modulates proinflammatory gene transcription and programmed cell death, and its impairment causes autoimmune diseases and cancer. NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) was recently identified as a critical suppressor of proinflammatory cytokine production1, whose mode of action remained unknown. Here, we show that N4BP1 is a novel linear ubiquitin reader that negatively regulates NF{kappa}B signalling by its unique dimerizationdependent ubiquitin-binding module that we named LUBIN. Dimeric N4BP1 strategically positions two non-selective ubiquitin-binding domains to ensure exclusive recognition of linear ubiquitin. Under proinflammatory conditions, N4BP1 is recruited to the nascent TNFR1 signalling complex, where it regulates duration of proinflammatory signalling in LUBIN-dependent manner. N4BP1 deficiency accelerates TNF-induced cell death by increasing complex II assembly. Under proapoptotic conditions, Caspase-8 mediates proteolytic processing of N4BP1 and the resulting cleavage fragment of N4BP1, which retains the ability to bind linear ubiquitin, is rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome, accelerating apoptosis. In summary, our findings demonstrate that N4BP1 dimerization creates a unique linear ubiquitin reader that ensures timely and coordinated regulation of TNFR1-mediated inflammation and cell death.",

In a reaction depending on the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA, the reconstituted system cleaves pre-mRNA at a single preferred site corresponding to the one used in vivo. Among the proteins, Cleavage Factor I stimulates cleavage but is not essential, consistent with its prominent role in alternative polyadenylation. RBBP6 is required, structural data showing it to contact and presumably activate the endonuclease CPSF73 through its DWNN domain. The C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is dispensable.

    "abstract": "Galactose is a ubiquitous monosaccharide with important yet incompletely understood nutritive and physiological roles. Chronic parenteral D-galactose administration is used for modeling aging-related pathophysiological processes in rodents due to its ability to induce oxidative stress (OS). Conversely, chronic oral D-galactose administration prevents and alleviates cognitive decline in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimers disease indicating galactose may exert beneficial health effects by acting in the gut. The present aim was to explore acute time-response of intestinal redox homeostasis following oral administration of D-galactose. Male Wistar rats were euthanized at baseline (n=6), 30 (n=6), 60 (n=6), and 120 (n=6) minutes following orogastric administration of D-galactose (200 mg/kg). The overall reductive capacity, lipid peroxidation, the concentration of low molecular weight thiols (LMWT) and protein sulfhydryls (SH), the activity of Mn and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (SOD), reduced and oxidized fractions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH/NADP), and hydrogen peroxide dissociation rate were analyzed in duodenum and ileum. Acute oral administration of D-galactose increased the activity of SODs and decreased intestinal lipid peroxidation and nucleophilic substrates (LMWT, SH, NADPH) indicating activation of peroxidative damage defense pathways. The redox system of the small intestine can acutely tolerate even high luminal concentrations of galactose (0.55 M) and oral galactose treatment is associated with a reduction rather than the increment of the intestinal OS. The ability of oral D-galactose to modulate intestinal OS should be further explored in the context of intestinal barrier maintenance, and beneficial cognitive effects associated with long-term administration of low doses of D-galactose.",

Here we show that Csx28, of Type VI-B2 systems, forms membrane pore structures to slow cellular metabolism upon viral infection, and this activity drastically increases anti-viral defense. High- resolution cryo-EM reveals that Csx28 exists unexpectedly as a detergent-encapsulated octameric pore, and we then show these Csx28 pores are membrane localized in vivo. Activation of Csx28 in vivo strictly requires sequence-specific recognition of viral mRNAs by Cas13b, and this activation results in Csx28-mediated membrane depolarization, slowed metabolism, and inhibition of sustained viral infection. Together, our work reveals an unprecedented mechanism by which Csx28 acts as a downstream, Cas13b-activated, effector protein that uses membrane perturbation as an anti-viral defense strategy.",

    "abstract": "Annexins (ANXs) are a family of peripheral membrane binding proteins which play a vital role in the maintenance and function of cellular membranes. These proteins are known to be part of the plasma membrane repair machinery where they are known to bind to negatively charged lipids in the cell membrane in a calcium dependent manner. The shape of the plasma membrane is known to be a regulator of protein density and thereby affects several biological functions of the cell such as exo-and endocytosis, cell motility, immune responses and also membrane repair. Membrane deformation and curvature sensing by proteins is a well described phenomenon which can assist in recruitment of specific proteins to certain regions in the cell and facilitate membrane bending. Following ruptures in the plasma membrane, calcium influx assist in the association of ANXs with the membrane around the ruptured area. Due to the expected increase in curvature at the damaged membrane site, it has been suggested that both membrane curvature and Ca2+ participate in the recruitment of ANXs. We have investigated the curvature sensing of ANXA4 in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) by pulling high curvature membrane tethers from the vesicle surface using optical tweezers showing that ANXA4 recruitment increases with higher membrane curvature. We also describe an assay for determining protein density on the plasma membrane by utilizing ANXA4s property as a calcium dependent membrane binding protein. This new assay allows us to investigate the effect of protein density on curvature sensing.",

We examined the motility of early endosomes and lysosomes in cells expressing wild-type (WT) tau and phosphomimetic Y18E tau. Lysosome motility is strongly inhibited by tau. Y18E tau preferentially inhibits lysosomes in the cell periphery, while centrally located lysosomes are less affected. Early endosomes are more sensitive to tau than lysosomes, and are inhibited by both WT and Y18E tau. Our results show that different cargoes have disparate responses to tau, likely governed by the types of kinesin motors driving their transport. In support of this model, kinesin-1 and -3 are strongly inhibited by tau while kinesin-2 and dynein are less affected. In contrast to kinesin-1, we find that kinesin-3 is strongly inhibited by phosphorylated tau.",

    "abstract": "The ParABS system plays an essential role in prokaryotic chromosome segregation. After loading at the parS site on the genome, ParB proteins rapidly redistribute to distances of ~15 kb away from the loading site. It has remained puzzling how this large-distance spreading can occur along DNA that is loaded with hundreds of proteins. Using single-molecule in vitro visualization, we here show that, unexpectedly, ParB can load onto DNA independently and distantly of parS, whereby loaded ParB molecules are themselves able to recruit additional ParB proteins from bulk. Strikingly, this recruitment can occur in-cis but also in-trans whereby, at low tensions within the DNA, newly recruited ParB can bypass roadblocks as it gets loaded to spatially proximal but genomically distant DNA regions. The data are supported by Molecular Dynamics simulations which also show that cooperative ParB-ParB recruitment enhances spreading. ParS-independent recruitment explains how ParB can cover substantial genomic distance during chromosome segregation which is vital for the bacterial cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis or programmed cell death plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and, therefore, is a tightly regulated process. Deregulation of apoptosis signalling can favour carcinogenesis. Apoptosis inhibitor 5 (Api5), an inhibitor of apoptosis, is upregulated in cancers. Interestingly, Api5 is shown to regulate both apoptosis and cell proliferation. To address the precise functional significance of Api5 in carcinogenesis here we investigate the role of Api5 in breast carcinogenesis.\n\nConsistently, in-silico analysis revealed elevated levels of Api5 transcript in breast cancer patients which correlated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of Api5 in non-tumorigenic breast acinar cultures resulted in increased proliferation and cells exhibited a partial EMT-like phenotype with higher migratory potential and disruption in cell polarity. Furthermore, during acini development, the influence of Api5 is mediated via the combined action of FGF2 activated PDK1-Akt/cMYC signalling and Ras-ERK pathways. Conversely, Api5 knock-down downregulated FGF2 signalling leading to reduced proliferation and diminished in vivo tumorigenic potential of the breast cancer cells. Thus, taken together, our study identifies Api5 as a central player involved in regulating multiple events during breast carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that various cancers can gain resistance to targeted therapies by acquiring lineage plasticity. Although various genomic and transcriptomic aberrations correlate with lineage plasticity-driven resistance, the molecular mechanisms of acquiring lineage plasticity have not been fully elucidated. Through integrated transcriptomic and single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis of more than 80,000 cells, we reveal for the first time that the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling is a crucial executor in promoting lineage plasticity-driven AR targeted therapy resistance in prostate cancer. Ectopic activation of JAK-STAT signaling is specifically required for the AR targeted therapy resistance of subclones expressing multilineage, stem-like and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lineage transcriptional programs and represents a potential therapeutic target for overcoming AR targeted therapy resistance.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryJAK-STAT signaling is a crucial executor in promoting lineage plasticity-driven AR therapy resistance in prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Adapted plant pathogenic fungi deacetylate chitin to chitosan to avoid host perception and disarm the chitin-triggered plant immunity. Whether plants have evolved factors to counteract this fungal evasion mechanism in the plant-pathogen interface remains obscure. Here, we decipher the underlying mechanism of maize cysteine-rich receptor-like secreted proteins (CRRSPs)-AFP1, which exhibits mannose-binding dependent antifungal activity. AFP1 initials the action by binding to specific sites on the surface of yeast-like cells, filaments, and germinated spores of the biotrophic fungi Ustilago maydis. This could result in fungal cell growth and cell budding inhibition, delaying spore germination and subsequently reducing fungal viability in a mannose-binding dependence manner. The antifungal activity of AFP1 is conferred by its interaction with the PMT-dependent mannosylated chitin deacetylases (CDAs) and interfering with the conversion of chitin. Our finding that AFP1 targets CDAs from pathogenic fungi and nonpathogenic budding yeast suggests a potential application of the CRRSP in combating fungal diseases and reducing threats posed by the fungal kingdom.",

    "abstract": "Glutamine amidotransferase-1 domain-containing AraC-family transcriptional regulators (GATRs) are present in the genomes of many bacteria, including all Pseudomonas species. The involvement of several characterized GATRs in amine-containing compound metabolism has been determined, but the full scope of GATR ligands and regulatory networks are still unknown. Here, we characterize Pseudomonas putidas detection of the animal-derived amine compound, creatine, a compound particularly enriched in muscle and ciliated cells by a creatine-specific GATR, PP_3665, here named CahR (Creatine amidohydrolase Regulator). cahR is necessary for transcription of the gene encoding creatinase (PP_3667/creA) in the presence of creatine and is critical for P. putidas ability to utilize creatine as a sole source of nitrogen. The CahR/creatine regulon is small and electrophoretic mobility shift demonstrates strong and specific CahR binding only at the creA promoter, supporting the conclusion that much of the regulon is dependent on downstream metabolites. Phylogenetic analysis of creA orthologs associated with cahR orthologs highlights a strain distribution and organization supporting likely horizontal gene transfer, particularly evident within the genus Acinetobacter. This study identifies and characterizes the GATR that transcriptionally controls P. putida metabolism of creatine, broadening the scope of known GATR ligands and suggesting GATR diversification during evolution of metabolism for aliphatic nitrogen compounds.",

TCDD induces hepatic fat accumulation and increases levels of secondary bile acids including taurolithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid, microbial modified bile acids involved in host bile acid regulation signaling pathways. To investigate the effects of TCDD on the gut microbiota, cecum contents of male C57BL/6 mice orally gavaged with sesame oil vehicle or 0.3, 3, or 30 {micro}g/kg TCDD were examined using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Taxonomic analysis identified dose-dependent increases in Lactobacillus species (i.e., Lactobacillus reuteri). Increased species were also associated with dose-dependent increases in bile salt hydrolase sequences, responsible for deconjugation reactions in secondary bile acid metabolism. Increased L. reuteri levels were further associated with mevalonate-dependent isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) biosynthesis and menaquinone biosynthesis genes. Analysis of gut microbiomes from cirrhosis patients identified increased abundance of these pathways as identified in the mouse cecum metagenomic analysis. These results extend the association of lactobacilli with the AhR/intestinal axis in NAFLD progression and highlight the similarities between TCDD-elicited phenotypes in mice to human NAFLD.",

Although a limited amount of APMV-1 strains in urban areas have been characterized, the role of the urban wild bird population as an APMV-1 reservoir is unclear. Since urban birds may have an important role for long-term circulation of the virus, fecal and swab samples were collected by community scientists from wild birds in New York City (NYC), New York, United States. These samples were screened for APMV-1 and genotypically characterized by sequencing of the complete genome. A total of 885 samples were collected from NYC parks and from a local wildlife rehabilitation clinic from October 2020 through June 2021. Eight birds (1.1 %) screened positive for the APMV-1 nucleoprotein gene by conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and two live viruses were isolated via egg culture. The F protein cleavage site, an indicator of pathogenicity, was present in the two samples fully sequenced by next generation sequencing, and positioned 112R R K K R F117. Phylogenetic analysis of the F gene coding sequence classified both isolates into genotype VI, a diverse and predominant genotype responsible for NDV outbreaks in pigeon and dove species worldwide.\n\nImportanceHere we describe the first large-scale effort to screen for APMV-1 in New York Citys wild bird population as part of the New York City Virus Hunters program, a community science initiative. We have characterized two isolates of NDV, with phylogenetic analyses suggesting diversity in established and circulating strains of pigeon paramyxoviruses. Our isolates are also domestic reference strains for future APMV-1 vaccine developments.

In recent work we found that SPEN has an additional role in correct localisation of Xist RNA in cis, indicating that its contribution to chromatin-mediated gene silencing needs to be reappraised. Making use of a SPEN separation-of-function mutation we show that SPEN and Polycomb pathways in fact function in parallel to establish gene silencing.

It is unclear, however, how they perform relative to each other in explaining chromatin architecture data and whether they compete or co-exist at the single-molecule level. Here, we compare models of polymer physics based on loop-extrusion and phase-separation, as well as models where both mechanisms act simultaneously in a single molecule, against multiplexed FISH data available in human loci in IMR90 and HCT116 cells. We find that the different models recapitulate bulk Hi-C and average microscopy data. Single-molecule chromatin conformations are also well captured, especially by phase-separation based models that better reflect the experimentally reported segregation in globules of the considered genomic loci and their cell-to-cell structural variability. Such a variability is consistent with two main concurrent causes: single-cell epigenetic heterogeneity and an intrinsic thermodynamic conformational degeneracy of folding. Overall, the model combining loop-extrusion and polymer phase-separation provides a very good description of the data, particularly higher-order contacts, showing that the two mechanisms can co-exist in shaping chromatin architecture in single cells.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents in ano-genital and oral cancers; HPV16 is the most prevalent type detected in human cancers. The HPV16 E6 protein targets p53 for proteasomal degradation to facilitate proliferation of the HPV16 infected cell. However, in HPV16 immortalized cells E6 is predominantly spliced (E6*) and unable to degrade p53. Here we demonstrate that human foreskin keratinocytes immortalized by HPV16 (HFK+HPV16), and HPV16 positive oropharyngeal cancers, retain significant expression of p53. In addition, p53 levels can be increased in HPV16+ head and neck cancer cell lines following treatment with cisplatin. Introduction of full-length E6 into HFK+HPV16 resulted in attenuation of cellular growth (in hTERT immortalized HFK, E6 expression promoted enhanced proliferation). An understudied interaction is that between E2 and p53 and we investigated whether this was important for the viral life cycle. We generated mutant genomes with E2 unable to interact with p53 resulting in profound phenotypes in primary HFK. The mutant induced hyper-proliferation, but an ultimate arrest of cell growth; {beta}-galactosidase staining demonstrated increased senescence, and COMET assays showed increased DNA damage compared with HFK+HPV16 wild type cells. There was failure of the viral life cycle in organotypic rafts with the mutant HFK resulting in premature differentiation and reduced proliferation. The results indicate that the E2-p53 interaction is critical during the HPV16 life cycle, and that disruption of this interaction has anti-viral potential. We discuss potential mechanisms to explain these phenotypes.\n\nImportanceHuman papillomaviruses are causative agents in around 5% of all cancers. There are currently no antivirals available to combat these infections and cancers, therefore it remains a priority to enhance our understanding of the HPV life cycle. Here we demonstrate that an interaction between the viral replication/transcription/segregation factor E2 and the tumor suppressor p53 is critical for the HPV16 life cycle. HPV16 immortalized cells retain significant expression of p53, and the critical role for the E2-p53 interaction demonstrates why this is the case. If the E2-p53 interaction is disrupted then HPV16 immortalized cells fail to proliferate, have enhanced DNA damage and senescence, and there is premature differentiation during the viral life cycle. Results suggest that targeting the E2-p53 interaction would have therapeutic benefits, potentially attenuating the spread of HPV16.",

This intron retention (IR) event was previously attributed to altered secondary structure that sequesters the normal splice donor site. We propose an alternative mechanism: that the mutation introduces a cryptic splice donor site that interferes with function of the annotated site to favor IR. We evaluated both models using minigene splicing reporters engineered to vary in secondary structure and/or cryptic splice site content. Analysis of reporter splicing efficiency in transfected K562 cells suggested that the mutation-generated internal splice site was sufficient to induce substantial IR. Mutations predicted to vary secondary structure at the annotated site had modest effects on IR, and also shifted the balance of residual splicing between the cryptic site and annotated site, supporting competition between the sites. Further studies demonstrated that introduction of cryptic splice donor motifs at other positions in E44 did not promote IR, indicating that interference with the annotated site is context-dependent. We conclude that mutant deep exon splice sites can interfere with proper splicing by inducing IR.",

    "abstract": "3-end processing of most human mRNAs is carried out by the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF; CPF in yeast). Endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent pre-mRNA defines the 3-end of the mature transcript, which is important for mRNA localization, translation and stability. Cleavage must therefore be tightly regulated. Here, we reconstitute specific and efficient 3-endonuclease activity of human CPSF with purified proteins. This requires the sevensubunit CPSF as well as three additional protein factors: cleavage stimulatory factor (CStF), cleavage factor IIm (CFIIm) and, importantly, the multi-domain protein RBBP6. Unlike its yeast homologue Mpe1, which is a stable subunit of CPF, RBBP6 does not copurify with CPSF and is recruited in an RNA-dependent manner. Sequence and mutational analyses suggest that RBBP6 interacts with the WDR33 and CPSF73 subunits of CPSF. Thus, it is likely that the role of RBBP6 is conserved from yeast to human. Overall, our data are consistent with CPSF endonuclease activation and site-specific pre-mRNA cleavage being highly controlled to maintain fidelity in RNA processing.",

    "abstract": "Prime editing enables the introduction of precise point mutations, small insertions, or short deletions without requiring donor DNA templates. However, efficiency remains a key challenge in a broad range of human cell types. In this work, we designed a robust coselection strategy through coediting of the ubiquitous and essential sodium/potassium pump (Na+/K+ ATPase). We readily engineered highly modified pools of cells and clones with homozygous modifications for functional studies with minimal pegRNA optimization. This process revealed that nicking the non-edited strand stimulates multiallelic editing but often generates tandem duplications and large deletions at the target site, an outcome dictated by the relative orientation of the protospacer adjacent motifs. Our approach streamlines the production of cell lines with multiple genetic modifications to create cellular models for biological research and lays the foundation for the development of cell-type specific coselection strategies.",

    "abstract": "Genome stability requires complete DNA duplication exactly once before cell division. In eukaryotes, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) plays a dual role in this regulation by inhibiting helicase loading factors before also activating origin firing. CDK activates initiation by phosphorylation of two substrates, Sld2 and Sld3, forming a transient and limiting intermediate - the pre-initiation complex (pre-IC). The importance and mechanism of dissociation of the pre-IC from origins is not understood. Here we show in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that CDK phosphorylation of Sld3 and Sld2 is specifically and rapidly turned over during interphase by the PP2A and PP4 phosphatases. Inhibiting dephosphorylation of Sld3/Sld2 causes dramatic defects in replication initiation genome-wide, retention of the pre-IC at origins and cell death. These studies not only provide a mechanism to guarantee that Sld3 and Sld2 are dephosphorylated before helicase loading factors but also uncover a novel positive role for phosphatases in eukaryotic origin firing.",

    "abstract": "The targeted deletion, replacement, integration, or inversion of DNA sequences at specified locations in the genome could be used to study or treat many human genetic diseases. Here, we describe twin prime editing (twinPE), a method for the programmable replacement or excision of DNA sequence at endogenous human genomic sites without requiring double-strand DNA breaks. TwinPE uses a prime editor (PE) protein and two prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) that template the synthesis of complementary DNA flaps on opposing strands of genomic DNA, resulting in the replacement of endogenous DNA sequence between the PE-induced nick sites with pegRNA-encoded sequences. We show that twinPE in human cells can perform precise deletions of at least 780 bp and precise replacements of genomic DNA sequence with new sequences of at least 108 bp. By combining single or multiplexed twinPE with site-specific serine recombinases either in separate steps or in a single step, we demonstrate targeted integration of gene-sized DNA plasmids (>5,000 bp) into safe-harbor loci including AAVS1, CCR5, and ALB in human cells. To our knowledge, these results represent the first RNA-programmable insertion of gene-sized DNA sequences into targeted genomic sites of unmodified human cells without requiring double-strand breaks or homology-directed repair. Twin PE combined with recombinases also mediated a 40,167-bp inversion at IDS that corrects a common Hunter syndrome allele. TwinPE expands the capabilities of precision gene editing without requiring double-strand DNA breaks and synergizes with other tools to enable the correction or complementation of large or complex pathogenic alleles in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Conservation of Arctic fish species is challenging partly due to our limited ability to track fish through time and space, which constrains our understanding of life history diversity and lifelong habitat use. Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus) is an important subsistence species for Alaskas Arctic Indigenous communities, yet little is known about life history diversity, migration patterns, and freshwater habitat use. Using laser ablation Sr isotope otolith microchemistry, we analyzed Colville River Broad Whitefish 87Sr/86Sr chronologies (n = 61) to reconstruct movements and habitat use across the lives of individual fish. We found evidence of at least six life history types, including three anadromous types, one semi-anadromous type, and two nonanadromous types. Anadromous life history types comprised a large proportion of individuals sampled (collectively, 59%) and most of these (59%) migrated to sea between ages 0-2 and spent varying durations at sea. The semi-anadromous life history type comprised 28% of samples and entered marine habitat as larvae. Nonanadromous life history types comprised the remainder (collectively, 13%). Otolith 87Sr/86Sr data from juvenile and adult freshwater stages suggest that habitat use changed in association with age, seasons, and life history strategies. This information on Broad Whitefish life histories and habitat use across time and space will help managers and conservation planners better understand the risks of anthropogenic impacts and help conserve this vital subsistence resource.",

    "abstract": "Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal cellular states (EMT/MET) contribute to cancer progression. We hypothesize that EMT followed by MET promotes cell population heterogeneity favouring tumour growth. We developed an EMT model by on/off exposure of epithelial EpH4 cells (E-cells) to TGF{beta}1 that mimics phenotypic EMT (M-cells) and MET. We aimed at understanding whether phenotypic MET is accompanied by molecular and functional reversion back to epithelia, by using RNA sequencing, Immunofluorescence (IF), proliferation, wound healing, focus formation and mamosphere formation assays, as well as cell-xenografts in nude mice. Phenotypic reverted-epithelial cells (RE-cells), obtained after MET induction, presented pure epithelial morphology and proliferation rate resembling E-cells. However, RE transcriptomic profile and IF staining of epithelial and mesenchymal markers revealed a unique and heterogeneous mixture of cell-subpopulations, with high self-renewal ability fed by oxidative phosporylation. RE-cells heterogeneity is stably maintained for long periods after TGF{beta}1 removal, both in vitro and in large derived tumours in nude mice. Overall, we show that phenotypic reverted-epithelial cells (RE-cells) do not return to the molecular and functional epithelial state, present mesenchymal features related with aggressiveness and cellular heterogeneity that favour tumour growth in vivo. This work strengthens epithelial cells reprogramming and cellular heterogeneity fostered by inflammatory cues as a tumour-growth promoting factor in vivo.",
