    "abstract": "Glycosylation plays a critical role during inflammation and glial scar formation upon spinal cord injury (SCI) disease progression. Astrocytes and microglia are involved in this cascade to modulate the inflammation and tissue remodelling from acute to chronic phases. Therefore, understating the glycan changes in these glial cells is paramount. Herein a lectin microarray was undertaken using a cytokine-driven inflammatory MGC model, revealing considerable differential glycosylation from the acute to the chronic phase in a cytokine-combination generated inflamed MGC model. It was found that several N- and O-linked glycans associated with glia during SCI were differentially regulated. Pearsons correlation hierarchical clustering showed that groups were separated into several clusters, illustrating the heterogenicity among the control, cytokine combination, and LPS treated groups and the day on which treatment was given. Control and LPS treatments were observed to be in dense clusters. This was further confirmed with lectin immunostaining in which GalNAc, GlcNAc, mannose, fucose and sialic acid-binding residues were detected in astrocytes and microglia. However, this modification (upregulation of sialic acid expression) was inhibited by the sialyltransferase inhibitor which indeed modulates the mitochondrial functions. The present study is the first functional investigation of glycosylation modulation in a MGC (MGC) model which elucidates the role of the glycome in neuroinflammation and identified potential therapeutic targets for future glycol-therapeutics in neuroinflammation",

    "abstract": "Current theories of perception suggest that the brain represents features of the world as probability distributions, but can such uncertain foundations provide the basis for everyday vision? Perceiving objects and scenes requires knowing not just how features (e.g., colors) are distributed but also where they are and which other features they are combined with. Using a Bayesian computational model, we recover probabilistic representations used by human observers to search for odd stimuli among distractors. Importantly, we found that the brain integrates information between feature dimensions and spatial locations, leading to more precise representations compared to when information integration is not possible. We also uncover representational asymmetries and biases, showing their spatial organization and arguing against simplified \"summary statistics\" accounts. Our results confirm that probabilistically encoded visual features are bound with other features and to particular locations, proving how probabilistic representations can be a foundation for higher-level vision.",

    "abstract": "In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, the initiation of DNA replication occurs asynchronously throughout S-phase according to a regulated replication timing program. Here, using Xenopus egg extracts, we showed that Yap (Yes-associated protein 1), a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, is required for the control of DNA replication dynamics. We found that Yap is recruited to chromatin at the start of DNA replication and that Yap depletion accelerates DNA replication dynamics by increasing the number of activated replication origins. Furthermore, we identified Rif1, a major regulator of the DNA replication timing program, as a novel Yap binding protein. In Xenopus embryos, using a Trim-Away approach during cleavage stages devoid of transcription, we found that both Yap and Rif1 depletion trigger an acceleration of cell divisions, suggesting a shorter S-phase by alterations of the replication program. Finally, our data show that Rif1 knockdown leads to defects in the partitioning of early versus late replication foci in retinal stem cells, as we previously showed for Yap. Altogether, our findings unveil a non-transcriptional role for Yap in regulating replication dynamics. We propose that Yap and Rif1 function as breaks to control the DNA replication program in early embryos and post-embryonic stem cells.\n\nHighlightsO_LIYap is recruited to chromatin during DNA replication dependent on pre-replicative complex assembly.\nC_LIO_LIYap controls DNA replication dynamics by limiting origin firing.\nC_LIO_LIThe replication timing regulatory factor 1, Rif1, is a novel Yap binding-partner.\nC_LIO_LIBoth Yap and Rif1 regulate the length of the first embryonic cell cycles.\nC_LIO_LILike Yap, Rif1 controls retinal stem cell DNA replication timing.\nC_LI",

Here we present DeepProjection, a trainable projection algorithm based on deep learning. This algorithm rapidly and robustly extracts image content contained in curved manifolds from time-lapse recorded 3D image stacks by binary masking of background content, stack by stack. The masks calculated for a given movie, when predicted, e.g., on fluorescent cell boundaries on one channel, can subsequently be applied to project other fluorescent channels from the same manifold. We apply DeepProjection to follow the dynamic movements of 2D-tissue sheets in embryonic development.

    "abstract": "There is growing recognition that interactions between species pairs are modified in a multispecies context by the density of a third species. However, how these higher-order interactions (HOIs) affect species persistence remains poorly understood. To explore the effect of HOIs steaming from multiple trophic layers on plant persistence, we experimentally built a mutualistic system containing three plants and three pollinators species with two contrasting network structures. For both structures, we first estimated the statistically supported HOIs on plant species, in addition to the pairwise interactions among plants and plant-pollinators. Following a structuralist approach, we then assessed the effects of the supported HOIs on the persistence probability of each of the three competing plant species and their combinations. HOIs produced substantial effects on the strength and sign of per capita interactions between plant species to such an extent that predictions of species persistence differ from a non-HOIs scenario. Changes in network structure due to removing a plant-pollinator link further modulated the species persistence probabilities by reorganizing per capita interaction strengths of both pairwise interactions and HOIs. Our study provides empirical evidence of the joint importance of HOIs and network structure for determining the probability of species to persist within diverse communities.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism is essential for cell function and adaptation. Because of their central role in metabolism, kinetic parameters and enzyme concentrations are under constant selective pressure to adapt the fluxes of the metabolic networks to the needs of the organism. In the line of various studies dealing with enzyme evolution, we recently developed a model of evolution of enzyme concentrations under selection for increased flux, considered as a proxy of fitness (Coton et al. 2021). Taking into account two realistic cellular constraints, competition for resources and co-regulations, we determined the evolutionary equilibria and the ranges of neutral variations of enzyme concentrations. In this article, we give more generality to this model, by considering that the enzymes of a pathway can belong to different groups of co-regulation. We determined the equilibria and showed that the constraints modify the adaptive landscape by limiting the number of independent dimensions. We also showed that any trade-off between enzyme concentration is sufficient to limit the flux and to relax selection for increasing other enzyme concentrations. Even though the model is based on simplifying assumptions, the complexity of the relationship between enzyme concentrations prevents the analysis of selective neutrality.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum causes serious malaria symptoms; when this protozoan parasite infects human erythrocytes, it produces and secretes large amounts of histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) into human blood. Thus, PfHRP2 is a well-known diagnostic marker for malaria infection. Here, however, we also identified PfHRP2 as a pathogenic factor produced by P. falciparum. PfHRP2 showed cell penetration and cytotoxicity against various human cells. In particular, PfHRP2 showed significant cytotoxicity over 5 days at the same concentration as in P. falciparum-infected patients blood (90-100 nM). This result is consistent with the mortality rate of P. falciparum malaria, which increases rapidly in untreated cases for 3-7 days. In addition, the cell penetration and cytotoxicity of PfHRP2 increased 2.5- and 2.6-fold, respectively, in the absence of serum, which suggests that low serum protein concentrations (occurring during malnutrition, for example) increase the risk of adverse effects from PfHRP2 (consistent with malnutrition increasing the lethality of malaria infection). We also showed that PfHRP2 bound to Ca2+ ions, localized to intracellular lysosomes, increased lysosomal Ca2+ levels, and inhibited the basal level of autophagy by inhibiting autolysosome formation. Furthermore, the Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity of PfHRP2 was suppressed by the metal ion chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). In summary, our findings suggest that PfHRP2 acts as a pathogenic factor in P. falciparum-infected patients and is associated with the exacerbation of malaria. Furthermore, EDTA is a promising candidate as a therapeutic agent for the suppression of PfHRP2 pathogenicity. Overall, this study provides new insights into P. falciparum malaria pathogenesis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) using an antibody conjugated to a near infrared dye IR700 is achieving significant success in target-specific elimination of cells. Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP-) is an important target in cancer because of its expression by cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as by some cancer cells. CAFs that express FAP- have protumorigenic and immune suppressive functions. Using immunohistochemistry of human breast cancer tissue microarrays, we identified an increase of FAP-+ CAFs in invasive breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. We found FAP- expression increased in fibroblasts co-cultured with cancer cells. In proof-of-principle studies, we engineered human FAP- overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and HT-1080 cancer cells and murine FAP- overexpressing NIH-3T3 fibroblasts to evaluate several anti-FAP- antibodies and selected AF3715 based on its high binding-affinity with both human and mouse FAP-. After conjugation of AF3715 with the phthalocyanine dye IR700, the resultant antibody conjugate, FAP--IR700, was evaluated in cells and tumors for its specificity and effectiveness in eliminating FAP- expressing cell populations with PIT. FAP--IR700-PIT resulted in effective FAP--specific cell killing in the engineered cancer cells and in two patient-derived CAFs in a dose-dependent manner. Following an intravenous injection, FAP--IR700 retention was three-fold higher than IgG-IR700 in FAP- overexpressing tumors, and two-fold higher compared to wild-type tumors. FAP--IR700-PIT resulted in significant growth inhibition of tumors derived from FAP- overexpressing human cancer cells. A reduction of endogenous FAP-+ murine CAFs was identified at 7 days after FAP--IR700-PIT. FAP--targeted NIR-PIT presents a promising strategy to eliminate FAP-+ CAFs.",

    "abstract": "Many applications of synthetic biology involve engineering microbial strains to express high-value proteins. Thanks to advances in rapid DNA synthesis and sequencing, deep learning has emerged as a promising approach to build sequence-to-expression models for strain design and optimization. Such models, however, require large amounts of training data that are costly to acquire, which creates substantial entry barriers for many laboratories. Here, we study the relation between model accuracy and data efficiency in a large panel of machine learning models of varied complexity, from penalized linear regressors to deep neural networks. Our analysis is based on data from a large genotype-phenotype screen in Escherichia coli, which was generated with a design-of-experiments approach to balance coverage and depth of the genotypic space. We sampled these data to emulate scenarios with a limited number of DNA sequences for training, as commonly encountered in strain engineering applications. Our results suggest that classic, non-deep, models can achieve good prediction accuracy with much smaller datasets than previously thought, and provide robust evidence that convolutional neural networks further improve performance with the same amount of data. Using methods from Explainable AI and model benchmarking, we show that convolutional neural networks have an improved ability to discriminate between input sequences and extract sequence features that are highly predictive of protein expression. We moreover show that controlled sequence diversity leads to important gains in data efficiency, and validated this principle in a separate genotype-phenotype screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These results provide practitioners with guidelines for designing experimental screens that strike a balance between cost and quality of training data, laying the groundwork for wider adoption of deep learning across the biotechnology sector.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining intracellular homeostases is a hallmark of life, and key physiological variables, such as cytoplasmic pH, osmotic pressure, and proton motive force (PMF), are typically interdependent. Using a mathematical model, we argue that near neutral pH homeostasis implies that cells must export ions other than protons to generate physiological electrical potential across their plasma membrane. For Escherichia coli, proton:ion antiporters are the only known cation efflux pumps, and we therefore predict that principal function of antiporters is to generate an out-of-equilibrium plasma membrane potential and so maintain the PMF at the constant levels observed. Consequently, the strength of the PMF determines the range of extracellular pH over which the cell is able to preserve its near neutral cytoplasmic pH, and the non-zero PMF is needed to maintain membrane potential. In support, we concurrently measure the PMF and cytoplasmic pH in single cells and demonstrate both that decreasing the PMFs strength impairs E. colis ability to maintain its pH and that artificially collapsing the PMF destroys the out-of-equilibrium plasma membrane potential. We further predict the observed ranges of extracellular pH for which three of E. colis antiporters are expressed, through defining their cost by the rate at which they divert protons from being imported to generate ATP. Taken together, our results suggest a new perspective on bacterial electrophysiology, where cells regulate the plasma membrane potential to maintain",

    "abstract": "The ability of the anaerobic gastrointestinal pathogen, Clostridioides difficile, to survive outside the host relies on the formation of dormant endospores. Spore formation is contingent on the activation of a conserved transcription factor, Spo0A, by phosphorylation. Multiple kinases and phosphatases regulate Spo0A activity in other spore-forming organisms; however, these factors are not well conserved in C. difficile. Previously, we discovered that deletion of a conserved phosphotransfer protein, CD1492, increases sporulation, indicating that CD1492 inhibits C. difficile spore formation. In this study, we investigate the functions of additional conserved orphan phosphotransfer proteins, CD2492, CD1579, and CD1949 which are hypothesized to regulate Spo0A phosphorylation. Disruption of the conserved phosphotransfer protein, CD2492, also increased sporulation frequency, similarly to the CD1492 mutant, and in contrast to a previous study. A CD1492 CD2492 mutant phenocopied the sporulation and gene expression patterns of the single mutants, suggesting that these proteins function in the same genetic pathway to repress sporulation. Deletion of the conserved CD1579 phosphotransfer protein also variably increased sporulation frequency; however, knockdown of CD1949 expression did not influence sporulation. We provide evidence that CD1492, CD2492 and CD1579 function as phosphatases, as mutation of the conserved histidine residue for phosphate transfer abolished CD2492 function, and expression of the CD1492 or CD2492 histidine site-directed mutants or the wild-type CD1579 allele in a parent strain resulted in a dominant negative hypersporulation phenotype. Altogether, at least three phosphotransfer proteins, CD1492, CD2492 and CD1579 (herein, PtpA, PtpB and PtpC) repress C. difficile sporulation initiation by regulating activity of Spo0A.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe formation of inactive spores is critical for the long-term survival of the gastrointestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile. The onset of sporulation is controlled by the master regulator of sporulation, Spo0A, which is activated by phosphorylation. Multiple kinases and phosphatases control Spo0A phosphorylation; however, this regulatory pathway is not defined in C. difficile. We show that two conserved phosphotransfer proteins, CD1492 (PtpA) and CD2492 (PtpB), function in the same regulatory pathway to repress sporulation by preventing Spo0A phosphorylation. We show that another conserved phosphotransfer protein, CD1579 (PtpC), also represses sporulation, and we eliminate the possibility that a fourth orphan histidine kinase protein, CD1949, impacts C. difficile sporulation. These results support the idea that C. difficile inhibits sporulation initiation through multiple phosphatases.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial exposure to antibiotic concentrations below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) may result in a selection window allowing for the rapid evolution of resistance. These sub-MIC concentrations are commonly found in the greater environment. This study aimed to evaluate the adaptive genetic changes in Klebsiella pneumoniae 43816 after prolonged but increasing sub-MIC levels of the common antibiotic cephalothin over a fourteen-day period. Over the course of the experiment, antibiotic concentrations increased from 0.5 g/mL to 7.5 g/mL. At the end of this extended exposure, the final adapted bacterial culture exhibited clinical resistance to both cephalothin and tetracycline, altered cellular and colony morphology, and a highly mucoid phenotype. Cephalothin resistance exceeded 125 g/mL without the acquisition of beta-lactamase genes. Whole genome sequencing identified a series of genetic changes that could be mapped over the fourteen-day exposure period to the onset of antibiotic resistance. Specifically, mutations in the rpoB subunit of RNA Polymerase, the tetR/acrR regulator, and the wcaJ sugar transferase each fix at specific timepoints in the exposure regimen where the MIC susceptibility dramatically increases. These mutations indicate that alterations in the secretion of colanic acid and attachment of colonic acid to LPS, may contribute to the resistant phenotype. These data demonstrate that very low, sub-MIC concentrations of antibiotics can have dramatic impacts on the bacterial evolution of resistance. Additionally, this study demonstrates that beta-lactam resistance can be achieved through sequential accumulation of specific mutations without the acquisition of a beta-lactamase gene.\n\nImportanceBacteria are constantly exposed to low levels of antibiotics in the environment. The impact of this low-level exposure on bacterial evolution is not well understood. In this work, we developed a model to expose Klebsiella pneumoniae to progressive, low doses of the antibiotic cephalothin. After a fourteen-day exposure regimen, our culture exhibited full clinical resistance to this antibiotic without the traditional acquisition of inactivating genes. This culture also exhibited resistance to tetracycline, had a highly mucoid appearance, and exhibited altered, elongated cellular morphology. Whole genome sequencing identified a collection of mutations to the bacterial genome that could be mapped to the emergence of the resistant phenotype. This study demonstrates that antibiotic resistance can be achieved in response to low level antibiotic exposure and without the traditional acquisition of resistance genes. Further, this study identifies new genes that may play a role in the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Infections with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) have been reported from various organs ranging from asymptomatic colonization to severe infections and sepsis associated with multiple organ dysfunction. Although considered an extracellular pathogen, S. aureus can invade and persist in professional phagocytes such as monocytes and macrophages. Its capability to persist and manipulate phagocytes is considered a critical step to evade host antimicrobial reactions. For the first time we leveraged a human liver-on-chip model and tailored image analysis algorithms to demonstrate that S. aureus (USA300) specifically targets macrophages in the liver models as essential niche facilitating bacterial persistence and phenotype switching to small colony variants (SCVs). In vitro M2 polarization was found to favor SCV-formation and was associated with increased intracellular bacterial loads in macrophages, increased cell death, and impaired recruitment of circulating monocytes to sites of infection. These findings expand the knowledge about the role of liver macrophages in the course of systemic infection. Further, the results might be relevant for understanding infection mechanisms in patients with chronic liver disease such as fibrosis that display increased frequencies of M2 polarized liver macrophages and have a higher risk for developing chronic infections and relapsing bacteremia.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a remarkable increase in the practicality of sequencing whole genomes from large numbers of bacterial isolates. The availability of this data has huge potential to deliver new insights into the evolution and epidemiology of bacterial pathogens, but the scalability of the analytical methodology has been lagging behind that of the sequencing technology. Here we present a step-by-step approach for such large-scale genomic epidemiology analyses, from bacterial genomes to epidemiological interpretations. A central component of this approach is the dated phylogeny, which is a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths measured in units of time. The construction of dated phylogenies from bacterial genomic data needs to account for the disruptive effect of recombination on phylogenetic relationships, and we describe how this can be achieved. Dated phylogenies can then be used to perform fine-scale or large-scale epidemiological analyses, depending on the proportion of cases for which genomes are available. A key feature of this approach is computational scalability, and in particular the ability to process hundreds or thousands of genomes within a matter of hours. This is a clear advantage of the step-by-step approach described here. We discuss other advantages and disadvantages of the approach, as well as potential improvements and avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic viruses express anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to inhibit the host adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas. While the virus infection biology was shown to be strongly dependent on the relative strengths of the host CRISPR-Cas and viral Acrs, little is known about the role of the core processes of viral life cycle (replication, packaging etc) in defence/anti-defence arms race. Here, we demonstrate the selective advantage provided by a replication initiator, Rep, in the context of CRISPR-Acr interactions. First, we developed a two-host based CRISPR-Cas genome editing tool for the deletion of highly conserved and thus potentially important viral genes. Using this strategy, we deleted a highly conserved Rep-coding gene, gp16, from the genome of Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2). The knockout mutant ({Delta}gp16) produced around 4 fold less virus in a CRISPR-null host, suggesting that Rep is the major contributor to replication initiation in Rudiviridae. Indeed, DNA sequencing revealed Rep-dependent replication initiation from the viral genome termini, in addition to Rep-independent replication initiation from non-terminal sites. Intriguingly, the lack of Rep showed a profound effect on virus propagation in a host carrying CRISPR-Cas immunity. Accordingly, the co-infecting parental virus (rep-containing) outcompeted the {Delta}gp16 mutant much more quickly in CRISPR-containing host than in CRISPR-null host, demonstrating a selective advantage provided by Rep in the presence of host CRISPR-Cas immunity. Despite the non-essentiality, rep is carried by all known members of Rudiviridae, which is likely an evolutionary outcome driven by the ubiquitous presence of CRISPR-Cas in Sulfolobales.\n\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas and anti-CRISPR proteins are accessary to prokaryotes and their viruses respectively. To date, research has been focused on their diversity, molecular mechanisms and application in genome editing. How CRISPR-Acr arms race influence the evolution of viral core genes involved in the basic virus life cycle remained a gap of knowledge so far. This study provides the first evidence that CRISPR-Acr arms race poses a selection pressure on the efficiency of viral genome replication, forcing viruses to evolve highly productive replication machineries..",

    "abstract": "Plastics pollution has been a global concern. Huge quantities of polyethylene (PE), the most abundant and refractory plastic in the world, have been accumulating in the environment causing serious ecological problems. However, the paucity of microorganisms and enzymes that efficiently degrading PE seriously impedes the development of bio-products to eliminate this environmental pollution. Here, by screening hundreds of plastic waste-associated samples, we isolated a fungus (named Alternaria sp. FB1) that possessing a prominent capability of colonizing, degrading and utilizing PE. Strikingly, the molecular weight of PE film decreased 95% after the fungal treatment. Using GC-MS, we further clarified that a four-carbon product (named Diglycolamine) accounted for 93.28% of all degradation products after the treatment by strain FB1. We defined potential enzymes that involved in the degradation of PE through a transcriptomic method. The degradation capabilities of two representative enzymes including a laccase and a peroxidase were verified. Lastly, a complete biodegradation process of PE is proposed. Our study provides a compelling candidate for further investigation of degradation mechanisms and development of biodegradation products of PE.",

    "abstract": "Comorbidities such as diabetes worsen COVID-19 severity and recovery. Metformin, a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes, has antiviral properties and certain studies have also indicated its prognostic potential in COVID-19. Here, we report that metformin significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture models. First, a steady increase in AMPK phosphorylation was detected as infection progressed, suggesting its important role during viral infection. Activation of AMPK in Calu3 and Caco2 cell lines using metformin revealed that metformin suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infectious titers up to 99%, in both naive as well as infected cells. TCID50 values from dose-variation studies in infected cells were found to be 0.8 and 3.5 mM in Calu3 and Caco2 cells, respectively. Role of AMPK in metformins antiviral suppression was further confirmed using other pharmacological compounds, AICAR and Compound C. Collectively, our study demonstrates that metformin is effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and thus possibly could offer double benefits s diabetic COVID-19 patients by lowering both blood glucose levels and viral load.",

    "abstract": "The 53BP1-RIF1 pathway antagonizes resection of DNA broken ends and confers PARP inhibitor sensitivity on BRCA1-mutated tumors. However, it is unclear how this pathway suppresses initiation of resection. Here, we identify ASF1 as a partner of RIF1 via an interacting manner similar to its interactions with histone chaperones CAF-1 and HIRA. ASF1 is recruited to distal chromatin flanking DNA breaks by 53BP1-RIF1 and promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) using its histone chaperone activity. Epistasis analysis shows that ASF1 acts in the same NHEJ pathway as RIF1, but via a parallel pathway with the shieldin complex, which suppresses resection after initiation. Moreover, defects in end resection and homologous recombination (HR) in BRCA1- deficient cells are largely suppressed by ASF1 deficiency. Mechanistically, ASF1 compacts adjacent chromatin by heterochromatinization to protect broken DNA ends from BRCA1-mediated resection. Taken together, our findings identified a RIF1-ASF1 histone chaperone complex that promotes changes in high-order chromatin structure to stimulate the NHEJ pathway for DSB repair.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the secreted enzyme ADAMTS7 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 7) are associated with protection for coronary artery disease (CAD). ADAMTS7 catalytic inhibition has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for treating CAD; however, the lack of an endogenous substrate has hindered the development of activity-based biomarkers. To identify ADAMTS7 extracellular substrates and their cleavage sites relevant to vascular disease, we used TAILS (terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates), a method for identifying protease-generated neo-N termini. We compared the secreted proteome of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells expressing either full-length mouse ADAMTS7 WT, catalytic mutant ADAMTS7 E373Q or a control luciferase adenovirus. Significantly enriched N-terminal cleavage sites in ADAMTS7 WT samples were compared to the negative control conditions and filtered for stringency, resulting in catalogs of high confidence candidate ADAMTS7 cleavage sites from our three independent TAILS experiments. Within the overlap of these discovery sets, we identified 24 unique cleavage sites from 16 protein substrates, including cleavage sites in EFEMP1 (EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1/Fibulin-3). The ADAMTS7 TAILS preference for EMEMP1 cleavage at the amino acids 123.124 over the adjacent 124.125 site was validated using both endogenous EFEMP1 and purified EFEMP1 in a binary in vitro cleavage assay. Collectively our TAILS discovery experiments have uncovered hundreds of potential substrates and cleavage sites to explore disease related biological substrates and facilitate activity-based ADAMTS7 biomarker development.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/469331v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1520ad4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@144f148org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13cdbc1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f7b4f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Widespread aberrant gene expression is pathological hallmark of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Numerous pathogenic signaling cascades, including c-Myc, Fos, and Jun are transactivated. However, the underlying epigenetic regulators are poorly defined. Here we show that H3K27ac, a histone modification that marks active enhancers, is elevated in mouse and human ADPKD samples. Using comparative H3K27ac ChIP-Seq analysis, we mapped >16000 active intronic and intergenic enhancer elements in Pkd1-mutant mouse kidneys. We find that the cystic kidney epigenetic landscape resembles that of a developing kidney, and >90% of upregulated genes in Pkd1-mutant kidneys are co-housed with activated enhancers in the same topologically associated domains. Furthermore, we identify an evolutionarily-conserved enhancer cluster downstream of the c-Myc gene and super-enhancers flanking both Jun and Fos loci in mouse and human ADPKD models. Deleting these regulatory elements reduces c-Myc, Jun, or Fos abundance and suppresses proliferation and 3D cyst growth of Pkd1-mutant cells. Finally, inhibiting glycolysis and glutaminolysis or activating Ppara in Pkd1-mutant cells lowers global H3K27ac levels and on c-Myc enhancers. Thus, our work suggests that epigenetic rewiring mediates the transcriptomic dysregulation in PKD, and the regulatory elements can be targeted to slow cyst growth.",

To date, only a few proteins have been shown to be essential for sperm-egg binding and fusion in mice, and only some are conserved across vertebrates. One of these conserved, testis-expressed factors is SPACA6, yet its function has not been investigated outside of mammals. Here we show that zebrafish spaca6 encodes for a sperm membrane protein which is essential for fertilization. Zebrafish spaca6 knockout males are sterile. Furthermore, Spaca6-deficient sperm have normal morphology, are motile, and can approach the egg, but fail to bind to the egg and therefore cannot complete fertilization. Interestingly, sperm lacking Spaca6 have decreased levels of another essential and conserved sperm fertility factor, Dcst2, revealing a previously unknown dependence of Dcst2 expression on Spaca6. Together, our results show that zebrafish Spaca6 regulates Dcst2 levels and is required for binding between the sperm membrane and the oolemma. This is in contrast to murine SPACA6, which was reported not to be required for sperm-egg membrane binding but necessary for fusion. These findings demonstrate that Spaca6 is essential for zebrafish fertilization and is a conserved sperm factor in vertebrate reproduction.",

Instead of using the standard approach of amino acid datasets, we performed analyses of newly assembled genome gene content and morphological datasets to investigate these recalcitrant nodes in the phylogeny of animals. We explored extensively the choices for assembling the genome gene content dataset and model choices of morphological analyses. Our results are robust to these choices and provide additional insights into the early evolution of animals, they are consistent with sponges as the sister group of all the other animals, the worm-like bilaterian lineage Xenacoelomorpha as the sister group of the other Bilateria, and tentatively support monophyletic Deuterostomia.",

However, our understanding of the transport mechanisms that regulate Zn2+ homeostasis in platelets is limited. Zn2+ transporters, ZIPs and ZnTs, are widely expressed in eukaryotic cells. Using mice globally lacking ZIP1 and ZIP3 (ZIP1/3 DKO), our aim was to explore the potential role of these well-known Zn2+ transporters in maintaining platelet Zn2+ homeostasis and in the regulation of platelet function. While ICP-MS measurements indicated unaltered overall Zn2+ concentrations in platelets of ZIP1/3 DKO mice, we observed a significantly delayed and less efficient Zn2+ release upon thrombin-stimulated platelet activation. This resulted in a hyperactive platelet response not only in response to thrombin, but also towards other G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM)-coupled receptor agonist signalling, however, was unaffected. Augmented GPCR responses were accompanied by enhanced Ca2+ signalling and PKC activation. Further functional analysis of ZIP1/3 double deficient mice revealed enhanced platelet aggregation, bigger thrombus volume under flow ex vivo and faster in vivo thrombus formation. The current study thereby identifies ZIP1 and ZIP3 as important regulators for the maintenance of platelet Zn2+ homeostasis and function.",

In current investigation, the impact of ammonium sulfate, sugar beet pulp (SBP) and glucose as variables on induction of polygalacturonase from P. indica was optimized using the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) under SmF. Additionally, partial polygalacturonase purification and in situ analysis were performed. The optimal reaction conditions, which resulted in the highest enzyme activity were observed as the following conditions: ammonium sulfate (4 g/L), SBP (20 g/L), glucose (60 g/L). Under the optimized condition, the maximum enzyme activity reached to 19.4 U/ml (127 U/mg) which increased by 5.84 times compared to non-optimized conditions. The partial purified polygalacturonase molecular weight was estimated 60 KDa. In line with the bioinformatic analysis, exo-polygalacturonase sequence of P. indica showed similarity with Rhizoctonia solanis and Thanateporus cucumeris. These results indicated that SBP act as a cheap and suitable inducer of polygalacturonase production by P. indica in a submerged cultivation.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) structures dictate the functions of RNA molecules in a wide variety of biological processes. However, direct determination of RNA 3D structures in vivo is difficult due to their large sizes, conformational heterogeneity, and dynamics. Here we present a new method, Spatial 2-Hydroxyl Acylation Reversible Crosslinking (SHARC), which uses chemical crosslinkers of defined lengths to measure distances between nucleotides in cellular RNA. Integrating crosslinking, exonuclease (exo) trimming, proximity ligation, and high throughput sequencing, SHARC enables transcriptome-wide tertiary structure contact maps at high accuracy and precision, revealing heterogeneous RNA structures and interactions. SHARC data provide constraints that improves Rosetta-based RNA 3D structure modeling at near-nanometer resolution. Integrating SHARC-exo with other crosslinking-based methods, we discover compact folding of the 7SK RNA, a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation. These results establish a new strategy for measuring RNA 3D distances and alternative conformations in their native cellular context.",

    "abstract": "Widespread availability of protein sequence-fitness data would revolutionize both our biochemical understanding of proteins and our ability to engineer them. Unfortunately, even though thousands of protein variants are generated and evaluated for fitness during a typical protein engineering campaign, most are never sequenced, leaving a wealth of potential sequence-fitness information untapped. This largely stems from the fact that sequencing is unnecessary for many protein engineering strategies; the added cost and effort of sequencing is thus unjustified. Here, we present every variant sequencing (evSeq), an efficient protocol for sequencing a variable region within every variant gene produced during a protein engineering campaign at a cost of cents per variant. Execution of evSeq is simple, requires no sequencing experience to perform, relies only on resources and services typically available to biology labs, and slots neatly into existing protein engineering workflows. Analysis of evSeq data is likewise made simple by its accompanying software (found at github.com/fhalab/evSeq, documentation at fhalab.github.io/evSeq), which can be run on a personal laptop and was designed to be accessible to users with no computational experience. Low-cost and easy to use, evSeq makes collection of extensive protein variant sequence-fitness data practical.",

    "abstract": "It is acknowledged that the inactivation of ultraviolet has been widely used in various fields. Much literature has been reported that ultraviolet C caused DNA damage to achieve inactivation of microorganisms. There is a lack of unified dose calibration and related parameters in this field. In this study, we used a device consisted of the LED of 272 nm to conduct sterilization experiments against A. baumanii. We confirmed the effectiveness of ultraviolet C sterilization for both sensitive and drug resistance strains and explored the relationship between bactericidal rate and ultraviolet doses under various irradiance. Dose requirements of various irradiance were clarified. High irradiance improved sterilization efficiency greatly. The overall damage to the total genome was observed though gel electrophoresis. Ultrastructure of damaged bacteria were investigated by transmission electron microscope in detail. The study revealed that damage to DNA and to the cytoplasm matrix and ribosomes. The study has yielded the possible effects of ultraviolet light on cells by amplifying the energy. The radiation significantly promoted the production of cell wall and cellular membrane.\n\nSignificance StatementThe statistical results of bactericidal efficiency are influenced by the quantity of bacteria on the medium. Irradiance on the target surface affects the sterilization efficiency directly. And doses required in low irradiance are much more than high. A high irradiance reduced dosage efficiently to achieve the sterilization which improves the sterilization efficiency. There is a difference between low and high UVC dosage damage to the structure of bacteria. Less energy can make DNA coagulation solidified or be dispersed to the edge. Meanwhile the cytoplasm matrix is ruined. When the energy was enough, there is a boost of cell wall and cellular membrane production. The invisible light causes comprehensive damage to bacteria.",

The small molecule TK216 was developed as a first-in-class direct EWSR1-FLI1 inhibitor and is in phase II clinical trials in combination with vincristine for EWS patients. However, TK216 exhibits anti-cancer activity against cancer cell lines and xenografts that do not express EWSR1-FLI1, and the mechanism underlying cytotoxicity remains unresolved. We apply a forward genetics screening platform utilizing engineered hypermutation in EWS cell lines and identify recurrent mutations in TUBA1B, encoding -tubulin, that prove sufficient to drive resistance to TK216. Using reconstituted microtubule (MT) polymerization in vitro and cell-based chemical probe competition assays, we demonstrate that TK216 acts as an MT destabilizing agent. This work defines the mechanism of cytotoxicity of TK216, explains the synergy observed with vincristine, and calls for a reexamination of ongoing clinical trials with TK216.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harbors a complex tumor microbiome that has been implicated in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy. Recent clinical investigations uncovered a correlation between high loads of intratumor Fusobacterium nucleatum and decreased patient survival. Here we show that healthy and cancerous pancreatic cell lines harboring intracellular F. nucleatum secrete increased levels of cancer-associated cytokines including GM-CSF, CXCL1, IL-8, and MIP-3. We report that GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) secretion directly increases the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells via an autocrine mechanism, notably in the absence of immune cell participation. Furthermore, we show that non-cancerous pancreatic epithelial cells do not exhibit increased proliferation or migration in response to these cytokines, but nevertheless, their secreted cytokines stimulate these responses in cancerous cell lines through paracrine signaling. Our results provide evidence that intratumor F. nucleatum in the pancreas elicits an infection-specific cytokine secretion profile from both normal and cancerous cells that adversely contributes to cancer progression through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Therefore, these results support the importance of investigating the contributions of both microbiome and host driven processes in pancreatic cancer to guide future therapeutic interventions.",

The emergence of primordial functional RNAs, such as ribozymes that fold into complex structures that contain multiple hairpin loops, is generally thought to have been supported by template-directed ligation. However, template inhibition and RNA misfolding problems impede the emergence of function. Here we demonstrate that RNA hairpin loops can be synthesized directly from short RNA duplexes with single-stranded overhangs by nonenzymatic loop-closing ligation chemistry. We show that loop-closing ligation allows full-length functional ribozymes containing a hairpin loop to be assembled free of inhibitory template strands. This approach to the assembly of structurally complex RNAs suggests a plausible pathway for the emergence of functional RNAs before a full-length RNA copying process became available.",

However, their mechanistic contributions to immune outcomes remain ill-defined. We discovered that the disease-associated gain-of-function allele Lrrk2G2019S (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) promotes mitochondrial hyper-fission, depolarization, and oxidative stress in macrophages. In the presence of Lrrk2G2019S-dependent mitochondrial perturbations, AIM2 inflammasome activation promotes more cell death but not more pyroptotic IL-1b release. Instead, inflammasome activation in Lrrk2G2019S macrophages triggers gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated mitochondrial pores, driving up ROS-mediated RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL dependent necroptosis. Consequently, infection of Lrrk2G2019S mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis elicits hyperinflammation and immunopathology via enhanced neutrophil infiltration. By uncovering that GSDMD promotes non-pyroptotic cell death in Lrrk2G2019S macrophages, our findings demonstrate that altered mitochondrial function can reprogram cell death modalities to elicit distinct immune outcomes.

    "abstract": "It is increasingly appreciated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) carry out important functions in mammalian cells, but how these are encoded in their sequences and manifested in their structures remains largely unknown. Some lncRNAs bind to and modulate the availability of RNA binding proteins, but the structural principles that underlie this mode of regulation are underexplored. Here, we focused on the NORAD lncRNA, which binds Pumilio proteins and modulates their ability to repress hundreds of mRNA targets. We probed the RNA structure and long-range RNA-RNA interactions formed by NORAD inside cells, under different stressful conditions. We discovered that NORAD structure is highly modular, and consists of well-defined domains that contribute independently to NORAD function. We discovered that NORAD structure spatially clusters the Pumilio binding sites along NORAD in a manner that contributes to the de-repression of Pumilio target proteins. Following arsenite stress, the majority of NORAD structure undergoes relaxation and forms inter-molecular interactions with RNAs that are targeted to stress granules. NORAD sequence thus dictates elaborated structural domain organization that facilitates its function on multiple levels, and which helps explain the extensive evolutionary sequence conservation of NORAD regions that are not predicted to directly bind Pumilio proteins.",

PGAM5 substrate determinates have not been rigorously investigated and it is unclear how uncoupling the mitochondrial membrane potential regulates its processing inversely to PINK1. Here we show that in PGAM5 several hydrophilic residues distant from the cleavage site serve as key determinant for PARL- catalyzed cleavage. NMR analysis indicates that a short N-terminal amphipathic helix, followed by a kink and a C-terminal helix harboring the scissile peptide bond, is key for a productive interaction with PARL. In difference to PINK1, PGAM5 is stably inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane until uncoupling the membrane potential triggers its disassembly into monomers that are vulnerable to PARL-catalyzed processing. We suggest a model in which PGAM5 is a slowly processed substrate with PARL-catalyzed cleavage that is influenced by multiple hierarchical substrate features including a membrane-potential- dependent oligomeric switch.",

    "abstract": "Precise regulation of embryo movement is crucial to successful implantation, but the role of ovarian hormones in this process is not understood. We ascertain the effects of altered hormonal environment on embryo movement using two delayed implantation models: Natural lactational Diapause (ND), a naturally occurring alternate model of pregnancy, and Artificially induced Diapause (AD), a laboratory version of ND. Our previous work suggests that embryos in a natural pregnancy (NP) first display unidirectional clustered embryo movement, followed by bidirectional scattering and spacing movement. In contrast, in the ND model, embryos are present as clusters near the oviductal-uterine junction for ~24-hours longer than NP, followed by locations consistent with a unidirectional scattering and spacing movement. Intriguingly, the AD model closely resembles embryo location in NP and not ND. Further, unlike the popular paradigm of reduced estrogen (E2) levels in diapause E2 levels are comparable across NP, ND, and AD, while progesterone (P4) levels are reduced in ND and highly increased in AD when compared to NP. Exogenous administration of E2 or P4 modifies the unidirectional clustered embryo movement, while E2 treatment causes a reduction in P4 and affects the bidirectional phase of embryo movement. Taken together, our data suggest embryo movement can be modulated by both P4 and E2. Understanding natural hormonal adaptation in diapause provides an opportunity to determine key players regulating embryo movement and implantation success. This knowledge can be leveraged to understand pregnancy survival and implantation success in hormonally altered conditions in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Fitness is at the core of evolutionary theory, but it is difficult to measure accurately. One way to measure long-term fitness is by calculating the individuals reproductive value, which represents the expected number of allele copies an individual passes on to distant future generations. However, this metric of fitness is scarcely used because the estimation of individuals reproductive value requires long-term pedigree data, which is rarely available in wild populations where following individuals from birth to death is often impossible. Wild study systems therefore use short-term fitness metrics as proxies, such as the number of offspring produced. This study obtained three frequently used short-term proxies for fitness obtained at different offspring life stages (eggs, hatchlings, fledglings and recruits), and compared their ability to predict reproductive values derived from the genetic pedigree of a wild passerine bird population. We used twenty years of precise field observations and a near-complete genetic pedigree to calculate reproductive success, individual growth rate and de-lifed fitness as lifetime fitness measures, and as annual de-lifed fitness. We compared the power of these metrics to predict reproductive values and lineage survival to the end of the study period. The three short-term fitness proxies predict the reproductive values and lineage survival only when measured at the recruit stage. There were no significant differences between the different fitness proxies at the same offspring stages in predicting the reproductive values and lineage survival. Annual fitness at one year old predicted reproductive values equally well as lifetime de-lifed fitness. However, none of the short-term fitness proxies was strongly associated with the reproductive values. In summary, the commonly short-term fitness proxies capture long-term fitness with intermediate accuracy at best, if measured at recruitment stage. As lifetime fitness measured at recruit stage and annual fitness in the first year of life were the best proxies of long-term fitness, we encourage their future use.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary relationship between prokaryotes and eukaryotes continues to fascinate biologists. Accumulated studies suggest a eukaryogenesis model based on the PVC (Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae) bacteria. However, a decisive PVC-based eukaryogenesis scenario has not yet been reported. Here, we isolated PVC bacteria, unique for dividing by budding and for possessing developed endomembrane systems, from the deep sea. In cultured PVC bacterial strains, we detected typical eukaryotic organelle-like structures including endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles and actin/tubulin-based microfilaments. Strikingly, we observed a nucleolus-containing nucleus in a Verrucomicrobia strain, which divides by mitosis. Transcriptomic results further demonstrated abundant presence of genes associated with eukaryotic cellular processes including membrane fusion. We propose that the prominent capability of membrane fusion drives eukaryogenesis by enabling PVC bacteria to evolve eukaryotic cellular features.",

    "abstract": "The domestication of plants and the origin of agricultural societies has been the focus of much theoretical discussion on why, how, when, and where these happened. The  when and  where have been substantially addressed by bioarchaeology, thanks to advances in methodology and the broadening of the geographical and chronological scope of evidence. However, the  why and  how have lagged behind, holding on to relatively old models with limited explanatory power. Armed with the evidence now available, we can return to theory by revisiting the mechanisms allegedly involved, disentangling their connection to the diversity of trajectories, and identifying the weight and role of the parameters involved. We present the Human-Plant Coevolution (HPC) model, which represents the dynamics of coevolution between a human and a plant population. The model consists of an ecological positive feedback system (mutualism), which can be reinforced by positive evolutionary feedback (coevolution). The model formulation is the result of wiring together relatively simple simulation models of population ecology and evolution, through a computational implementation in R. The HPC model captures a variety of potential scenarios, though which conditions are linked to the degree and timing of population change and the intensity of selective pressures. Our results confirm that the possible trajectories leading to neolithisation are diverse and involve multiple factors. However, simulations also show how some of those factors are entangled, what are their effects on human and plant populations under different conditions, and what might be the main causes fostering agriculture and domestication.",

Notably, under pathological conditions, the two factors have been shown to interact genetically, but both the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions and their relevance under physiological conditions remain unclear. Here we report that STAT3 is required for the HIF1-dependent response to hypoxia. In Stat3 knock-out pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), a large fraction of HIF1 target genes is not induced by hypoxia. Mechanistically, STAT3 does not regulate neither HIF1 expression nor stability, rather, it physically interacts with it in the nucleus. In vivo, we observed that both genetic and chemical inactivation of Stat3 blunted physiological responses to hypoxia, such as angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and immune cell mobilization. Such defects were accompanied with faulty transcriptional activity of HIF1. In sum, our data reveal that STAT3 and HIF1 cooperatively mediate the physiological response to hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Surf zones are highly dynamic marine ecosystems that are subject to increasing anthropogenic and climatic pressures, posing multiple challenges for biomonitoring. Traditional methods such as seines and hook and line surveys are often labor intensive, taxonomically biased, and can be physically hazardous. Emerging techniques, such as baited remote underwater video (BRUV) and environmental DNA (eDNA) are promising nondestructive tools for assessing marine biodiversity in surf zones of sandy beaches. Here we compare the relative performance of beach seines, BRUV, and eDNA in characterizing community composition of bony (teleost) and cartilaginous (elasmobranch) fishes of surf zones at 18 open coast sandy beaches in southern California. Seine and BRUV surveys captured overlapping, but distinct fish communities with 50% (18/36) of detected species shared. BRUV surveys more frequently detected larger species (e.g. sharks and rays) while seines more frequently detected one of the most abundant species, barred surfperch (Amphistichus argenteus). In contrast, eDNA metabarcoding captured 83.3% (30/36) of all fishes observed in seine and BRUV surveys plus 59 additional species, including 13 that frequent surf zone habitats. eDNA approaches showed significantly higher sensitivity than seine and BRUV methods and more consistently detected 29 of the 30 (96.7%) jointly observed species across beaches. The six species detected by BRUV/seines, but not eDNA either lacked reference sequences, were only resolved at higher taxonomic ranks (e.g. Embiotocidae surfperches), or were detected below occupancy thresholds. Low site-species overlap between methods limited comparisons of richness and abundance estimates, highlighting the challenge of comparing biomonitoring approaches. Despite potential for improvement, results overall demonstrate that eDNA can provide a cost-effective tool for long-term surf zone monitoring that complements data from seine and BRUV surveys, allowing more comprehensive surveys of vertebrate diversity in surf zone habitats.",

    "abstract": "A composite likelihood method is introduced for jointly estimating the intensity of selection and the rate of mutation, both scaled by the effective population size, when there is balancing selection at a single multi-allelic locus in an isolated population at demographic equilibrium. The performance of the method is tested using simulated data. Average estimated mutation rates and selection intensities are close to the true values but there is considerable variation about the averages. Allowing for both population growth and population subdivision do not result in qualitative differences but the estimated mutation rates and selection intensities do not in general reflect the current effective population size. The method is applied to three class I (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) and two class II loci (HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1) in the 1000 Genomes populations. Allowing for asymmetric balancing selection has only a slight effect on the results from the symmetric model. Mutations that restore symmetry of the selection model are preferentially retained because of the tendency of natural selection to maximize average fitness. However, slight differences in selective effects result in much longer persistence time of some alleles. Trans-species polymorphism (TSP), which is characteristic of MHC in vertebrates, is more likely when there are small differences in allelic fitness than when complete symmetry is assumed. Therefore, variation in allelic fitness expands the range of parameter values consistent with observations of TSP.",

    "abstract": "Taste memory involves storing information through plasticity changes in the neural network of taste, including the insular cortex (IC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), a critical provider of dopamine. Although a VTA-IC dopaminergic pathway has been demonstrated, its role to consolidate taste recognition memory remains poorly understood. We found that photostimulation of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA or VTA-IC dopaminergic terminals of TH-Cre mice increases the salience of a novel taste stimulus regardless of its hedonic value, without altering their taste palatability. Importantly, the inhibition of the D1-like receptor into the IC impairs the salience to facilitate consolidation of an aversive taste recognition memory. Finally, our results showed that VTA photostimulation improves the salience to consolidate a conditioned taste aversion memory through the D1-like receptor into the IC. It is concluded that the dopamine activity from the VTA into IC is required to increase the salience enabling the consolidation of a taste recognition memory. Notably, the D1-like receptor activity into the IC is required to consolidate both innate and learned aversive taste memories but not appetitive taste memory.",

    "abstract": "Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has been employed for the high-throughput analysis of endogenous gene function. We developed a CaMV 35S promoter-driven cucumber fruit mottle mosaic virus-Cm vector (pCF93) for the efficient generation of viral transcripts in plants. Using the novel pCF93 vector, we identified genes related to male sterility in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), which is recalcitrant to genetic transformation. We previously reported reference-based and de novo transcriptomic profiling for the detection of differentially expressed genes between a male fertile line (DAH3615) and its near isogenic male sterile line (DAH3615-MS). Based on the RNA-seq results, we identified 38 de novo-exclusive differentially expressed genes (DEDEGs) that are potentially responsible for male sterility. Partial genes of 200[~]300bp were cloned into pCF93 which was then inoculated into DAH, a small type of watermelon that enables high-throughput screening with a small cultivation area. In this manner, we simultaneously characterized phenotypes associated with the 38 candidate genes in a common-sized greenhouse. Eight out of the 38 gene-silenced plants produced male sterile flowers with abnormal stamens and no pollens. Gene expression levels in flowers were validated via RT-qPCR. Stamen histological sections from male sterile floral buds and mature flowers showed developmental disruption and shrunken pollen sacs. Based on the current findings, we believe that the novel pCF93 vector and our VIGS system facilitate high-throughput analysis for the study of gene function in watermelons.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe CaMV 35S promoter-driven cucumber fruit mottle mosaic virus-Cm vector (pCF93) facilitates large-scale validation of male sterility-related gene functions in watermelon.",

    "abstract": "Closely spaced promoters in tandem formation are abundant in bacteria. We investigated the evolutionary conservation, biological functions, and the RNA and single-cell protein expression of genes regulated by tandem promoters in E. coli. We also studied the sequence (distance between transcription start sites  dTSS, pause sequences, and distances from oriC) and potential influence of the input transcription factors of these promoters. From this, we propose an analytical model of gene expression based on measured expression dynamics, where RNAP-promoter occupancy times and dTSS are the key regulators of transcription interference due to TSS occlusion by RNAP at one of the promoters (when dTSS [&le;] 35 bp) and RNAP occupancy of the downstream promoter (when dTSS > 35 bp). Occlusion and downstream promoter occupancy are modeled as linear functions of occupancy time, while the influence of dTSS is implemented by a continuous step function, fit to in vivo data on mean single-cell protein numbers of 30 natural genes controlled by tandem promoters. The best-fitting step is at 35 bp, matching the length of DNA occupied by RNAP in the open complex formation. This model accurately predicts the squared coefficient of variation and skewness of the natural single-cell protein numbers as a function of dTSS. Additional predictions suggest that promoters in tandem formation can cover a wide range of transcription dynamics within realistic intervals of parameter values. By accurately capturing the dynamics of these promoters, this model can be helpful to predict the dynamics of new promoters and contribute to the expansion of the repertoire of expression dynamics available to synthetic genetic constructs.\n\nAuthor SummaryTandem promoters are common in nature, but investigations on their dynamics have so far largely relied on synthetic constructs. Thus, their regulation and potentially unique dynamics remain unexplored. We first performed a comprehensive exploration of the conservation of genes regulated by these promoters in E. coli and the properties of their input transcription factors. We then measured protein and RNA levels expressed by 30 Escherichia coli tandem promoters, to establish an analytical model of the expression dynamics of genes controlled by such promoters. We show that start site occlusion and downstream RNAP occupancy can be realistically captured by a model with RNAP binding affinity, the time length of open complex formation, and the nucleotide distance between transcription start sites. This study contributes to a better understanding of the unique dynamics tandem promoters can bring to the dynamics of gene networks and will assist in their use in synthetic genetic circuits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVariation in the longitudinal course of childhood attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) coincides with neurodevelopmental maturation of brain structure and function. Prior work has attempted to determine how alterations in white matter (WM) relate to changes in symptom severity, but much of that work has been done in smaller cross-sectional samples using voxel-based analyses. Using standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods, we previously showed WM alterations were associated with ADHD symptom remission over time in a longitudinal sample of probands, siblings, and unaffected individuals. Here, we extend this work by further assessing the nature of these changes in WM microstructure by including an additional follow-up measurement (aged 18 - 34 years), and using the more physiologically informative fixel-based analysis (FBA).\n\nMethodsData were obtained from 139 participants over 3 clinical and 2 follow-up DWI waves, and analyzed using FBA in regions-of-interest based on prior findings. We replicated previously reported significant models and extended them by adding another time-point, testing whether changes in combined ADHD and hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) continuous symptom scores are associated with fixel metrics at follow-up.\n\nResultsClinical improvement in HI symptoms over time was associated with more fiber density at follow-up in the left corticospinal tract (lCST) (tmax=1.092, standardized effect[SE]=0.044, pFWE=0.016). Improvement in combined ADHD symptoms over time was associated with more fiber cross-section at follow-up in the lCST (tmax=3.775, SE=0.051, pFWE=0.019). Conclusions: Aberrant white matter development involves both lCST micro- and macrostructural alterations, and its path may be moderated by preceding symptom trajectory.",

    "abstract": "While traditional studies claim that visuospatial attention stays fixed at one location at a time, recent research has rather shown that attention rhythmically fluctuates between different locations at rates of prominent brain rhythms. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of this fluctuation and, particularly, whether it changes over time. Thus, we addressed this question by investigating how visuospatial attention behaves over space and time. We recorded electroencephalographic activity of twenty-seven human participants while they performed a visuospatial cueing task, where attention was covertly oriented to the left or right visual field. In order to decode the spatial locus of attention from neural activity, we trained and tested a classifier on every timepoint of the orienting period, from the attentional cue to stimulus onset. This resulted in one temporal generalization matrix per participant, which was time-frequency decomposed to identify the sampling rhythm. Finally, a searchlight analysis was conducted to reveal the brain regions responsible for attention allocation. Our results show a dynamic evolution of the attentional spotlight, distinguishing between two states. In an early time window, attention explored both cued and uncued hemifield rhythmically at ~10 Hz. In a later time window attention focused on the cued hemifield. Classification was driven by occipital sources, while frontal regions exclusively became involved just before the spotlight settled onto the cued location. Together, our results define attentional sampling as a quasi-rhythmic dynamic process characterized by an initial rhythmic exploration-exploitation state, which is followed by a stable exploitation state.",

Bee diversity and abundance is key for urban agriculture and maintenance of plant diversity, and assessing what aspects of cities enhance bee populations will promote our capacity to retain and provision bee habitat. Here, we assessed how variation in land cover and neighborhood development history affected bee communities in the midwestern US urban landscape of Madison, Wisconsin. We sampled bee communities across 38 sites with relatively high (> 55%) or low (< 30%) levels of impervious surface, and assessed effects of land use and neighborhood development history on bee abundance and species richness. We show abundance and richness of bees was lower in recently developed neighborhoods, with particularly strong negative effects on soil nesting bees. Soil nesting bees and bee community richness decreased as cover of impervious surface increased, but above ground nesting bees were minimally impacted. Bee community similarity varied spatially and based on dissimilar local land cover, only for soil nesting bees, and the overall bee community. Impervious surface limited bee abundance and diversity, but new neighborhoods were associated with greater negative effects. We suggest that enhancing the structural diversity of new neighborhoods in urban ecosystems may imitate the structural benefits of older neighborhoods for bee populations.",

    "abstract": "For billions of years, life has continuously adapted to dynamic physical conditions near the Earths surface. Fossils and other preserved biosignatures in the paleontological record are the most direct evidence for reconstructing the broad historical contours of this adaptive interplay. However, biosignatures dating to Earths earliest history are exceedingly rare. Here, we combine phylogenetic inference of primordial rhodopsin proteins with modeled spectral features of the Precambrian Earth environment to reconstruct the paleobiological history of this essential family of photoactive transmembrane proteins. Our results suggest that ancestral microbial rhodopsins likely acted as light-driven proton pumps and were spectrally tuned toward the absorption of green light, which would have enabled their hosts to occupy depths in a water column or biofilm where UV wavelengths were attenuated. Subsequent diversification of rhodopsin functions and peak absorption frequencies was enabled by the expansion of surface ecological niches induced by the accumulation of atmospheric oxygen. Inferred ancestors retain distinct associations between extant functions and peak absorption frequencies. Our findings suggest that novel information encoded by biomolecules can be used as \"paleosensors\" for conditions of ancient, inhabited niches of host organisms not represented elsewhere in the paleontological record. The coupling of functional diversification and spectral tuning of this taxonomically diverse protein family underscores the utility of rhodopsins as universal testbeds for inferring remotely detectable biosignatures on inhabited planetary bodies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSemen quality and male fertility are monitored in artificial insemination bulls to ensure high insemination success rates. Only ejaculates that fulfill minimum quality requirements are processed and eventually used for artificial inseminations. We examined 70,990 ejaculates from 1343 Brown Swiss bulls to identify bulls from which all ejaculates were rejected due to low semen quality. This procedure identified a bull that produced twelve ejaculates with an aberrantly low number of sperm (0.2{+/-}0.2 x 109 sperm per ml) which were mostly immotile due to multiple morphological abnormalities.\n\nResultsThe genome of the bull was sequenced at 12-fold coverage to investigate a suspected genetic cause. Comparing the sequence variant genotypes of the bull with those from 397 fertile bulls revealed a 1-bp deletion in the coding sequence of QRICH2 encoding glutamine rich 2 as a compelling candidate causal variant. The 1-bp deletion causes a frameshift in translation and induces a premature termination codon (ENSBTAP00000018337.1:p.Cys1644AlafsTer52). The analysis of testis transcriptomes from 76 bulls showed that the transcript with the premature termination codon is subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The 1-bp deletion resides on a 675 kb haplotype spanning 181 SNPs from the Illumina BovineHD Bead chip. The haplotype segregates at a frequency of 5% in the Brown Swiss cattle population. This analysis also identified another bull that carried the 1-bp deletion in the homozygous state. Semen analyses from the second bull confirmed low sperm concentration and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities primarily affecting the sperm flagellum and, to a lesser extent, the sperm head.\n\nConclusionsA recessive loss-of-function allele of bovine QRICH2 likely causes low sperm concentration and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities. Routine sperm analyses unambiguously identify homozygous bulls. A direct gene test can be implemented to monitor the frequency of the undesired allele in cattle populations.",

    "abstract": "As human activity alters the planet, there is a pressing need to understand how organisms adapt to environmental change. Of growing interest in this area is the role of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, in tailoring gene expression to fit novel conditions. Here, we reanalyzed nine invertebrate (Anthozoa and Hexapoda) datasets to validate a key prediction of this hypothesis: changes in DNA methylation in response to some condition correlate with changes in gene expression. While we detected both differential methylation and differential expression, there was no simple relationship between these differences. Hence, if changes in DNA methylation regulate invertebrate transcription, the mechanism does not follow a simple linear relationship.",

    "abstract": "Several variants of multicolor single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) have been developed to resolve the spatial relationship of nanoscale structures in biological samples. The oligonucleotide-based SMLM approach  DNA-PAINT robustly achieves nanometer localization precision and can be used to count binding sites within nanostructures. However, multicolor DNA-PAINT has primarily been realized by  Exchange-PAINT that requires sequential exchange of the imaging solution and thus leads to extended acquisition times. To alleviate the need for fluid exchange and to speed up the acquisition of current multichannel DNA-PAINT, we here present a novel approach that combines DNA-PAINT with simultaneous multicolor acquisition using spectral demixing (SD). By using newly designed probes and a novel multichannel registration procedure we achieve simultaneous multicolor SD-DNA-PAINT with minimal crosstalk. We demonstrate high localization precision (3 - 6 nm) and multicolor registration of dual and triple-color SD-DNA-PAINT by resolving patterns on DNA origami nanostructures and cellular structures.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the tissue collagen content in addition to the epithelial morphology has been proven to offer complementary information in histopathology, especially in oncology tumor staging and prediction of survival in cancer patients. One imaging modality widely used for this purpose is second harmonic generation microscopy (SHGM), which reports on the nonlinear susceptibility associated with the collagen fibers. Another method is polarization light microscopy (PLM) combined with picrosirius-red (PSR) tissue staining. However, SHGM requires expensive equipment and provides limited throughput, while PLM and PSR staining are not part of the routine surgical pathology workflow. Here, we utilize phase imaging with computational specificity (PICS) to computationally infer the collagen distribution of unlabeled tissue, with high specificity. PICS utilizes deep learning to translate quantitative phase images (QPI) into corresponding PSR images with high accuracy and inference speed of 200 milisecond per forwardpass through the model once trained. We developed a multimodal imaging instrument that yields both Spatial light Inference Microscopy (SLIM) and polarized light microscopy (PLM) images from the same field of view. Our results indicate that the distributions of collagen fiber orientation, length, and straightness reported by PICS closely match the ones from ground truth as defined by KL-divergence.",

    "abstract": "The potential health consequences of glyphosate-induced gut microbiome alterations have become a matter of intense debate. As part of a multifaceted study investigating toxicity, carcinogenicity and multigenerational effects of glyphosate and its commercial herbicide formulations, we assessed changes in bacterial and fungal populations in the caecum microbiota of rats exposed prenatally until adulthood (13 weeks after weaning) to three doses of glyphosate (0.5, 5, 50 mg/kg body weight/day), or to the formulated herbicide products Roundup Bioflow and RangerPro at the same glyphosate-equivalent doses. Caecum bacterial microbiota were evaluated by 16S rRNA sequencing whilst the fungal population was determined by ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Results showed that both fungal and bacterial diversity were affected by the Roundup formulations in a dose-dependent manner, whilst glyphosate alone significantly altered only bacterial diversity. At taxa level, a reduction in Bacteroidota abundance, marked by alterations in the levels of Alloprevotella, Prevotella and Prevotellaceae UCG-003, was concomitant to increased levels of Firmicutes (e.g., Romboutsia, Dubosiella, Eubacterium brachy group or Christensenellaceae) and Actinobacteria (e.g., Enterorhabdus, Adlercreutzia, or Asaccharobacter). Treponema and Mycoplasma also had their levels reduced by the pesticide treatments. Analysis of fungal composition indicated that the abundance of the rat gut commensal Ascomycota Kazachstania was reduced while the abundance of Gibberella, Penicillium, Claviceps, Cornuvesica, Candida, Trichoderma and Sarocladium were increased by exposure to the Roundup formulations, but not to glyphosate. Altogether, our data suggest that glyphosate and its Roundup RangerPro and Bioflow caused profound changes in caecum microbiome composition by affecting the fitness of major commensals, which in turn reduced competition and allowed opportunistic fungi to grow in the gut, in particular in animals exposed to the herbicide formulations. This further indicates that changes in gut microbiome composition might influence the long-term toxicity, carcinogenicity and multigenerational effects of glyphosate-based herbicides.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExuberant inflammation during Pneumocystis pneumonia leads to lung injury. CARD9 is a central mediator of inflammatory signaling mediated by C-type lectin receptors. CARD9 inhibitor BRD5529 has been shown to be an effective in vitro inhibitor of Pneumocystis {beta}-glucan-induced proinflammatory signaling and downstream TNF-alpha production, suggesting its viability as a candidate for preliminary drug testing as an anti- inflammatory agent in the rodent Pneumocystis pneumonia model (PCP).\n\nMethodsTo assess for potential toxicity, mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) daily either with vehicle or BRD5529 at 0.1 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg for two weeks. Mouse weights were taken daily. At day 14, mice were euthanized, weighed, and analyzed by flexiVent for lung stiffness. Lungs, liver, and kidney were then harvested for H&E staining and pathology scoring. Lung samples were further analyzed for proinflammatory cytokines via ELISA and extracellular matrix generation via quantitative PCR (q-PCR). Blood collection postmortem was performed for blood chemistry analysis.\n\nResultsBRD5529 at both doses of IP administration resulted in no significant changes in daily or final weight gain. Analysis of lung stiffness by flexiVent showed no significant differences between the control or treated groups. Furthermore, ELISA results for proinflammatory IL-1 Beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha showed no major differences in the respective groups. qPCR analysis of extracellular matrix transcripts collagen type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) and fibronectin (Fn) were statically similar as well in the treated and control groups. Examination and pathology scoring of H&E slides from lung, liver, and kidney from the each of the mice in all groups and subsequent pathology scoring showed no significant change. Blood chemistry analysis revealed similar, non-significant patterns.\n\nConclusionsBRD5529 in our initial general safety and toxicology assessments displayed no inherent safety concerns in the analyzed parameters. These data support broader in vivo testing of the inhibitor as a timed adjunct therapy to the deleterious proinflammatory host immune response often associated with anti-Pneumocystis therapy.",

Soils could enable this transformation, but unfortunately, they have a hugely complex and opaque structure and studies of its myriad of mechanisms are difficult. Here, the fabrication of smart soils for the screening of below-ground bio-processes is demonstrated. Particles were generated from fluoropolymer waste with functionalisation converting them into sensors able to report on key chemical dynamics. Tailored functionalization was obtained by radical terpolymerisation to improve growth conditions and sensing capabilities.

    "abstract": "Protein kinases play an important role in cellular signaling pathways and their dysregulation leads to multiple diseases, making kinases prime drug targets. While more than 500 human protein kinases are known to collectively mediate phosphorylation of over 290,000 S/T/Y sites, the activities have been characterized only for a minor, intensively studied subset. To systematically address this discrepancy, we developed a human kinase array in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a simple readout tool to systematically assess kinase activities. For this array, we expressed 266 human kinases in four different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and profiled ectopic growth as a proxy for kinase activity across 33 conditions. More than half of the kinases showed an activity-dependent phenotype across many conditions and in more than one strain. We then employed the kinase array to identify the kinase(s) that can modulate protein-protein-interactions (PPIs). Two characterized, phosphorylation-dependent PPIs with unknown kinase-substrate relationships were analyzed in a phospho-yeast two-hybrid assay. CK21 and SGK2 kinases can abrogate the interaction between the spliceosomal proteins AAR2 and PRPF8 and NEK6 kinase was found to mediate the estrogen receptor (ER) interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. The human kinase yeast array can thus be used for a variety of kinase activity-dependent readouts.",
