    "abstract": "ObjectivesCRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing has been leveraged for the modification of human and mouse T cells. However, limited experience is available on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 electroporation in cryopreserved T cells collected during e.g. clinical trials.\n\nMethodsPBMCs from healthy donors were used to generate knockout T cell models for interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma}), Cbl Proto-Oncogene B (CBLB), Fas cell surface death receptor (Fas) and T cell receptor (TCR{beta}b) genes. The effect of CRISPR-cas9-mediated gene editing on T cells was evaluated using apoptosis assays, cytokine bead arrays and ex vivo and in vitro stimulation assays.\n\nResultsOur results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of ex vivo T cells is efficient and does not overtly affect T cell viability. Cytokine release and T cell proliferation were not affected in gene edited T cells. Interestingly, memory T cells were more susceptible to CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing than naive T cells. Ex vivo and in vitro stimulation with antigens resulted in equivalent antigen-specific T cell responses in gene-edited and untouched control cells; making CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing compatible with clinical antigen-specific T cell activation and expansion assays.\n\nConclusionHere, we report an optimized protocol for rapid, viable and highly efficient genetic modification in ex vivo human antigen specific T cells, for subsequent functional evaluation and/or expansion. Our platform extends CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for use in gold-standard clinically-used immune-monitoring pipelines and serves as a starting point for development of analogous approaches such as those including transcriptional activators and or epigenetic modifiers.",

    "abstract": "AimEcosystem-based management requires accurate predictions on how biotic and environmental factors interact to deliver ecosystem services. Biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) theory predicts that as diversity increases, the ecosystem will become more productive (positive diversity-productivity relationship - DPR) and more stable (positive diversity-stability relationship - DSR). Support for BEF has been primarily derived from fine-grained, non-harvested systems. The purpose of this study is to examine the robustness of BEF predictions for the DPR and DSR by examining how well fish diversity predicts productivity and stability of fish, shrimp, and flounder at a regional scale.\n\nLocationSoutheast coast of United States.\n\nTime Period1989 - 2015\n\nMajor Taxa StudiedMarine Fishes\n\nMethodsWe used 27 years of the SEAMAP-SA Coastal Trawl Survey database to derive estimates of fish, shrimp, and flounder biomass (i.e., productivity), temporal stability of biomass (i.e., invariability of productivity), and fish community species richness. We pooled trawls into 22 km x 22 km raster cells and 3-year time bins. We controlled for variation in sampling effort using sample-based rarefaction. We compared the ability of fish species richness, water salinity, and water temperature to predict biomass and stability of all fish, shrimp, and flounder using multiple linear regression.\n\nResultsBoth the DPR and DSR exhibited positive log-log linear trends as expected, but the DPR had a much stronger signal. Species richness outperformed the environmental covariates in both the fish and shrimp DPR models. Surface temperature was the most important variable in both flounder models. Overall, our models better explained productivity than stability.\n\nMain ConclusionsThe DPR and DSR are relevant at regional scales in a commercially important fishery although support for the DSR is less justified than DPR. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms driving the DPR and DSR are necessary to design management around BEF theory.",

    "abstract": "Microbial pangenomes vary across species; their size and structure are determined by genetic diversity within the population and by gene loss and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Many bacteria are associated with eukaryotic hosts where the host colonization dynamics may impact bacterial genome evolution. Host-associated lifestyle has been recognized as a barrier to HGT in parentally transmitted bacteria. However, pangenome evolution of environmentally acquired symbionts remains understudied, often due to limitations in symbiont cultivation. Using high-resolution metagenomics, here we study pangenome evolution of two co-occurring endosymbionts inhabiting Bathymodiolus brooksi mussels from a single cold seep. The symbionts, sulfur-oxidizing (SOX) and methane-oxidizing (MOX) gamma-proteobacteria, are environmentally acquired at an early developmental stage and individual mussels may harbor multiple strains of each species. We found differences in the accessory gene content of both symbionts across individual mussels, which are reflected by differences in symbiont strain composition. Compared to core genes, accessory genes are enriched in functions involved in genome integrity. We found no evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer between both symbionts. A comparison between the symbiont pangenomes revealed that the MOX population is less diverged and contains fewer accessory genes, supporting that the MOX association with B. brooksi is more recent than that of SOX. Our results show that the pangenomes of both symbionts evolved mainly by vertical inheritance. We conclude that environmentally transmitted symbionts that associate with individual hosts over their lifetime show features of narrow symbioses, where the frequency of HGT is constrained.",

For many susceptibility loci, however, the mechanisms are unknown. We examined splicing QTLs (sQTLs) in islets from 399 donors and observed that genetic variation has a widespread influence on splicing of genes with important functions in islet biology. In parallel, we profiled expression QTLs, and used transcriptome-wide association and co-localization studies to assign islet sQTLs or eQTLs to T2D susceptibility signals that lacked candidate effector genes. We found novel T2D associations, including an sQTL that creates a nonsense isoform in ERO1B, a regulator of ER-stress and proinsulin biosynthesis. The expanded list of T2D risk effectors revealed overrepresented pathways, including regulators of G-protein-mediated cAMP production.

In meta-analyses of glycan-binding proteins, we observed glycan-binding specificities that were not uncovered from single sources.

Here, we develop an image-based method for baseline correction using techniques from computer vision such as lane detection and active contours. The approach is remarkably accurate and efficient, allowing for rapid analysis of single-molecule time series contaminated with nearly any type of slow baseline drift.",

    "abstract": "Animal locomotion is hypothesized to be controlled by a central pattern generator in the spinal cord. Experiments and models show that rhythm generating neurons and genetically determined network properties could sustain oscillatory output activity suitable for locomotion. However, current CPG models do not explain how a spinal cord circuitry, which has the same basic genetic plan across species, can adapt to control the different biomechanical properties and locomotion patterns existing in these species. Here we demonstrate that rhythmic and alternating movements in pendulum models can be learned by a monolayer spinal cord circuitry model using the BCM learning rule, which has been previously proposed to explain learning in the visual cortex. These results provide an alternative theory to CPG models, because rhythm generating neurons and genetically defined connectivity are not required in our model.\n\nAuthor summaryThe central pattern generator is the leading hypothesis of locomotor control in animals. There, rhythm generating neurons and genetically defined neural connectivity would form a circuit generating activity patterns suitable for locomotion. We provide a new hypothesis of locomotor control, where rhythmic patterns are learned by a Hebbian learning rule from a mechanical system that has an intrinsic tendency to oscillate.",

Myelin is a vital brain microstructure marker, yet the individual microstructure-function relationship is poorly understood. Here, we explore the brain microstructure-function relationships using a higher-order framework. Global (network-level) higher-order microstructure-function relationships negatively correlate with male participants personality scores and decline with aging. Nodal (node-level) higher-order microstructure-function relationships are not aligned uniformly throughout the brain, being stronger in association cortices and lower in sensory cortices, showing gender differences. Notably, higher-order microstructure-function relationships are maintained from the whole-brain to local circuits, which uncovers a compelling and straightforward principle of brain structure-function interactions. Additionally, targeted artificial attacks can disrupt these higher-order relationships, and the main results are robust against several factors. Together, our results increase the collective knowledge of higher-order structure-function interactions that may underlie cognition, individual differences, and aging.",

    "abstract": "HIV infection results in a state of chronic immune activation leading to premature immune aging, B-cells dysfunction, that persists despite prolonged virological suppression. In this scenario, adolescence living with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV), deserve a peculiar attention since potentially exposed for their entire life to chronic immune activation. Here we identified determinants of precocious aging B cells in 40 PHIV undergoing suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) for median 13.5 years. All individuals started ART by 2nd year of life and achieved virus suppression within the 1st year of ART, with majority of patient maintaining suppression until analysis and 5/40 experiencing viral Spike (transient elevation of HIV-1 VL, 50-999 copies/ml). We employed a multiomics approach including deep immunological B and T cell phenotype in PBMC, with aging B cells defined by the expression of T-bet and CD11c; plasma proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry and serum level of anti-measles antibodies as correlates of humoral response. We found that individuals with expansion of aging B cell, defined by the expression of T-bet+CD11c+, were those starting treatment later, presenting detectable levels of cell-associated HIV-1 RNA, history of Spikes, and a higher frequency of exhausted T-cells, including those expressing PD-1, LAG3, TIGIT. Accordingly, the proteomic analysis revealed that subjects with expansion of aging B cells and exhausted T cells had enrichment of proteins involved in immune inflammation and complement activation pathways, such as CLU and APCS which are also involved in tumor progression. Signs of precocious aging were associated with a reduced capacity to maintain virological memory against measles vaccination. To our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on precocious B-cell aging and dysfunctionality in PHIV with long-term virological suppression. Our experimental strategy enabled identification of clinical, viral, cellular and plasma soluble markers associated with B-cells aging. Our results pave the way to further define risk of disease progression or lymphoproliferative disorders in PHIV.\n\nAuthor summaryDespite a successful antiretroviral therapy (ART), adolescence living with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) experience B-cells dysfunction, including loss of vaccine-induced immunological memory and higher risk of developing B-cells associated tumors. It is thus paramount to define novel and precise correlates of precious aging B cell for the definition of novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we studied 40 PHIV who started treatment by 2nd year of life and maintain virological suppression for 13.5 years, with 5/40 patients experiencing transient elevation of the HIV-1 load in the plasma (Spike). We applied a multi-omics approach including immunological B and T cell phenotype, plasma proteomics analysis and serum level of anti-measles antibodies as functional correlates of vaccine-induced immunity. We found that levels of aging B cells were positively associated with age at ART start, cell associated HIV-1 RNA (caHIV-1 RNA) and the presence of Spikes. Individuals with increased proportions of aging B cells had concomitant expansion of exhausted T cells and were unable to maintain vaccine-induced immunity over time. B-cell aging, and T-cell exhaustion were also associated with proteins involved in immune inflammation. The factors found here to be associated with aging B-cell could inform further therapeutic studies.",

    "abstract": "While aligning sequences has been the dominant approach for determining homology prior to phylogenetic inference, alignment-free methods have much appeal in terms of simplifying the process of inference, especially when analyzing genome-wide data. Furthermore, alignment-free methods present the only option for some emerging forms of data, such as genome skims, which cannot be assembled. Despite the appeal, alignment-free methods have not been competitive with alignment-based methods in terms of accuracy. One limitation of alignment-free methods is that they typically rely on simplified models of sequence evolution such as Jukes-Cantor. It is possible to compute pairwise distances under more complex models by computing frequencies of base substitutions provided that these quantities can be estimated in the alignment-free setting. A particular limitation is that for many forms of genomewide data, which arguably present the best use case for alignment-free methods, the strand of DNA sequences is unknown. Under such conditions, the so-called no-strand bias models are the most complex models that can be used. Here, we show how to calculate distances under a no-strain bias restriction of the General Time Reversible (GTR) model called TK4 without relying on alignments. The method relies on replacing letters in the input sequences, and subsequent computation of Jaccard indices between k-mer sets. For the method to work on large genomes, we also need to compute the number of k-mer mismatches after replacement due to random chance as opposed to homology. We show in simulation that these alignment-free distances can be highly accurate when genomes evolve under the assumed models, and we examine the effectiveness of the method on real genomic data.",

    "abstract": "High maternal weight is associated with a number of detrimental outcomes in offspring, including increased susceptibility to neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and communicative disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorders)1-8. Despite widespread acknowledgement of sex-biases in the prevalence, incidence, and age of onset of these disorders, few studies have investigated potential sex-biased mechanisms underlying disorder susceptibility. Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate how maternal high-fat diet, one contributor to overweight, causes endotoxin accumulation in fetal tissue, and subsequent perinatal inflammation influences sex-specific behavioral outcomes in offspring. In male high-fat diet offspring, increased macrophage toll like receptor 4 signaling results in excess phagocytosis of serotonin neurons in the developing dorsal raphe nucleus, decreasing serotonin bioavailability in the fetal and adult brain. Bulk sequencing from a large cohort of matched first trimester human fetal brain, placenta, and maternal decidua samples reveals sex-specific transcriptome-wide changes in placenta and brain tissue in response to maternal triglyceride accumulation (a proxy for dietary fat content). Further, we find that fetal brain serotonin levels decrease as maternal dietary fat intake increases in males only. These findings uncover a microglia-dependent mechanism through which maternal diet may impact offspring susceptibility for neuropsychiatric disorder development in a sex-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Behavior-related neuronal signals often vary between neurons. Despite the unreliability of individual neurons, brains are able to accurately represent and drive behavior. The notion may also apply to economic ( value-based) choices and the underlying reward signals. Reward value is subjective and can be defined by nonlinear weighting of magnitude (utility) and probability. Using a wide variety of reward magnitude and probability, we assessed subjective reward value at choice indifference between safe and risky rewards as prescribed by the continuity axiom that provides stringent criteria for meaningful choice. We found that individual neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of monkeys carry unreliable and heterogeneous neuronal signals for subjective value that largely fails to match the animals choice. However, the averaged neuronal signals matched well the animals choices, suggesting reliable subjective economic value encoding by the observed population of unreliable neurons.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDifferent from widely held views, reliable neuronal information processing may not require reliable processors.\nC_LIO_LINeurons in monkey orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) process reward magnitude and probability heterogeneously and unreliably.\nC_LIO_LIDespite unreliable neuronal processing, OFC population activity codes choices reliably.\nC_LIO_LIReliability systems performance from unreliable elements seems to be a broad feature of neuronal reward coding.\nC_LI\n\nIn briefUsing stringent concepts of behavioral choice, Ferrari-Toniolo and Schultz describe unreliable individual reward neurons in monkey orbitofrontal cortex whose activity combines to a reliable population code for economic choice.",

    "abstract": "Adult neurogenesis has primarily been examined in two key regions in the mammalian brain, the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. The proliferation and integration of newly generated neurons has been observed widely in adult mammalian species including the human hippocampus. Recent high-profile studies have suggested however, that this process is considerably reduced in humans, occurring in children but declining rapidly and nearly completely in the adult brain. In comparison, rodent studies also show age-related decline but a greater degree of proliferation of new neurons in adult animals. Here, we examine whether differences in tissue fixation, rather than biological difference in human versus rodent studies might account for the diminished levels of neurogenesis sometimes observed in the human brain. To do so we analyzed neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rats that were either perfusion-fixed or the brains extracted and immersion-fixed at various post-mortem intervals. We observed an interaction between animal age and the time delay between death and tissue fixation. While similar levels of neurogenesis were observed in young rats regardless of fixation, older rats had significantly fewer labeled neurons when fixation was not immediate. Furthermore, the morphological detail of the labeled neurons was significantly reduced in the delayed fixation conditions at all ages. This study highlights critical concerns that must be considered when using post-mortem tissue to quantify adult neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "An intact gut microbiota confers colonization resistance against Clostridioides difficile through a variety of mechanisms, likely including competition for nutrients. Recently, proline was identified as an important environmental amino acid that C. difficile uses to support growth and cause significant disease. A post-translationally modified form, trans-4-hydroxyproline, is highly abundant in collagen, which is degraded by host proteases in response to C. difficile toxin activity. The ability to dehydrate trans-4-hydroxyproline via the HypD glycyl radical enzyme is wide-spread amongst gut microbiota, including C. difficile and members of the commensal Clostridia, suggesting that this amino acid is an important nutrient in the host environment. Therefore, we constructed a C. difficile {Delta}hypD mutant and found that it was modestly impaired in fitness in a mouse model of infection, and was associated with an altered microbiota when compared to mice challenged with the wild type strain. Changes in the microbiota between the two groups were largely driven by members of the Lachnospiraceae family and the Clostridium genus. We found that C. difficile and type strains of three commensal Clostridia had significant alterations to their metabolic gene expression in the presence of trans-4-hydroxyproline in vitro. The proline reductase (prd) genes were elevated in C. difficile, consistent with the hypothesis that trans-4-hydroxyproline is used by C. difficile to supply proline for fermentation. Similar transcripts were also elevated in some commensal Clostridia tested, although each strain responded differently. This suggests that the uptake and utilization of other nutrients by the commensal Clostridia may be affected by trans-4-hydroxyproline metabolism, highlighting how a common nutrient may be a signal to each organism to adapt to a unique niche. Further elucidation of the differences between them in the presence of hydroxyproline and other key nutrients will be important to determining their role in nutrient competition against C. difficile.",

    "abstract": "5-Methylcytosine (m5C) is a base modification broadly found on various RNAs in the human transcriptome. In eukaryotes, m5C is catalyzed by enzymes of the NSUN family composed of seven human members (NSUN1-7). NOP2/NSUN1 has been primarily characterized in budding yeast as an essential ribosome biogenesis factor required for the deposition of m5C on the 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Although human NOP2/NSUN1 has been known to be an oncogene overexpressed in several types of cancer, its functions and substrates remain poorly characterized. Here we used a miCLIP-seq approach to identify human NOP2/NSUN1 RNA substrates. Our analysis revealed that NOP2/NSUN1 catalyzes the deposition of m5C at position 4447 on the 28S rRNA. We also find that NOP2/NSUN1 binds to the 5ETS region of the pre-rRNA transcript and regulates pre-rRNA processing through non-catalytic complex formation with box C/D snoRNAs. We provide evidence that NOP2/NSUN1 facilitates the recruitment of U3 and U8 snoRNAs to pre-90S ribosomal particles and their stable assembly into snoRNP complexes. Remarkably, expression of both WT and catalytically inactive NOP2/NSUN1 in knockdown background rescues the rRNA processing defects and the stable assembly of box C/D snoRNP complexes, suggesting that NOP2/NSUN1-mediated deposition of m5C on rRNA is not required for ribosome synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen synthase (GYS1), in complex with glycogenin (GYG1), is the central enzyme of muscle glycogen biosynthesis, and its inhibition has been proposed as a therapeutic avenue for various glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). GYS1 activity is inhibited by phosphorylation of its N- and C-termini, which can be relieved by allosteric activation of glucose-6-phosphate. However, the structural basis of GYS1 regulation is unclear. Here, we present the first cryo-EM structures of phosphorylated human GYS1 complexed with a minimal interacting region of GYG1 in the inhibited, activated, and catalytically competent states at resolutions of 3.0-4.0 [A]. These structures reveal how phosphorylations of specific N- and C- terminal residues are sensed by different arginine clusters that lock the GYS1 tetramer complex in an inhibited state via inter-subunit interactions. The allosteric activator, glucose-6-phopshate, promotes a conformational change by disrupting these interactions and increases flexibility of GYS1 allowing for a catalytically competent state to occur when bound to the sugar donor UDP-glucose. We also identify an inhibited-like conformation that has not transitioned into the activated state, whereby the locking interaction of phosphorylation with the arginine cluster impedes the subsequent conformational changes due to glucose-6-phosphate binding. Finally, we show that the PP1 phosphatase regulatory subunit PPP1R3C (PTG) is recruited to the GYS1:GYG1 complex through direct interaction with glycogen. Our results address long-standing questions into the mechanism of human glycogen synthase regulation.",

Here we report the synthesis and biophysical characterization of ac4C in its endogenous eukaryotic sequence context. First, we develop a synthetic route to homogenous RNAs containing electrophilic acetyl groups. Next, we use thermal denaturation to interrogate the effects of ac4C on duplex stability and mismatch discrimination in a native sequence found in human ribosomal RNA. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of this chemistry to incorporate ac4C into the complex modification landscape of human tRNA, and use duplex melting combined with sequence analysis to highlight a potentially unique enforcing role for ac4C in this setting.

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding whether and which microbes played a mediating role between an exposure and a disease outcome are essential for researchers to develop clinical interventions to treat the disease by modulating the microbes. Existing methods for mediation analysis of the microbiome are often limited to a global test of community-level mediation or selection of mediating microbes without control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Further, while the null hypothesis of no mediation at each microbe is a composite null that consists of three types of null (no exposure-microbe association, no microbe-outcome association given the exposure, or neither), most existing methods for the global test such as MedTest and MODIMA treat the microbes as if they are all under the same type of null.\n\nMethodsWe propose a new approach based on inverse regression that regresses the (possibly transformed) relative abundance of each taxon on the exposure and the exposure-adjusted outcome to assess the exposure-taxon and taxon-outcome associations simultaneously. Then the association p-values are used to test mediation at both the community and individual taxon levels. This approach fits nicely into our Linear Decomposition Model (LDM) frame-work, so our new method is implemented in the LDM and enjoys all the features of the LDM, i.e., allowing an arbitrary number of taxa to be tested, supporting continuous, discrete, or multivariate exposures and outcomes as well as adjustment of confounding covariates, accom-modating clustered data, and offering analysis at the relative abundance or presence-absence scale. We refer to this new method as LDM-med.\n\nResultsUsing extensive simulations, we showed that LDM-med always controlled the type I error of the global test and had compelling power over existing methods; LDM-med always preserved the FDR of testing individual taxa and had much better sensitivity than alternative approaches. In contrast, MedTest and MODIMA had severely inflated type I error when different taxa were under different types of null. The flexibility of LDM-med for a variety of mediation analyses is illustrated by the application to a murine microbiome dataset.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationOur new method has been added to our R package LDM, which is available on GitHub at https://github.com/yijuanhu/LDM.",

    "abstract": "The high global burden of cryptococcosis has made development of a protective vaccine a public health priority. We previously demonstrated that a vaccine composed of recombinant Cryptococcus neoformans chitin deacetylase 2 (Cda2) delivered in glucan particles (GPs) protects BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice from an otherwise lethal challenge with a highly virulent C. neoformans strain. An immunoinformatic analysis of Cda2 revealed a peptide sequence predicted to have strong binding to the MHC Class II (MHC II) H2-IAd allele found in BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice vaccinated with GPs containing a 32 amino acid peptide (Cda2-Pep1) that included this strong binding region were protected from cryptococcosis. Protection was lost with GP-based vaccines containing versions of recombinant Cda2 protein and Cda2-Pep1 with mutations predicted to greatly diminish MHC II binding. Cda2 has homology to the three other C. neoformans chitin deacetylases, Cda1, Cda3 and Fpd1, in the high MHC II binding region. GPs loaded with homologous peptides of Cda1, Cda3 and Fpd1 protected BALB/c mice from experimental cryptococcosis, albeit not as robustly as the Cda2-Pep1 vaccine. Finally, seven other peptides were synthesized based on regions in Cda2 predicted to contain promising CD4+ T cell epitopes in BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice. While five peptide vaccines significantly protected BALB/c mice, only one protected C57BL/6 mice. Thus, GP-based vaccines containing a single peptide can protect mice against cryptococcosis. However, given the diversity of human MHC II alleles, a peptide-based Cryptococcus vaccine for use in humans would be challenging and likely need to contain multiple peptide sequences.\n\nImportanceCryptococcosis, due to infection by fungi of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex, is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons, particularly those with AIDS. Cryptococcal vaccines are a public health priority yet are not available for human use. We previously demonstrated mice could be protected from experimental cryptococcosis with vaccines composed of recombinant cryptococcal proteins encased in hollow highly purified yeast cell walls (glucan particles). Here, we examined one such protective protein, Cda2, and using bioinformatics, identified a region predicted to stimulate strong T cell responses. A peptide containing this region formulated in glucan particle-based vaccines protected mice as well as the recombinant protein. Other peptide vaccines also protected, including peptides containing sequences from proteins homologous to Cda2. These preclinical mouse studies provide a proof of principle that peptides can be effective as vaccines to protect against cryptococcosis and that bioinformatic approaches can guide peptide selection.",

    "abstract": "More than half of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) causing [~]80% of uncomplicated cases. Iron acquisition systems are essential for uropathogenesis, and UPEC encode functionally redundant iron acquisition systems, underlining their importance. However, a recent UPEC clinical isolate, HM7 lacks this functional redundancy and instead encodes a sole siderophore, enterobactin. To determine if E. coli HM7 possesses unidentified iron acquisition systems, we performed RNA-sequencing under iron-limiting conditions and demonstrated that the ferric citrate uptake system (fecABCDE and fecIR) was highly upregulated. Importantly, there are high levels of citrate within urine, some of which is bound to iron, and the fec system is highly enriched in UPEC isolates compared to environmental or fecal strains. Therefore, we hypothesized that HM7 and other similar strains use the fec system to acquire iron in the host. Deletion of both enterobactin biosynthesis and ferric citrate uptake ({Delta}entB/{Delta}fecA) abrogates use of ferric citrate as an iron source and fecA provides an advantage in human urine in absence of enterobactin. However, in a UTI mouse model, fecA is a fitness factor independent of enterobactin production, likely due to the action of host Lipocalin-2 chelating ferrienterobactin. These findings indicate that ferric citrate uptake is used as an iron source when siderophore efficacy is limited, such as in the host during UTI. Defining these novel compensatory mechanisms and understanding the nutritional hierarchy of preferred iron sources within the urinary tract are important in the search for new approaches to combat UTI.\n\nImportanceUPEC, the primary causative agent of uncomplicated UTI is responsible for five billion dollars in healthcare costs in the US each year. Rates of antibiotic resistance are on the rise therefore it is vital to understand the mechanisms of UPEC pathogenesis to uncover potential targets for novel therapeutics. Iron acquisition systems used to obtain iron from sequestered host sources are essential for UPEC survival during UTI and have been used as vaccine targets to prevent infection. This study reveals the ferric citrate uptake system is another important iron acquisition system that is highly enriched in UPEC strains. Ferric citrate uptake has not previously been associated with these pathogenic isolates, underlining the importance of the continued study of these strains to fully understand their mechanisms of pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGroup A Streptococcus (GAS) are responsible for a wide range of human-exclusive infections, annually killing more than 500,000 people. Antibiotic resistance incidence of invasive GAS tripled in the past decade and emphasises the need to develop a universal GAS vaccine. We have produced, for the first time, a recombinant polyrhamnose backbone (pRha), a validated universal GAS vaccine candidate. E. coli outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) carrying pRha were investigated for their immunogenicity and efficacy in an animal model.\n\nMethodsOMVs decorated with pRha were administered to C57BL/6J mouse and rabbit models. Flow cytometry, ELISA, Luminex, immunofluorescence microscopy and serum bactericidal assay assays were conducted to investigate the ability of pRha-specific antibodies to recognise and kill clinical (hypervirulent) GAS strains.\n\nResultsOur results suggest that pRha-OMVs induce specific antibodies which recognise Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) from S pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. Increased IgG levels correlate with increased bactericidal killing of the hypervirulent GAS M89 strain. Elevated IL-17a from pRha-OMV-immunised splenocytes indicates possible stimulation of long-term memory immune cells.\n\nConclusionWe are the first to report efficacy and potency of this unique, exogenously produced polysaccharide, pRha, in the induction of humoral-mediated immune responses to GAS.\n\nTopicStreptococcus pyogenes, immunoglobulins, polysaccharides, opsonophagocytosis, acute rheumatic fever, M protein, invasive Group A Streptococcus, hyaluronic acid",

    "abstract": "During cell division, kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) provide a physical linkage between the chromosomes and the rest of the spindle. KMTs in mammalian cells are organized into bundles, so-called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers), but the ultrastructure of these fibers is currently not well characterized. Here we show by large-scale electron tomography that each k-fiber in HeLa cells in metaphase is composed of approximately nine KMTs, only half of which reach the spindle pole. Our comprehensive reconstructions allowed us to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of k-fibers and their surrounding MTs in detail. We found that k-fibers exhibit remarkable variation in circumference and KMT density along their length, with the pole-proximal side showing a broadening. Extending our structural analysis then to other MTs in the spindle, we further observed that the association of KMTs with non-KMTs predominantly occurs in the spindle pole regions. Our 3D reconstructions have implications for KMT growth and k-fiber self-organization models as covered in a parallel publication applying complementary live-cell imaging in combination with biophysical modeling (Conway et al., 2022). Finally, we also introduce a new visualization tool allowing an interactive display of our 3D spindle data that will serve as a resource for further structural studies on mitosis in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein, a major minus-end directed microtubule motor, plays essential roles in eukaryotic cells. Drosophila oocyte growth is mainly dependent on the contribution of cytoplasmic contents from the interconnected sister cells, nurse cells. We have previously shown that cytoplasmic dynein is required for Drosophila oocyte growth, and assumed that it transports cargoes along microtubule tracks from nurse cells to the oocyte. Here we report that instead transporting cargoes along microtubules into the oocyte, cortical dynein actively moves microtubules in nurse cells and from nurse cells to the oocyte via the cytoplasmic bridges, the ring canals. We demonstrate this microtubule movement is sufficient to drag even inert cytoplasmic particles through the ring canals to the oocyte. Furthermore, replacing dynein with a minus-end directed plant kinesin linked to the actin cortex is sufficient for transporting organelles and cytoplasm to the oocyte and driving its growth. These experiments show that cortical dynein can perform bulk cytoplasmic transport by gliding microtubules along the cell cortex and through the ring canals to the oocyte. We propose that the dynein-driven microtubule flow could serve as a novel mode of cargo transport for fast cytoplasmic transfer to support rapid oocyte growth.",

The dataset includes cytological, bioenergetic, DNA methylation, gene expression, secreted proteins, mitochondrial DNA copy number and mutations, cell-free DNA, telomere length, and whole-genome sequencing data. This dataset enables the bridging of mechanistic processes of aging as outlined by the \"hallmarks of aging\", with the descriptive characterization of aging such as epigenetic age clocks. Here we focus on bridging the gap for the hallmark mitochondrial metabolism. Our dataset includes measurement of healthy cells, and cells subjected to over a dozen experimental manipulations targeting oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), glycolysis, and glucocorticoid signaling, among others.

    "abstract": "Soil microorganisms play a major role in shaping plant diversity, not only through their direct effects as pathogens, mutualists, and decomposers, but also by altering interactions between plants. In particular, previous research has shown that the soil community often generates frequency-dependent feedback loops among plants that can either destabilize species interactions, or generate stabilizing niche differences that promote species coexistence. However, recent insights from modern coexistence theory have shown that microbial effects on plant coexistence depend not only on these stabilizing or destabilizing effects, but also on the degree to which they generate competitive fitness differences. While many previous experiments have generated the data necessary for evaluating microbially mediated fitness differences, these effects have rarely been quantified in the literature. Here we present a meta-analysis of data from 50 studies, which we used to quantify the microbially mediated (de)stabilization and fitness differences derived from a classic plant-soil feedback model. Across 518 pairwise comparisons, we found that soil microbes generated both stabilization (or destabilization) and fitness differences, but also that the microbially mediated fitness differences dominated. As a consequence, if plants are otherwise equivalent competitors, the balance of soil microbe-generated (de)stabilization and fitness differences drives species exclusion much more frequently than coexistence or priority effects. Our work shows that microbially mediated fitness differences are an important but overlooked effect of soil microbes on plant coexistence. This finding paves the way for a more complete understanding of the processes that maintain plant biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid sterility is a complex phenotype that can result from the breakdown of spermatogenesis at multiple developmental stages. Here, we disentangle two proposed hybrid male sterility mechanisms in the house mice, Mus musculus domesticus and M. m. musculus, by comparing patterns of gene expression in sterile F1 hybrids from a reciprocal cross. We found that hybrid males from both cross directions showed disrupted X chromosome expression during prophase of meiosis I consistent with a loss of Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI) and Prdm9-associated sterility, but that the degree of disruption was greater in mice with an M. m. musculus X chromosome consistent with previous studies. During postmeiotic development, gene expression on the X chromosome was only disrupted in one cross direction, suggesting that misexpression at this later stage was genotype-specific and not a simple downstream consequence of MSCI disruption which was observed in both reciprocal crosses. Instead, disrupted postmeiotic expression may depend on the magnitude of earlier disrupted MSCI, or the disruption of particular X-linked genes or gene networks. Alternatively, only hybrids with a potential deficit of Sly copies, a Y-linked ampliconic gene family, showed overexpression in postmeiotic cells, consistent with a previously proposed model of antagonistic coevolution between the X and Y-linked ampliconic genes contributing to disrupted expression late in spermatogenesis. The relative contributions of these two regulatory mechanisms and their impact on sterility phenotypes awaits further study. Our results further support the hypothesis that X-linked hybrid sterility in house mice has a variable genetic basis, and that genotype-specific disruption of gene regulation contributes to overexpression of the X chromosome at different stages of development. Overall, these findings underscore the critical role of epigenetic regulation of the X chromosome during spermatogenesis and suggest that these processes are prone to disruption in hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Parental RNA interference (pRNAi) is a powerful and widely used method for gene-specific knockdown. Yet in insects its efficacy varies between species, and how the systemic RNAi response is transmitted from mother to offspring remains elusive. Using the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, we report an RT-qPCR strategy to unmask the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) distinct from endogenous mRNA. We find that the injected dsRNA is directly transmitted into the egg and persists throughout embryogenesis. Despite this depletion of dsRNA from the mother, we show that strong pRNAi can persist for months before waning at strain-specific rates. In seeking the receptor proteins for cellular uptake of long dsRNA into the egg, we lastly present a phylogenomics profiling approach to ascertain macroevolutionary distributions of candidate proteins. We demonstrate a visualization strategy based on taxonomically hierarchical assessment of orthology clustering data to rapidly assess gene age and copy number changes, refined by several lines of sequence-based evidence. We use this approach to document repeated losses of SID-1-like channel proteins in the arthropods, including wholesale loss in the Heteroptera (true bugs), which are nonetheless highly sensitive to pRNAi. Overall, we elucidate practical considerations for insect pRNAi against a backdrop of outstanding questions on the molecular mechanism of dsRNA transmission to achieve long-term, systemic knockdown.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity among cancer cells and in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is thought to be a significant contributor to the heterogeneity of clinical therapy response observed between patients and can evolve over time. A primary example of this is multiple myeloma (MM), a generally incurable cancer where such heterogeneity contributes to the persistent evolution of drug resistance. However, there is a paucity of functional assays for studying this heterogeneity in patient samples or for assessing the influence of the patient TME on therapy response. Indeed, the population-averaged data provided by traditional drug response assays and the large number of cells required for screening remain significant hurdles to advancement. To address these hurdles, we developed a suite of accessible technologies for quantifying functional drug response to a panel of therapies in ex vivo three-dimensional culture using small quantities of a patients own cancer and TME components. This suite includes tools for label-free single-cell identification and quantification of both cell division and death events with a standard brightfield microscope, an open-source software package for objective image analysis and feasible data management of multi-day timelapse experiments, and a new approach to fluorescent detection of cell death that is compatible with long-term imaging of primary cells. These new tools and capabilities are used to enable sensitive, objective, functional characterization of primary MM cell therapy response in the presence of TME components, laying the foundation for future studies and efforts to enable predictive assessment drug efficacy for individual patients.\n\nInsight BoxThe new tools and capabilities described here allow new insights into functional primary cell therapy response by (i) enabling more drugs to be tested on precious and limited numbers of patient cells ex vivo (ii) providing the ability to discriminate both cell division and death events over multiple days with single-cell resolution, and (iii) by incorporating the influences of a patients own cancer cells and TME components on drug response.",

    "abstract": "During a heart failure, higher amount of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) enzyme in the sarcolemma membrane inhibits the synthesis of second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is required for the regulation of the calcium ion balance for normal functioning of the heart. In a dependent pathway, NDPK normally phosphorylates the stimulatory guanosine diphosphate, GDP(s), to a guanosine triphosphate, GTP(s), on the heterotrimeric (, {beta} and {gamma} subunits) guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), resulting in the stimulation of the cAMP formation. In case of a heart failure, an increased quantity of NDPK also reacts with the inhibitory GDP(i), which is converted to a GTP(i), resulting in the inhibition of the cAMP formation. Typically, the {beta}{gamma} dimer of the G protein binds with hexameric NDPK-B/C complex and receives the phosphate at the residue His266 from residue His118 of NDPK-B. It is known that NDPK-C is required for NDPK-B to phosphorylate the G protein. In this work, the interactions between NDPK-B and NDPK-C are quantified in the presence and absence of graphene oxide (GO) as well as those between NDPK-B and GO through stability analysis involving hydrogen bonds, center of mass (COM), root mean square deviation (RMSD), and salt bridges, and energetics analysis involving van der Waals (VDW) and electrostatic energies. Furthermore, the role of water molecules at the interface of NDPK-B and NDPK-C as well as between NDPK-B and GO is investigated to understand the nature of interactions. It is found that the adsorption of NDPK-B on GO triggers a potential conformational change in the structure of NDPK-B, resulting in a diminished interaction with NDPK-C. This is confirmed through a reduced center of mass (COM) distance between NDPK-B and GO (from 40 A{square} to 30 A{square}) and an increased COM distance between NDPK-B and NDPK-C (from 50 A{square} to 60 A{square}). Furthermore, this is also supported by fewer salt bridges between NDPK-B and NDPK-C, and an increased number of hydrogen bonds formed by the interfacial water molecules. As NDPK-C is crucial to be complexed with NDPK-B for successful interaction of NDPK-B with the G protein, this finding shows that GO can suppress the interactions between NDPK-B/C and G proteins, thereby providing an additional insight into the role of GO in the heart failure mechanism.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWe report a novel computational understanding of the interactions between the enzymes NDPK-B and NDPK-C with GO as a potential inhibitor to such interactions and its implications. These types of interactions can play influential roles in many biochemical processes including those that take place during heart failure. A second messenger called cAMP is needed for proper cardiac contraction through the actions of NDPK-B/NDPK-C. It is needed to study the interactions between NDPK-B and NDPK-C to control the synthesis of cAMP. Towards this end, GO is tested through molecular simulations to understand the interactions between NDPK-B and NDPK-C. Influencing or modifying such enzyme active sites has been very less explored and, in this work, the molecular simulations suggest that GO is able to interact with the active site of NDPK-B to provide a sustained cAMP synthesis for longer duration. We found that conformational changes within NDPK-B and NDPK-C influence the interactions between them and such conformational changes are found to be governed by their adsorption on GO. Finally, we found the role of interfacial water molecules between NDPK-B and GO to be crucial in maintaining the interface between them.",

    "abstract": "The tubular system of cardiomyocytes plays a key role in excitation-contraction coupling. To determine the area of the tubular membrane in relation to the area of the surface membrane, indirect measurements through the determination of membrane capacitances by electrophysiological measurements are currently used in addition to microscopic methods. Unlike existing electrophysiological methods based on an irreversible procedure (osmotic shock), the proposed approach uses a reversible short-term intermittent increase in the electrical resistance of the extracellular medium. The resulting increase in the lumen resistance of the tubular system makes it possible to determine separately capacitances of the tubular and surface membranes from altered capacitive current responses to subthreshold voltage-clamped rectangular pulses. Based on the analysis of the time course of capacitive current, computational relations were derived which allow to quantify elements of the electrical equivalent circuit of the measured cardiomyocyte including both capacitances. The exposition to isotonic low-conductivity sucrose solution is reversible which is the main advantage of the proposed approach allowing repetitive measurements on the same cell under control and sucrose solutions. In addition, it might be possible to identify changes in both surface and tubular membrane capacitances caused by various interventions. Preliminary experiments in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (n = 10) resulted in values of the surface and tubular capacitances 72.3 {+/-} 16.4 and 42.1 {+/-} 14.7 pF, respectively, implying the fraction of tubular capacitance/area of 0.36 {+/-} 0.08. We conclude that the newly proposed method provides results comparable to those reported in literature and, in contrast to the currently used methods, enables repetitive evaluation of parameters describing the surface and tubular membranes. It may be used to study alterations of the tubular system resulting from various interventions including associated cardiac pathologies.\n\nAuthor summaryThe cell membrane of cardiomyocytes is invaginated forming a net of tubules through the whole cell (the tubular system). These invaginations are essential for the coordinated contraction of cardiomyocytes. Various cardiac diseases may lead to an alteration of the tubular system and vice versa alteration of the tubular system may result in cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, it is desirable to investigate the tubular membrane separately. Unfortunately, it is not easy and methods currently used for this purpose provide diverse results. The widely used detubulation methods (separating the tubular and surface membrane by an osmotic shock) are irreversible. It makes impossible repeated measurements on the same cell, thus, disabling evaluation of parameters describing the surface and tubular membranes and particularly testing changes in the tubular system. We developed an alternative approach based on the electrical separation of the tubular and surface membranes induced by exposition of the cardiomyocyte to an isotonic sucrose solution with low electrical conductivity. It allows to quantify the approximate area of the surface and tubular membrane using evaluation of electrical capacitance of both membrane areas. Measurements can be repeated several times on the same cell.",

Previously, we developed a light-gated immune receptor to probe the role of ligand kinetics in T cell antigen signaling. We found significant kinetic proofreading at the level of the signaling lipid diacylglycerol (DAG) but lacked the ability to determine where the multiple signaling steps required for kinetic discrimination originate in the upstream signaling cascade (Tischer and Weiner, 2019). Here we uncover where kinetic proofreading is executed by adapting our optogenetic system for robust activation of early signaling events. We find the strength of kinetic proofreading progressively increases from Zap70 recruitment to LAT clustering to downstream DAG generation. These data suggest a distributed kinetic proofreading mechanism, with proofreading steps both at the receptor and at downstream signaling events. Leveraging the ability of our system to rapidly disengage ligand binding, we measure slower reset rates for downstream signaling events. Our observations of distributed kinetic proofreading and slowed resetting of downstream steps suggest a basis of cooperativity between multiple active receptors with implications in tissue homeostasis, autoimmunity, and immunotherapy off-target effects.",

    "abstract": "Polyomaviruses (PyV) are ubiquitous pathogens that can cause devastating human diseases. Due to the small size of their genomes, PyV utilize complex patterns of RNA splicing to maximize their coding capacity. Despite the importance of PyV to human disease, their transcriptome architecture is poorly characterized. Here, we compare short- and long-read RNA sequencing data from eight human and non-human PyV. We provide a detailed transcriptome atlas for BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), an important human pathogen, and the prototype PyV, simian virus 40 (SV40). We identify pervasive wraparound transcription in PyV, wherein transcription runs through the polyA site and circles the genome multiple times. Comparative analyses identify novel, conserved transcripts that increase PyV coding capacity. One of these conserved transcripts encodes superT, a T antigen containing two RB-binding LxCxE motifs. We find that superT-encoding transcripts are abundant in PyV-associated human cancers. Together, we show that comparative transcriptomic approaches can greatly expand known transcript and coding capacity in one of the simplest and most well-studied viral families.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, SET8 mediated Histone H4 Lys 20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) has been implicated in regulating mitotic condensation, DNA replication, DNA damage response, and gene expression. Here we show SET8, the only known enzyme for H4K20me1 is post-translationally poly ADP-ribosylated by PARP1 on lysine residues. PARP1 interacts with SET8 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Poly ADP-ribosylation on SET8 renders it catalytically compromised, and degradation via ubiquitylation pathway. Knockdown of PARP1 led to an increase of SET8 protein levels, leading to aberrant H4K20me1 and H4K20me3 domains genome-wide. H4K20me1 is associated with higher gene transcription levels while the increase of H4K20me3 levels was predominant in DNA repeat elements correlating with modulation of chromatin states. Hence, SET8 mediated chromatin remodeling in mammalian cells are modulated by poly ADP-ribosylation by PARP1.",

    "abstract": "Prochlorococcus is one of the most abundant photosynthesizing organisms in the oligotrophic oceans. Gene content variation among Prochlorococcus populations in separate ocean basins often mirrors the selective pressures imposed by the regions distinct biogeochemistry. By pairing genomic datasets with trace metal concentrations from across the global ocean, we show that the genomic capacity for siderophore-mediated iron uptake is widespread in low-light adapted Prochlorococcus populations from iron-depleted regions of the oligotrophic Pacific and S. Atlantic oceans: Prochlorococcus siderophore consumers were absent in the N. Atlantic ocean (higher iron flux) but constituted up to half of all Prochlorococcus genomes from metagenomes in the N. Pacific (lower iron flux). Prochlorococcus siderophore consumers, like many other bacteria with this trait, also lack siderophore biosynthesis genes indicating that they scavenge exogenous siderophores from seawater. Statistical modeling suggests that the capacity for siderophore uptake is endemic to remote ocean regions where atmospheric iron fluxes are the smallest, particularly at deep chlorophyll maximum and primary nitrite maximum layers. We argue that abundant siderophore consumers at these two common oceanographic features could be a symptom of wider community iron stress, consistent with prior hypotheses. Our results provide a clear example of iron as a selective force driving the evolution of Prochlorococcus.",

    "abstract": "Adoptive cellular therapy using genetically engineered immune cells holds tremendous promise for the treatment of advanced cancers. While the number of available receptors targeting tumor specific antigens continues to grow, the current reliance on viral vectors for clinical production of engineered immune cells remains a significant bottleneck limiting translation of promising new therapies. Here, we describe an optimized methodology for efficient CRISPR-Cas9 based, non-viral engineering of primary human T cells that overcomes key limitations of previous approaches. By synergizing temporal optimization of reagent delivery, reagent composition, and integration mechanism, we achieve targeted integration of large DNA cargo at efficiencies nearing those of viral vector platforms with minimal toxicity. CAR-T cells generated using our approach are highly functional and elicit potent anti-tumor cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, our method is readily adaptable to cGMP compliant manufacturing and clinical scale-up, offering a near-term alternative to the use of viral vectors for production of genetically engineered T cells for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Age increases the risk for cognitive impairment and is the single major risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. The pathophysiological processes triggered by aging that render the brain vulnerable to dementia involve, at least in part, changes in inflammatory mediators. Here we show that lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a lipid mediator of inflammation resolution known to stimulate endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, is reduced in the aging central nervous system. We demonstrate that genetic suppression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), the enzyme mediating LXA4 synthesis, promotes learning impairment in mice. Conversely, administration of exogenous LXA4 attenuated cytokine production and memory loss induced by inflammation in mice. We further show that cerebrospinal fluid LXA4 is reduced in patients with dementia and positively associates with memory performance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and AD-linked amyloid-. Our findings suggest that reduced LXA4 levels may lead to vulnerability to age-related cognitive disorders and that promoting LXA4 signaling may comprise an effective strategy to prevent early cognitive decline in AD.",

    "abstract": "{gamma}{delta} T cells physiologically scan the intestinal epithelium, representing a substantial fraction of infiltrating lymphocytes in colorectal cancer (CRC), albeit their role in CRC remains unclear. Using murine CRC models, we found that most {gamma}{delta} T cells in pre- or non-tumor colon express V{gamma}1+ or V{gamma}7+ and exhibit a cytotoxic profile. Targeting these {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets, as well as conditionally interfering with {gamma}{delta} T cell function at early stages of tumorigenesis led to heightened tumor development, suggesting anti-CRC functions for V{gamma}1+ and V{gamma}7+ subsets. In contrast, ROR{gamma}t+ {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets, including V{gamma}4+ and microbiotadependent V{gamma}6+, accumulated during CRC progression. Conditional deletion of ROR{gamma}t or V{gamma} chains revealed redundant roles for IL-17-producing V{gamma}4+ and V{gamma}6+ {gamma}{delta} T cells in promoting tumor growth. Our results uncover pro- and anti-tumor roles for {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets.",
