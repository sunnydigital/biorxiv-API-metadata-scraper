    "abstract": "Carnivores tend to exhibit a lack of (or less pronounced) genetic structure at continental scales in both a geographic and temporal sense and this can confound the identification of post-glacial colonization patterns in this group. In this study we used genome-wide data (using Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS)) to reconstruct the phylogeographic history of a widespread carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), by investigating broad-scale patterns of genomic variation, differentiation and admixture amongst contemporary populations in Europe. Using 15,003 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 524 individuals allowed us to identify the importance of refugial regions for the red fox in terms of endemism (e.g. Iberia). In addition, we tested multiple post-glacial re-colonization scenarios of previously glaciated regions during the Last Glacial Maximum using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach that were unresolved from previous studies. This allowed us to identify the role of admixture from multiple source population post-Younger Dryas in the case of Scandinavia and ancient land-bridges in the colonization of the British Isles. A natural colonization of Ireland was deemed more likely than an ancient human-mediated introduction as has previously been proposed and potentially points to an increased mammalian fauna on the island in the early post-glacial period. Using genome-wide data has allowed us to tease apart broad-scale patterns of structure and diversity in a widespread carnivore in Europe that was not evident from using more limited marker sets and provides a foundation for next-generation phylogeographic studies in other non-model species.",

    "abstract": "Binge alcohol consumption elicits robust sympathoexcitation and excitatory neuronal output. However, the central mechanism that mediates these effects remains elusive. We investigated the effects of ethanol metabolism within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) on sympathoexcitation, and elucidated the role of acetate in these excitatory responses. In vivo arterial blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity responses to CeA microinjected ethanol or acetate with appropriate inhibitors/antagonists were tracked. In vitro whole-cell electrophysiology recording responses to acetate in CeA neurons with axon projecting to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (CeA-RVLM) were investigated, and cytosolic calcium responses in primary neuronal cultures were quantified. We demonstrate that in Sprague Dawley rats, local brain metabolism of ethanol in the CeA to acetic acid/acetate elicits sympathoexcitatory responses in vivo through activation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR). Alcohol dehydrogenase or aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition using fomepizole or cyanamide and NMDAR antagonism using AP5 or memantine blunted these effects. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices containing autonomic CeA-RVLM neurons revealed a dose-dependent increase in neuronal excitability in response to acetate. NMDAR antagonists suppressed the acetate-induced increase in CeA-RVLM neuronal excitability, and memantine suppressed the direct activation of NMDAR-mediated inward currents by acetate in brain slices. We observed that acetate increased cytosolic Ca2+ in a time-dependent manner in primary neuronal cell cultures. The acetate enhancement of calcium signaling was abolished by memantine. These findings suggest that within the CeA, ethanol is sympathoexcitatory through local brain metabolism, which generates acetic acid/acetate leading to activation of NMDAR.\n\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYBrain ethanol metabolism to acetic acid (vinegar)/acetate causes activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the central nucleus of the amygdala and elicits sympathoexcitatory responses. This excitatory mechanism is opposite to the inhibitory effects of ethanol at NMDAR. Understanding the active compounds that arise from ethanol metabolism, and the molecular mechanisms by which they influence alcohol reward and cardiovascular function, may be beneficial in developing targeted intervention strategies for both alcohol use disorder and its cardiovascular sequelae.\n\nGraphical Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=172 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/212597v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d8ec9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@996b70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5cbecaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f1cd4b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Proposed mechanisms for ethanol and acetate induced increases in sympathoexcitation within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA).

    "abstract": "Infection by SARS-CoV-2 may elicit uncontrolled and damaging inflammatory responses. Thus, it is critical to identify compounds able to inhibit virus replication and thwart the inflammatory reaction. Here, we show that the plasma levels of the immunoregulatory neuropeptide VIP are elevated in patients with severe COVID-19, correlating with reduced inflammatory mediators and with survival on those patients. In vitro, VIP and PACAP, highly similar neuropeptides, decreased the SARS-CoV-2 genome replication in human monocytes and viral production in lung epithelial cells, also reducing cell death. Both neuropeptides inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators in lung epithelial cells and in monocytes. VIP and PACAP prevented in monocytes the SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of NF-kB and SREBP1 and SREBP2, transcriptions factors involved in proinflammatory reactions and lipid metabolism, respectively. They also promoted CREB activation, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity and negative regulator of NF-kB. Specific inhibition of NF-kB and SREBP1/2 reproduced the anti-inflammatory, antiviral and cell death protection effects of VIP and PACAP. Our results support further clinical investigations of these neuropeptides against COVID-19.",

To address this practical limitation, we developed a modular vector that contains the regulatory elements from all three binary systems, enabling Gal4-, LexA- or QF-dependent expression of transgenes. Our methods also incorporate DNA elements that facilitate independent site-specific recombination and elimination of regulatory UAS, LexAop or QUAST modules with spatial and temporal control, thus offering unprecedented possibilities and logistical advantages for in vivo genetic modulation and efficient interconversion of overexpression transgenic fly lines.",

    "abstract": "The spike (S)-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 and requires proteolytic \"priming\" at PRRAR685{downarrow} into S1 and S2 (cleavage at S1/S2), and \"fusion-activation\" at a S2 site for viral entry. In vitro, Furin cleaved peptides mimicking the S1/S2 cleavage site more efficiently than at the putative S2, whereas TMPRSS2 inefficiently cleaved both sites. In HeLa cells Furin-like enzymes mainly cleaved at S1/S2 during intracellular protein trafficking, and S2 processing by Furin at KPSKR815{downarrow} was strongly enhanced by ACE2, but not for the optimized S2 KRRKR815{downarrow} mutant (S2), whereas individual/double KR815AA mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pharmacological Furin-inhibitors (Boston Pharmaceuticals, BOS-inhibitors) effectively blocked endogenous S-protein processing in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we show using pseudotyped viruses that while entry by a \"pH-dependent\" endocytosis pathway in HEK293 cells did not require Furin processing at S1/S2, a \"pH-independent\" viral entry in lung-derived Calu-3 cells was sensitive to inhibitors of Furin (BOS) and TMPRSS2 (Camostat). Consistently, these inhibitors potently reduce infectious viral titer and cytopathic effects, an outcome enhanced when both compounds were combined. Quantitative analyses of cell-to-cell fusion and spike processing revealed the key importance of the Furin sites for syncytia formation. Our assays showed that TMPRSS2 enhances fusion and proteolysis at S2 in the absence of cleavage at S1/S2, an effect that is linked to ACE2 shedding by TMPRSS2. Overall, our results indicate that Furin and TMPRSS2 play synergistic roles in generating fusion-competent S-protein, and in promoting viral entry, supporting the combination of Furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 that resulted in >5 million deaths. The spike protein (S) of the virus directs infection of the lungs and other tissues by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. For effective infection, the S-protein is cleaved at two sites: S1/S2 and S2. Cleavage at S1/S2, induces a conformational change favoring the recognition of ACE2. The S2 cleavage is critical for cell-to-cell fusion and virus entry into host cells. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of interaction between Furin and TMPRSS2 during SARS-CoV-2 entry and suggests that the combination of a non-toxic Furin inhibitor with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor could significantly reduce viral entry in lung cells, as evidenced by an average synergistic [~]95% reduction of viral infection. This represents a powerful novel antiviral approach to reduce viral spread in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 or future related coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how individual differences among organisms arise and how their effects propagate through groups of interacting individuals are fundamental questions in biology.Individual differences can arise from genetically-based variation in the conspecifics with which an individual interacts, and these effects might then be propagated to other individuals. Using a clonal species, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), we test the hypothesis that such indirect genetic effects (IGE) propagate beyond individuals that experience them firsthand. We tested this hypothesis by exposing genetically identical Amazon mollies to social partners of different genotypes, and then moving these individuals to new social groups in which they were the only member to have experienced the IGE. We found that genetically different social environments induced different levels of aggression experienced by the focal animals, and that these genetically-based social effects carried over into new social groups to influence the behavior of individuals that did not directly experience the previous social environments. Our data reveal that IGE can cascade beyond the individuals that directly experience them to influence phenotypes even when there is no genetically-based variation present within interacting groups. Theoretical and empirical expansion of the quantitative genetic framework developed for IGE to include cascading and other types of carry-over effects will improve understanding of social behavior and its evolution.",

The abundances of bacteria are a good indicator of how radiation influences the gut microbiome. The current study is an attempt towards this; thus, we have employed a public dataset (Bioproject code PRJNA368790) of 80 mice samples treated with a range of doses from 0Gy to 1Gy and feces samples were collected at different time points of post radiation treatment. Metagenomic analysis was performed on this data to understand the effect of radiation doses on the abundance of microbial species or microbial diversity implementing the DADA2 and Phyloseq pipelines. Our analyses have shown that 0.1Gy high LET radiation had the significant effect on the species of bacteria. There is a significant decrease in four types of bacteria, i.e., Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium castoris, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii, with p-value of 7.05x10-5, 0.020, 0.057and 0.020, respectively. Additionally, pathway analysis indicates the protein coding products of these bacteria are involved in the GABAergic synaptic pathway.

We aimed to develop a screening tool to detect such cases from the head MRI with performance comparable to neuroradiologists.\n\nMethodsWe leveraged 496 clinical MRI exams collected retrospectively at a single clinical site from patients referred for any reason. This diagnostic dataset was enriched to have 259 hydrocephalus cases. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on 16 manually segmented exams (ten hydrocephalus) and subsequently used to automatically segment the remaining 480 exams and extract volumetric anatomical features. A linear classifier of these features was trained on 240 exams to detect cases of hydrocephalus that required treatment with surgical intervention. Performance was compared to four neuroradiologists on the remaining 240 exams. Performance was also evaluated on a separate screening dataset of 451 exams collected from a routine clinical population to predict the consensus reading from four neuroradiologists using images alone. The pipeline was also tested on an external dataset of 31 exams from a 2nd clinical site.\n\nResultsThe most discriminant features were the Magnetic Resonance Hydrocephalic Index (MRHI), ventricle volume, and the ratio between ventricle and brain volume. At matching sensitivity, the specificity of the machine and the neuroradiologists did not show significant differences for detection of hydrocephalus on either dataset (proportions test, p > 0.05). ROC performance compared favorably with the state-of-the-art (AUC 0.90-0.96), and replicated in the external validation.\n\nConclusionHydrocephalus cases requiring treatment can be detected automatically from MRI in a heterogeneous patient population based on quantitative characterization of brain anatomy with performance comparable to that of neuroradiologists.",

While this compound was isolated from the Antarctic ascidian Synoicum adareanum, its biosynthesis has since been hypothesized to be microbially mediated, given structural similarities to microbially-produced hybrid non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide macrolides. Here, we describe a metagenome-enabled investigation aimed at identifying the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and palmerolide A-producing organism. A 74 Kbp candidate BGC encoding the multi-modular enzymatic machinery (hybrid Type I-trans-AT polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and tailoring functional domains) was identified and found to harbor key features predicted as necessary for palmerolide A biosynthesis. Surveys of ascidian microbiome samples targeting the candidate BGC revealed a high correlation between palmerolide-gene targets and a single 16S rRNA gene variant (R=0.83 - 0.99). Through repeated rounds of metagenome sequencing followed by binning contigs into metagenome-assembled genomes, we were able to retrieve a near-complete genome (10 contigs) of the BGC-producing organism, a novel verrucomicrobium within the Opitutaceae family that we propose here as Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus. The refined genome assembly harbors five highly similar BGC copies, along with structural and functional features that shed light on the host-associated nature of this unique bacterium.\n\nImportancePalmerolide A has potential as a chemotherapeutic agent to target melanoma. We interrogated the microbiome of the Antarctic ascidian, Synoicum adareanum, using a cultivation-independent high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic strategy. The metagenome-encoded biosynthetic machinery predicted to produce palmerolide A was found to be associated with the genome of a member of the S. adareanum core microbiome. Phylogenomic analysis suggests the organism represents a new deeply-branching genus, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, in the Opitutaceae family of the Verrucomicrobia phylum. The Ca. S. palmerolidicus 4.29 Mb genome encodes a repertoire of carbohydrate-utilizing and transport pathways enabling its ascidian-associated lifestyle. The palmerolide-producers genome also contains five distinct copies of the large palmerolide biosynthetic gene cluster that may provide structural complexity of palmerolide variants.",

    "abstract": "A key question in SARS-CoV-2 infection is why viral loads and patient outcomes vary dramatically across individuals. Because spatial-temporal dynamics of viral spread and immune response are challenging to study in vivo, we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus (SIMCoV), a scalable computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of lung cells, including respiratory epithelial cells and T cells. SIMCoV replicates viral growth dynamics observed in patients and shows how spatially dispersed infections can lead to increased viral loads. The model also shows how the timing and strength of the T cell response can affect viral persistence, oscillations, and control. By incorporating spatial interactions, SIMCoV provides a parsimonious explanation for the dramatically different viral load trajectories among patients by varying only the number of initial sites of infection, and the magnitude and timing of the T cell immune response. When the branching airway structure of the lung is explicitly represented, we find that virus spreads faster than in a 2D layer of epithelial cells, but much more slowly than in an undifferentiated 3D grid or in a well-mixed ODE model. These results illustrate how realistic spatially explicit computational models can improve understanding of within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nSummaryA key question in SARS-CoV-2 infection is why viral loads and patient outcomes are so different across individuals. Because its difficult to see how the virus spreads in the lungs of infected people, we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus (SIMCoV), a computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of cells, including lung cells and immune cells. SIMCoV simulates how virus grows and then declines, and the simulations match data observed in patients. SIMCoV shows that when there are more initial infection sites, the virus grows to a higher peak. The model also shows how the timing of the immune response, particularly the T cell response, can affect how long the virus persists and whether it is ultimately cleared from the lungs. SIMCoV shows that the different viral loads in different patients can be explained by how many different places the virus is initially seeded inside their lungs. We explicitly add the branching airway structure of the lung into the model and show that virus spreads slightly faster than it would in a two-dimensional layer of lung cells, but much slower than traditional mathematical models based on differential equations. These results illustrate how realistic spatial computational models can improve understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection spreads in the lung.",

    "abstract": "The brain consists of thousands of different neuronal types that are generated through multiple divisions of neuronal stem cells. These stem cells have the capacity to generate different neuronal types at different stages of their development. In Drosophila, this temporal patterning is driven by the successive expression of temporal transcription factors (tTFs). While a number of tTFs are known in different animals and across various parts of the nervous system, these have been mostly identified by informed guesses and antibody availability. We used single-cell mRNA sequencing to identify the complete series of tTFs that specify most Drosophila medulla neurons in the optic lobe. We tested the genetic interactions among these tTFs. While we verify the general principle that tTFs regulate the progression of the series by activating the next tTFs in the series and repressing the previous ones, we also identify more complex regulations. Two of the tTFs, Eyeless and Dichaete, act as hubs integrating the input of several upstream tTFs before allowing the series to progress and in turn regulating the expression of several downstream tTFs. Moreover, we show that tTFs not only specify neuronal identity by controlling the expression of cell type-specific genes. Finally, we describe the very first steps of neuronal differentiation and find that terminal differentiation genes, such as neurotransmitter-related genes, are present as transcripts, but not as proteins, in immature larval neurons days before they are being used in functioning neurons; we show that these mechanisms are conserved in humans. Our results offer a comprehensive description of a temporal series of tTFs in a neuronal system, offering mechanistic insights into the regulation of the progression of the series and the regulation of neuronal diversity. This represents a proof-of-principle for the use of single-cell mRNA sequencing for the comparison of temporal patterning across phyla that can lead to an understanding of how the human brain develops and how it has evolved.",

To probe how the visual system detects changes in the environment, functional paradigms in freely behaving mice are strongly needed. We developed and validated the first EEG-based method to investigate visual deviance detection in freely behaving mice. Mice with EEG implants were exposed to a visual deviant detection paradigm that involved changes in light intensity as standard and deviant stimuli. By subtracting the standard from the deviant evoked waveform, deviant detection was evident as bi-phasic negativity (starting around 70 ms) in the difference waveform. Additionally, deviance-associated evoked (beta/gamma) and induced (gamma) oscillatory responses were found. We showed that the results were stimulus-independent by applying a \"flip-flop\" design and the results showed good repeatability in an independent measurement. Together, we put forward a validated, easy-to-use paradigm to measure visual deviance processing in freely behaving mice.",

    "abstract": "Read alignment to genomes is a fundamental computational step used in many bioinformatic analyses, and often, it is the computational bottleneck. Therefore, it is desirable to perform the alignment step as fast as possible without compromising accuracy. Most alignment algorithms consider a seed-and-extend approach, where the time-consuming seeding step identifies and decides on candidate mapping locations. Recently, several advances have been made on seeding methods for fast sequence comparison.\n\nWe combine two such methods, syncmers and strobemers, in a novel seeding approach for constructing dynamic-sized fuzzy seeds and implement the method in a short-read aligner, strobealign. Firstly, we show that our seeding is fast to construct and effectively reduces repetitiveness in the seeding step using a novel metric E-hits. Secondly, we benchmark strobealign to traditional and recently proposed aligners on simulated and biological data and show that strobealign is several times faster than traditional aligners such as BWA and Bowtie2 at similar and sometimes higher accuracy while being both faster and more accurate than more recently proposed aligners. Our aligner can free up substantial time and computing resources needed for read alignment in many pipelines.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ksahlin/strobealign.",

Here we analyzed A.23.1, first identified in Uganda, as a P681R-containing virus several months prior to the emergence of B.1.617.2 (Delta variant). We performed assays using peptides mimicking the S1/S2 from A.23.1 and B.1.617 and observed significantly increased cleavability with furin compared to both an original B lineage (Wuhan-Hu1) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant). We also performed cell-cell fusion and functional infectivity assays using pseudotyped particles and observed an increase in activity for A.23.1 compared to an original B lineage spike. However, these changes in activity were not reproduced in the B lineage spike bearing only the P681R substitution. Our findings suggest that while A.23.1 has increased furin-mediated cleavage linked to the P681R substitution, this substitution needs to occur on the background of other spike protein changes to enable its functional consequences.",

    "abstract": "Computational models can offer mechanistic insight into cognition and therefore have the potential to transform our understanding of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. For translational efforts to be successful, it is imperative that computational measures capture individual characteristics reliably. Here we examine the reliability of reinforcement learning and economic models derived from two commonly used tasks. Healthy individuals (N=50) completed a restless four-armed bandit and a calibrated gambling task twice, two weeks apart. Reward and punishment learning rates from the reinforcement learning model showed good reliability and reward and punishment sensitivity from the same model had fair reliability; while risk aversion and loss aversion parameters from a prospect theory model exhibited good and excellent reliability, respectively. Both models were further able to predict future behaviour above chance within individuals. This prediction was better when based on participants own model parameters than other participants parameter estimates. These results suggest that reinforcement learning, and particularly prospect theory parameters, as derived from a restless four-armed bandit and a calibrated gambling task, can be measured reliably to assess learning and decision-making mechanisms. Overall, these findings indicate the translational potential of clinically-relevant computational parameters for precision psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (T cells) and natural killer cells form a tight contact, the immunological synapse (IS), with target cells, where they release their lytic granules containing perforin/granzyme and cytokine containing vesicles. During this process the cell repolarizes and moves the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) towards the IS. In the first part of our work we developed a computational model for the molecular-motor-driven motion of the MT cytoskeleton during T cell polarization and analyzed effects of cortical sliding and capture-shrinkage mechanisms. Here we use this model to analyze the dynamics of the MTOC repositioning in situations in which a) the IS is in an arbitrary position with respect to the initial position of the MTOC and b) the T cell has two IS at two arbitrary positions. In the case of one IS, we found that the initial position determines which mechanism is dominant and that the time of repositioning does not rise monotonously with the MTOC-IS distance. In the case of two IS, we observe several scenarios that have also been reported experimentally: the MTOC alternates stochastically (but with a well defined average transition time) between the two IS; it wiggles in between the two IS without transiting to one of the two; or it is at some point pulled to one of the two IS and stays there. Our model allows to predict which scenario emerges in dependency of the mechanisms in action and the number of dyneins present. We report that the presence of capture-shrinkage mechanism at least in one IS is necessary to assure the transitions in every cell configuration. Moreover, the frequency of transitions does not decrease with the distance between the two IS and is the highest when both mechanisms are present in both IS.",

    "abstract": "Research from human and animal studies has found that responding that has been successfully reduced following treatment can return upon exposure to certain contexts. An individual in recovery from alcohol use disorder, for example, might relapse to drinking upon visiting their favourite bar. However, most of these data have been derived from experiments involving a single (active) response, and the context-dependence of returned responding in situations involving choice between multiple actions and outcomes is less well-understood. We thus investigated how outcome-selective reinstatement - a procedure involving choice between multiple actions - was affected by altering the physical context in rats. In Experiment 1, rats were trained over 6 days to press a left lever for one food outcome (pellets or sucrose) and a right lever for the other outcome. Then, rats received an extinction session in either the same context (A) as lever press training, or in a different context (B). Rats were tested immediately (5 minutes) after extinction in Context A or B such that there were four groups in total: AAA, ABB, ABA, and AAB. Reinstatement testing consisted of one food outcome being delivered  freely (i.e. unearned by lever pressing and unsignalled by cues) to the food magazine every 4 minutes in the following order: Sucrose, Pellet, Pellet, Sucrose. Selective reinstatement was considered intact if pellet delivery increased pressing selectively on the pellet lever, and sucrose delivery selectively increased pressing on the sucrose lever. This result (Reinstated > Nonreinstated) was observed for rats in group AAA and ABB, but not rats in groups ABA and AAB. Experiment 2 was conducted identically, except that rats received two extinction sessions over two days and tested one day later. This time, all groups demonstrated intact outcome-selective reinstatement regardless of context. Analysis of c-Fos expression in several brain regions revealed that only c-Fos expression in the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) was related to intact reinstatement performance. Overall, these results suggest that outcome-selective reinstatement is predominantly context-independent, and that intact reinstatement is related to neuronal activity in the pDMS.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOutcome-selective reinstatement is predominantly context-independent\nC_LIO_LIOutcome-selective reinstatement is entirely context-independent after multiple extinction sessions\nC_LIO_LIOutcome-selective reinstatement increases c-Fos expression in dorsomedial striatum\nC_LIO_LIc-Fos expression in orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus is unaffected by selective reinstatement.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cell size is tightly controlled in healthy tissues, but it is poorly understood how variations in cell size affect cell physiology. To address this, we employed a high-accuracy mass spectrometry-based approach to measure how the proteome changes with cell size. Protein concentration changes are widespread, measurable in both asynchronous and G1-arrested cell populations, and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent changes in mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, protein concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced. This suggests that large size is a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA damage-, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by a similar increase in ploidy. This shows that proteome composition is determined by the DNA-to-ploidy ratio rather than cell size per se and that polyploidization is an elegant method to generate large non-senescent cells as is commonly found in nature. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology through remodeling the proteome, thereby providing a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe kinetoplastid protozoan Leishmania tropica mainly causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans in the Middle East, and relapse or treatment failure after treatment are common in this area. L. tropicas digenic life cycle includes distinct stages in the vector sandfly and the mammalian host. Sexual reproduction and genetic exchange appear to occur more frequently than in other Leishmania species. Understanding these processes is complicated by chromosome instability during cell division that yields aneuploidy, recombination and heterozygosity. This combination of rare recombination and aneuploid permits may reveal signs of hypothetical parasexual mating, where diploid cells fuse to form a transient tetraploid that undergoes chromosomal recombination and gradual chromosomal loss.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe genome-wide SNP diversity from 22 L. tropica isolates showed chromosome-specific runs of patchy heterozygosity and extensive chromosome copy number variation. All these isolates were collected during 2007-2017 in Sweden from patients infected in the Middle East and included isolates from a patient possessing two genetically distinct leishmaniasis infections three years apart with no evidence of re-infection. We found differing ancestries on the same chromosome (chr36) across multiple samples: matching the reference genome with few derived alleles, followed by blocks of heterozygous SNPs, and then by clusters of homozygous SNPs with specific recombination breakpoints at an inferred origin of replication. Other chromosomes had similar marked changes in heterozygosity at strand-switch regions separating polycistronic transcriptional units.\n\nConclusion/SignificanceThese large-scale intra- and inter-chromosomal changes in diversity driven by recombination and aneuploidy suggest multiple mechanisms of cell reproduction and diversification in L. tropica, including mitotic, meiotic and parasexual processes. It underpins the need for more genomic surveillance of Leishmania, to detect emerging hybrids that could spread more widely and to better understand the association between genetic variation and treatment outcome. Furthering our understanding of Leishmania genome evolution and ancestry will aid better diagnostics and treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L.tropica in the Middle East.\n\nAuthor SummaryCutaneous leishmaniasis is mainly caused by Leishmania tropica in the Middle East, where it is known for treatment failure and a need for prolonged and/or multiple treatments. Several factors affect the clinical presentation and treatment outcome, such as host genetic variability and specific immune response, as well as environmental factors and the vector species. Little is known about the parasite genome and its influence on treatment response. By analysing the genome of 22 isolates of L. tropica, we have revealed extensive genomic variation and a complex population structure with evidence of genetic exchange within and among the isolates, indicating a possible presence of sexual or parasexual mechanisms. Understanding the Leishmania genome better may improve future treatment and better understanding of treatment failure and relapse.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are present as communities in the environment. However, the importance of minor populations has not been well studied experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the role of Bacillus subtilis with a 1% population and its effect on co-incubated Enterococcus faecalis with a 99% population. Here we used an azo dye-decolorizing Enterococcus faecalis strain T6a1 and non-dye-decolorizing Bacillus subtilis strain S4ga. The dye decolorization assay enabled the investigation of the effects of B. subtilis S4ga on the activity of E. faecalis T6a1, even when B. subtilis S4ga was present at only 1% relative abundance or lower. We found that non-decolorizing B. subtilis S4ga enhanced the dye decolorization activity of E. faecalis T6a1, shortened the lag time of E. faecalis T6a1 to start decreasing the dye concentration, and increased the time for E. faecalis T6a1 to continue dye decolorization. These effects were correlated with redox potential values. We compared the extracellular amino acids between each incubation culture of E. faecalis T6a1 and B. subtilis S4ga, which revealed their mutual relationship by cross-feeding of specific amino acids. We also compared the intracellular primary metabolites between co-incubation and sole incubation of E. faecalis T6a1. The arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway in the co-incubated E. faecalis T6a1 was activated compared to that of E. faecalis T6a1 incubated solely. These findings explained that co-incubation with B. subtilis S4ga promoted ATP production in E. faecalis T6a1 cells to a greater extent and enhanced dye-decolorization activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study highlights the importance of minor bacterial populations and their effects on major populations. We used Enterococcus faecalis as the major population and Bacillus subtilis as the minor population. Both species are becoming increasingly important. Some strains of E. faecalis are antibiotic-resistant pathogens, show probiotic effects, or are applicable for textile wastewater treatment. Some strains of B. subtilis are known to produce antimicrobial agents, reduce intestinal inflammation, or restore gut microbiota. We demonstrated that a low abundance of B. subtilis with 1% population increased the amount of energy produced by E. faecalis with 99% population, which appeared as enhanced dye decolorization activity of dye-decolorizing E. faecalis. Metabolomic analysis suggested that E. faecalis and B. subtilis had a mutual relationship by feeding specific amino acids to each other. These results provide new insights into co-existing minor populations in microbial communities and will improve our understanding of bacterial control.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/462685v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@950ce8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1826200org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f02e5forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@749e07_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microglial activation is a hall marker of Alzheimers disease (AD); its pathogenic role and regulating mechanisms are unclear. p38-MAPK, a stress-responding kinase, is activated in AD brain in early disease stages. In APP-transgenic mice, we deleted p38-MAPK in whole myeloid cells from birth or specifically in microglia from 9 months, and analysed AD pathology at the age of 4, 9 and 12 months. In both experimental settings, p38-MAPK deficiency decreased cerebral A{beta} and improved cognitive function of AD mice; however, p38-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells were more effective than p38-MAPK-deficient microglia in preventing AD pathogenesis. Deficiency of p38-MAPK in myeloid cells inhibited the inflammatory activation of individual microglia by 4 months, but enhanced it by 9 months. Inflammatory activation was essential for p38-MAPK deficiency to promote microglial internalization of A{beta}. Interestingly, p38-MAPK deficiency in peripheral myeloid cells reduced il-17a transcription in CD4-positive spleen cells. By cross-breeding APP-transgenic mice and IL-17a knockout mice, we further observed that IL-17a deficiency activated microglia and decreased A{beta} deposits in AD mouse brain. Thus, p38-MAPK deficiency in myeloid cells prevents AD pathogenesis, perhaps through reducing IL-17a-expressing T lymphocytes, and promoting A{beta} clearance in the brain. Our study supports p38-MAPK as a novel target for AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Native transcription factor-based biosensors (TFBs) have the potential for in situ detection of value-added chemicals or byproducts. However, their industrial application is limited by their ligand promiscuity, low sensitivity, and narrow detection range. Alcohols exhibit similar structures, and no reported TFB can distinguish a specific alcohol from its analogs. Here, we engineered an alcohol-regulated transcription factor, BmoR, and obtained various mutants with remarkable properties. For example, the generated signal-molecule-specific BmoRs could distinguish the constitutional isomers n-butanol and isobutanol, with insensitivity up to an ethanol concentration of 800 mM (36.9 g/L). Linear detection of 0-60 mM of a specific higher alcohol could be achieved in the presence of up to 500 mM (23.0 g/L) ethanol as background noise. Notably, two mutants with raised outputs and over 1.0 x 107-fold higher sensitivity, and one mutant with an increased upper detection limit (14.8 g/L n-butanol or isobutanol) were screened out. Using BmoR as an example, this study systematically explored the ultimate detection limit of a TFB towards its small-molecule ligands, paving the way for in situ detection in the biofuel and wine industries.",

    "abstract": "Mitotically-stable \"epigenetic\" memory requires a mechanism for the maintenance of gene-regulatory information through the cell division cycle. Typically DNA-protein contacts are disrupted by DNA replication, but in some cases locus-specific association between DNA and overlying histones may appear to be maintained, providing a plausible mechanism for the transmission of histone-associated gene-regulatory information to daughter cells. Male Drosophila melanogaster testis germ stem cell divisions seem a clear example of such inheritance, as previously chromatin-bound Histone H3.2 proteins (presumably with their post-translational modifications intact) have been reported to be retained in the germ stem cell nuclei, while newly synthesized histones are incorporated into daughter spermatogonial chromosomes. To investigate the rate of errors in this selective partitioning that may lead to defects in the epigenetic identity of germ stem cells, we employed a photoswitchable Dendra2 moiety as a C-terminal fusion on Histones H3 (Histone H3.2 and Histone H3.3); we could thereby discriminate histones translated before photoswitching and those translated after. We found instead that male germ line stem cell divisions show no evidence of asymmetric histone partitioning, even after a single division, and thus no evidence for locus-specific retention of either Histone H3.2 or Histone H3.3. We considered alternative hypotheses for the appearance of asymmetry and find that previous reports of asymmetric histone distribution in male germ stem cells can be satisfactorily explained by asynchrony between subsequent sister stem cell and spermatogonial divisions.",

The empirically-observed dependence on blood IgG anti-receptor binding domain antibody concentration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against infection has a rational explanation in the statistics of binding of antibody to spike proteins on the virus surface, leading to blocking of binding to the receptor: namely that the probability of infection is the probability that a critical number of the spike proteins protruding from the virus are unblocked. The model is consistent with the observed antibody concentrations required to induce immunity and with the observed dependence of vaccine efficacy on antibody concentration and thus is a useful tool in the development of models to relate, for an individual person, risk of infection given measured antibody concentration. It can be used to relate population breakthrough infection risk to the distribution across the population of antibody concentration, and its variation with time.",

    "abstract": "Chitinases are enzymes that digest the polysaccharide polymer chitin. Chitin is a major component of insect exoskeletons, which must be replaced multiple times during growth and development in a process known as molting. Insect genomes usually have multiple chitinase genes, some of which are required for molting and some whose functions are still unknown. Since knockdown of the chitinases required for molting causes high levels of lethality, chitinase genes have drawn interest as targets for RNAi-based pest control methods. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, carries the bacterium that causes Huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening disease, which is devastating the citrus industry worldwide. We have identified and annotated 12 chitinase family genes from D. citri as part of a community effort to create high quality gene models to facilitate the design of interdictory molecules for pest control. Using predicted protein domain content and phylogenetic analysis, we categorized the D. citri chitinases according to a previously established classification scheme and re-evaluated the classification of chitinases in other hemipterans. In addition to chitinases belonging to known groups, we identified a novel class of chitinases present in D. citri and several related hemipterans that appears to be the result of horizontal gene transfer.",

Here we report that dopamine pulses in distinct striatal subregions convey reward prediction errors over distinct temporal scales. Dopamine dynamics systematically accelerated from ventral to dorsal-medial to dorsal-lateral striatum, in the tempo of their spontaneous fluctuations, their integration of prior rewards, and their discounting of future rewards. This spectrum of time scales for value computations can help achieve efficient learning and adaptive motivation for a wide range of behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Species tree estimation is frequently based on phylogenomic approaches that use multiple genes from throughout the genome. However, for a combination of reasons (ranging from sampling biases to more biological causes, as in gene birth and loss), gene trees are often incomplete, meaning that not all species of interest have a common set of genes. Incomplete gene trees can potentially impact the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. We, for the first time, introduce the problem of imputing the quartet distribution induced by a set of incomplete gene trees, which involves adding the missing quartets back to the quartet distribution. We present QT-GILD, an automated and specially tailored unsupervised deep learning technique, accompanied by cues from natural language processing (NLP), which learns the quartet distribution in a given set of incomplete gene trees and generates a complete set of quartets accordingly. QT-GILD is a general-purpose technique needing no explicit modeling of the subject system or reasons for missing data or gene tree heterogeneity. Experimental studies on a collection of simulated and empirical data sets suggest that QT-GILD can effectively impute the quartet distribution, which results in a dramatic improvement in the species tree accuracy. Remarkably, QT-GILD not only imputes the missing quartets but it can also account for gene tree estimation error. Therefore, QT-GILD advances the state-of-the-art in species tree estimation from gene trees in the face of missing data.

    "abstract": "Oncogenic FGFR4 signalling represents a potential therapeutic target in many cancer types, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, resistance to single-agent therapy directed at FGFR4 remains a major challenge, prompting the need to identify more effective combinatorial therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated computational network modelling and experimental validation to characterise dynamic reprogramming of the FGFR4 signalling network in TNBC following FGFR4 kinase inhibition. We found that AKT, which signals downstream of FGFR4, displayed a rapid and potent reactivation following FGFR4 targeting. Through model-based simulation and systematic prediction of the effect of co-targeting specific network nodes, we predicted, and validated experimentally, strong synergism of co-targeting FGFR4 and particular ErbB kinases or AKT, but not the upstream kinase PI3K. Further, incorporation of protein expression data from hundreds of cancer cell types enabled us to adapt our model to other diverse cellular contexts, leading to the prediction that while AKT rebound occurs frequently, it is not a general phenomenon. Instead, ERK is reactivated in a subset of cell types, including the FGFR4-driven HCC cell line Hep3B. This was subsequently corroborated, and moreover, co-targeting FGFR4 and MEK in Hep3B cells markedly enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the dynamics of drug-induced network remodelling in cancer cells, highlight the impact of protein expression heterogeneity on network response to targeted therapy and identify candidate cell type-selective combination treatments for FGFR4-driven cancer.",

    "abstract": "Studies of insect herbivory on fossilized leaves tend to focus on a few, relatively simple metrics that are agnostic to the distribution of insect damage types among host plants. More complex metrics that link particular damage types to particular host plants have the potential to address additional ecological questions, but such metrics can be biased by sampling incompleteness due to the difficulty of distinguishing the true absence of a particular interaction from the failure to detect it--a challenge that has been raised in the ecological literature. We evaluate a range of methods for characterizing the relationships between damage types and host plants by performing resampling and subsampling exercises on a variety of datasets. We found that the components of beta diversity provide a more valid, reliable, and interpretable method for comparing component communities than do bipartite network metrics. We found the rarefaction of interactions to be a valid, reliable, and interpretable method for comparing compound communities. Both beta diversity and rarefaction of interactions avoid the potential pitfalls of multiple comparisons. Lastly, we found that the host specificity of individual damage types is challenging to assess. Whereas some previously used methods are sufficiently biased by sampling incompleteness to be inappropriate for fossil herbivory data, alternatives exist that are perfectly suitable for fossil datasets with sufficient sample coverage.",

    "abstract": "Signal peptide is a short peptide located in the N-terminus of proteins. It plays an important role in targeting and transferring transmembrane proteins and secreted proteins to correct positions. Compared with traditional experimental methods to identify and discover signal peptides, the computational methods are faster and more efficient, which are more practical for the analysis of thousands or even millions of protein sequences in reality, especially for the metagenomic data. Therefore, computational tools are recently proposed to classify signal peptides and predict cleavage site positions, but most of them disregard the extreme data imbalance problem in these tasks. In addition, almost all these methods rely on additional group information of proteins to boost their performances, which, however, may not always be available. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we present Unbiased Organism-agnostic Signal Peptide Network (USPNet), a signal peptide prediction and cleavage site prediction model based on deep protein language model. We propose to use label distribution-aware margin (LDAM) loss and evolutionary scale modeling (ESM) embedding to handle data imbalance and object-dependence problems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the previous methods on the classification performance. Additional study on the simulated metagenomic data further indicates that our model is a more universal and robust tool without dependency on additional group information of proteins, with the Matthews correlation coefficient improved by up to 17.5%. The proposed method will be potentially useful to discover new signal peptides from the abundant metagenomic data.",

Here we describe an intersectional genetic approach for manipulating EEC subtypes in behaving mice. We show that multiple EEC subtypes inhibit food intake but have different effects on learning. Conditioned flavor preference is driven by release of cholecystokinin whereas conditioned taste aversion is mediated by serotonin and substance P. These positive and negative valence signals are transmitted by vagal and spinal afferents, respectively. These findings establish a cellular basis for how chemosensing in the gut drives learning about food.",

    "abstract": "The family of Phosphoprotein Phosphatases (PPPs) is responsible for most cellular serine and threonine dephosphorylation. PPPs achieve substrate specificity and selectivity by forming multimeric holoenzymes. PPP holoenzyme assembly is tightly controlled, and changes in the cellular repertoire of PPPs are linked to human disease, including cancer and neurodegeneration. For PP2A, PP4, and PP6, holoenzyme formation is in part regulated by carboxyl (C)-terminal methyl-esterification (often referred to as \"methylation\"). Here, we use mass spectrometry-based proteomics, methylation-ablating mutations, and genome editing to elucidate the role of C-terminal methylation on PP2A, PP4, and PP6 holoenzyme assembly. We find that the catalytic subunits of PP2A, PP4, and PP6 are frequently methylated in cancer cells and that deletion of the C-terminal leucine faithfully recapitulates loss of methylation. We observe that loss of PP2A methylation consistently reduced B55, B56, and B72 regulatory subunit binding in cancer and non-transformed cell lines. However, Striatin subunit binding is only affected in non-transformed cells. For PP4, we find that PP4R1 and PP4R3{beta} bind in a methylation-dependent manner. Intriguingly, loss of methylation does not affect PP6 holoenzymes. Our analyses demonstrate in an unbiased, comprehensive, and isoform-specific manner the crucial regulatory function of endogenous PPP methylation in transformed and non-transformed cell lines",

    "abstract": "Condensins compact chromosomes to promote their equal segregation during mitosis, but the mechanism of condensin engagement with and action on chromatin is incompletely understood. Here, we show that the general transcription factor TFIIH complex is continuously required to establish and maintain a compacted chromosome structure in transcriptionally silent Xenopus egg extracts. Inhibiting the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the TFIIH complex subunit XPB rapidly and reversibly induces a complete loss of chromosome structure and prevents the enrichment of condensins I and II, but not topoisomerase II, on chromatin. In addition, inhibiting TFIIH prevents condensation of both mouse and Xenopus nuclei in Xenopus egg extracts, which suggests a fundamental mechanism of TFIIH action. Reducing nucleosome density through partial histone depletion restores chromosome structure and condensin enrichment in the absence of TFIIH activity. We propose that the TFIIH complex promotes mitotic chromosome condensation by dynamically altering chromatin structure to facilitate condensin loading and condensin-dependent loop extrusion.",

    "abstract": "In humans, a family of 25 bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) mediates bitter taste perception. A common approach to characterize bitter causative agents involves expressing TAS2Rs and the appropriate signal transducers in heterologous cell systems, and monitoring changes in the intracellular free calcium levels upon ligand exposure using a fluorescence-based modality, which typically suffers from a low signal window, and is susceptible to interference by autofluorescence, therefore prohibiting its application to screening of plant or food extracts, which are likely to contain autofluorescent compounds. Here, we report the development and validation of a bioluminescence-based intracellular calcium release assay for TAS2Rs that has a better assay performance than a fluorescence-based assay. Furthermore, the bioluminescence-based assay enables the evaluation of TAS2R agonists within an autofluorescent matrix, highlighting its potential utility in the assessment of the bitterness-inducing properties of plant or food fractions by the food industry. Additionally, improvement to the bioluminescence-based assay for some TAS2Rs was achieved by altering their N-terminal signal sequences, leading to signal window enhancement. Altogether, the bioluminescence-based TAS2R assay can be used to perform functional studies of TAS2Rs, evaluate TAS2R-modulating properties of autofluorescent samples, and facilitate the discovery of compounds that can function as promising bitter taste modulators.",

    "abstract": "In CD-1 mice, gestational-only exposure to cadmium (Cd) causes female-specific hepatic insulin resistance, metabolic disruption, and obesity. To evaluate whether sex differences in cadmium uptake and changes in essential metal concentrations contribute to metabolic outcomes, placental and liver cadmium and essential metal concentrations were quantified in male and female offspring perinatally exposed to 500 ppb CdCl2. Exposure resulted in increased maternal liver Cd+2 concentrations (364 g/kg) similar to concentrations found in non-occupationally exposed human liver. At gestational day (GD) 18, placental cadmium and manganese concentrations were significantly increased in exposed males and females, and zinc was significantly decreased in females. Placental efficiency was significantly decreased in GD18 exposed males. Increases in hepatic Cd concentrations and a transient prenatal increase in zinc were observed in exposed female liver. Fetal and adult liver iron concentrations were decreased in both sexes, and decreases in hepatic zinc, iron, and manganese were observed in exposed females. Analysis of GD18 placental and liver metallothionein mRNA expression revealed significant Cd-induced upregulation of placental metallothionein in both sexes, and a significant decrease in fetal hepatic metallothionein in exposed females. In placenta, expression of metal ion transporters responsible for metal ion uptake was increased in exposed females. In liver of exposed adult female offspring, expression of the divalent cation importer (Slc39a14/Zip14) decreased, whereas expression of the primary exporter (Slc30a10) increased. These findings demonstrate that Cd can preferentially cross the female placenta, accumulate in the liver, and cause lifelong dysregulation of metal ion concentrations associated with metabolic disruption.",

So far sleep need can only be inferred by animal behaviors and indicated by electroencephalography (EEG). Here we report that threonine 221 (T221) of the salt inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) was important for the catalytic activity and stability of SIK3. T221 phosphorylation in the mouse brain indicates sleep need: more sleep resulting in less phosphorylation and less sleep more phosphorylation during daily sleep/wake cycle and after sleep deprivation (SD). Sleep need was reduced in SIK3 loss of function (LOF) mutants and by T221 mutation to alanine (T221A). Sleep rebound after SD was also decreased in SIK3 LOF and T221A mutant mice. Other kinases such as SIK1 and SIK2 or other sites in SIK3 do not fulfil criteria to be both an indicator and a controller of sleep need. Our results reveal SIK3 T221 phosphorylation as the first and only chemical modification which indicates and controls sleep need.",

Although LHA neurons innervate adipose tissues, the identity of neurons that regulate fat is undefined. Here we identify that Gabra5-positive neurons in LHA (GABRA5LHA) polysynaptically project to brown and white adipose tissues in the periphery. GABRA5LHA are a distinct subpopulation of GABAergic neurons and show decreased pacemaker firing in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Chemogenetic inhibition of GABRA5LHA suppresses energy expenditure and increases weight gain, whereas gene-silencing of Gabra5 in LHA decreases weight gain. In DIO mouse model, GABRA5LHA are tonically inhibited by nearby reactive astrocytes releasing GABA, which is synthesized by MAOB. Gene-silencing of astrocytic MAOB in LHA reduces weight gain significantly without affecting food intake, which is recapitulated by administration of a MAOB inhibitor, KDS2010. We propose that firing of GABRA5LHA facilitates energy expenditure and selective inhibition of astrocytic GABA is a molecular target for treating obesity.",

    "abstract": "After entering the host cells, Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) stays inside a modified membrane-bound compartment called Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV). The biogenesis and stability of SCV are crucial for the intracellular proliferation of Salmonella. Our research has provided a novel mechanistic view on the role of a bacterial porin OmpA in maintaining the stability of SCV. We found that the deletion of OmpA forces the bacteria to escape from the SCV during the immediate early stage of infection. In the absence of OmpA, the bacteria failed to retain the LAMP-1 and came into the host cells cytosol. Subsequently, the cytosolic population of STM{Delta} ompA activated the host autophagy machinery after colocalizing with syntaxin 17 and LC3B. The autophagosomes carrying STM{Delta} ompA were targeted to the lysosomes for degradation. Inhibition of autophagy pathway using bafilomycin A1 restored the intracellular proliferation of STM{Delta} ompA. We further showed that the four extracellular loops of OmpA played a crucial role in holding the LAMP-1 pool around the SCV. We have altered the extracellular loop sequences of Salmonella OmpA by site-directed mutagenesis and observed that the bacteria failed to maintain the LAMP-1 pool around the SCV, which finally resulted in their release into the cytosol of the host macrophages. Surprisingly, the cytosolic population of Salmonella having mutations in the extracellular loops of OmpA didnt activate the lysosomal degradation pathway like STM{Delta} ompA, which helped them to survive within the murine macrophages. In summary, our study revealed an OmpA dependent novel strategy utilized by Salmonella to combat host autophagy by promoting the stability of SCV.",

    "abstract": "Developing methods to modulate growth of the mucin-degrading gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila could benefit patients with different health needs, as A. muciniphila has been associated with both positive metabolic health outcomes and detrimental neurodegenerative outcomes. Growth of A. muciniphila is sensitive to plant-derived polyphenols, and particularly proanthocyanidins (PACs), when administered in isolated form at supraphysiological doses. However, it remains unclear whether doses sufficient for these effects are achievable via diet. Here, we explore the extent to which nutritionally relevant doses of common polyphenol-rich foods - berries, wine, and coffee - influence A. muciniphila abundance in C57BL/6J mice under varying dietary conditions. By administering polyphenol-rich whole foods, comparing polyphenol-depleted and PAC-rich versus PAC-poor food supplements, and through gradient PAC-dosing experiments, we show that PAC-rich foods uniquely induce A. muciniphila growth at doses that are feasibly achieved through routine diet. Notably, the effects of PAC supplementation were detected against a high-fat diet but not a low-fat control diet background, highlighting the importance of habitual diet strategies in either amplifying or mitigating the prebiotic effects of PAC-rich food consumption. Ultimately, our work suggests that both PACs and diet influence A. muciniphila abundance with downstream impacts for human health.",

    "abstract": "Early-life gut microbial colonization is an important process shaping host physiology, immunity and long-term health outcomes in humans and other animals. However, our understanding of this dynamic process remains poorly investigated in wild animals, where developmental mechanisms can be better understood within ecological and evolutionary relevant contexts. Using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing on 525 fecal samples from a large cohort of infant and juvenile geladas (Theropithecus gelada), we characterized gut microbiome maturation during the first three years of life and assessed the role of maternal effects in shaping offspring microbiome assembly. Microbial diversity increased rapidly in the first months of life, followed by more gradual changes until weaning. As expected, changes in gut microbiome composition and function with increasing age reflected progressive dietary transitions: in early infancy when infants rely heavily on their mothers milk, microbes that facilitate milk glycans and lactose utilization dominated, while later in development as graminoids are progressively introduced into the diet, microbes that metabolize plant complex polysaccharides became dominant. Furthermore, the microbial community of nursing infants born to first-time (primiparous) mothers was more \"milk-oriented\" compared to similarly-aged infants born to experienced (multiparous) mothers. Comparisons of matched mother-offspring fecal samples to random dyads did not support vertical transmission as a conduit for these maternal effects, which instead could be explained by slower phenotypic development (and associated slower gut microbiome maturation) in infants born to first-time mothers. Together, our findings highlight the dynamic nature of gut colonization in early life and the role of maternal effects in modulating this trajectory in a wild primate.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the factors that influence microbes environmental distributions is important for deter-mining drivers of microbial community composition. These include environmental variables like temperature and pH, and higher-dimensional variables like geographic distance and host species phylogeny. In microbial ecology, \"specificity\" is often described in the context of symbiotic or host parasitic interactions, but specificity can be more broadly used to describe the extent to which a species occupies a narrower range of an environmental variable than expected by chance. Using a standardization we describe here, Raos (1982, 2010) Quadratic Entropy can be conveniently applied to calculate specificity of a feature, such as a species, to many different environmental variables.\n\nResultsWe present our R package specificity for performing the above analyses, and apply it to four real-life microbial data sets to demonstrate its application. We found that many fungi within the leaves of native Hawaiian plants had strong specificity to rainfall and elevation, even though these variables showed minimal importance in a previous analysis of fungal beta-diversity. In Antarctic cryoconite holes, our tool revealed that many bacteria have specificity to co-occurring algal community composition. Similarly, in the human gut microbiome, many bacteria showed specificity to the composition of bile acids. Finally, our analysis of the Earth Microbiome Project data set showed that most bacteria show strong ontological specificity to sample type. Our software performed as expected on synthetic data as well.\n\nConclusionsspecificity is well-suited to analysis of microbiome data, both in synthetic test cases, and across multiple environment types and experimental designs. The analysis and software we present here can reveal patterns in microbial taxa that may not be evident from a community-level perspective.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a key role in the growth and development of the placenta, an organ essential for pregnancy in eutherian mammals. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with pregnancy pathologies. However, the mechanisms whereby placental mitochondria sense inflammatory signals at a cellular and mechanistic level are unknown. Mitochondrial Nuclear Retrograde Regulator 1 (MNRR1) is a bi-organellar protein responsible for optimal mitochondrial function to achieve energy and redox homeostasis. In addition, MNRR1 also is required for optimal induction of cellular stress-responsive signaling pathways such as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Here, in a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of placental inflammation, we show that MNRR1 levels are reduced in placental tissues and cell lines. Reduction in MNRR1 is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced oxidative stress along with activation of pro-inflammatory signaling. Mechanistically, we uncover a non-conventional pathway independent of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that results in a specific ATM kinase-dependent threonine phosphorylation and activation of a mitochondrial protease, YME1L1, degrading MNRR1. Furthermore, enhancing MNRR1 levels in placental cells either genetically or with specific activators abrogates the bioenergetic defect and induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype, suggesting that MNRR1 is upstream of the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in our model. Reduction in MNRR1 levels is a generalized phenomenon observed in cells under an inflammatory stimulus. We therefore propose MNRR1 as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic target in pathologies associated with placental inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Studying the molecular mechanisms of ovarian aging is crucial for understanding the age-related fertility issues in females. Recently, a single-cell transcriptomic roadmap of ovarian aging based on non-human primates revealed the molecular signatures of the oocytes at different developmental stages. Herein, we present the first epigenetic landscape of human ovarian aging, through an integrated analysis of the single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq. We depicted the transcriptional profiles and chromatin accessibility of the ovarian tissues isolated from old (n=4) and young (n=2) donors. The unsupervised clustering of data revealed seven distinct cell populations in the ovarian tissues and six subtypes of oocytes, which could be distinguished by age difference. Further analysis of the scATAC-seq data from the young and old oocytes revealed that the interaction between the Notch signaling pathway and AP-1 family transcription factors may crucially determine oocyte aging. Finally, a machine-learning algorithm was applied to calculate the optimal model based on the single-cell dataset for predicting oocyte aging, which exhibited excellent accuracy with a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristics score of 0.99. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of human ovarian aging at both the transcriptomic and epigenetic levels, based on an integrated analysis of large-scale single-cell datasets. We believe our results will shed light on the discovery of potential therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers for age-related ovarian disorders.",

This process results in the sequential accumulation of regularly spaced insertion mutations at a synthetic locus. Accumulated insertions are permanent throughout editing because peCHYRON uses a prime editor that avoids cutting both DNA strands, which risks deletions. Editing continues indefinitely because each insertion adds the complete sequence needed to initiate the next step. Constitutively expressed pegRNAs generate insertion patterns that support straightforward reconstruction of cell lineage relationships.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine; 5mC) is a repressive gene-regulatory mark required for vertebrate embryogenesis. Genomic 5mC is tightly regulated through the coordinated action of DNA methyltransferases, which deposit 5mC, and TET enzymes, which participate in its active removal through the formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). TET enzymes are essential for mammalian gastrulation and activation of vertebrate developmental enhancers, however, to date, a clear picture of 5hmC function, abundance, and genomic distribution in non-vertebrate lineages is lacking. By employing base-resolution 5mC and 5hmC quantification during sea urchin and lancelet embryogenesis, we shed light on the roles of non-vertebrate 5hmC and TET enzymes. We find that these invertebrate deuterostomes employ TET enzymes for targeted demethylation of regulatory regions associated with developmental genes and show that the complement of identified 5hmC-regulated genes is conserved to vertebrates. This work thus demonstrates that active 5mC removal from regulatory regions is a common feature of deuterostome embryogenesis suggestive of unexpected deep conservation of a major gene-regulatory module.",

    "abstract": "The RNA binding protein Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a potent activator of mRNA decay, specifically for transcripts bearing AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3'-untranslated regions. TTP functions as a mediator for mRNA decay by interacting with the decay machinery and recruiting it to the target ARE-mRNA. In this study, we report a weak, but direct interaction between TTP and the human decapping enzyme DCP2, which impacts the stability of ARE-transcripts. The TTP-DCP2 interaction is unusual as it involves intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of both binding partners. We show that the IDR of DCP2 has a propensity for oligomerization and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. Binding of TTP to DCP2 leads to its partitioning into phase-separated droplets formed by DCP2, suggesting that molecular crowding might facilitate the weak interaction between the two proteins and enable assembly of a decapping-competent mRNA-protein complex on TTP-bound transcripts in cells. Our studies underline the role of weak interactions in the cellular interaction network and their contribution towards cellular functionality.",

The main difference between Mesowestern and traditional Western is that semi-dry horizontal instead of immersed vertical gel electrophoresis is used. The linear range of detection is approximately 2 orders of magnitude, with a limit of detection (for {beta}-actin) of around 30 ng of total protein from mammalian cell lysates (~30-3000 cells).

ANKLE1 is molecularly characterized as an endonuclease that efficiently cuts branched DNA and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the role of ANKLE1 in mammalian development and homeostasis remains unknown. In normal development ANKLE1 expression is limited to the erythroblast lineage and we found that ANKLE1s role is to cleave the mitochondrial genome during erythropoiesis. We show that ectopic expression of ANKLE1 in breast epithelial-derived cells leads to genome instability and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cleavage. mtDNA degradation then leads to mitophagy and causes a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (Warburg effect). Moreover, mtDNA degradation activates STAT1 and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes. Reduction in mitochondrial content contributes to apoptosis resistance, which may allow precancerous cells to avoid apoptotic checkpoints and proliferate. These findings provide evidence that ANKLE1 is the causal cancer susceptibility gene in the chr19p13.1 locus and describe mechanisms by which higher ANKLE1 expression promotes cancer risk.",

We find that different bacteria dramatically modulate tamoxifen toxicity in C. elegans, with a three-order of magnitude difference between animals fed Escherichia coli, Comamonas aquatica, and Bacillus subtilis. Remarkably, host fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis mitigates tamoxifen toxicity, and different bacteria provide the animal with different FAs, resulting in distinct FA profiles. Surprisingly these bacteria modulate tamoxifen toxicity by different death mechanisms, some of which are modulated by FA supplementation and others by antioxidants. Together, this work reveals a complex interplay between microbiota, FA metabolism and tamoxifen toxicity that may provide a blueprint for similar studies in more complex mammals.",

We show that insects feeding on resistant plants take longer to establish a feeding site and have their feeding duration suppressed two-fold compared with insects feeding on susceptible plants. Our results reveal that the underlying traits contributing towards resistant phenotypes are conserved across plant families, deployed against taxonomically diverse insect groups, and that the underlying resistance mechanisms are conserved.

Until now, there has been limited evidence that GzmA/B proteins contribute to combating intracellular bacterial pathogens in mammals. Here, we find that the route of infection of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reveals the distinct roles that Granzymes play in defending against bacterial infection. We used Gzma-/-Gzmb-/- mice to discover that Granzymes are required to protect mice against oral infection with Salmonella. However, Granzymes do not play a role in systemic infection. We investigated the tissue-specific expression of Granzymes and determined that intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are the only cell types that express Granzymes in healthy non-infected mice. In fact, IEL are sufficient to mediate the protective effects of Granzymes against Salmonella infection. Intriguingly, we found that GzmA and GzmB play opposing roles in Salmonella control, with GzmA being protective against infection whilst GzmB promoted infection. Both GzmA and GzmB proteins functioned independently of the pore-forming molecule Perforin, suggesting extracellular action. Our study reveals that IEL-expressed Granzymes play significant and distinct functions in host defense from oral bacterial infection.",

Elevated genetically determined body mass index (BMI) and lipid levels decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, explaining consistent with clinical observations associating obesity and anemia. However, lipid-related effects were confined to erythroid traits, whereas BMI affected multiple blood lineages, indicating broad effects on hematopoiesis. BMI-related effects were unexpectedly opposed by truncal adipose distribution, which increased hemoglobin and blood cell counts across lineages. Conditional analyses indicated genes, pathways, and cell types responsible for these effects, including Leptin Receptor and other blood cell-extrinsic factors in adipocytes and endothelium, which regulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell biology.

Recently, genome sequencing has identified elevated densities of tumour somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in lncRNA genes. However, this has been attributed to phenotypically-neutral \"passenger\" processes, and the existence of positively-selected fitness-altering \"driver\" SNVs acting via lncRNAs has not been addressed. We developed and used ExInAtor2, an improved driver-discovery pipeline, to map pancancer and cancer-specific mutated lncRNAs across an extensive cohort of 2583 primary and 3527 metastatic tumours. The 54 resulting lncRNAs are mostly linked to cancer for the first time. Their significance is supported by a range of clinical and genomic evidence, and display oncogenic potential when experimentally expressed in matched tumour models. Our results revealed a striking SNV hotspot in the iconic NEAT1 oncogene, which was ascribed by previous studies to passenger processes. To directly evaluate the functional significance of NEAT1 SNVs, we used in cellulo mutagenesis to introduce tumour-like mutations in the gene and observed a consequent increase in cell proliferation in both transformed and normal backgrounds. Mechanistic analyses revealed that SNVs alter NEAT1 ribonucleoprotein assembly and boost subnuclear paraspeckles. This is the first experimental evidence that mutated lncRNAs can contribute to the pathological fitness of tumour cells.",

    "abstract": "Actin is one of the key structural components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton that regulates cellular architecture and mechanical properties. Dynamic regulation of actin filament length and organization is essential for the control of many physiological processes including cell adhesion, motility and division. While previous studies have mostly focused on the mechanisms controlling the mean length of individual actin filaments, it remains poorly understood how distinct actin filament populations in cells maintain different lengths using the same set of molecular building blocks. Here we develop a theoretical model for the length regulation of multiple actin filaments by nucleation and growth rate modulation by actin binding proteins in a limiting pool of monomers. We first show that spontaneous nucleation of actin filaments naturally leads to heterogeneities in filament length distribution. We then investigate the effects of filament growth inhibition by capping proteins and growth promotion by formin proteins on filament length distribution. We find that filament length heterogeneity can be increased by growth inhibition, whereas growth promoters do not significantly affect length heterogeneity. Interestingly, a competition between filament growth inhibitors and growth promoters can give rise to bimodal filament length distribution as well as a highly heterogeneous length distribution with large statistical dispersion. We quantitatively predict how heterogeneity in actin filament length can be modulated by tuning F-actin nucleation and growth rates in order to create distinct filament subpopulations with different lengths.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEActin filaments organize into different functional network architectures within eukaryotic cells. To maintain distinct actin network architectures, it is essential to regulate the lengths of actin filaments. While the mechanisms controlling the lengths of individual actin filaments have been extensively studied, the regulation of length heterogeneity in actin filament populations is not well understood. Here we show that the modulation of actin filament growth and nucleation rates by actin binding proteins can regulate actin length distribution and create distinct sub-populations with different lengths. In particular, by tuning concentrations of formin, profilin and capping proteins, various aspects of actin filament length distribution can be controlled. Insights gained from our results may have significant implications for the regulation of actin filament length heterogeneity and architecture within a cell.",

The condition is commonly acquired secondary to diseases such as cancer or the therapies associated with it. The primary driving force for fluid return through the lymphatic vasculature is provided by contractions of the muscularized lymphatic collecting vessels, driven by electrical oscillations. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the molecular and bioelectric mechanisms involved in lymphatic muscle cell excitation, hampering the development and use of pharmacological therapies. Modelling in silico has contributed greatly to understanding the contributions of specific ion channels to the cardiac action potential, but modelling of these processes in lymphatic muscle remains limited. Here, we propose a model of oscillations in the membrane voltage (M-clock) and intracellular calcium concentrations (C-clock) of lymphatic muscle cells. We modify a model by Imtiaz and colleagues to enable the M-clock to drive the C-clock oscillations. This approach differs from typical models of calcium oscillators in lymphatic and related cell types, but is required to fit recent experimental data. We include an additional voltage dependence in the gating variable control for the L-type calcium channel, enabling the M-clock to oscillate independently of the C-clock. We use phase-plane analysis to show that these M-clock oscillations are qualitatively similar to those of a generalised FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We also provide phase plane analysis to understand the interaction of the M-clock and C-clock oscillations. The model and methods have the potential to help determine mechanisms and find targets for pharmacological treatment of lymphoedema.",

    "abstract": "Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII) is an essential player in long-term potentiation and memory formation. However, the establishment of effective molecular interventions with CaMKII to improve memory remains a long-standing challenge. Here we report a novel intrabody targeting GluN1, a subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We identify this anti-GluN1 intrabody (termed VHH Anti-GluN1; VHHAN1) by a synthetic phage display library selection and yeast-two-hybrid screenings. We validate specific targeting of VHHAN1 to GluN1 in heterologous cells and the mouse hippocampus. We further show that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of CaMKII fused with VHHAN1 is locally enriched at excitatory postsynaptic regions of the mouse hippocampus. We also find that the AAV- and VHHAN1-mediated postsynaptic enrichment of CaMKII in the hippocampus improves contextual fear memory in mice. This novel approach opens a new avenue to enhance memory ability in health and diseases.",

    "abstract": "The mTOR pathway is an essential regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties and whether they act together or independently is unknown. Here we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. As mTOR is involved in several brain disorders caused by dopaminergic dysregulation including Parkinsons disease and addiction, our results have implications for understanding the pathophysiology and potential therapeutic strategies for these diseases.",

    "abstract": "While midbrain dopamine (DA) neuronal circuits are central to motivated behaviors, much remains unknown about our knowledge of how these circuits are modified over time by experience to facilitate selective aspects of experience-dependent plasticity. Most studies of the DA system in drug addiction focus on the role of the mesolimbic DA pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in facilitating drug-associated reward. In contrast, less is known about how midbrain DA cells and associated circuits contribute to negative affective states including anxiety that emerge during protracted withdrawal from drug administration. Here, we demonstrate the selective role of a midbrain DA projection to the amygdala (VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala) for anxiety that develops during protracted withdrawal from cocaine administration but does not participate in cocaine reward or sensitization. Our rabies virus-mediated circuit mapping approach revealed a persistent elevation in spontaneous and task-related activity of GABAergic cells from the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) and downstream VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala cells that could be detected even after a single cocaine exposure. Activity in BNSTGABA cells was related to cocaine-induced anxiety but not reward or sensitization, and silencing the projection from these cells to the midbrain was sufficient to prevent the development of anxiety during protracted withdrawal following cocaine administration. We observed that VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala cells, but not other midbrain DA cells, were strongly activated after a challenge exposure to cocaine, and found that activity in these cells was necessary for the expression of reinstatement of cocaine place preference. Lastly, the importance of activity in VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala cells extends beyond cocaine, as these cells mediate the development of anxiety states triggered by morphine and a predator odor. Our results provide an exemplar for how to identify key circuit substrates that contribute to behavioral adaptations and reveal a critical role for BNSTGABA[-&gt;]VTADA[-&gt;]Amygdala pathway in anxiety states induced by drugs of abuse or natural experiences as well as cocaine-primed reinstatement of conditioned place preference.",

    "abstract": "Falling asleep at the wrong time can place an individual at risk of immediate physical harm. However, not sleeping degrades cognition and adaptive behavior. To understand how animals match sleep need with environmental demands, we used live-brain imaging to examine the physiological response properties of the Drosophila sleep homeostat (dFB) following interventions that modify sleep (sleep deprivation, starvation, time-restricted feeding, memory consolidation). We report that dFB neurons can distinguish between different types of waking and can change their physiological response-properties accordingly. That is, dFB neurons are not simply passive components of a hard-wired circuit. Rather, the dFB neurons themselves can determine their response to the activity from upstream circuits. Finally, we show that the dFB appears to contain a memory trace of prior exposure to metabolic challenges induced by starvation or time-restricted feeding. Together these data highlight that the sleep homeostat is plastic and suggests an underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Associative brain centers, such as the insect mushroom body, need to represent sensory information in an efficient manner. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body integrate inputs from a random set of olfactory projection neurons, but some projection neurons -- namely those activated by a few ethologically meaningful odors -- connect to Kenyon cells more frequently than others. This biased and random connectivity pattern is conceivably advantageous, as it enables the mushroom body to represent a large number of odors as unique activity patterns while prioritizing the representation of a few specific odors. How this connectivity pattern is established remains largely unknown. Here, we test whether the mechanisms patterning the connections between Kenyon cells and projection neurons depend on sensory activity or whether they are hardwired. We mapped a large number of mushroom body input connections in anosmic flies -- flies lacking the obligate odorant co-receptor Orco -- and in wildtype flies. Statistical analyses of these datasets reveal that the random and biased connectivity pattern observed between Kenyon cells and projection neurons forms normally in the absence of most olfactory sensory activity. This finding supports the idea that even comparatively subtle, population-level patterns of neuronal connectivity can be encoded by fixed genetic programs and are likely to be the result of evolved prioritization of ecologically and ethologically salient stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Wnt signalling is an evolutionary conserved signal transduction pathway heavily implicated in normal development and disease. The central mediator of this pathway, {beta}-catenin, is frequently overexpressed, mislocalised and overactive in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) where it mediates the establishment, maintenance and drug resistance of leukaemia stem cells. Critical to the stability, localisation and activity of {beta}-catenin are the protein-protein interactions it forms, yet these are poorly defined in AML. We recently performed the first {beta}-catenin interactome study in blood cells of any kind and identified a plethora of novel interacting partners. This study shows for the first time that {beta}-catenin interacts with Wilms tumour protein (WT1), a protein frequently overexpressed and mutated in AML, in both myeloid cell lines and also primary AML samples. We demonstrate crosstalk between the signalling activity of these two proteins in myeloid cells, and show that modulation of either protein can affect expression of the other. Finally, we demonstrate that WT1 mutations frequently observed in AML can increase stabilise {beta}-catenin and augment Wnt signalling output. This study has uncovered new context-dependent molecular interactions for {beta}-catenin which could inform future therapeutic strategies to target this dysregulated molecule in AML.\n\nArticle summaryO_LI{beta}-Catenin is frequently dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and protein interactions govern its stability, localization and activity, but these are poorly defined in AML.\nC_LIO_LIThis study shows for the first time that {beta}-catenin and Wilms tumour protein (WT1) interact and influence each others expression level and signalling activity in AML cells, which could inform future therapeutic strategies.\nC_LI",
