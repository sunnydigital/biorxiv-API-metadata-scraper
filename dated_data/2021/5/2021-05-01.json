    "abstract": "Nociceptive and pruriceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) convey sensations of pain and itch to the spinal cord, respectively. One subtype of mature DRG neurons, comprising about 5% of neurons in the ganglia, is responsible for sensing mediators of acute itch and atopic dermatitis, including the cytokine IL-31. How itch-sensitive (pruriceptive) neurons are specified is unclear. Here we show that Tmem184b, a gene with roles in axon degeneration and nerve terminal maintenance, is required for the expression of a large cohort of itch receptors, including those for IL-31, Leukotriene C4, and Histamine. Male and female mice lacking Tmem184b show reduced responses to IL-31, but maintain normal responses to pain and mechanical force, indicating a specific behavioral defect in pruriception. Calcium imaging experiments indicate that a reduction in IL-31 induced calcium entry is a likely contributor to this phenotype. We identify an early failure of proper Wnt-dependent transcriptional signatures and signaling components in Tmem184b mutant mice that may explain the improper DRG neuronal subtype specification. Accordingly, lentiviral re-expression of Tmem184b in mutant embryonic neurons restores Wnt signatures. Together, these data demonstrate that Tmem184b promotes adult somatosensation through developmental Wnt signaling and promotion of proper pruriceptive gene expression. Our data illuminate a new key regulatory step in the processes controlling the establishment of diversity in the somatosensory system.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of the peripheral sensory adaptation response were compared to a simple mathematical relationship involving the spontaneous, peak and steady-state activities. This relationship is based on the geometric mean and is found to be obeyed to good approximation in peripheral sensory units showing a sustained response to prolonged stimulation. From an extensive review of past studies, the geometric mean relationship is shown to be independent of modality and is satisfied in a wide range of animal species. The consilience of evidence, from nearly one hundred years of experiments beginning with the work of Edgar Adrian, suggests that this is a fundamental result of neurophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas spp. exhibit considerable differences in host specificity and virulence. Most Pseudomonas species were isolated exclusively from environmental sources, ranging from soil to plants, but some Pseudomonas species have been detected from versatile sources, including both human host and environmental sources. Understanding genome variations that generate the tremendous diversity in Pseudomonas biology is important in controlling the incidence of infections. With a data set of 704 Pseudomonas complete whole genome sequences representing 186 species, Pseudomonas intrageneric structure was investigated by hierarchical clustering based on average nucleotide identity, and by phylogeny analysis based on concatenated core-gene alignment. Further comparative functional analyses indicated that Pseudomonas species only living in natural habitats lack multiple functions that are important in the regulation of bacterial pathogenesis, indicating the possession of these functions might be characteristic of Pseudomonas human pathogens. Moreover, we have performed pangenome based homogeneity analyses, and detected genes with conserved structures but diversified functions across the Pseudomonas genomes, suggesting these genes play a role in driving diversity. In summary, this study provided insights into the dynamics of genome diversity and host-related genetic determinants in Pseudomonas, which might help the development of more targeted antibiotics for the treatment of Pseudomonas infections.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant cleavage of Notch by {gamma}-secretase is implicated in numerous diseases, but how cleavage is regulated in space and time is unclear. Here, we report that cadherin-based adherens junctions (cadAJs) are sites of high cell-surface {gamma}-secretase activity, as well as sites of constrained physical space that excludes {gamma}-secretase substrates having large extracellular domains (ECDs) like Notch. ECD shedding initiates drastic spatial relocalization of Notch to cadAJs, allowing enzyme-substrate interactions and downstream signaling. Spatial mutations by adjusting the ECD size or the physical constraint alter signaling. Dysregulation of this spatial switch promotes precocious differentiation of ventricular zone neural progenitor cells in vivo. We show the generality of this spatial switch for amyloid precursor protein proteolysis. Thus, cadAJs create spatially distinct biochemical compartments regulating cleavage events involving {gamma}-secretase and preventing aberrant activation of receptors.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryNotch cleavage by {gamma}-secretase is regulated through dynamic spatial control of receptors, adhesion molecules, and activating proteases",

We present an alignment method uLTRA based on a novel two-pass collinear chaining algorithm. Furthermore, uLTRA can be used both as a stand-alone aligner and as a wrapper around minimap2 for improved alignments in gene regions. We show that uLTRA produces higher accuracy over state-of-the-art aligners with substantially higher accuracy for small exons on simulated and synthetic data. On biological data where true read location is unknown, we show several examples where uLTRA aligns to known and novel isoforms with exon structures that are not detected with other aligners. uLTRA is available at https://github.com/ksahlin/ultra.",

    "abstract": "Repeating structures forming regular patterns are common in sounds. Learning such patterns may enable accurate perceptual organization. In five experiments, we investigated the behavioral and neural signatures of rapid perceptual learning of regular sound patterns. We show that recurring (compared to novel) patterns are detected more quickly and increase sensitivity to pattern deviations and to the temporal order of pattern onset relative to a visual stimulus. Sustained neural activity reflected perceptual learning in two ways. Firstly, sustained activity increased earlier for recurring than novel patterns when participants attended to sounds, but not when they ignored them; this earlier increase mirrored the rapid perceptual learning we observed behaviorally. Secondly, the magnitude of sustained activity was generally lower for recurring than novel patterns, but only for trials later in the experiment, and independent of whether participants attended to or ignored sounds. The late manifestation of sustained activity reduction suggests that it is not directly related to rapid perceptual learning, but to a mechanism that does not require attention to sound. In sum, we demonstrate that the latency of sustained activity reflects rapid perceptual learning of auditory patterns, while the magnitude may reflect a result of learning, such as better prediction of learned auditory patterns.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by desire to understand pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology, scientists have developed models of pulmonary physiology. However, pathophysiology and interactions between human lungs and ventilators, e.g., ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), present problems for modeling efforts. Real-world injury is too complex for simple models to capture, and while complex models tend not to be estimable with clinical data, limiting both the clinical utility with existing approaches. To address this gap, we present a damaged-informed lung ventilator (DILV) model to model and quantify patient-ventilator interactions and lung health. This approach relies on systematically mathematizing the pathophysiologic knowledge clinicians use to interpret lung condition from ventilator waveform data. This is achieved by defining clinically relevant features in the ventilator waveform data that contain hypothesis-driven information about pulmonary physiology, patient-ventilator interaction, and ventilator settings. To capture these features, we develop a modelling framework where the model has enough flexibility to reproduce commonly observed variability in waveform data. We infer the model parameters with clinical (human) and laboratory (mouse) data. The DILV model can reproduce essential dynamics of differently damaged lungs for tightly controlled measurements in mice and uncontrolled human intensive care unit data in the absence and presence of respiratory effort. Estimated parameters correlate with known measures of lung physiology, including lung compliance. This method has the potential to translate laboratory physiology experiments to clinical applications, including pathways for high fidelity estimates of lung state and sources of VILI with an end goal of reducing the impact of VILI and acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

We consider the effect of using a misspecified site-independent model on the accuracy of Bayesian phylogenetic inference in the setting of pairwise-site epistasis. Previous work has shown that as alignment length increases, tree reconstruction accuracy also increases. Here, we present a simulation study demonstrating that accuracy increases with alignment size even if the additional sites are epistatically coupled. We introduce an alignment-based test statistic that is a diagnostic for pair-wise epistasis and can be used in posterior predictive checks.",

    "abstract": "Within populations, some individuals tend to exhibit a bold or shy social behavior phenotype relative to the mean. The neural underpinnings of these differing phenotypes - also described as syndromes, personalities, and coping styles - is an area of ongoing investigation. Although a social decision-making network has been described across vertebrate taxa, most studies examining activity within this network do so in relation to exhibited differences in behavioral expression. Our study instead focuses on constitutive gene expression in bold and shy individuals by isolating baseline gene expression profiles that influence social boldness predisposition, rather than those reflecting the results of social interaction and behavioral execution. We performed this study on male green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), an established model organism for behavioral research, which provides a crucial comparison group to investigations of birds and mammals. After identifying subjects as bold or shy through repeated reproductive and agonistic behavior testing, we used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression profiles between these groups within various forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions. The ventromedial hypothalamus had the largest group differences in gene expression, with bold males having increased expression of neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter receptor and calcium channel genes compared to shy males. Conversely, shy males express more integrin alpha-10 in the majority of examined regions. There were no significant group differences in physiology or hormone levels. Our results highlight the ventromedial hypothalamus as an important center of behavioral differences across individuals and provide novel candidates for investigations into the regulation of individual variation in social behavior phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Emerin is an integral nuclear envelope protein participating in the maintenance of nuclear shape. When mutated or absent, emerin causes X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). To define how emerin takes parts in molecular scaffolding at the nuclear envelope and helps protect the nucleus against mechanical stress, we established its nanoscale organization using single molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy. We show that emerin monomers form localized oligomeric nanoclusters stabilized by both lamin A/C and SUN1 at the LINC complex. Interactions of emerin with nuclear actin and BAF additionally modulate its membrane mobility and its ability to oligomerize. In nuclei subjected to mechanical challenges, the mechanotransducing functions of emerin are coupled to changes in its oligomeric state, and the incremental self-assembly of emerin determines nuclear shape adaptation against forces. We also show that the abnormal nuclear envelope deformations induced by EDMD emerin mutants stem from an improper formation of lamin A/C and LINC complex-stabilized emerin oligomers. These findings place emerin at the center of the molecular processes that regulate nuclear shape remodeling in response to mechanical challenges.",

The recently available high-resolution environmental predictors, along with recently developed methods enable to increase the eligibility of narrow-ranging species for SDMs, provided their distribution is well known. We fill a gap of knowledge on the effect of predicted climate change on narrow-ranging species. We modelled the distribution of the golden mantella frog Mantella aurantiaca and the Manapany day gecko Phelsuma inexpectata, for which the distribution of their occurrence records is well documented. Our modelling scheme included a range of processes susceptible to address statistical issues related to narrow-ranging species. We predict an alarming decline in climate suitability in the whole current distribution area of both species by 2070, potentially leading to a complete extinction in most scenarios. We identified the areas with the best climate suitability in the future, but these remain largely suboptimal regarding species climatic niche. The high level of habitat fragmentation suggests that both species likely need to be at least partly translocated. Climate change may not only drive range contractions or distribution shifts in narrow-ranging species, but may lead to the complete extirpation of suitable environments across their entire region. This study suggests that the level of threats of narrow-ranging species already identified as threatened may be underestimated, especially in heterogeneous tropical areas. We stress the need to develop sampling campaigns and implement proactive actions for narrow-ranging species in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "Most ectotherms obey the temperature-size rule, meaning they grow larger in a colder environment. This raises the question of how the interplay between genes and temperature affect the body size of ectotherms. Despite the growing body of literature on the physiological life-history and molecular genetic mechanism underlying the temperature-size rule, the overall genetic architecture orchestrating this complex phenotype is not yet fully understood. One approach to identify genetic regulators of complex phenotypes is Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping. Here, we explore the genetic architecture of body size phenotypes, and plasticity of body-size phenotypes in different temperatures using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model ectotherm. We used 40 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from N2 and CB4856, which were reared at four different temperatures (16{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C, 24{degrees}C, and 26{degrees}C) and measured at two developmental stages (L4 and adult). The animals were measured for body length, width at vulva, body volume, length/width ratio, and seven other body-size traits. The genetically diverse RILs varied in their body-size phenotypes with heritabilities ranging from 0.0 to 0.99. We detected 18 QTL underlying the body-size traits across all treatment combinations, with the majority clustering on Chromosome X. We hypothesize that the Chromosome X QTL could result from a known pleiotropic regulator - npr-1 - known to affect the body size of C. elegans through behavioral changes. We also found five plasticity QTL of body-size which three of them colocalized with some body-size QTL at certain temperature. In conclusion, our findings shed more light on multiple loci affecting body size plasticity and the possibility of co-regulation of traits and traits plasticity by the same loci under different environment.",

    "abstract": "Brain signal decoding promises significant advances in the development of clinical brain computer interfaces (BCI). In Parkinsons disease (PD), first bidirectional BCI implants for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) are now available. Brain signal decoding can extend the clinical utility of adaptive DBS but the impact of neural source, computational methods and PD pathophysiology on decoding performance are unknown. This represents an unmet need for the development of future neurotechnology. To address this, we developed an invasive brain-signal decoding approach based on intraoperative sensorimotor electrocorticography (ECoG) and subthalamic LFP to predict grip-force, a representative movement decoding application, in 11 PD patients undergoing DBS. We demonstrate that ECoG is superior to subthalamic LFP for accurate grip-force decoding. Gradient boosted decision trees (XGBOOST) outperformed other model architectures. ECoG based decoding performance negatively correlated with motor impairment, which could be attributed to subthalamic beta bursts in the motor preparation and movement period. This highlights the impact of PD pathophysiology on the neural capacity to encode movement kinematics. Finally, we developed a connectomic analysis that could predict grip-force decoding performance of individual ECoG channels across patients by using their connectomic fingerprints. Our study provides a neurophysiological and computational framework for invasive brain signal decoding to aid the development of an individualized precision-medicine approach to intelligent adaptive DBS.\n\nSignificance StatementNeurotechnology will revolutionize the treatment of neurological and psychiatric patients, promising novel treatment avenues for previously intractable brain disorders. However, optimal surgical and computational approaches and their interactions with neurological disorders are unknown. How can recent advances in machine learning and connectomics aid the precision and performance of invasive brain signal decoding strategies? Do the brain disorders treated with such approaches have impact on decoding performance? We propose a real time compatible advanced machine learning pipeline for invasively recorded brain signals in Parkinsons disease (PD) patients. We report optimal movement decoding strategies with respect to signal source, model architecture and connectomic fingerprint and demonstrate that PD pathophysiology significantly and negatively impacts movement decoding. Our study has broad impacts for the development of smart brain implants for the treatment of PD and other brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "The human definitive yolk sac is an important organ supporting the early developing embryo through nutrient supply and by facilitating the establishment of the embryonic circulatory system. However, the molecular and cellular biology of the human yolk sac remains largely obscure due to the lack of suitable in vitro models. Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) co-cultured with various types of stromal cells as spheroids self-organize into yolk sac-like organoids without the addition of exogenous factors. Yolk sac-like organoids recapitulated a yolk sac specific cellular complement and structures as well as the functional ability to generate definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Furthermore, sequential hemato-vascular ontogenesis could be observed during organoid formation. Notably, our organoid system can be performed in a scalable, autologous, and xeno-free condition, thereby providing an important model of human definitive yolk sac development and allows for efficient bulk generation of hiPSC-derived HPCs.",

    "abstract": "Stress-induced cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) into tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) occurs across organisms from yeast to human, yet its mechanistic bases and pathological consequences remain poorly defined. By performing genome-wide small RNA profiling, we detected increased abundance of a Cysteine tRNA fragment (5-tRFCys) during breast cancer metastatic progression. 5-tRFCys is required for efficient breast cancer metastatic lung colonization and metastatic cell survival. We identified Nucleolin as the direct binding partner of 5-tRFCys. 5-tRFCys binding enhanced the stability of Nucleolins associated pro-metastatic transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes Mthfd1l and Pafah1b1. 5-tRFCys stabilized these transcripts by promoting Nucleolin oligomerization and the assembly of Nucleolin and its bound transcripts into a higher-order ribonucleoprotein complex. Our findings reveal that a tRF can promote oligomerization of an RNA binding protein into a stabilizing ribonucleoprotein complex containing specific target transcripts, thereby driving specific metabolic pathways underlying cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMost genomes harbor a large number of transposons, and they play an important role in evolution and gene regulation. They are also of interest to clinicians as they are involved in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Although several methods for transposon identification are available, they are often highly specialised towards specific tasks or classes of transposons, and they lack common standards such as a unified taxonomy scheme and output file format. Moreover, many methods are difficult to install, poorly documented, and difficult to reproduce.\n\nResultsWe present TransposonUltimate, a powerful bundle of three modules for transposon classification, annotation, and detection of transposition events. TransposonUltimate comes as a Conda package under the GPL-3.0 licence, is well documented and it is easy to install. We benchmark the classification module on the large TransposonDB covering over 891,051 sequences to demonstrate that it outperforms the currently best existing solutions. The annotation and detection modules combine sixteen existing softwares, and we illustrate its use by annotating Caenorhabditis elegans, Rhizophagus irregularis and Oryza sativa subs. japonica genomes. Finally, we use the detection module to discover 29,554 transposition events in the genomes of twenty wild type strains of Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nAvailabilityRunning software and source code available on https://github.com/DerKevinRiehl/TransposonClassifierRFSB.

Execution of experiments to cover all possible combinations of perturbations is infeasible. In this paper, we present the host response model (HRM), a machine learning approach that takes the cell response to single perturbations as the input and predicts the whole cell transcriptional response to the combination of inducers. We find that the HRM is able to qualitatively predict the directionality of dysregulation to a combination of inducers with an accuracy of >90% using data from single inducers. We further find that the use of known prior, known cell regulatory networks doubles the predictive performance of the HRM (an R2 from 0.3 to 0.65). This tool will significantly reduce the number of high-throughput sequencing experiments that need to be run to characterize the transcriptional impact of the combination of perturbations on the host.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing and cataloging genetic parts are critical to the design of useful genetic circuits. Having well-characterized parts allows for the fine-tuning of genetic circuits, such that their function results in predictable outcomes. With the growth of synthetic biology as a field, there has been an explosion of genetic circuits that have been implemented in microbes to execute functions pertaining to sensing, metabolic alteration, and cellular computing. Here, we show a cost-effective and rapid method for characterizing genetic parts. Our method utilizes cell-free lysate, prepared in-house, as a medium to evaluate parts via the expression of a reporter protein. Template DNA is prepared by PCR-amplification using inexpensive primers to add variant parts to the reporter gene, and the template is added to the reaction as linear DNA without cloning. Parts that can be added in this way include promoters, operators, ribosome binding sites, insulators, and terminators. This approach, combined with the incorporation of an acoustic liquid handler and 384-well plates, allows the user to carry out high-throughput evaluations of genetic parts in a single day. By comparison, cell-based screening approaches require time-consuming cloning and have longer testing times due to overnight culture and culture density normalization steps. Further, working in cell-free lysate allows the user to exact tighter control over the expression conditions through the addition of exogenous components, or by titrating DNA concentrations rather than relying on limited plasmid copy numbers. Because this method retains a cell-like environment, the function of the genetic part will typically mimic its function in whole cells.\n\nSUMMARYWell-characterized genetic parts are necessary for the design of novel genetic circuits. Here we describe a cost-effective, high-throughput method for rapidly characterizing genetic parts. Our method reduces cost and time by combining cell-free lysates, linear DNA to avoid cloning, and acoustic liquid handling to increase throughput and reduce reaction volumes.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous host protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), is an essential regulator of cellular transcription and functions to maintain epigenetic boundaries, stabilise chromatin loops and regulate splicing of alternative exons. We have previously demonstrated that CTCF binds to the E2 open reading frame (ORF) of human papillomavirus (HPV) 18 and functions to repress viral oncogene expression in undifferentiated keratinocytes by co-ordinating an epigenetically repressed chromatin loop within HPV episomes. Cellular differentiation, which is necessary for HPV life cycle completion disrupts CTCF-dependent chromatin looping of HPV18 episomes inducing enhanced activity of the HPV18 early promoter P105 and increased viral oncogene expression.\n\nTo further characterise CTCF function in HPV transcription control we utilised direct, long-read Nanopore RNA-sequencing which provides information on the structure and abundance of full-length transcripts. Nanopore analysis of primary human keratinocytes containing HPV18 episomes before and after synchronous differentiation allowed quantification of viral transcript species in these cultures, including the identification of low abundance novel transcripts. Comparison of transcripts produced in wild type HPV18 genome-containing cells to those identified in CTCF-binding deficient genome-containing cells (HPV18-{Delta}CTCF) identifies CTCF as a key regulator of differentiation-dependent late promoter activation, required for efficient E1^E4 and L1 protein expression. Furthermore, our data show that CTCF binding at the E2 ORF of HPV18 promotes usage of the downstream weak splice donor (SD) sites SD3165 and SD3284, to the dominant E4 splice acceptor site at nucleotide 3434. These findings demonstrate importance of CTCF-dependent transcription regulation at multiple stages of the HPV life cycle.\n\nIMPORTANCEOncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the cause of a subset of epithelial cancers of the uterine cervix, other anogenital areas and the oropharynx. HPV infection is established in the basal cells of epithelia where a restricted programme of viral gene expression is required for replication and maintenance of the viral episome. Completion of the HPV life cycle is dependent on the maturation (differentiation) of infected cells which induces enhanced viral gene expression and induction of capsid production. We previously reported that the host cell transcriptional regulator, CTCF, is hijacked by HPV to control viral gene expression. In this study, we use long-read mRNA sequencing to quantitatively map the variety and abundance of HPV transcripts produced in early and late stages of the HPV life cycle and to dissect the function of CTCF in controlling HPV gene expression and transcript processing.",

    "abstract": "Three prevalent SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) were emerged and caused epidemic waves. It is essential to uncover the key genetic changes that cause the high transmissibility of VOCs. However, different viral mutations are generally tightly linked so traditional population genetic methods may not reliably detect beneficial mutation. In this study, we proposed a new pandemic-scale phylogenomic approach to detect mutations crucial to transmissibility. We analyzed 3,646,973 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and the epidemiology metadata. Based on the sequential occurrence order of mutations and the instantaneously accelerated furcation rate, the analysis revealed that two non-coding mutations at the position of 28271 (g.a28271-/t) might be crucial for the high transmissibility of Alpha, Delta and Omicron VOCs. Both two mutations cause an A-to-T change at the core Kozak site of the N gene. The analysis also revealed that the non-coding mutations (g.a28271-/t) alone are unlikely to cause high viral transmissibility, indicating epistasis or multilocus interaction in viral transmissibility. A convergent evolutionary analysis revealed that g.a28271-/t, S:P681H/R and N:R203K/M occur independently in the three-VOC lineages, suggesting a potential interaction among these mutations. Therefore, this study unveils that non-synonymous and non-coding mutations could affect the transmissibility synergistically.",

AngII binding to orthosteric pocket in the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) induces G protein and {beta}-arrestin signaling. AT1R blocking drugs and {beta}-arrestin biased ligands also bind to the orthosteric pocket but evoke different inactive and active states1-6. AT1R-directed auto-antibodies observed in preeclampsia bound outside the orthosteric pocket to extracellular loop-2 (ECL2) of AT1R7-9. How auto-antibodies modulate AT1R activity causing preeclampsia pathogenesis is unknown. Here we report a druggable cryptic allosteric pocket encompassing the preeclampsia epitope on ECL2. Using structure based high-throughput small molecule screening we discovered 18 ligands specific for AT1Rs allosteric pocket. After procuring these ligands we validated inhibition of preeclampsia epitope-specific antibody binding. We characterize their inhibitory effect on antibody and AngII-signaling in cells and vasoconstriction ex vivo. These novel AT1R allosteric ligands, thus act as dual action negative modulators of auto-antibody action and vasoconstriction. Our study demonstrates that positive allosteric modulator action of auto-antibody causes a disease linked to AT1R. We anticipate our findings to kindle structure-based discovery of AT1R allosteric ligands for intervention in maladies such as preeclampsia7-10, rejection of organ transplants11, vasodilatory shock12, 13 and metabolic syndrome14.",

    "abstract": "Lassa virus (LASV) is an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus that causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever, for which there are limited treatment options. Successful LASV entry requires the viral glycoprotein 1 (GP1) to undergo a receptor switch from its primary receptor alpha-dystroglycan (-DG) to its endosomal receptor lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1). A conserved histidine triad in LASV GP1 has been reported to be responsible for receptor switch. To test the hypothesis that other non-conserved residues also contribute to receptor switch, we constructed a series of GP1 mutant proteins and tested them for binding to LAMP1. Four residues, L84, K88, L107, and H170, were identified as critical for receptor switch. Substituting any of the four residues with the corresponding lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus residue (L84N, K88E, L10F, and H170S) reduced the binding affinity of GP1LASV for LAMP1. Moreover, all the mutations caused decreases in GPC-mediated membrane fusion at both pH 4.5 and 5.2. The infectivity of pseudotyped viruses bearing either GPCL84N or GPCK88E decreased sharply in multiple cell types, whereas L107F and H170S had only mild effects on infectivity. Notably, in LAMP1 knockout cells, all four mutants showed reduced pseudovirus infectivity. Using biolayer light interferometry assay, we found that all four mutants had decreased binding affinity to LAMP1, in the order L84N > L107F > K88E > H170S.\n\nIMPORTANCELassa virus requires pH-dependent receptor switch to infect host cells; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this process are not well known. Here, we identify four residues, L84, K88, L107, and H170 that contribute to the interaction with the second receptor lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1). Mutant any of the four residues would impair the binding affinity to LAMP1, decrease the glycoprotein mediated membrane fusion, and reduce the pseudovirus infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes chronic infections like cystic fibrosis, endocarditis, bacteremia and sepsis, which are life-threatening and difficult to treat. The lack of antibiotic response in P. aeruginosa is due to adaptive resistance mechanism, which prevents the entry of antibiotics into cytosol of the cell to achieve tolerance. Among different groups of antibiotics, aminoglycosides are used as a parental antibiotic for treatment of P. aeruginosa. This study aims to determine the kinetics of antibiotic tolerance and gene expression changes in P. aeruginosa exposed to amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. These antibiotics were exposed to P. aeruginosa at their MICs and the experimental setup was monitored till 72 hours, followed by the measurement of optical density in the interval of every 12 hours. The growth of P. aeruginosa in MICs of antibiotics represents the kinetics of antibiotic tolerance in amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Transcriptomic profile of antibiotic exposed P. aeruginosa PA14 was taken from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), NCBI as microarray datasets. The gene expressions of two datasets were compared by test versus control. Tobramycin exposed P. aeruginosa failed to develop tolerance in MICs 0.5{micro}g/mL, 1{micro}g/mL and 1.5{micro}g/mL. Whereas amikacin and gentamicin treated P. aeruginosa developed tolerance in MICs. This depicts the superior in vitro response of tobramycin over the gentamicin and amikacin. Further, in silico transcriptomic analysis of tobramycin treated P. aeruginosa resulted in low expression of 16s rRNA Methyltransferase E, B & L, alginate biosynthesis genes and several proteins of Type 2 Secretory System (T2SS) and Type 3 Secretory System (T3SS). The Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) of alginate biosynthesis, and RNA Methyltransferases suggests increased antibiotic response and low probability of developing resistance. The use of tobramycin as a parental antibiotic with its synergistic combination might combat P. aeruginosa with increased response.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus infections are a global concern, with increasing cases of resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus haemolyticus found circulating in the Middle East. While extensive surveys have described the prevalence of resistant infections in Europe, Asia, and North America, the population structure of resistant staphylococcal Middle Eastern clinical isolates is poorly characterized. We performed whole genome sequencing of 56 S. aureus and 10 S. haemolyticus isolates from Alexandria Main University Hospital. Supplemented with additional publicly available genomes from the region (34 S. aureus and 6 S. haemolyticus), we present the largest genomic study of staphylococcal Middle Eastern isolates. These genomes include 20 S. aureus multilocus sequence typing (MLST) types and 9 S. haemolyticus MLSTs, including 3 and 1 new MLSTs, respectively. Phylogenomic analyses of each species core genome largely mirrored MLSTs, irrespective of geographical origin. The hospital-acquired spa t037/SCCmec III/MLST CC8 clone represented the largest clade, comprising 22% of S. aureus isolates. Similar to other regional genome surveys of S. aureus, the Middle Eastern isolates have an open pangenome, a strong indicator of gene exchange of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes with other reservoirs. We recommend stricter implementation of antibiotic stewardship and infection control plans in the region.\n\nImpact StatementStaphylococci are under-studied despite their prevalence within the Middle East. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is endemic to hospitals in this region, as are other antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus and S. haemolyticus. To provide insight into the strains currently in circulation within Egypt, we performed whole genome sequencing of 56 S. aureus and 10 S. haemolyticus isolates from Alexandria Main University Hospital (AMUH). Through analysis of these genomes, as well as other genomes of isolates from the Middle East, we were able to produce a more complete picture of the current diversity than traditional molecular typing strategies.

    "abstract": "Mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is the executioner in the caspase-independent form of programmed cell death called necroptosis. Receptor Interacting serine/threonine Protein Kinase 3 (RIPK3) phosphorylates MLKL, triggering MLKL oligomerization, membrane translocation and membrane disruption. MLKL also undergoes ubiquitylation during necroptosis, yet neither the mechanism nor significance of this event have been demonstrated. Here we show that necroptosis-specific, multi-mono-ubiquitylation of MLKL occurs following its activation and oligomerization. Ubiquitylated MLKL accumulates in a digitonin insoluble cell fraction comprising plasma/organellar membranes and protein aggregates. This ubiquitylated form is diminished by a plasma membrane located deubiquitylating enzyme. MLKL is ubiquitylated on at least 4 separate lysine residues once oligomerized, and this correlates with proteasome- and lysosome-dependent turnover. Using a MLKL-DUB fusion strategy, we show that constitutive removal of ubiquitin from MLKL licences MLKL auto-activity independent of necroptosis signalling in mouse and human cells. Therefore, besides its role in the kinetic regulation of MLKL-induced death following an exogenous necroptotic stimulus, ubiquitylation also contributes to the restraint of basal levels of activated MLKL to avoid errant cell death.",

    "abstract": "During mycoparasitism, a fungus--the host--is parasitized by another fungus--the mycoparasite. The genetic underpinnings of these relationships have been best characterized in ascomycete fungi. However, within basidiomycete fungi, there are rare instances of mushroom-forming species parasitizing the reproductive structures, or sporocarps, of other mushroom-forming species, which have been rarely investigated on a genetic level. One of the most enigmatic of these occurs between Entoloma abortivum and species of Armillaria, where hyphae of E. abortivum are hypothesized to disrupt the development of Armillaria sporocarps, resulting in the formation of carpophoroids. However, it remains unknown whether carpophoroids are the direct result of a mycoparasitic relationship. To address the nature of this unique interaction, we analyzed gene expression of field-collected Armillaria and E. abortivum sporocarps and carpophoroids. Transcripts in the carpophoroids are primarily from E. abortivum, supporting the hypothesis that this species is parasitizing Armillaria. Most notably, we identified differentially upregulated E. abortivum {beta}-trefoil-type lectins in the carpophoroid, which we hypothesize bind to Armillaria cell wall galactomannoproteins, thereby mediating recognition between the mycoparasite and the host. The most differentially upregulated E. abortivum transcripts in the carpophoroid code for oxalate decarboxylases--enzymes that degrade oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is a virulence factor in many plant pathogens, including Armillaria species, however, E. abortivum has evolved a sophisticated strategy to overcome this defense mechanism. The number of gene models and genes that code for carbohydrate-active enzymes in the E. abortivum transcriptome were reduced compared to other closely related species, perhaps as a result of the specialized nature of this interaction.\n\nIMPORTANCEBy studying fungi that parasitize other fungi, we can understand the basic biology of these unique interactions. Studies focused on the genetic mechanisms regulating mycoparasitism between host and parasite have thus far concentrated on a single fungal lineage within the Ascomycota. The work presented here expands our understanding of mycoparasitic relationships to the Basidiomycota and represents the first transcriptomic study to our knowledge that examines fungal-fungal relationships in their natural setting. The results presented here suggest that even distantly related mycoparasites utilize similar mechanisms to parasitize their host. Given that species of the mushroom-forming pathogen Armillaria cause plant root-rot diseases in many agroecosystems, an enhanced understanding of this interaction may contribute to better control of these diseases through biocontrol applications.",

    "abstract": "Host-parasite interactions represent complex co-evolving systems in which genetic variation within a species can significantly affect selective pressure on traits in the other (for example via inter-species indirect genetic effects). While often viewed as a two-species interaction between host and parasite species, some systems are more complex due to the involvement of symbionts in the host that influence its immunity, enemies of the host, and the parasite through intraguild predation. However, it remains unclear what the joint effects of intraguild predation, defensive endosymbiosis, within-species genetic variation and indirect genetic effects on host immunity are. We have addressed this question in an important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi due to immunity conferring endosymbiotic bacteria. In a complex experiment involving a quantitative genetic design of the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator, we demonstrate that aphid immunity is affected by intraspecific genetic variation in the parasitoid and the aphid, as well as by associated differences in the defensive endosymbiont communities. Using 16s rRNA sequencing, we identified secondary symbionts that differed between the lineages. We further show that aphid lineages differ in their altruistic behaviour once parasitised whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate predation. The outcome of these complex between-species interactions not only shape important host-parasite systems but have also implications for understanding the evolution of multitrophic interactions, and aphid biocontrol.",

    "abstract": "Large body sizes have evolved structures to facilitate resource transport. Like unitary organisms, social insect colonies must transport information and resources. Colonies with more individuals may experience transport challenges similar to large-bodied organisms. In ant colonies, transport occurs in the nest, which may consist of structures that facilitate movement. We examine three attributes of nests that might have evolved to mitigate transport challenges related to colony size: (1) subdivision - nests of species with large colonies are more subdivided to reduce crowd viscosity; (2) branching - nest tunnels increase branching in species with large colonies to reduce travel distances; and (3) short-cuts - nests of species with large colonies have cross-linking tunnels to connect distant parts of the nest and create alternative routes. We test these hypotheses by comparing nest structures of species with different colony sizes in phylogenetically controlled meta-analyses. Our findings support the hypothesis that nest subdivision and branching evolved to mitigate transport challenges related to colony size. Nests of species with large colonies contain more chambers and branching tunnels. The similarity in how ant nests and bodies of unitary organisms have evolved in response to increasing size suggests common solutions across taxa and levels of biological organization.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of scaling relationships, allometric scaling, has a long history of importance for modelling and predicting biological phenomena. Individual organisms are not truly independent, and as a result phylogenetic corrections are necessary to increase the accuracy of scaling relationships. The relationships between body mass and gestation length have not been previously reported at the Family level, as it was previously thought species had insufficient time to diverge evolutionarily leaving phylogenetic corrections unnecessary. Using a Carnivora supertree, we perform a phylogenetically generalised least squares (PGLS) analysis using life history information largely from the Pantheria dataset. Our results suggest that allometric relationships are maintained in four families: Canidae, Felidae, Herpestidae and Otariidae. Conversely, several evolutionary mechanisms may contribute to the lack of a significant scaling parameter in other families, such as diverse reproductive strategies or positive selection for genes affecting adiposity. In addition, low sample sizes or the inclusion of paternal body masses could alter the presence of significant scaling. Our results suggests that PGLS analyses are informative at the family level, and the absence of scaling can provide insight to understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that work on the family taxonomic level or below.\n\nCCS CONCEPTS* Applied computing [-&gt;] Molecular evolution; * Computing methodologies [-&gt;] Modeling methodologies.\n\nACM Reference FormatStefanie Navaratnam and Julie Baker Phillips. 2021.

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide expression changes occur during heart failure, including reactivation of fetal-specific isoforms. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the extent to which a fetal gene program switch occurs remains unclear. Limitations hindering transcriptome-wide analyses of alternative splicing differences (i.e. isoform switching) in cardiovascular system (CVS) tissues between fetal and adult (healthy and diseased) stages have included both cellular heterogeneity across bulk RNA-seq samples and limited availability of fetal tissue for research. To overcome these limitations, we have deconvoluted the cellular compositions of 996 RNA-seq samples representing heart failure, healthy adult (heart and arteria), and fetal-like (iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells) CVS tissues. Comparison of the expression profiles revealed that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are highly overexpressed in fetal-like compared with healthy adult and are reactivated in heart failure, which results in expression of thousands fetal-specific isoforms. Of note, isoforms for 20 different RBPs were among those that reverted in heart failure to the fetal-like expression pattern. We determined that, compared with adult-specific isoforms, fetal-specific isoforms are more likely to bind RBPs, have canonical sequences at their splice sites and encode proteins with more functions. Our findings suggest targeting RBP fetal-specific isoforms could result in novel therapeutics for heart failure.",

Sequence analysis of streptococcal Cas9 sequences revealed conservation of three distinct PAM-interacting motifs, with phylogenetic analysis of full-length Cas9 and the PID demonstrating that PAM-interacting domain (PID) domain swapping was extensively utilized to diversify its PAM specificity. An extended analysis of 582 representative Cas9 sequences revealed that this PID swapping was broadly present in most of the investigated genera. Mimicking the natural PID domain swapping, a functional chimeric enzyme, based on the scaffold of compact Staphylococcus aureus Cas9, with novel NNAAAA PAM specificity was developed. In summary, our findings shed new light on a rich source of exchangeable PID domains in Cas9 genes, which can be mined for domain swapping aiming to an effective PAM refinement.",

We asked whether sacral SCS could be used to target the lower urinary tract. Here we show that high-density epidural SCS over the sacral spinal cord and cauda equina of anesthetized cats evokes responses in nerves innervating the bladder and urethra and that these nerves can be activated selectively. Sacral epidural SCS always recruited the pelvic and pudendal nerves and selectively recruited these nerves in all but one animal. Individual branches of the pudendal nerve were always recruited as well. Electrodes that selectively recruited specific peripheral nerves were spatially clustered on the arrays, suggesting anatomically organized sensory pathways. This selective recruitment demonstrates a mechanism to directly modulate bladder and urethral function through known reflex pathways, which could be used to restore bladder and urethral function after injury or disease.",

Similarly, calculating the size of individual objects may also take some time. We present an open-source program to determine the size of objects under a microscope using Python and OpenCV. Taking photos of a stage micrometer under a microscope, we identify gradations on the micrometer and calculate the distance between lines on the micrometer in pixels. From this, we can infer the size of objects from bright-field microscopy images.

We address this gap and present a proof-of-concept study for classifying fungal taxa using linked machine learning classifiers. We demonstrate the capability of linked machine learning classifiers to accurately classify species and strains using real-world and simulated fungal ribosomal DNA datasets, including plant and human pathogens. We benchmark our new approach in comparison to current alignment and k-mer based methods based on synthetic mock communities. We also assess real world applications of species identification in complex unlabelled datasets.\n\nResultsOur machine learning approach assigned individual nanopore long-read amplicon sequences to fungal species with high recall rates and low false positive rates. Importantly, our approach successfully distinguished between closely-related species and strains when individual read errors were higher than the genetic distance between individual taxa, which the alignment and k-mer methods could not do. The machine learning approach showed an ability to identify key species with high recall rates, even in complex samples of unknown species composition.\n\nConclusionsA proof of concept machine learning approach using a tree-descent approach on a decision tree of classifiers can identify known taxa with high accuracy, and precisely detect known target species from complex samples with high recall rates. We propose this approach is suitable for detecting the known knowns of pathogens or invasive species in any environment of mostly unknown composition, including agriculture and wild ecosystems.",

These associations are heavily confounded by socio-economic characteristics, such as household income and parents educational attainment, amongst other factors. In this study, we report observational and causal effects of habitual diet on school performance, using individual level data for 9,220 adolescents in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986. For this purpose, we derived principal components for the dietary variables, meal patterns and school performance variables. The observational study showed a significant association of consumption of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) with poor performance in all school subjects, and an association of consumption of healthy foods and traditional foods with good school performance in general subjects, science and physical education (PE). Moreover, a positive association was observed between not skipping breakfast and good performance in all school subjects. Mendelian randomisation analysis confirmed a negative effect of HFSS on school performance in general/science subjects (-0.080, -0.128 to -0.033) and a positive effect of healthy food on school performance in general/science subjects (0.071, 0.024 to 0.119) and PE (0.065, 0.021 to 0.110). To conclude, we identified compelling evidence that HFSS foods and healthy foods were causally affecting school performance.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing methods based on Group II introns (known as Targetron technology) have been long used as a gene knock-out strategy in a wide range of organisms in a fashion independent of homologous recombination. Yet, their utility as delivery systems has been typically suboptimal because of their reduced efficiency of insertion when they carry exogenous sequences. We show that this limitation can be tackled and Targetron adapted as a general tool in Gram-negative bacteria. To this end, a set of broad host range standardized vectors were designed for conditional expression of the Ll.LtrB intron. After testing the correct functionality of these plasmids in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, we created a library of Ll.LtrB variants carrying cargo DNA sequences of different lengths to benchmark the capacity of intron-mediated delivery in these bacteria. Next, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-facilitated counterselection to increase the chances of finding genomic sites inserted with the thereby engineered introns. By following this pipeline, we were able to insert exogenous sequences of up to 600 bp at specific genomic locations in wild-type P. putida KT2440 and its {Delta}recA derivative. Finally, we were able to apply this technology to successfully tag this strain with an orthogonal short sequence (barcode) that acts as a unique identifier for tracking this microorganism in biotechnological settings. The results with P. putida exemplified the value of the Targetron approach for unrestricted delivery of small DNA fragments to the genomes of Gram-negative bacteria for a suite of genome editing endeavours.",

    "abstract": "The ability to comprehend phrases is an essential integrative property of the brain. Here we evaluate the neural processes that enable the transition from single word processing to a minimal compositional scheme. Previous research has reported conflicting timing effects of composition, and disagreement persists with respect to inferior frontal and posterior temporal contributions. To address these issues, 19 patients (10 male, 19 female) implanted with penetrating depth or surface subdural intracranial electrodes heard auditory recordings of adjective-noun, pseudoword-noun and adjective-pseudoword phrases and judged whether the phrase matched a picture. Stimulus-dependent alterations in broadband gamma activity, low frequency power and phase-locking values across the language-dominant left hemisphere were derived. This revealed a mosaic located in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), in which closely neighboring cortical sites displayed exclusive sensitivity to either lexicality or phrase structure, but not both. Distinct timings were found for effects of phrase composition (210-300 ms) and pseudoword processing (approximately 300-700 ms), and these were localized to neighboring electrodes in pSTS. The pars triangularis and temporal pole encode anticipation of composition in broadband low frequencies, and both regions exhibit greater functional connectivity with pSTS during phrase composition. Our results suggest that the pSTS is a highly specialized region comprised of sparsely interwoven heterogeneous constituents that encodes both lower and higher level linguistic features. This hub in pSTS for minimal phrase processing may form the neural basis for the human-specific computational capacity for forming hierarchically organized linguistic structures.\n\nSignificanceLinguists have claimed that the integration of multiple words into a phrase demands a computational procedure distinct from single word processing. Here, we provide intracranial recordings from a large patient cohort, with high spatiotemporal resolution, to track the cortical dynamics of phrase composition. Epileptic patients volunteered to participate in a task in which they listened to phrases (\"red boat\"), word-pseudoword or pseudoword-word pairs (e.g., \"red fulg\"). At the onset of the second word in phrases, greater broadband high gamma activity was found in posterior superior temporal sulcus in electrodes that exclusively indexed phrasal meaning, and not lexical meaning. These results provide direct, high-resolution signatures of minimal phrase composition in humans, a potentially species-specific computational capacity.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinsons disease, who lose the dopaminergic projections to the striatum, are impaired in certain aspects of motor learning. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to its role in motor performance, the striatum plays a key role in the memory of motor learning. Whether Parkinsons patients have impaired motor memory and whether motor memory is modulated by dopamine at the time of initial learning is unknown. To address these questions, we measured memory of a learned motor sequence in Parkinsons patients who were either On or Off their dopaminergic medications. We compared them to a group of older and younger controls. Contrary to our predictions, motor memory was not impaired in patients compared to older controls, and was not influenced by dopamine state at the time of initial learning. To probe post-learning consolidation processes, we also tested whether learning a new sequence shortly after learning the initial sequence would interfere with later memory. We found that, in contrast to younger adults, neither older adults nor patients were susceptible to this interference. These findings suggest that motor memory is preserved in Parkinsons patients and raise the possibility that motor memory in patients is supported by compensatory non-dopamine sensitive mechanisms. Furthermore, given the similar performance characteristics observed in the patients and older adults and the absence of an effect of dopamine, these results raise the possibility that aging and Parkinsons disease affect motor memory in similar ways.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRecording and stimulating neuronal activity across different brain regions requires interfacing at multiple sites using dedicated tools while tissue reactions at the recording sites often prevent their successful long-term application. This implies the technological challenge of developing complex probe geometries while keeping the overall footprint minimal, and of selecting materials compatible with neural tissue. While the potential of soft materials in reducing tissue response is uncontested, the implantation of these materials is often limited to reliably target neuronal structures across large brain volumes.\n\nApproachWe report on the development of a new multi-electrode array exploiting the advantages of soft and stiff materials by combining 7-m-thin polyimide wings carrying platinum electrodes with a silicon backbone enabling a safe probe implantation. The probe fabrication applies microsystems technologies in combination with a temporal wafer fixation method for rear side processing, i.e., grinding and deep reactive ion etching, of slender probe shanks and electrode wings. The wing-type neural probes are chronically implanted into the entorhinal-hippocampal formation in the mouse for in vivo recordings of freely behaving animals.\n\nMain resultsProbes comprising the novel wing-type electrodes have been realized and characterized in view of their electrical performance and insertion capability. Chronic electrophysiological in vivo recordings of the entorhinal-hippocampal network in the mouse of up to 104 days demonstrated a stable yield of channels containing identifiable multi-unit and single-unit activity outperforming probes with electrodes residing on a Si backbone.\n\nSignificanceThe innovative fabrication process using a process compatible, temporary wafer bonding allowed to realize new Michigan style probe arrays. The wing-type probe design enables a precise probe insertion into brain tissue and long-term stable recordings of unit activity due to the application of a stable backbone and 7-m-thin probe wings provoking locally a minimal tissue response and protruding from the glial scare of the backbone.",

    "abstract": "Perturbation of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance leads to neurodevelopmental diseases including to autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. Mutation in the DYRK1A gene located on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) leads to an intellectual disability syndrome associated with microcephaly, epilepsy, and autistic troubles (MRD7). Overexpression of DYRK1A, on the other hand, has been linked with learning and memory defects observed in people with Down syndrome (DS). Dyrk1a is expressed in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but its impact on each neuronal population has not yet been elucidated. Here we investigated the impact of Dyrk1a gene copy number variation in glutamatergic neurons using a conditional knockout allele of Dyrk1a crossed with the Tg(Camk2-Cre)4Gsc transgenic mouse. We explored this genetic modification in homozygotes, heterozygotes and combined with the Dp(16Lipi-Zbtb21)1Yey trisomic mouse model to unravel the consequence of Dyrk1a dosage from 0 to 3, to understand its role in normal physiology, and in MRD7 and DS. Overall, Dyrk1a dosage in glutamatergic neurons did not impact locomotor activity, working memory or epileptic susceptibility, but revealed that Dyrk1a is involved in long-term explicit memory. Molecular analyses pointed at a deregulation of transcriptional activity through immediate early genes and a role of DYRK1A at the glutamatergic post-synapse by deregulating and interacting with key post-synaptic proteins implicated in mechanism leading to long-term enhanced synaptic plasticity. Altogether, our work gives important information to understand the action of DYRK1A inhibitors and have a better therapeutic approach.\n\nAuthor summaryThe Dual Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulated Kinase 1A, DYRK1A, drives cognitive alterations with increased dose in Down syndrome (DS) or with reduced dose in mental retardation disease 7 (MRD7). Here we report that specific and complete loss of Dyrk1a in glutamatergic neurons induced a range of specific cognitive phenotypes and alter the expression of genes involved in neurotransmission in the hippocampus. We further explored the consequences of Dyrk1a dosage in glutamatergic neurons on the cognitive phenotypes observed respectively in MRD7 and DS mouse models and we found specific roles in long-term explicit memory with no impact on motor activity, short-term working memory, and susceptibility to epilepsy. Then we demonstrated that DYRK1A is a component of the glutamatergic post-synapse and interacts with several component such as NR2B and PSD95. Altogether our work describes a new role of DYRK1A at the glutamatergic synapse that must be considered to understand the consequence of treatment targeting DYRK1A in disease.",

But these same recordings also subsume neural signals unrelated to mnemonic retrieval, such as response-related motor activity. Here we examined spectral EEG biomarkers of memory retrieval under an extreme manipulation of mnemonic demands: subjects either recalled items after a few seconds or after several days. This manipulation helped to isolate EEG components specifically related to long-term memory retrieval. In the moments immediately preceding recall we observed increased theta (4-8 Hz) power (+T), decreased alpha (8-20 Hz) power (-A), and increased gamma (40-128 Hz) power (+G), with this spectral pattern (+T-A+G) distinguishing the long-delay and immediate recall conditions. As subjects vocalized the same set of studied words in both conditions, we interpret the spectral +T-A+G as a biomarker of episodic memory retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Detection and accurate quantitation of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis is fundamental to understanding mycobacterial pathogenicity, tuberculosis (TB) disease progression and outcomes; TB transmission; drug action, efficacy and drug resistance. Despite this importance, methods for determining numbers of viable bacilli are limited in accuracy and precision owing to inherent characteristics of mycobacterial cell biology - including the tendency to clump, and \"differential\" culturability - and technical challenges consequent on handling an infectious pathogen under biosafe conditions. We developed an absolute counting method for mycobacteria in liquid cultures using a bench-top flow cytometer, and the low-cost fluorescent dyes Calcein-AM (CA) and SYBR-gold (SG). During exponential growth CA+ cell counts are highly correlated with CFU counts and can be used as a real-time alternative to simplify the accurate standardisation of inocula for experiments. In contrast to CFU counting, this method can detect and enumerate cell aggregates in samples, which we show are a potential source of variance and bias when using established methods. We show that CFUs comprise a sub-population of intact, metabolically active mycobacterial cells in liquid cultures, with CFU-proportion varying by growth conditions. A pharmacodynamic application of the flow cytometry method, exploring kinetics of fluorescent probe defined subpopulations compared to CFU is demonstrated. Flow cytometry derived Mycobacterium bovis BCG time-kill curves differ for rifampicin and kanamycin versus isoniazid and ethambutol, as do the relative dynamics of discrete morphologically-distinct subpopulations of bacilli revealed by this high-throughput single-cell technique.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses are negative-sense RNA viruses that rely on their own viral replication machinery to replicate and transcribe their segmented single-stranded RNA genome. The viral ribonucleoprotein complexes in which viral RNA is replicated consist of a nucleoprotein scaffold around which the RNA genome is bound, and a heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyzes viral replication. The RNA polymerase copies the viral RNA (vRNA) via a replicative intermediate, called the complementary RNA (cRNA), and subsequently uses this cRNA to make more vRNA copies. To ensure that new cRNA and vRNA molecules are associated with ribonucleoproteins in which they can be amplified, the active RNA polymerase recruits a second polymerase to encapsidate the cRNA or vRNA. Host factor ANP32A has been shown to be essential for viral replication and to facilitate the formation of a dimer between viral RNA polymerases and differences between mammalian and avian ANP32A proteins are sufficient to restrict viral replication. It has been proposed that ANP32A is only required for the synthesis of vRNA molecules from a cRNA, but not vice versa. However, this view does not match recent molecular evidence. Here we use minigenome assays, virus infections, and viral promoter mutations to demonstrate that ANP32A is essential for both vRNA and cRNA synthesis. Moreover, we show that ANP32 is not only needed for the actively replicating polymerase, but also for the polymerase that is encapsidating nascent viral RNA products. Overall, these results provide new insights into influenza A virus replication and host adaptation.\n\nIMPORTANCEZoonotic avian influenza A viruses pose a constant threat to global health and they have the potential to cause highly pathogenic pandemic outbreaks. Species variations in host factor ANP32A play a key role in supporting the activity of avian influenza A virus RNA polymerases in mammalian hosts. Here we show that ANP32A acts at two stages in the influenza A virus replication cycle, supporting recent structural experiments and in line with its essential role. Understanding how ANP32A supports viral RNA polymerase activity and how it supports avian polymerase function in mammalian hosts is important for understanding influenza A virus replication and the development of antiviral strategies against influenza A viruses.",

Somatic and germline cells have distinct functions and constraints, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms contribute to an integrated starvation response. Using C. elegans L1 arrest as a model, we show that gene expression changes deep into starvation. Surprisingly, relative expression of germline-enriched genes increases for days. We conditionally degraded the large subunit of RNA Polymerase II and found that early but not late somatic transcription is required for survival and that germline transcription does not affect survival. Expression analysis revealed that thousands of genes are continuously transcribed in the soma, though their absolute abundance declines, while the germ line is transcriptionally quiescent with extreme transcript stability. This work reveals alternative somatic and germline gene-regulatory strategies during starvation, with the soma relying on a robust transcriptional response to support immediate survival while the germ line relies on transcriptional quiescence and mRNA stability to maintain future reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhenome-wide association studies conducted in electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks have uncovered a large number of genomic loci associated with traits and diseases. However, interpretation of the complex relationships of associated genes and phenotypes is challenging.\n\nResultsWe constructed a tissue-level phenome-wide network map of colocalized genes and phenotypes. First, we generated colocalized expression quantitative trait loci from 48 tissues of the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and from publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UK Biobank. We identified 9,151 colocalized genes for 1,411 phenotypes across 48 tissues. Then, we constructed a bipartite network using the colocalized signals to establish links between genes and phenotypes in each tissue. The majority of links are observed in a single tissue whereas only a few are present in all tissues. Finally, we applied the biLouvain clustering algorithm in each tissue-specific bipartite network to identify co-clusters of non-overlapping genes and phenotypes. The majority of co-clusters contains a small number of genes and phenotypes, and 88.6% of co-clusters are found in only one tissue. To demonstrate functionality of the phenome-wide map, we tested if these co-clusters were enriched with known biological and functional gene classes and observed several significant enrichments. Furthermore, we observed that tissue-specific co-clusters are enriched with reported drug side effects for the corresponding drug target genes in clinical trial data.\n\nConclusionsThe phenome-wide map provides links between genes, phenotypes and tissues across a wide spectrum of biological classes and can yield biological and clinical discoveries.

    "abstract": "Primary template-directed amplification (PTA) is an improved amplification technique for single-cell DNA sequencing. We generated whole-genome analysis of 76 single neurons and developed SCAN2, a computational method to accurately identify both clonal and non-clonal somatic (i.e., limited to a single neuron) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) using PTA data. Our analysis confirms an increase in non-clonal somatic mutation in single neurons with age, but revises estimates for the rate of this accumulation to be 15 SNVs per year. We also identify artifacts in other amplification methods. Most importantly, we show that somatic indels also increase by at least 2 indels per year per neuron and that indels may have a larger impact on gene function than somatic SNVs in human neurons.",

    "abstract": "Receptor kinases (RKs) play fundamental roles in extracellular sensing to regulate development and stress responses across kingdoms. In plants, leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) function primarily as peptide receptors that regulate myriad aspects of plant development and response to external stimuli. Extensive phosphorylation of LRR-RK cytoplasmic domains is among the earliest detectable responses following ligand perception, and reciprocal transphosphorylation between a receptor and its co-receptor is thought to activate the receptor complex. Originally proposed based on characterization of the brassinosteroid receptor, the prevalence of complex activation via reciprocal transphosphorylation across the plant RK family has not been tested. Using the LRR-RK ELONGATION FACTOR TU RECEPTOR (EFR) as a model RK, we set out to understand the steps critical for activating RK complexes. While the EFR cytoplasmic domain is an active protein kinase in vitro and is phosphorylated in a ligand-dependent manner in vivo, catalytically deficient EFR variants are functional in anti-bacterial immunity. These results reveal a non-catalytic role for the EFR cytoplasmic domain in triggering immune signaling and indicate that reciprocal transphoshorylation is not a ubiquitous requirement for LRR-RK complex activation. Rather, our analysis of EFR along with a detailed survey of the literature suggests a distinction between LRR-RK complexes with RD- versus non-RD protein kinase domains. Based on newly identified phosphorylation sites that regulate the activation state of the EFR complex in vivo, we propose that LRR-RK complexes containing a non-RD protein kinase may be regulated by phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes of the ligand-binding receptor which could initiate signaling in a feed-forward fashion either allosterically or through driving the dissociation of negative regulators of the complex.",

    "abstract": "Command-line software plays a critical role in biology research. However, processes for installing and executing software differ widely. The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a community standard that addresses this problem. Using CWL, tool developers can formally describe a tools inputs, outputs, and other execution details in a manner that fosters use of shared computational methods and reproducibility of complex analyses. CWL documents can include instructions for executing tools inside software containers--isolated, operating-system environments. Accordingly, CWL tools are portable--they can be executed on diverse computers--including personal workstations, high-performance clusters, or the cloud. This portability enables easier adoption of bioinformatics pipelines. CWL supports workflows, which describe dependencies among tools and using outputs from one tool as inputs to others. To date, CWL has been used primarily for batch processing of large datasets, especially in genomics. But it can also be used for analytical steps of a study. This article explains key concepts about CWL and software containers and provides examples for using CWL in biology research. CWL documents are text-based, so they can be created manually, without computer programming. However, ensuring that these documents confirm to the CWL specification may prevent some users from adopting it. To address this gap, we created ToolJig, a Web application that enables researchers to create CWL documents interactively. ToolJig validates information provided by the user to ensure it is complete and valid. After creating a CWL tool or workflow, the user can create \"input-object\" files, which store values for a particular invocation of a tool or workflow. In addition, ToolJig provides examples of how to execute the tool or workflow via a workflow engine.",

    "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bound peptides that originate from tumor-specific genetic alterations, known as neoantigens, are an important class of anti-cancer therapeutic targets. Accurately predicting peptide presentation by MHC complexes is a key aspect of discovering therapeutically relevant neoantigens. Technological improvements in mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics and advanced modeling techniques have vastly improved MHC presentation prediction over the past two decades. However, improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of prediction algorithms is needed for clinical applications such as the development of personalized cancer vaccines, the discovery of biomarkers for response to checkpoint blockade and the quantification of autoimmune risk in gene therapies. Toward this end, we generated allele-specific immunopeptidomics data using 25 mono-allelic cell lines and created Systematic HLA Epitope Ranking Pan Algorithm (SHERPA), a pan-allelic MHC-peptide algorithm for predicting MHC-peptide binding and presentation. In contrast to previously published large-scale mono-allelic data, we used an HLA-null K562 parental cell line and a stable transfection of HLA alleles to better emulate native presentation. Our dataset includes five previously unprofiled alleles that expand MHC binding pocket diversity in the training data and extend allelic coverage in underprofiled populations. To improve generalizability, SHERPA systematically integrates 128 mono-allelic and 384 multi-allelic samples with publicly available immunoproteomics data and binding assay data. Using this dataset, we developed two features that empirically estimate the propensities of genes and specific regions within gene bodies to engender immunopeptides to represent antigen processing. Using a composite model constructed with gradient boosting decision trees, multiallelic deconvolution and 2.15 million peptides encompassing 167 alleles, we achieved a 1.44 fold improvement of positive predictive value compared to existing tools when evaluated on independent mono-allelic datasets and a 1.15 fold improvement when evaluating on tumor samples. With a high degree of accuracy, SHERPA has the potential to enable precision neoantigen discovery for future clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Experimental data about known gene functions curated from the primary literature have enormous value for research scientists in understanding biology. Using the Gene Ontology (GO), manual curation by experts has provided an important resource for studying gene function, especially within model organisms. Unprecedented expansion of the scientific literature and validation of the predicted proteins have increased both data value and the challenges of keeping pace. Capturing literature-based functional annotations is limited by the ability of biocurators to handle the massive and rapidly growing scientific literature. Within the community-oriented wiki framework for GO annotation called the Gene Ontology Normal Usage Tracking System (GONUTS), we describe an approach to expand biocuration through crowdsourcing with undergraduates. This multiplies the number of high-quality annotations in international databases, enriches our coverage of the literature on normal gene function, and pushes the field in new directions. From an intercollegiate competition judged by experienced biocurators, Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies (CACAO), we have contributed nearly 5000 literature-based annotations. Many of those annotations are to organisms not currently well-represented within GO. Over a ten-year history, our community contributors have spurred changes to the ontology not traditionally covered by professional biocurators. The CACAO principle of relying on community members to participate in and shape the future of biocuration in GO is a powerful and scalable model used to promote the scientific enterprise. It also provides undergraduate students with a unique and enriching introduction to critical reading of primary literature and acquisition of marketable skills.\n\nSignificance StatementThe primary scientific literature catalogs the results from publicly funded scientific research about gene function in human-readable format. Information captured from those studies in a widely adopted, machine-readable standard format comes in the form of Gene Ontology annotations about gene functions from all domains of life. Manual annotations based on inferences directly from the scientific literature, including the evidence used to make such inferences, represents the best return on investment by improving data accessibility across the biological sciences. To supplement professional curation, our CACAO project enabled annotation of the scientific literature by community annotators, in this case undergraduates, which resulted in contribution of thousands of validated entries to public resources. These annotations are now being used by scientists worldwide.",

We benchmarked this system at the HMR and GAL2 loci, both well-characterized model systems for localization to the nuclear periphery. Using microscopy and gene silencing assays, we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas-mediated tethering can recruit the HMR locus but does not silence reporter gene expression. A previously reported Gal4-mediated tethering system does silence gene expression, and we demonstrate that the silencing phenotype has an unexpected dependence on the structure of the protein tether. The CRISPR-Cas system was unable to recruit GAL2 to the nuclear periphery. Our results reveal potential challenges for synthetic genome structure perturbations and suggest that distinct functional effects can arise from subtle structural differences in how genes are recruited to the periphery.",

As a result, it is able to outperform commercial software in both time and space complexity for high channel count data and can handle out-of-core computation in a user-friendly manner.

    "abstract": "Pre-reading language skills develop rapidly in early childhood and are related to brain structure and function in young children prior to formal education. However, the early neurobiological development that support these skills is not well understood and has not been assessed longitudinally using multiple imaging approaches. Here we acquired anatomical, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from 35 children at 3.5 years of age. Children were assessed for pre-reading abilities using the NEPSY-II subtests one year later (4.5 years). We applied a data-driven linked independent component analysis to explore the shared co-variation of grey and white matter measures. Two sources of structural variation at 3.5 years of age demonstrated a weak relationship with Speeded Naming scores at 4.5 years of age. The first imaging component involved volumetric variability in reading-related cortical regions alongside microstructural features of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. The second component was dominated by cortical volumetric variations within the cerebellum and visual association area. In a subset of children with rs-fMRI data, we evaluated the inter-network functional connectivity of the left-lateralized fronto-parietal language (FPL) network and its relationship with pre-reading measures. Higher functional connectivity between the FPL functional network and the default mode and visual networks at 3.5 years predicted better Phonological Processing scores at 4.5 years. Together, these results suggest that the integration of functional networks, as well as the co-development of white and grey matter brain structures in early childhood, may support the emergence of pre-reading measures in preschool children.",

    "abstract": "Swarming motility is flagellar-mediated movement over a solid surface and Bacillus subtilis cells require an increase in flagellar density to swarm. SwrB is a protein of unknown function required for swarming that is necessary to increase the number of flagellar hooks but not basal bodies. Previous work suggested that SwrB activates flagellar type III secretion but the mechanism by which it might perform this function is unknown. Here we show that SwrB likely acts sub-stoichiometrically as it localizes as puncta at the membrane in numbers fewer than that of flagellar basal bodies. Moreover the action of SwrB is likely transient as puncta of SwrB were not dependent on the presence of the basal bodies and rarely co-localized with flagellar hooks. Random mutagenesis of the SwrB sequence found that a histidine within the transmembrane segment was conditionally required for activity and punctate localization. Finally, three hydrophobic residues that precede a cytoplasmic domain of poor conservation abolished SwrB activity when mutated and caused aberrant migration during electrophoresis. Our data are consistent with a model in which SwrB interacts with the flagellum, changes conformation to activate type III secretion, and departs.\n\nIMPORTANCEType III secretion systems (T3SS) are elaborate nanomachines that form the core of the bacterial flagellum and injectisome of pathogens. The machines not only secrete proteins like virulence factors but also secrete the structural components for their own assembly. Moroever, proper construction requires complex regulation to ensure that the parts are roughly secreted in the order in which they are assembled. Here we explore a poorly understood activator the flagellar T3SS activation in Bacillus subtilis called SwrB. To aid mechanistic understanding, we determine the rules for subcellular punctate localization, the topology with respect to the membrane, and critical residues required for SwrB function.",

How a context dependent signaling response is generated has been a central question of developmental biology, which can now be addressed with in vitro models of human embryos that are derived from embryonic stem cells (hESCs) called gastruloids. Our previous work demonstrated that during early self-organization of gastruloids, cells chronicle signaling hierarchy. Only cells that have been exposed (primed) by WNT signaling can respond to subsequent Activin exposure and differentiate to mesendodermal (ME) fates. Here, we show that WNT priming does not alter SMAD2 binding nor its chromatin opening, but rather, acts by inducing the expression of the SMAD2 co-factor, EOMES. Expression of EOMES is sufficient to replace WNT upstream of Activin-mediated ME differentiation, thus unveiling the mechanistic basis for priming and cellular memory in early development.",

    "abstract": "The use of spatial memory is well documented in many animal species and has been shown to be critical for the emergence of spatial learning. Adaptive behaviors based on learning can emerge thanks to an interdependence between the acquisition of information over time and movement decisions. The study of how spatio-ecological knowledge is constructed throughout the life of an individual has not been carried out in a quantitative and comprehensive way, hindered by the lack of knowledge of the information an animal already has of its environment at the time monitoring begins. Identifying how animals use memory to make beneficial decisions is fundamental to developing a general theory of animal movement and space use. Here we propose several mobility models based on memory and perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on 11-month trajectories of 21 elk after they were released in a completely new environment. Almost all the observed animals exhibited preferential returns to previously visited patches, such that memory and random exploration phases occurred. Memory decay was mild or negligible over the study period. The fact that individual elk rapidly become used to a relatively small number of patches was consistent with the hypothesis that they seek places with predictable resources and reduced mortality risks such as predation.",

The first demonstration of HTP involved the integration of phosphopeptide enrichment into a TMT-based, single-LC separation thermal profiling workflow1. Here we present a new  label-fractionate-enrich (LFE)-HTP method that involves high-pH reverse phase fractionation of TMT-labeled peptides prior to phosphopeptide enrichment, followed by peptide detection and quantitation using multi-notch LC-MS3. We find that LFE-HTP, while more resource intensive, improves the depth and precision of (phospho)proteoform coverage relative to the initial published HTP workflow. The fraction of detected phosphorylation sites that are significantly perturbed in this new dataset are consistent with those seen in our previous study, as well as those published by others, when compared head-to-head with the same analysis pipelines. Likewise, many  hotspot phosphorylation sites identified in our paper are consistently reproduced by LFE-HTP as well as other modified HTP methods. The LFE-HTP dataset contains many novel  hotspot phosphorylation sites that regulate the stability of diverse proteins, including phosphosites in the central glycolytic enzyme Aldolase A that are associated with monomer-to-oligomer formation, enzymatic activity and metabolic regulation in cancer cells. Our comparative analyses confirm that several variants of the HTP method can track modified proteoforms in live cells to detect and prioritize PTM-dependent changes in protein stability that may be associated with function.",

    "abstract": "Studies of fate patterning during development typically emphasize cell-cell communication via diffusible signals. Recent experiments on monolayer stem cell colonies, however, suggest that mechanical forces between cells may also play a role. These findings inspire a model of mechanical patterning: fate affects cell contractility, and pressure in the cell layer biases fate. Cells at the colony boundary, more contractile than cells at the center, seed a pattern that propagates via force transmission. In agreement with previous observations, our model implies that the width of the outer fate domain depends only weakly on colony diameter. We further predict and confirm experimentally that this same width varies non-monotonically with substrate stiffness. This finding supports the idea that mechanical stress can mediate patterning in a manner similar to a morphogen; we argue that a similar dependence on substrate stiffness can be achieved by a chemical signal only if strong constraints on the signaling pathways mechanobiology are met.",

    "abstract": "The beating of cilia and flagella is essential to perform many important biological functions, including generating fluid flows on the cell surface or propulsion of micro-organisms. In this work, we analyze the motion of isolated and demembranated flagella from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which act as ATP-driven micro-swimmers. The waveform of the Chlamydomonas beating flagella has an asymmetric waveform that is known to involve the superposition of a static component, corresponding to a fixed, intrinsic curvature, and a dynamic wave component traveling in the base-to-tip direction at the fundamental beat frequency, plus higher harmonics. Here, we demonstrate that these modes are not sufficient to reproduce the observed flagella waveforms. We find that two extra modes play an essential role to describe the motion: first, a time-symmetric mode, which corresponds to a global oscillation of the axonemal curvature, and second, a secondary tip-to-base wave component at the fundamental frequency that propagates opposite to the dominant base-to-tip wave, albeit with a smaller amplitude. Although the time-symmetric mode cannot, by itself, contribute to propulsion (scallop theorem), it does enhance the translational and rotational velocities of the flagellum by approximately a factor of 2. This mode highlights a long-range coupled on/off activity of force-generating dynein motors and can provide further insight into the underling biology of the ciliary beat.",

    "abstract": "The Rothschilds giraffe is currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This is attributed to the loss of habitat due to human activities. This study examined the effect of habitat type on population structure and distribution of Rothschilds giraffe in Ruma National Park (RNP) and Mwea National Reserve (MNR) in Kenya. The study employed road transects to collect data on the number, age class and sex distribution in three habitat types, open, medium and closed. Data was collected along three road transects of equal lengths measuring 14.2 km in each site (RNP and MNR) for comparison. A driving speed of 20 km per hour was maintained along each transect for standardization of survey effort and a maximum giraffe detection rate. Photographic capture of the coat patterns of the right side of all the giraffes sighted within 500 m from the transect was done for identification of age classes. The field visits were replicated 12 times for each transect giving 36 replications for each site spread equally through wet and dry seasons from March 2017 to November 2018. The effect of habitat type on population structure and distribution was analysed using ANOVA and Tukey HSD to test for significant differences. T-test was used to compare the mean population size of giraffe across the wet and dry seasons. Coat pattern analysis for age class identification was done using WildID software. The findings indicated that MNR had more males to females compared to RNP that registered more females and calves. Habitat type had a significant effect on the distribution of giraffes. The giraffe population showed a preference for medium habitat types. The findings are key for the management of habitat quality for giraffe populations at the interface where conservation areas overlap with human land use.",

By comparing tissue-specific transcriptomes across over 70 million years of primate evolution, we identify that within 3 million years circRNA expression profiles diverged such that they are more related to species identity than organ type. However, our analysis also revealed a subset of circRNAs with conserved neural expression across tens of millions of years of evolution. These circRNAs are defined by an extended downstream intron that has shown dramatic lengthening during evolution due to the insertion of novel retrotransposons. Our work provides comparative analyses of the mechanisms promoting circRNAs to generate increased transcriptomic complexity in primates.",

Here we report that amyloid {beta} precursor-like protein 1 (Aplp1) forms a complex with Lag3 that facilitates the binding, internalization, transmission, and toxicity of pathologic -syn.

    "abstract": "Mossy cells (MCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG) are key components of an excitatory associative circuit established by reciprocal connections with dentate granule cells (GCs). MCs are implicated in place field encoding, pattern separation and novelty detection, as well as in brain disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy and depression. Despite their functional relevance, little is known about the determinants that control MC activity. Here, we examined whether MCs express functional kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors involved in neuronal development, synaptic transmission and epilepsy. Using mouse hippocampal slices, we found that bath application of submicromolar and micromolar concentrations of the KAR agonist kainic acid induced inward currents and robust MC firing. These effects were abolished in GluK2 KO mice, indicating the presence of functional GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. In contrast to CA3 pyramidal cells, which are structurally and functionally similar to MCs, and express synaptic KARs at mossy fiber (MF) inputs (i.e., GC axons), we found no evidence for KAR-mediated transmission at MF-MC synapses, indicating that most KARs at MCs are extrasynaptic. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy analyses confirmed the extrasynaptic localization of GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. Finally, blocking glutamate transporters, a manipulation that increases extracellular levels of endogenous glutamate, was sufficient to induce KAR-mediated inward currents in MCs, suggesting that MC-KARs can be activated by increases in ambient glutamate. Our findings provide the first direct evidence of functional extrasynaptic KARs at a critical excitatory neuron of the hippocampus.\n\nSignificance StatementHilar mossy cells (MCs) are an understudied population of hippocampal neurons that form an excitatory loop with dentate granule cells. MCs have been implicated in pattern separation, spatial navigation, and epilepsy. Despite their importance in hippocampal function and disease, little is known about how MC activity is recruited. Here, we show for the first time that MCs express extrasynaptic kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors critically involved in neuronal function and epilepsy. While we found no evidence for synaptic KARs in MCs, KAR activation induced strong action potential firing of MCs, raising the possibility that extracellular KARs regulate MC excitability in vivo and may also promote dentate gyrus hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by treatment-resistant epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and sudden death, due to pathogenic variants in SCN1A encoding the Nav1.1 sodium channel subunit. Convergent data suggest hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) pathology. We found that optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal cortex was ictogenic in DS (Scn1a+/-) but not wild-type mice in vivo. Two-photon calcium imaging in brain slice demonstrated profound impairment in filtering of perforant path input by DG in young adult Scn1a+/- mice due to enhanced excitatory input to granule cells. Excitability of parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) was near-normal and selective activation of PV-INs rescued circuit impairments. This demonstrates developmental reorganization of hippocampal circuitry that can be modulated by recruitment of functional PV-INs, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches towards seizure modulation. The identified circuit abnormality mirrors that seen in models of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting convergent mechanisms linking genetic and acquired causes of temporal lobe-onset seizures.",

    "abstract": "Frizzleds (FZD1-10) comprise a class of G protein-coupled receptors containing an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that binds lipoglycoproteins of the Wingless/Int-1 family (WNTs). Despite the prominent role of the WNT/FZD system in health and disease, our understanding of how WNT binding to the FZD CRD is translated into receptor activation and transmembrane signaling remains limited. Current hypotheses dispute the roles for conformational dynamics and the involvement of the linker domain connecting the CRD with the seven-helical transmembrane core of FZD. To clarify the mechanism of WNT binding to FZD and to elucidate how WNT/FZD complexes achieve signaling pathway specificity, we devised conformational FZD-CRD biosensors based on bioluminescence-resonance-energy-transfer (BRET). Using FZD engineered with N-terminal nanoluciferase and fluorescently-labeled unnatural amino acids in the linker domain and extracellular loop 3, we show that WNT-3A and WNT-5A induce similar CRD conformational rearrangements despite promoting distinct downstream signaling pathways, and that CRD dynamics are not required for WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling. Thus, the novel FZD-CRD biosensors we report provide insights into the stepwise binding, activation and signaling processes in FZDs. The sensor design is broadly applicable to explore fundamental events in signal transduction mediated by other membrane receptors.",

    "abstract": "Repeat element transcription plays a vital role in early embryonic development. Expression of repeats such as MERVL characterises mouse embryos at the 2-cell stage, and defines a 2-cell-like cell (2CLC) population in a mouse embryonic stem cell culture. Repeat element sequences contain binding sites for numerous transcription factors. We identify the forkhead domain transcription factor FOXD3 as a regulator of repeat element transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells. FOXD3 binds to and recruits the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to MERVL and major satellite repeats, consequentially repressing the transcription of these repeats by the establishment of the H3K9me3 heterochromatin modification. Notably, depletion of FOXD3 leads to the de-repression of MERVL and major satellite repeats as well as a subset of genes expressed in the 2-cell state, shifting the balance between the stem cell and 2-cell like population in culture. Thus, FOXD3 acts as a negative regulator of repeat transcription, ascribing a novel function to this transcription factor.",

    "abstract": "Social interactions between animals can provide many benefits, including the ability to gain useful environmental information through social learning. However, these social contacts can also facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases through a population. Animals engaging in social interactions must therefore face a trade-off between the potential informational benefits and the risk of acquiring disease. In order to understand how this trade-off can influence animal sociality, it is necessary to quantify the effects of different social structures on individuals likelihood of acquiring information versus infection Theoretical models have suggested that modular social networks, associated with the formation of groups or sub-groups, can slow spread of infection by trapping it within particular groups. However these social structures will not necessarily impact the spread of information in the same way if its transmission is considered as a \"complex contagion\", e.g. through individuals copying the majority (conformist learning). Here we use simulation models to demonstrate that modular networks can promote the spread of information relative to the spread of infection, but only when the network is fragmented and group sizes are small. We show that the difference in transmission between information and disease is maximised for more well-connected social networks when the likelihood of transmission is intermediate. Our results have important implications for understanding the selective pressures operating on the social structure of animal societies, revealing that highly fragmented networks such as those formed in fission-fusion social groups and multilevel societies can be effective in modulating the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.\n\nSignificance statementRisk of infection is commonly regarded as one of the costs of animal social behaviours, while the potential for acquiring useful information is seen as a benefit. Balancing this risk of infection with the potential to gain useful information is one of the key trade-offs facing animals that engage in social interactions. In order to better understand this trade-off, it is necessary to quantify how different social structures can promote access to useful information while minimising risk of infection. We used simulations of disease and information spread to examine how group sizes and social network fragmentation influences both these transmission processes. Our models find that more subdivided networks slow the spread of disease far more than infection, but only group sizes are small. Our results demonstrate that showing that fragmented social structures can be more effective in balancing the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.",

    "abstract": "Infection with human noroviruses (hNoV) for the vast majority of strains requires attachment of the viral capsid to histo blood group antigens (HBGA). The HBGA binding pocket is formed by dimers of the protruding domain (P dimers) of the capsid protein VP1. Several studies have focused on HBGA binding to P dimers, reporting binding affinities and stoichiometries. However, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and native mass spectrometry (MS) analyses yielded incongruent dissociation constants (KD) for binding of HBGAs to P dimers and, in some cases, disagreed whether glycans bind at all. We hypothesized that glycan clustering during electrospray ionization in native MS critically depends on the physicochemical properties of the protein studied. It follows that the choice of the reference protein is crucial. We analyzed carbohydrate clustering using various P dimers and eight non-glycan binding proteins serving as possible references. Data from native and ion mobility MS indicate that the mass fraction of {beta}-sheet has a strong influence on the degree of glycan clustering. Therefore, the determination of specific glycan binding affinities from native MS must be interpreted cautiously.",
