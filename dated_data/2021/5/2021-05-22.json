    "abstract": "Cell plating, the spreading out of a liquid suspension of cells on a surface followed by colony growth, is a common laboratory procedure in microbiology. Despite this, the exact impact of its parameters on colony growth has not been extensively studied. A common protocol involves the shaking of glass beads within a petri dish containing solid growth media. We investigated the effects of multiple parameters in this protocol - the number of beads, the shape of movement, and the number of movements. Standard suspensions of Escherichia coli were spread while varying these parameters to assess their impact on colony growth. Results were assessed by a variety of metrics - the number of colonies, the mean distance between closest colonies, and the variability and uniformity of their spatial distribution. Finally, we devised a mathematical model of shifting billiard to explain the heterogeneities in the observed spatial patterns. Exploring the parameters that affect the most fundamental techniques in microbiology allows us to better understand their function, giving us the ability to precisely control their outputs for our exact needs.",

    "abstract": "The recent increase in reliable, simultaneous high channel count extracellular recordings is exciting for physiologists and theoreticians because it offers the possibility of reconstructing the underlying neuronal circuits. We recently presented a method of inferring this circuit connectivity from neuronal spike trains by applying the generalized linear model to cross-correlograms. Although the algorithm can do a good job of circuit reconstruction, the parameters need to be carefully tuned for each individual dataset. Here we present another method using a Convolutional Neural Network for Estimating synaptic Connectivity from spike trains (CoNNECT). After adaptation to huge amounts of simulated data, this method robustly captures the specific feature of monosynaptic impact in a noisy cross-correlogram. There are no user-adjustable parameters. With this new method, we have constructed diagrams of neuronal circuits recorded in several cortical areas of monkeys.",

Here, we tracked the precise sequence of cortical activity in mice transforming a brief whisker stimulus into delayed licking using wide-field calcium imaging, multi-region high-density electrophysiology and time-resolved optogenetic manipulation. Rapid activity evoked by whisker deflection acquired two prominent features for task performance: i) an enhanced excitation of secondary whisker motor cortex, suggesting its important role connecting whisker sensory processing to lick motor planning, and ii) a transient reduction of activity in orofacial sensorimotor cortex, which contributed to suppressing premature licking. Subsequent widespread cortical activity during the delay period largely correlated with anticipatory movements, but when these were accounted for, a focal sustained activity remained in frontal cortex, which was causally essential for licking in the response period. Our results demonstrate key cortical nodes for motor plan generation and timely execution in delayed goal-directed licking.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive resilience is the ability to withstand the negative effects of stress on cognitive functioning and is important for maintaining quality of life while aging. UK Biobank (UKB) does not have direct measurements of the same cognitive phenotype at distal timepoints. Therefore, we used number of education years (EY) as a proxy phenotype for past cognitive performance. Current cognitive performance was determined based on processing speed. This approach captured an average time span of 40 years between past and current cognitive performance in 330,097 individuals. A confounding factor was that EY is highly polygenic and masked the genetics of resilience. To overcome this, we employed Genomics Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to perform a GWAS-by-subtraction using two GWAS, one GWAS of EY and resilience and a second GWAS of EY but not resilience. Subtracting one from the other generated a GWAS of Resilience. Replication of this approach was shown using independent discovery and replication samples within UKB and the full UKB GWAS results show significant genetic correlation with a GWAS of cognitive change in the independent Health and Retirement Study (N=9,526; P=1.5x10-3). We found 13 independent genetic loci for Resilience. Functional analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including GABAergic neurons (P=6.59x10-8) and glutamatergic neurons (P=6.98x10-6) in the cortex. Gene-set analyses implicated the biological process \"neuron differentiation\" (P=9.7x10-7) and the cellular component \"synaptic part\" (P=2.14x10-6). Mendelian randomization analysis showed a causative effect of white matter volume on cognitive resilience. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of resilience.",

    "abstract": "FTSJ1 is a conserved human 2-O-methyltransferase (Nm-MTase) that modifies several transfer RNAs (tRNAs) at position 32 and the wobble position 34 in the AntiCodon Loop (ACL). Its loss of function has been linked to Non-Syndromic X-Linked Intellectual Disability (NSXLID), and more recently to cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologies are currently unclear. Here we report a novel FTSJ1 pathogenic variant from a NSXLID patient. Using blood cells derived from this patient and other affected individuals carrying FTSJ1 mutations, we performed an unbiased and comprehensive RiboMethSeq analysis to map the ribose methylation (Nm) on all human tRNAs and identify novel targets. In addition, we performed a transcriptome analysis in these cells and found that several genes previously associated with intellectual disability and cancers were deregulated. We also found changes in the miRNA population that suggest potential cross-regulation of some miRNAs with these key mRNA targets. Finally, we show that differentiation of FTSJ1-depleted human neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) into neurons displays long and thin spine neurites compared to control cells. These defects are also observed in Drosophila and are associated with long term memory deficit in this organism. Altogether, our study adds insight into FTSJ1 pathologies in human and flies by the identification of novel FTSJ1 targets and the defect in neuron morphology.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent works have investigated functional and effective cortical networks in animal models, the dynamical information transfer among functional modules underneath cognitive control is still largely unknown. Here, we addressed the issue using Transfer Entropy and graph theory methods on neural activities recorded at the mesoscopic scale from a multielectrode array in the dorsal premotor cortex of rhesus monkeys. We focused our analysis on the decision time of a Stop-signal (countermanding) task looking for hallmarks in the network functional configuration, when the Stop signal is presented, that could influence the motor plan maturation. When comparing trials with successful inhibition to those with generated movement the nodes (modules) of the network resulted organized in four classes, hierarchically arranged, and differently partaking in information transfer. Interestingly, the hierarchies and the strength of the information exchanged between modules varied during the task, being different for generated movements and cancelled ones and coupled with distinct levels of network complexity and heterogeneity depending on the motor behaviors explored. Last, we exposed the multiscale structure of the network through the multi-fractal formalism, which allowed us to reveal the generating rules of the network and measure the distance between the information processed in the different behavioral conditions. Our results suggest that the premotor contribution to motor decisions involves a topological reorganization of the mesoscopic functional network whose intrinsic fractal features delineate its behavioral functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust prediction of patient-specific responses to drug treatments is critical for drug development and personalized medicine. However, patient data are often too scarce to train a generalized machine learning model. Although many methods have been developed to utilize cell line data, few of them can reliably predict individual patient clinical responses to new drugs due to data distribution shift and confounding factors. We develop a novel Context-aware Deconfounding Autoencoder (CODE-AE) that can extract common biological signals masked by context-specific patterns and confounding factors. Extensive studies demonstrate that CODE-AE effectively alleviates the out-of-distribution problem for the model generalization, significantly improves accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art methods in both predicting patient-specific ex vivo and in vivo drug responses purely from in vitro screens and disentangling intrinsic biological signals from confounding factors. Using CODE-AE, we screened 50 drugs for 9,808 cancer patients and discovered novel personalized anti-cancer therapies and drug-response biomarkers.\n\nContact: lxie@iscb.org",

However, many of the current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limitations, such as reliance on a single reference dataset or marker gene set, or excessive run times for large datasets. Acquiring high-quality labeled data to use as a reference can be challenging. With CITE-seq, surface protein expression of cells can be directly measured in addition to the RNA expression, facilitating cell type annotation. Here, we compiled and annotated a collection of 16 publicly available CITE-seq datasets. This data was then used as training data to develop Superscan, a supervised machine learning-based prediction model. Using our 16 reference datasets, we benchmarked Superscan and showed that it performs better in terms of both accuracy and speed when compared to other state-of-the-art cell annotation methods. Superscan is pre-trained on a collection of primarily PBMC immune datasets; however, additional data and cell types can be easily added to the training data for further improvement. Finally, we used Superscan to reanalyze a previously published dataset, demonstrating its applicability even when the dataset includes cell types that are missing from the training set.",

Devising a single model applicable to distinct stimuli and conditions has been limited by lack of robust observables. Indeed, previous numerical models have been tailored to fit experimental datasets in restricted scenarios, failing to predict response to different stimuli. We quantified the activity of three caspases simultaneously upon intrinsic or extrinsic stimulation to assemble a comprehensive dataset. We measured and modeled the time between maximum activity of intrinsic, extrinsic and effector caspases, a robust observable of network dynamics, to create the first integrated Apoptotic Reaction Model (ARM). Observing how effector caspases reach maximum activity first irrespective of stimuli used, led us to identify and incorporate a missing feedback into a successful model for extrinsic stimulation. By simulating different recently performed experiments, we corroborated that ARM adequately describes them. This integrated model provides further insight into the indispensable feedback from effector caspase to initiator caspases.",

    "abstract": "Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are widely used to describe biochemical processes, since they effectively represent mass action kinetics. Optimization-based calibration of ODE models on experimental data can be challenging, even for low-dimensional problems. However, reliable model calibration is a prerequisite for uncertainty analysis, model comparison, and biological interpretation. Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain why optimization based calibration of biochemical models is challenging, but there are few comprehensive studies that test these hypotheses, likely because tools for performing such studies are also lacking.\n\nWe implemented an established trust-region method as a modular Python framework (fides) to enable systematic comparison of different approaches to ODE model calibration involving various Hessian approximation schemes. We evaluated fides on a set of benchmark problems for which real experimental data are available. Unexpectedly, we observed high variability in optimizer performance among different implementations of the same algorithm. Overall, fides performed most reliably and efficiently. Our investigation of possible sources of poor optimizer performance identified drawbacks in the widely used Gauss-Newton, BFGS and SR1 Hessian approximations. We address these drawbacks by proposing a novel hybrid Hessian approximation scheme that enhances optimizer performance and outperforms existing hybrid approaches. We expect fides to be broadly useful for ODE constrained optimization problems and to enable future methods development.\n\nAvailabilityfides is published under the permissive BSD-3-Clause license with source code publicly available at https://github.com/fides-dev/fides.

However, their existence patterns, dynamic changes, biological functions, as well as associations with histone lysine acetylation (Kac) and gene expression during mammalian development remain largely unknown, which imped us from understanding the epigenetic regulations of histone lysine acylations.\n\nResultsHistone Kcr and Kla are widely distributed and undergo global changes during neural development. By profiling genome-wide dynamics of H3K9ac, H3K9cr and H3K18la in combination with ATAC sequencing and RNA sequencing, we reveal that these histone marks cooperatively regulate chromatin state and gene expression, as well as promote transcriptome remodelling to favour cell fate transition in the developing telencephalon. Importantly, we demonstrate that global histone Kcr and Kla are not consequence of transcription and furtherly identify histone deacetylase 1-3 (HDAC1-3) as novel \"erasers\" of H3K18la. Taking advantage of induced differentiation system of P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, we find that a selective inhibitor of HDAC1-3, MS-275 pre-activates neural fate-related transcriptional programs via stimulating multiple histone lysine acylations simultaneously.\n\nConclusionsOur study uncover the interplays between histone lysine acylations to regulate gene expression and the differentiation-promoting functions of histone Kcr and Kla during development, and provide evidence that multiple histone lysine actlations synchronously alternate to orchestrate transcriptome responding under HDACs inhibition.",

When body size determines the outcome of competitive interactions between individuals, coexistence depends also on how resource use and the ability to compete for these resources change with body size. Testing coexistence theory in size-structured communities, therefore, requires disentangling the effects of size-dependent competitive abilities and niche shifts.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we tested the hypothesis that the evolution of species and size-dependent competitive asymmetries increased the likelihood of coexistence between interacting species.\nC_LIO_LIWe experimentally estimated the effects of size-dependent competitive interactions on somatic growth rates of two interacting fish species, Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and killifish (Rivulus hartii). We controlled for the effects of size-dependent changes in the niche at two competitive settings representing the early (allopatric) and late (sympatric) evolutionary stages of a killifish-guppy community. We fitted the growth data to a model that incorporates species and size-dependent competitive asymmetries to test whether changes in the competitive interactions across stages increased the likelihood of species coexistence from allopatry to sympatry.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that guppies are competitively superior to killifish but were less so in sympatric populations. The decrease in the effects of interspecific competition on the fitness of killifish and increase in the interspecific effect on guppies fitness increased the likelihood that sympatric guppies and killifish will coexist.

We compare the relative power of this taxon-specific set, Bromeliad1776, to the universal Angiosperms353 kit. The taxon-specific set results in higher enrichment success across the entire family, however, the overall performance of both kits to reconstruct phylogenetic trees is relatively comparable, highlighting the vast potential of universal kits for resolving evolutionary relationships. For more detailed phylogenetic or population genetic analyses, e.g. the exploration of gene tree concordance, nucleotide diversity or population structure, the taxon-specific capture set presents clear benefits. We discuss the potential lessons that this comparative study provides for future phylogenetic and population genetic investigations, in particular for the study of evolutionary radiations.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic parameters underlying inheritance and complex biological relationships for quantitative traits are not available for aquatic animal species. I synthesised and conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of the published information from 1985 to 2017 on heritability, common full-sib effects and genetic correlations for quantitative characters of biological importance (growth, carcass and flesh quality, disease resistance, deformity and reproduction) for aquaculture species. A majority of the studies (73.5%) focussed on growth related traits (body weight), followed by those on disease resistance (15.9%), whereas only a limited number of studies (10.6%) reported heritability estimates for carcass and flesh quality, deformity or reproduction characteristics. The weighted means of heritability for growth (weight, food utilisation efficiency, maturity) and carcass (fillet weight and yield) traits were moderate. Resistance against various bacteria, virus and parasites were moderately to highly heritable. Across aquatic animal species, the weighted heritability for a range of deformity measures and reproductive traits (fecundity, early survival) was low and not significantly different from zero. The common full-sibs (c2) accounted for a large proportion of total variance for body traits but it was of smaller magnitude in later phase of the growth development. The c2 effects however were not significant or in many cases they were not reported for carcass and flesh quality attributes as well as survival and deformity. The maternal genetic effects were not available for all traits studied especially for reproductive and early growth characters. Genetic correlations between body and carcass traits were high and positive, suggesting that selection for rapid growth can improve fillet weight, a carcass trait of paramount importance. Body weight, the most commonly used selection criterion in aquatic animals, showed non-significant genetic correlation with disease resistance, likely because both positive and negative genetic associations between the two types of traits. Interestingly the genetic associations between growth and reproductive performance (fecundity) and fry traits (fry weight, fry survival) were favourable. To date, there are still no published data on genetic relationships of carcass and flesh quality with disease resistance or reproductive performance in any aquaculture species. Additionally, the present study discussed new traits, including functional, immunological, behavioural and social interaction as well as uniformity that are emerging as potential selection criteria and which can be exploited in future genetic improvement programs for aquatic animals.",

    "abstract": "Lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) are increasingly being used as cleaner fish to control parasitic sea-lice in salmon farming, but cleaning rates are very variable and not all individuals eat sea-lice, which increases the risk of emaciation and has ethical and practical implications. Selecting good cleaners is a priority to make the industry more sustainable, but there is little information on what behaviours make cleaner fish effective under a commercial setting. We examined variation in lumpfish personalities according to the five-factor personality model that takes into account differences in activity, anxiety (shelter use, thigmotaxis), aggression, sociality, and boldness (neophobia). We then quantified how variation in lumpfish personalities influenced interactions with naive Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), without the confounding effects of variation in sea-lice loads. Variation in activity, sociality, aggression and neophobia, but not in anxiety, was repeatable, which is consistent with a heritable basis. Neophilic, non-aggressive lumpfish spent more time inspecting salmon than neophobic and aggressive individuals, but salmon fled in the presence of the most active and social individuals, suggesting there may be an optimal cleaner fish personality amenable to artificial selection. The personality screening protocols developed in this study could inform a more efficient use of cleaner fish in salmon farming and reduce the number of individuals required to control sea-lice.",

    "abstract": "The huge body of publicly available RNA-seq libraries is a treasure of functional information allowing to quantify the expression of known or novel transcripts in tissues. However, transcript quantification commonly relies on alignment methods requiring a lot of computational resources and processing time, which does not scale easily to large datasets. K-mer decomposition constitutes a new way to process RNA-seq data for the identification of transcriptional signatures, as k-mers can be used to quantify accurately gene expression in a less resource-consuming way. We present the Kmerator Suite, a set of three tools designed to extract specific k-mer signatures, quantify these k-mers into RNA-seq datasets and quickly visualize large datasets characteristics. The core tool, Kmerator, produces specific k-mers for 97% of human genes, enabling the measure of gene expression with high accuracy in simulated datasets. KmerExploR, a direct application of Kmerator, uses a set of predictor genes specific k-mers to infer metadata including library protocol, sample features or contaminations from RNA-seq datasets. KmerExploR results are visualised through a user-friendly interface. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Kmerator Suite can be used for advanced queries targeting known or new biomarkers such as mutations, gene fusions or long non coding-RNAs for human health applications.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by specifically binding to DNA targets. Many factors have been revealed to influence TF-DNA binding specificity. Coevolution of residues in proteins occurs due to a common evolutionary history. However, it is unclear how coevolving residues in TFs contribute to DNA binding specificity. Here, we systematically analyzed TF-DNA interactions from high-throughput experiments for seven TF families, including Homeobox, HLH, bZIP_1, Ets, HMG_box, zf-C4 and Zn_clus TFs. Based on TF-DNA interactions, we detected TF subclass determining sites (TSDSs) defining the heterogeneity of DNA binding preference for each TF family. We showed that the TSDSs were more likely to be coevolving with TSDSs than with non-TSDSs, particularly for Homeobox, HLH, Ets, bZIP_1 and HMG_box TF families. Mutation of the highly coevolving residues could significantly reduce the stability of TF-DNA complex. The distant residues from the DNA interface also contributed to TF-DNA binding activity. Overall, our study gave evidence of the functional importance of coevolved residues in refining transcriptional regulation and provided clues to the application of engineered DNA-binding domains and protein.",

    "abstract": "Varying technologies and experimental approaches used in microbiome studies often lead to irreproducible results due to unwanted technical variations. Such variations, often unaccounted for and of unknown source, may interfere with true biological signals, resulting in misleading biological conclusions. In this work, we aim to characterize the major sources of technical variations in microbiome data and demonstrate how a state-of-the art approach can minimize their impact on downstream analyses. We analyzed 184 pig faecal metagenomes encompassing 21 specific combinations of deliberately introduced factors of technical and biological variations. We identify several known experimental factors, specifically storage conditions and freeze-thaw cycles, as a likely major source of unwanted variation in metagenomes. We also observed that these unwanted technical variations do not affect taxa uniformly, with freezing samples affecting taxa of class Bacteroidia the most, for example. Additionally, we benchmarked the performance of a novel batch correcting tool used in this study, RUV-III-NB (https://github.com/limfuxing/ruvIIInb/), to other popular batch correction methods, including ComBat, ComBat-seq, RUVg, and RUVs. While RUV-III-NB performed consistently robustly across our sensitivity and specificity metrics, most other methods did not remove unwanted variations optimally, with RUVg even overcorrecting and removing some of the true biological signals from the samples. Our analyses suggests that a careful consideration of possible technical confounders is critical in the experimental design of microbiome studies to ensure accurate biological reading of microbial taxa of interest, and that the inclusion of technical replicates is necessary to efficiently remove unwanted variations computationally.",

    "abstract": "Genomic prediction is a promising technology for advancing both plant and animal breeding, with many different prediction models evaluated in the literature. It has been suggested that the ability of powerful nonlinear models such as deep neural networks to capture complex epistatic effects between markers offers advantages for genomic prediction. However, these methods tend not to outperform classical linear methods, leaving it an open question why this capacity to model nonlinear effects does not seem to result in better predictive capability. In this work, we propose the theory that, due to a principle called shortcut learning, deep neural networks tend to base their predictions on overall genetic relatedness, rather than on the effects of particular markers, such as epistatic effects. Using several datasets of crop plants (lentil, wheat, and Brassica carinata), we demonstrate the networks indifference to the values of the markers by showing that the same network, provided with only the locations of matches between markers for two individuals, is able to perform prediction to the same level of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Synonymous single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) are common in the human genome but are often overlooked. However, sSNVs can have significant biological impact and may lead to disease. Existing computational methods for evaluating the effect of sSNVs suffer from the lack of gold-standard training/evaluation data and exhibit over-reliance on sequence conservation signals. We developed synVep (synonymous Variant effect predictor), a machine learning-based method that overcomes both of these limitations. Our training data was a combination of variants reported by gnomAD (observed) and those unreported, but possible in the human genome (generated). We used positive-unlabeled learning to purify the generated variant set of any likely unobservable variants. We then trained two sequential extreme gradient boosting models to identify subsets of the remaining variants putatively enriched and depleted in effect. Our method attained 90% precision/recall on a previously unseen set of variants. Furthermore, although synVep does not explicitly use conservation, its scores correlated with evolutionary distances between orthologs in cross-species variation analysis. synVep was also able to differentiate pathogenic vs. benign variants, as well as splice-site disrupting variants (SDV) vs. non-SDVs. Thus, synVep provides an important improvement in annotation of sSNVs, allowing users to focus on variants that most likely harbor effects.",

Using DASH on 611 patients across 15 tumor types, we found that 18% of patients had HLA LOH. Moreover, we show inflated HLA LOH rates compared to genome-wide LOH and correlations between CD274 (PD-L1) expression and MSI status, suggesting the HLA LOH is a key immune resistance strategy.",

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), consists of a combination of vaccination and anti-rabies immunoglobulins (RIGs); it is 100% effective if administered early after infection. Because of the limited availability, alternatives for RIGs are needed. To that end we evaluated a panel of 33 different lectins for their effect on RABV infection in cell culture. Several lectins, with either mannose or GlcNAc specificity elicited anti-RABV activity of which the GlcNAc specific Urtica dioica Agglutinin (UDA) was selected for further studies. UDA was found to prevent entry of the virus into the host cell. To further assess the potential of UDA, a physiologically relevant RABV infection muscle explant model was developed. Strips of dissected swine skeletal muscle that were kept in culture medium could be productively infected with the RABV. When the infection of the muscle strips was carried out in the presence of UDA, RABV replication was completely prevented. We thus developed a physiologically relevant RABV muscle infection model. UDA (i) may serve as a reference for further studies and (ii) holds promise as a cheap and simple to produce alternative for RIGs in PEP.",

In the original study, urinary biomarkers and kidney histopathology scores were determined. Urine was sampled daily and analyzed for urinary metabolites via 1H NMR analysis.\n\nUnsupervised Principal Components Analysis was applied for exploratory data analysis to identify trends and outliers in the spectral data. Then, supervised Orthogonal Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis was applied to classify the samples collected in different days and identify metabolic differences during the treatment. Metabolomes were compared across study groups (i.e. those receiving QD, BID, TID, and control) using a mixed-effects models. Spearman correlation was performed for injury biomarkers and the metabolome.\n\nResultsA total of 27 rats contributed 77 urinary samples; n=25 rats were included that were treated with Polymyxin B and n=2 received saline. Pre-dosing samples clustered well and were characterized by higher amounts of citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, and Hippurate. On day 1 post treatment, day 1 samples showed higher taurine; day 3 samples had higher lactate, acetate and creatine. Taurine was the only metabolite significantly increased in both BID and TID compared to QD group. Taurine on day 1 correlated with increasing histopathology scores (Spearmans rho = 0.4167, P=0.038) and KIM-1 (Spearmans rho =0.4052, P=0.036); whereas KIM-1 on day one and day 3 did not reach significance with histopathology (Spearmans rho = 0.3248, P=0.11 and Spearmans rho = 0.3739, P=0.066).\n\nConclusionPolymyxin B causes increased amounts of urinary taurine on day 1 which then normalizes to baseline concentrations. Taurine may provide one of the earlier signals of acute kidney damage caused by polymyxin B.",

    "abstract": "With age comes a gradual decline in physical function and exercise capacity, concurrent with a progressive propensity for development of sarcopenia /(age-related loss of muscle mass and strength) and frailty (inability of body to thrive and maintain homeostasis). Prior research has demonstrated that exercise, while not a cure, can help mitigate sarcopenia/frailty and restore functional capacity. Reliable, validated, pre-clinical models are necessary to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms at the intersection of age, exercise, and functional decline. In this study, we hypothesized that endurance exercise programs mimicking typical human exercise protocols would improve physical function in both adult and older adult mice. Furthermore, our secondary hypothesis was that older mice would receive less benefit from a similar volume of exercise than adult mice. To test these hypotheses, we randomly assigned (with some selection criteria) male C57BL/6 mice either at adult ages during the study (n=24, designated 10m, aged 6 months to 10 months) or at older adult ages (n=18, designated 26m, aged 22 months to 26 months) to a 13-week program of voluntary wheel running (VWR, group termed RUN) or high intensity interval training (HIIT), with an additional 10m sedentary control (CON). The functional aptitude of each mouse was determined pre- and post-training using our composite CFAB (comprehensive functional assessment battery) scoring system consisting of voluntary wheel running (volitional exercise and activity rate), treadmill (endurance), rotarod (overall motor function), grip meter (forelimb strength), and inverted cling (whole body strength/endurance). To measure sarcopenia, we tracked body mass and body composition changes with EchoMRI, and measured muscle wet mass post-training.",

To address this issue, we developed PISCES, a platform for the network-based, single-cell analysis of mammalian tissue. PISCES accurately estimates the mechanistic contribution of regulatory and signaling proteins to cell state implementation and maintenance, based on the expression of their lineage-specific transcriptional targets, thus supporting discovery and visualization of Master Regulators of cell state and cell state transitions. Experimental validation assays, including by assessing concordance with antibody and CITE-Seq-based measurements, show significant improvement in the ability to identify rare subpopulations and to elucidate key lineage markers, compared to gene expression analysis. Systematic analysis of single cell profiles in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) produced a comprehensive resource for human tissue studies, supporting fine-grain stratification of distinct cell states, molecular determinants, and surface markers.",

    "abstract": "O_LIComparing traits across species has been a hallmark of biological research for centuries. While inter-specific comparisons can be highly informative, phylogenetic inertia can bias estimates if not properly accounted for in comparative analyses. In response, researchers typically treat phylogenetic inertia as a form of autocorrelation that can be detected, modelled, and corrected for. Despite the range of methods available for quantifying the strength of phylogenetic autocorrelation, no tools exist for visualising these autocorrelation structures.\nC_LIO_LIHere we derive variogram methods suitable for phylogenic data, and show how they can be used to straightforwardly visualise phylogenetic autocorrelation. We then demonstrate their utility for three empirical examples: sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the Musteloidea, maximum per capita rate of population growth, r, in the Carnivora, and brain size in the Artiodactyla.\nC_LIO_LIWhen modelling musteloid SSD, the empirical variogram showed a tendency for the variance in SSD to stabilise over time, a characteristic feature of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) evolution. In agreement with this visual assessment, model selection identified the OU model as the best fit to the data. In contrast, the infinitely diffusive Brownian Motion (BM) model did not capture the asymptotic behaviour of the variogram and was less supported than the OU model. Phylogenetic variograms proved equally useful in understanding why an OU model was selected when modelling r in the Carnivora, and why BM was the selected evolutionary model for brain size in the Artiodactyla.\nC_LIO_LIBecause the variograms of the various evolutionary processes each have different theoretical profiles, comparing fitted semi-variance functions against empirical semi-variograms can serve as a useful diagnostic tool, allowing researchers to understand why any given evolutionary model might be selected over another, which features are well captured by the model, and which are not. This allows for fitted models to be compared against the empirical variogram, facilitating model identification prior to subsequent analyses. We therefore recommend that any phylogenetic analysis begin with a non-parametric estimate of the autocorrelation structure of the data that can be visualized. The methods developed in this work are openly available in the new R package ctpm.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The ability of natural selection to remove deleterious mutations from a population is a function of the effective population size. Increases in selfing rate, and concomitant increases in population-level homozygosity, can increase or decrease the efficacy of selection, depending on the dominance and selection coefficients of the deleterious mutations. Most theory has focused on how (partial) selfing affects the efficacy of selection for mutations of a given dominance and fitness effect in isolation. It remains unclear how selfing affects the purging of deleterious mutations in a genome-wide context where mutations with different selection and dominance coefficients co-segregate. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate how mutation, selection and recombination interact with selfing rate to shape genome-wide patterns of genetic load. We recover various mechanisms previously described for how (partial) selfing affects the efficacy of selection against mutations of a given dominance class. However, we find that the interaction of purifying selection against mutations of different dominance classes changes with selfing rate. In particular, as outcrossing populations transition from purifying selection to pseudo-overdominance they experience a dramatic increase in the genetic load caused by additive, mildly deleterious mutations. We describe the threshold selfing rate that prevents pseudo-overdominance and decreases genetic load.",

    "abstract": "One important goal of fish genetic breeding is to identify valuable loci and genes that can facilitate growth and thereby productivity. Few such loci or genes have been identified in golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus), a species of significant economic value. In this study, we produced a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of the golden pompano by de novo sequencing and assemblies for 2 parents and 200 F1 offspring by genome re-sequencing. We exploited these assemblies to identify loci and genes by QTL mapping, Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) genotyping, and haplotype-based regional association analysis based on growth records of a 64 biparental and 147 individuals from a naturally occurring population. At a locus 291kb from BSNP21031, we identified a somatostatin receptor type 1-like (designated as gpsstr1) gene in which the BSNP1369 of the promoter region was highly associated with growth. Loss of sstr1a, the homolog of gpsstr1 in zebrafish, caused growth retardation. Sstr1a mediated growth via sstr2 and Wnt-gsk-3{beta} signaling pathways. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms controlling growth. Our strategy can serve as an effective way to uncover novel genomic information and facilitate improvement of fish growth.",

    "abstract": "Identifying antigens displayed specifically on tumour cell surfaces by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins is important for the development of immunotherapies and cancer vaccines. The difficulty in capturing an HLA ligandome stems from the fact that many HLA ligands are derived from splicing events or contain mutations, hindering their identification in a standard database search. To address this challenge, we developed an immunopeptidomics workflow with PEAKS XPro that uses de novo sequencing to uncover such peptides and identifies mutations for neoantigen discovery. We demonstrate the utility of this workflow by re-analyzing HLA-I ligandome datasets and reveal a vast diversity in peptide sequences among clones derived from a colorectal cancer tumour. Over 8000 peptides predicted to bind HLA-I molecules were identified by de novo sequencing only (not found in the UniProt database) and make up over 50% of identified peptides from each sample. Lastly, tumour-specific mutations and consensus sequence motif characteristics are defined. This workflow is widely applicable to any immunopeptidomic mass spectrometry dataset and does not require custom database generation for neoantigen discovery.",

    "abstract": "Coevolution is often considered a major driver of speciation, but evidence for this claim is not always found because diversity might be cryptic. When morphological divergence is low, molecular data are needed to uncover diversity. A taxon for which this holds true are the mites, which are known for their extensive and often cryptic diversity. We studied mites of the genus Poecilochirus that are phoretic on burying beetles (Silphidae: Nicrophorus). Poecilochirus taxonomy is poorly understood. Most studies on this genus focus on the evolutionary ecology of Poecilochirus carabi sensu lato, a complex of at least two biological species. Based on molecular data of 230 specimens from 43 locations worldwide, we identified 24 genetic clusters that may represent species. We estimate that these mites began to diversify during the Paleogene, when the clade containing P. subterraneus branched off and the remaining mites diverged into two further clades. One clade resembles P. monospinosus and P. austroasiaticus. The other clade contains 17 genetic clusters resembling P. carabi s.l.. Among these are P. carabi sensu stricto, P. necrophori, and potentially many additional cryptic species. Our analyses suggest that these clades were formed in the miocene by large-scale geographic separation. Diversification also seems to have happened on a smaller scale, potentially due to adaptation to specific hosts or local abiotic conditions, causing some clusters to specialize on certain beetle species. Our results suggest that biodiversity in this genus was generated by multiple interacting forces shaping the tangled webs of life.",

Our biochemical experiment demonstrates that PICS exists as an octamer consisting of two copies of each subunits. Combining structural analyses with mutagenesis experiments, we identified residues of PICS subunits that are critical for maintaining intact PICS complex in vitro. Furthermore, using genetics, cell biology and imaging experiments, we found that those mutants impairing the in vitro interaction network within PICS, also lead to abnormal dysfunction PICS in vivo, including mislocalization of PICS, and reduced levels of piRNAs or abnormal chromosome segregation and cell division.

However, FUBI is not part of the mature 40S ribosomal subunit and cleaved off by an as-of-yet unidentified protease. How FUBI-eS30 processing is coordinated with 40S subunit maturation is unknown. To study the mechanism and importance of FUBI-eS30 processing, we expressed non-cleavable mutants in human cells, which affected late steps of cytoplasmic 40S maturation, including the maturation of 18S rRNA and recycling of late-acting ribosome biogenesis factors. Differential affinity purification of wild-type and non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants identified the deubiquitinase USP36 as a candidate FUBI-eS30 processing enzyme. Depletion of USP36 by RNAi or CRISPRi indeed impaired FUBI-eS30 processing and moreover, purified USP36 cut FUBI-eS30 in vitro. Together, these data demonstrate the functional importance of FUBI-eS30 cleavage and identify USP36 as a novel protease involved in this process.",

    "abstract": "Polycystins are conserved mechanosensitive channels whose mutations lead to the common human renal disorder ADPKD. Previously we discovered that the plasma membrane-localized fission yeast homologue Pkd2p is an essential protein required for cytokinesis, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we isolated a novel temperature-sensitive mutant pkd2-B42. Among its strong growth defects, the most unique was that many mutant cells often lost significant portion of their volume in just 5 minutes followed by a gradual recovery, a process that we termed Deflation. Unlike cell lysis, deflation did not result in the plasma membrane rupture and it occurred independently from the cell cycle progression. The tip extension of pkd2-B42 cells was 80% slower than the wild type and their turgor pressure was 50% lower. Both pkd2-B42 and the other mutant pkd2-81KD partially rescued the mutants of the yeast Hippo signaling pathway Septation Initiation Network, by preventing cell lysis, enhancing septum formation, and doubling the number of Sid2/Mob1 molecules at the spindle pole bodies. We conclude that Pkd2p promotes cell size expansion during interphase by regulating turgor pressure and antagonizes SIN during cytokinesis.\n\nSummary statementMutations of polycystins lead to human genetic disorder ADPKD. We discovered that the fission yeast homologue Pkd2p promotes the cell expansion during interphase growth and antagonizes the Hippo pathway SIN during cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenetic events during development of the fetal ovary are crucial to the establishment of female fertility. However, the effects of structural rearrangements of the ovary and surrounding reproductive tissues on ovary morphogenesis remain largely uncharacterized. Using tissue clearing and lightsheet microscopy, we found that ovary folding correlated with regionalization into cortex and medulla. Relocation of the oviduct to the ventral aspect of the ovary led to ovary encapsulation, and mutual attachment of the ovary and oviduct to the cranial suspensory ligament likely triggered ovary folding. Development of the rete ovarii correlated with events of ovary morphogenesis. Using genetic mouse models in which the oviduct and rete ovarii are perturbed, we found the oviduct is required for ovary encapsulation. This study reveals novel relationships among the ovary and surrounding tissues and paves the way for functional investigation of the relationship between architecture and differentiation of the mammalian ovary.",

    "abstract": "Much effort has been devoted to the development of selective inhibitors of the LRRK2 as a potential treatment for LRRK2 driven Parkinsons disease. In this study we first compare the properties of Type I (GSK3357679A and MLi-2) and Type II (GZD-824, Rebastinib and Ponatinib) kinase inhibitors that bind to the closed or open conformations of the LRRK2 kinase domain, respectively. We show that Type I and Type II inhibitors suppress phosphorylation of Rab10 and Rab12, key physiological substrates of LRRK2 and also promote mitophagy, a process suppressed by LRRK2. Type II inhibitors also display higher potency towards wild type LRRK2 compared to pathogenic mutants. Unexpectedly, we find that Type II inhibitors, in contrast to Type I compounds, fail to induce dephosphorylation of a set of well-studied LRRK2 biomarker phosphorylation sites at the N-terminal region of LRRK2, including Ser935. These findings emphasize that the biomarker phosphorylation sites on LRRK2 are likely reporting on the open vs closed conformation of LRRK2 kinase and that only inhibitors which stabilize the closed conformation induce dephosphorylation of these biomarker sites. Finally, we demonstrate that the LRRK2[A2016T] mutant which is resistant to MLi-2 Type 1 inhibitor, also induces resistance to GZD-824 and Rebastinib suggesting this mutation could be exploited to distinguish off target effects of Type II inhibitors. Our observations provide a framework of knowledge to aide with the development of more selective Type II LRRK2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Many cell regulatory systems implicate nonlinearity and redundancy among components. The regulatory network governing lamellipodial and lamellar actin structures is prototypical of such a system, containing tens of actin-nucleating and -modulating molecules with functional overlap and feedback loops. Due to instantaneous and long-term compensation, phenotyping the system response to perturbation provides limited information on the roles the targeted component plays in the unperturbed system. Accordingly, how individual actin regulators contribute to lamellipodial dynamics remains ambiguous. Here, we present a perturbation-free reconstruction of cause-effect relations among actin regulators by applying Granger-causal inference to constitutive image fluctuations that indicate regulator recruitment as a proxy for activity. Our analysis identifies distinct zones of actin regulator activation and of causal effects on filament assembly and delineates actin-dependent and actin-independent regulator roles in controlling edge motion. We propose that edge motion is driven by assembly of two independently operating actin filament systems.

    "abstract": "Clathrin-coated pits are formed by the recognition of membrane and cargo by the heterotetrameric AP2 complex and the subsequent recruitment of clathrin triskelia. A potential role for AP2 in coated-pit assembly beyond initial clathrin recruitment has not been explored. Clathrin binds the {beta}2 subunit of AP2, and several binding sites on {beta}2 and on the clathrin heavy chain have been identified, but our structural knowledge of these interactions is incomplete and their functional importance during endocytosis is unclear. Here, we analysed the cryo-EM structure of clathrin cages assembled in the presence of {beta}2 hinge and appendage ({beta}2HA) domains. We find that the {beta}2-appendage binds in at least two positions in the cage, demonstrating that multi-modal binding is a fundamental property of clathrin-AP2 interactions. In one position, {beta}2-appendage cross-links two adjacent terminal domains from different triskelia below the vertex. Functional analysis of {beta}2HA-clathrin interactions reveals that endocytosis requires two clathrin interaction sites: a clathrin-box motif on the hinge and the \"sandwich site\" on the appendage, with the appendage \"platform site\" having less importance. From these studies and the work of others, we propose that {beta}2-appendage binding to more than one clathrin triskelion is a key feature of the system and likely explains why clathrin assembly is driven by AP2.",

Here we used bioluminescent nuclear factor (NF)-{kappa}B reporter mice and macrophages to discover that metastatic tumors trigger NF-{kappa}B activation in host macrophages, dependent on mutant KRAS signaling and delivered via secretory versican. Versican activates NF-{kappa}B in tumor-associated macrophages via inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B kinase (IKK) {beta}, resulting in release of interleukin (IL)-1{beta} into the tumor microenvironment. Versican silencing in cancer cells or conditional IKK{beta} deletion in macrophages prevents myeloid NF-{kappa}B activation and metastasis. Versican is overexpressed and/or mutated in human cancers and metastatic effusions with KRAS mutations, predicts poor survival, can aid in the development of diagnostic platforms for pleural metastasis, and is druggable via toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 inhibition. The data indicate a cardinal role for tumor-derived versican in establishing cross-talk with macrophage IKK{beta} during metastasis and may foster the development of new therapies and diagnostic tools.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRisk prediction is crucial for early detection and prognosis of breast cancer. Circulating plasma proteins could provide a valuable source to increase the validity of risk prediction models, however, no such markers have yet been identified for clinical use.\n\nMethodsEDTA plasma samples from 183 breast cancer cases and 366 age-matched controls were collected prior to diagnosis from the Swedish breast cancer cohort KARMA. The samples were profiled on 700 circulating proteins using an exploratory affinity proteomics approach. Linear association analyses were performed on case-control status and a data-driven analysis strategy was applied to cluster the women on their plasma proteome profiles in an unsupervised manner. The resulting clusters were subsequently annotated for the differences in phenotypic characteristics, clinical parameters, and genetic risk.\n\nResultsUsing the data-driven approach we identified five clusters with distinct proteomic plasma profiles. Women in a particular sub-group (cluster 1) were significantly more likely to have used menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT), more likely to get a breast cancer diagnosis, and were older compared to the remaining clusters. The levels of circulating proteins in cluster 1 were decreased for proteins related to DNA repair and cell replication and increased for proteins related to mammographic density and female tissues. In contrast, classical dichotomous case-control analyses did not reveal any proteins significantly associated with future breast cancer.\n\nConclusionUsing a data-driven approach, we identified a subset of women with circulating proteins associated with previous use of MHT and risk of breast cancer. Our findings point to the potential long-lasting effects of MHT on the circulating proteome even after ending the treatment, and hence provide valuable insights concerning risk predication of breast cancer.\n\nHighlightsO_LICurrent risk prediction models use a variety of factors to identify women at risk of developing breast cancer.\nC_LIO_LIProteins circulating in blood represent an attractive but currently still underrepresented source of candidates serving as molecular risk factors.\nC_LIO_LIPlasma proteomes from women participating in a prospective breast cancer cohort study were studied for proteomic risk factors related to a future breast cancer diagnosis.\nC_LIO_LIUsing data-driven approaches, women with future breast cancers and previous use of menopausal hormone therapy were identified based on their circulating proteins.\nC_LIO_LIMenopausal hormone therapy was found to altered the levels of the circulating proteins even years after the treatment ended.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Extensive interactions occur between a poultry host and its gut microbiome. Glycerol monolaurate (GML) possesses a large range of antimicrobial and immunoregulatory properties. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of different doses of GML (basal diets complemented with 0, 300, 600, 900, or 1200 mg/kg GML) on growth performance, intestinal barrier, and cecal microbiota in broiler chicks. Results revealed that feed intake increased after 900 and 1200 mg/kg GML were administered during the entire 14-day experiment period. Dietary GML decreased crypt depth and increased the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio of the jejunum. In the serum and jejunum, supplementation with more than 600 mg/kg GML reduced interleukin-1{beta}, tumor necrosis factor-, and malondialdehyde levels and increased the levels of immunoglobulin G, jejunal mucin 2, total antioxidant capacity, and total superoxide dismutase. GML down-regulated jejunal interleukin-1{beta} and interferon-{gamma} expression and increased the mRNA level of zonula occludens 1 and occludin. A reduced expression of toll-like receptor 4 and a tendency of down-regulated nuclear factor kappa-B was shown in GML-treated groups. In addition, GML modulated the composition of the cecal microbiota of the broilers, improved microbial diversity, and increased the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria. Spearmans correlation analysis revealed that the genera Barnesiella, Coprobacter, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Odoriacter, and Parabacteroides were related to inflammation and intestinal integrity. In conclusion, GML ameliorated intestinal morphology and barrier function in broiler chicks probably by regulating intestinal immune and antioxidant balance, as well as intestinal microbiota.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntibiotic residues and resistance issues led to the ban of antibiotic growth promoters. GML is considered an efficacious antibiotic growth promoter alternative for animal health and has the potential to become a unique fungicide owing to its established safety, antibacterial properties, and immunomodulatory capacity. Despite the potential of GML as an additive in poultry feed, little is known about the influence of GML on cecal microbiota in broilers. The significance of our research was to determine the microbial mechanism by which GML worked.",

    "abstract": "Brain connectivity requires correct axonal guidance to drive axons to their appropriate targets. This process is orchestrated by guidance cues that exert attraction or repulsion to developing axons. However, the intricacies of the cellular machinery responsible for the correct response of growth cones are just being unveiled. Netrin-1 is a bifunctional molecule involved in axon pathfinding and cell migration that induces repulsion during postnatal cerebellar development. This process is mediated by Uncoordinated locomotion 5 (UNC5) receptors located on external granule layer (EGL) tracts. Here, we demonstrate that this response is characterized by enhanced membrane internalization through macropinocytosis, but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that UNC5 receptors form a protein complex with the t-SNARE syntaxin-1 (Stx1). By combining botulinum neurotoxins, a shRNA knock-down strategy and Stx1 knock-out mice, we demonstrate that this SNARE protein is required for Netrin-1-induced macropinocytosis and chemorepulsion, suggesting that Stx1 is crucial in regulating Netrin-1-mediated axonal guidance.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) are web-like chromatin structures composed by dsDNA and histones, decorated with anti-microbial proteins. Their interaction with dendritic cells (DC) allows DC activation and maturation toward presentation of NET-associated antigens. Differently from other types of cell death that imply protein denaturation, NETosis preserves the proteins localized onto the DNA threads for proper enzymatic activity and conformational status, including immunogenic epitopes. Besides neutrophils, leukemic cells can release extracellular traps displaying leukemia-associated antigens, prototypically mutant nucleophosmin (NPMc+) that upon mutation translocates from nucleolus to the cytoplasm localizing onto NET threads. We tested NPMc+ immunogenicity through a NET/DC vaccine to treat NPMc-driven myeloproliferation in transgenic and transplantable models. Vaccination with DC loaded with NPMc+ NET (NPMc+ NET/DC) reduced myeloproliferation in transgenic mice, favoring the development of antibodies to mutant NPMc and and the induction of a CD8+ T cell response. The efficacy of this vaccine was also tested in mixed NPMc/WT bone marrow chimeras in a competitive bone marrow transplantation setting, where the NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination impaired the expansion of NPMc+ in favor of WT myeloid compartment. NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination also achieved control of an aggressive leukemia transduced with mutant NPMc, effectively inducing an anti-leukemia CD8 T cell memory response.\n\neTOC SummaryNPMc is an AML-triggering mutation inducing translocation of NPM into the cytoplasm, allowing its association to NET threads. On NET, NPMc becomes immunogenic acting as an alarmin and exposing immunogenic peptides. We demonstrate that NET can be exploited as anti-tumor weapons in DC-based vaccination strategies.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially the genetic factors contributing to imbalance of naive/memory T-cell subpopulations, still remain largely elusive. Here we show that loss of DJ-1 encoded by PARK7/DJ-1, causing early-onset familial Parkinsons disease (PD), unexpectedly delayed immunoaging in both human and mice. Compared with two gender-matched unaffected sibling carriers of similar ages, the index PD patient with DJ-1 deficiency showed a decline in many critical immunoaging features, including almost doubled frequencies of non-senescent T cells. The observation of a  younger immune system in the index patient was further consolidated by the results in aged DJ-1 knockout mice. Our data from bone marrow chimera models and adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that DJ-1 regulates several immunoaging features via hematopoietic-intrinsic and naive-CD8-intrinsic mechanisms. Our finding suggests an unrecognized critical role of DJ-1 in regulating immunoaging, discovering a potent target to interfere with immunoaging- and aging-associated diseases.",

Here, we aimed to analyse the activity of a mixture of the three tamoxifen metabolites against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and Enterococcus spp.\n\nMRSE (n=17) and Enterococcus spp. (E. faecalis n=8, and E. faecium n=10) strains were used. MIC of the mixture of DTAM, HTAM and ENDX, and vancomycin were determined by microdilution assay. The bactericidal activity of the three metabolites together and vancomycin against MRSE (SE385 and SE742) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (EVR1 and EVR2) strains was determined by time-kill curve assays. Finally, changes in membrane permeability of SE742 and EVR1 strains were analyzed using fluorescence assays.\n\nMIC50 and MIC90 of tamoxifen metabolites were 1 mg/L for MRSE strains and 2 mg/L for Enterococcus spp. strains. In the time-killing assays, tamoxifen metabolites mixture showed bactericidal activity at 2x and 4xMIC for MRSE (SE385 and SE742) and E. faecalis (EVR1 and EVR2) strains. This antimicrobial activity of tamoxifen metabolites paralleled an increased membrane permeability of SE385 and EVR2 strains.\n\nAltogether, these results showed that tamoxifen metabolites presented antibacterial activity against MRSE and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, suggesting that tamoxifen metabolites might increase the arsenal of drugs treatment against these bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a leading human pathogen that frequently causes chronic and relapsing infections. Antibiotic tolerant persister cells contribute to frequent antibiotic failure in patients. Macrophages represent an important niche during S. aureus bacteremia and recent work has identified a role for oxidative burst in the formation of antibiotic tolerant S. aureus. We find that host-derived peroxynitrite, the reaction product of superoxide and nitric oxide, is the main mediator of antibiotic tolerance in macrophages. Using a collection of S. aureus clinical isolates, we find that, despite significant variation in persister formation in pure culture, all strains were similarly enriched for antibiotic tolerance following internalization by activated macrophages. Our findings suggest that host interaction strongly induces antibiotic tolerance and may negate bacterial mechanisms of persister formation, established in pure culture. These findings emphasize the importance of studying antibiotic tolerance in the context of bacterial interaction with the host suggest that modulation of the host response may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to sensitize S. aureus to antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is an important fungal pathogen and the main etiological agent of aspergillosis, a disease characterized by a noninvasive process that can evolve to a more severe clinical manifestation called invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in immunocompromised patients. The antifungal arsenal to threat aspergillosis is very restricted. Azoles are the main therapeutic approach to control IPA, but the emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates has significantly increased over the last decades. Therefore, new strategies are necessary to combat aspergillosis and drug repurposing has emerged as an efficient and alternative approach for identifying new antifungal drugs. Here, we used a screening approach to analyze A. fumigatus in vitro susceptibility to 1,127 compounds. A. fumigatus was more susceptible to 10 compounds, including miltefosine, a drug that displayed fungicidal activity against A. fumigatus. By screening an A. fumigatus transcription factor null library, we identified a single mutant, which has the rmiA (resistant to miltefosine) gene deleted, conferring a phenotype of susceptibility to miltefosine. The transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq) of the wild-type and the {Delta}rmiA strains and the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation coupled to next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of a RmiA-tagged strain exposed to miltefosine revealed genes of the sphingolipids pathway that are directly or indirectly regulated by RmiA. Sphingolipids analysis demonstrated that the mutant has overall decreased levels of sphingolipids when growing in the presence of miltefosine. The identification of RmiA represents the first genetic element described and characterized which plays a direct role in miltefosine response in fungi.\n\nAuthor summaryThe filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus causes a group of diseases named aspergillosis and their development occurs after the inhalation of conidia dispersed in the environment. Very few classes of antifungal drugs are available for aspergillosis treatment, e.g., azoles, but the emergence of global resistance to azoles in A. fumigatus clinical isolates has increased over the last decades. Repositioning or repurposing drugs already available on the market is an interesting and faster opportunity for the identification of novel antifungals agents. By using a repurposing strategy, we identified 10 different compounds that impact A. fumigatus survival. One of these compounds, miltefosine, demonstrated fungicidal activity against A. fumigatus. The mechanism of action of miltefosine is unknown and aiming to get more insights about it, we identified a transcription factor RmiA (Resistant to miltefosine) important for miltefosine resistance. Our results suggest that miltefosine plays antifungal activity against A. fumigatus interfering in the sphingolipids biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the genes present in bacterial genomes remain poorly characterised with up to one third of those that are protein encoding having no definitive function. Transposon insertion sequencing represents a high-throughput technique that can help rectify this deficiency. The technology, however, can only be realistically applied to easily transformable species leaving those with low DNA-transfer rates out of reach. Here we have developed a number of approaches that overcome this barrier in the autotrophic species Clostridium autoethanogenum using a mariner-based transposon system. The inherent instability of such systems in the Escherichia coli conjugation donor due to transposition events was counteracted through the incorporation of a conditionally lethal codA marker on the plasmid backbone. Relatively low frequencies of transformation of the plasmid into C. autoethanogenum were circumvented through the use of a plasmid that is conditional for replication coupled with the routine implementation of an Illumina library preparation protocol that eliminates plasmid-based reads. A transposon library was then used to determine the essential genes needed for growth using carbon monoxide as a sole carbon and energy source.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlthough microbial genome sequences are relatively easily determined, assigning gene function remains a bottleneck. Consequently, relatively few genes are well characterised, leaving the function of many as either hypothetical or entirely unknown. High-throughput, transposon sequencing can help remedy this deficiency, but is generally only applicable to microbes with efficient DNA-transfer procedures. These exclude many microorganisms of importance to humankind either as agents of disease or as industrial process organisms. Here we developed approaches to facilitate transposon-insertion sequencing in the acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum, a chassis being exploited to convert single-carbon waste gases, CO and CO2, into chemicals and fuels at an industrial scale. This allowed the determination of gene essentiality under heterotrophic and autotrophic growth providing insights into the utilisation of CO as a sole carbon and energy source. The strategies implemented are translatable and will allow others to apply transposon-insertion sequencing to other microbes where DNA-transfer has until now represented a barrier to progress.",

    "abstract": "Bile salts are amphiphilic steroids with a C5 carboxylic side chain with digestive functions in vertebrates. Upon excretion, they are degraded by environmental bacteria. Degradation of the bile-salt steroid skeleton resembles the well-studied pathway for other steroids like testosterone, while specific differences occur during side-chain degradation and the initiating transformations of the steroid skeleton. Of the latter, two variants via either {Delta}1,4- or {Delta}4,6-3-ketostructures of the steroid skeleton exist for 7-hydroxy bile salts. While the {Delta}1,4- variant is well-known from many model organisms, the {Delta}4,6-variant involving a 7-hydroxysteroid dehydratase as key enzyme has not been systematically studied. Here, combined proteomic, bioinformatic and functional analyses of the {Delta}4,6-variant in Sphingobium sp. strain Chol11 were performed. They revealed a degradation of the steroid rings similar to the {Delta}1,4-variant except for the elimination of the 7-OH as key difference. In contrast, differential production of the respective proteins revealed a putative gene cluster for side-chain degradation encoding a CoA-ligase, an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a Rieske monooxygenase, and an amidase, but lacking most canonical genes known from other steroid-degrading bacteria. Bioinformatic analyses predicted the {Delta}4,6-variant to be widespread among the Sphingomonadaceae, which was verified for three type strains which also have the predicted side-chain degradation cluster. A second amidase in the side-chain degradation gene cluster of strain Chol11 was shown to cleave conjugated bile salts while having low similarity to known bile-salt hydrolases. This study signifies members of the Sphingomonadaceae remarkably well-adapted to the utilization of bile salts via a partially distinct metabolic pathway.\n\nImportanceThis study highlights the biochemical diversity of bacterial degradation of steroid compounds, in particular bile salts. Furthermore, it substantiates and advances knowledge of a variant pathway for degradation of steroids by sphingomonads, a group of environmental bacteria that are well-known for their broad metabolic capabilities. Biodegradation of bile salts is a critical process due to the high input of these compounds from manure into agricultural soils and wastewater treatment plants. In addition, these results may also be relevant for the biotechnological production of bile salts or other steroid compounds with pharmaceutical functions.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization between crops and their wild relatives may promote the evolution of de-domesticated (feral) weeds. Wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is typically found in ruderal environments, but crop-wild hybridization may facilitate the evolution of weedy populations. Using one crop-specific mitochondrial marker (CMS-PET1) and 14 nuclear SSR markers, we studied the origin and genetic diversity of a recently discovered weedy population of sunflower (named BRW). Then, using a resurrection approach, we tested for rapid evolution of weedy traits (seed dormancy, herbicide resistance, and competitive ability) by sampling weedy and wild populations 10 years apart (2007 and 2017). All the weedy plants present the CMS-PET1 cytotype, confirming their feral origin. At the nuclear markers, BRW showed higher genetic diversity than the cultivated lines and low differentiation with one wild population, suggesting that wild hybridization increased their genetic diversity. We found support for rapid evolution towards higher seed dormancy, but not for higher competitive ability or herbicide resistance. Our results highlight the importance of seed dormancy during the earliest stages of adaptation and show that crop-wild hybrids can evolve quickly in agricultural environments.",

To eliminate the dependence on isolates, the enzyme-linked lectin assay for analyzing NA antigenicity was performed with reverse genetic viruses carrying the same HA. Our results show that ferret antisera against NAs from the recommended H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine strains for the 2020-21 northern hemisphere influenza season recognize and inhibit the most prevalent circulating N1s and N2s, suggesting the NAs from the influenza A vaccine and circulating strains are antigenically similar. Comparisons of the recent N2s also revealed a bias in the reactivity of NA antisera from the egg and cell-based H3N2 vaccine strains due to a C-terminal substitution, indicating the C-terminus can influence N2 antigenicity and should receive consideration during the H3N2 strain selection.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous hemagglutinin (FhaB) is a critical virulence factor for both Bordetella pertussis, the causal agent of whooping cough, and the closely related species Bordetella bronchiseptica. FhaB is an adhesin, suppresses inflammatory cytokine production, and protects against phagocytic cell clearance during infection. Regulated degradation of the FhaB C-terminal prodomain is required to establish a persistent infection in mice. Two proteases, CtpA in the periplasm and SphB1 on the bacterial surface, are known to mediate FhaB processing, and we recently determined that CtpA functions before, and controls the FhaB cleavage site of, SphB1. However, the data indicate that another periplasmic protease must initiate degradation of the prodomain by removing a portion of the FhaB C terminus that inhibits CtpA-mediated degradation. Using a candidate approach, we identified DegP as the initiating protease. Deletion of degP or substitution of its predicted catalytic residue resulted in reduced creation of FHA', the main product of FhaB processing, and an accumulation of full-length FhaB in whole cell lysates. Also, FHA' was no longer released into culture supernatants in degP mutants. Alterations of the FhaB C terminus that relieve inhibition of CtpA abrogate the need for DegP, consistent with DegP functioning prior to CtpA in the processing pathway. DegP is not required for secretion of FhaB through FhaC or for adherence of the bacteria to host cells, indicating that DegP acts primarily as a protease and not a chaperone for FhaB in B. bronchiseptica. Our results highlight a role for HtrA family proteases in activation of virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria.\n\nImportanceTwo-partner secretion (TPS) systems are broadly distributed among Gram-negative bacteria and play important roles in bacterial pathogenesis. FhaB-FhaC is the prototypical member of the TPS family and here we identified the protease that initiates a processing cascade that controls FhaB function. Our results are significant because they provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the ability of Bordetella species to prevent clearance by phagocytic cells, which is critical for bacterial persistence in the lower respiratory tract. Our findings also highlight an underappreciated role for HtrA family proteases in processing specific bacterial virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "Crop losses to plant pathogens are a growing threat to global food security and more effective control strategies are urgently required. Biofumigation, an agricultural technique where Brassica plant tissues are mulched into soils to release antimicrobial plant allelochemicals called isothiocyanates (ITCs), has been proposed as an environmentally friendly alternative to agrochemicals. While biofumigation has been shown to suppress a range of plant pathogens, its effects on plant pathogenic bacteria remain largely unexplored. Here we used a laboratory model system to compare the efficacy of different types of ITCs against Ralstonia solanacearum plant bacterial pathogen. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for ITC-tolerance evolution under high, intermediate and low transfer frequency ITC exposure treatments. We found that allyl-ITC was the most efficient compound at suppressing R. solanacearum growth, and its efficacy was not improved when combined with other types of ITCs. Despite consistent pathogen growth suppression, ITC tolerance evolution was observed in the low transfer frequency exposure treatment, leading to cross-tolerance to ampicillin beta-lactam antibiotic. Mechanistically, tolerance was linked to insertion sequence movement at four positions in genes that were potentially associated with stress responses (H-NS histone like protein), cell growth and competitiveness (acyltransferase), iron storage ((2-Fe-2S)-binding protein) and calcium ion sequestration (calcium-binding protein). Interestingly, pathogen adaptation to the growth media also indirectly selected for increased ITC tolerance through potential adaptations linked with metabolism and antibiotic resistance (dehydrogenase-like protein) and transmembrane protein movement (Tat pathway signal protein). Together, our results suggest that R. solanacearum can rapidly evolve tolerance to allyl-ITC plant allelochemical which could constrain the long-term efficiency of biofumigation biocontrol and potentially shape pathogen evolution with plants.",

    "abstract": "Competition is a critical aspect of bacterial life, as it enables niche establishment and facilitates the acquisition of essential nutrients. Warfare between Gram-negative bacteria is largely mediated by the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a dynamic nanoweapon that delivers toxic effector proteins from an attacking cell to adjacent bacteria in a contact-dependent manner. Effector-encoding bacteria prevent self-intoxication and kin cell killing by the expression of immunity proteins, which prevent effector toxicity by specifically binding their cognate effector and occluding its active site. In this study, we investigate Tsi3, a previously uncharacterized T6SS immunity protein present in multiple strains of the human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. We show that Tsi3 is the cognate immunity protein of the antibacterial effector of unknown function Tse3. Our bioinformatic analyses indicate that Tsi3 homologs are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria, often encoded within T6SS effector-immunity modules. Surprisingly, we found that Tsi3 homologs possess a characteristic formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) domain, which is present in various enzymatic proteins. Our data shows that Tsi3-mediated immunity is dependent on Tse3-Tsi3 protein-protein interactions and that Tsi3 homologs from various bacteria do not protect against Tse3-dependent bacterial killing. Thus, we conclude that Tsi3 homologs are unlikely to be functional enzymes. Collectively, our work identifies FGE domain-containing proteins as important mediators of immunity against T6SS attacks and indicates that the FGE domain can be co-opted as a scaffold in multiple proteins to carry out diverse functions.\n\nImportanceDespite the wealth of knowledge on the diversity of biochemical activities carried out by T6SS effectors, comparably little is known about the various strategies bacteria employ to prevent susceptibility to T6SS-dependent bacterial killing. Our work establishes a novel family of T6SS immunity proteins with a characteristic FGE domain. This domain is present in enzymatic proteins with various catalytic activities. Our characterization of Tsi3 expands the known functions carried out by FGE-like proteins to include defense during T6SS-mediated bacterial warfare. Moreover, it highlights the evolution of FGE domain-containing proteins to carry out diverse biological functions.",

By establishing a probability-based model to evaluate the consensus probability between MLB-seq data and structures proposed using NUPACK software, we identified the secondary structures of individual ssDNA molecules and estimated the distribution of multiple secondary structures in solution. We studied the structures of 1,057 human genome subsequences and experimentally confirmed that 84% adopted two or more structures.

We used generalized linear mixed effects models to assess the relationship between epiphytic and terrestrial plant diversity, and contemporary and historical environmental predictors.\n\nResultsWe find that epiphytes substantially contribute to global centres of vascular plant diversity, accounting for up to 39% of the vascular flora in the Neotropics. Epiphytes decrease in species numbers with increasing latitude at a rate three times faster than terrestrial plants, a trend that is driven mainly by the distribution of tropical forests and precipitation. Further, large regional differences emerge that are explained by several large endemic angiosperm families (e.g., Neotropical Bromeliaceae) that are absent in other tropical regions.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results show that epiphytes are disproportionately diverse in most global centres of plant diversity and play an important role in driving the global latitudinal diversity gradient for plants. The distribution of precipitation and tropical forests emerge as major drivers of the latitudinal diversity gradient in epiphyte species richness. Finally, our findings demonstrate how epiphyte floras in different biogeographical realms are composed of different families and higher taxa revealing an important signature of historical biogeography.",

    "abstract": "Phytoalexins are specialized metabolites that are induced upon pathogen infection and contribute to the defense arsenal of plants. Maize and rice produce multiple diterpenoid phytoalexins and there is evidence from genomic sequences that other monocots may also produce diterpenoid phytoalexins. Here we report on the identification and characterization of a gene cluster in barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Golden Promise) that is involved in the production of a set of labdane-related diterpenoids upon infection of roots by the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana. The cluster is localized on chromosome 2, covers over 600 kb and comprises genes coding for a (+)-copalyl diphosphate synthase (HvCPS2), a kaurene synthase like (HvKSL4) and several cytochrome P450 oxygenases (CYPs). Expression of HvCPS2 and HvKSL4 in yeast and Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in the production of a single major product, whose structure was determined to be of the cleistanthane type and was named hordediene. Co-expression of HvCPS2, HvKSL4 and one of the CYPs from the cluster (CYP89E31) afforded two additional products, hordetriene and 11-hydroxy-hordetriene. Both of these compounds could be detected in extracts of barley roots infected by B. sorokiniana, validating the function of these genes in planta. Furthermore, diterpenoids with multiple oxidations and with molecular masses of 316, 318 and 332 were induced in infected barley roots and secreted in the medium, indicating that additional oxidases, possibly from the same genomic cluster are involved in the production of these phytoalexins. Our results provide the basis for further investigation of the role of this gene cluster in the defense of barley against pathogens and more generally in the interaction with the microbiome.",
