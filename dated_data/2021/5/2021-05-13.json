    "abstract": "PIK3CA is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes; the p110 protein it encodes plays a central role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. Small molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit have entered clinical trials, with early-phase GDC-0077 (Inavolisib) studies showing anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with PIK3CA-mutant, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer as a single agent or in combination therapy. Despite this, preclinical studies have shown that PI3K pathway inhibition releases negative feedback and activates receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, reengaging the pathway and attenuating drug activity. Here we discover that GDC-0077 and taselisib more potently inhibit mutant PI3K pathway signaling and cell viability through unique HER2-dependent degradation. Both are more effective than other PI3K inhibitors at maintaining prolonged pathway suppression, resulting in enhanced apoptosis and greater efficacy. This unique mechanism against mutant p110 reveals a new strategy for creating inhibitors that specifically target mutant tumors with selective degradation of the mutant oncoprotein and also provide a strong rationale for pursuing PI3K degraders in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWith advances in single-cell techniques, measuring gene dynamics at cellular resolution has become practicable. In contrast, the increased complexity of data has made it more challenging computationally to unravel underlying biological mechanisms. Thus, it is critical to develop novel computational methods capable of dealing with such complexity and of providing predictive deductions from such data. Many methods have been developed to address such challenges, each with its own advantages and limitations. We present an iterative regression algorithm for inferring a mechanistic gene network from single-cell data. Using this regression, we infer a developmental model for the gene dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster blastoderm embryo. Our results show that the predictive power of the inferred model is higher than that of other models inferred with least squares and ridge regressions.\n\nFurthermore, model predictions of the gene dynamics are more accurate than predictions made with neural networks. This holds true even in the limit of small sample sizes. We compare predictions for various gene knockouts with published experimental results, finding substantial agreement. We also make predictions for gene dynamics under various gene network perturbations, impossible in non-mechanistic models.",

    "abstract": "Electrical synapses are established between specific neurons and within distinct subcellular compartments, but the mechanisms that direct gap junction assembly in the nervous system are largely unknown. Here we show that a transcriptional program tunes cAMP signaling to direct the neuron-specific assembly and placement of electrical synapses in the C. elegans motor circuit. For these studies, we use live cell imaging to visualize electrical synapses in vivo and a novel optogenetic assay to confirm that they are functional. In VA motor neurons, the UNC-4 transcription factor blocks expression of cAMP antagonists that promote gap junction miswiring. In unc-4 mutants, VA electrical synapses are established with an alternative synaptic partner and are repositioned from the VA axon to soma. We show that cAMP counters these effects by driving gap junction trafficking into the VA axon for electrical synapse assembly. Thus, our experiments in an intact nervous system establish that cAMP regulates gap junction trafficking for the biogenesis of electrical synapses.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic aggregation of Tar-DNA/RNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) occurs in 97 percent of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), about 40 percent of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and in many cases of Alzheimers disease (AD). Cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions are seen in both sporadic and familial forms of these disorders, including those cases that are caused by repeat expansion mutations in the C9orf72 gene. To identify downstream mediators of TDP-43 toxicity, we expressed human TDP-43 in a subset of Drosophila motor neurons. Such expression causes age-dependent deficits in negative geotaxis behavior. Using this behavioral readout of locomotion, we conducted an shRNA suppressor screen and identified 32 transcripts whose knockdown was sufficient to ameliorate the neurological phenotype. The majority of these suppressors also substantially suppressed the negative effects on lifespan seen with glial TDP-43 expression. In addition to identification of a number of genes whose roles in neurodegeneration were not previously known, our screen also yielded genes involved in chromatin regulation and nuclear/import export-pathways that were previously identified in the context of cell based or neurodevelopmental suppressor screens. A notable example is SF2, a conserved orthologue of mammalian SRSF1, an RNA binding protein with roles in splicing and nuclear export. Our identification SF2/SRSF1 as a potent suppressor of both neuronal and glial TDP-43 toxicity also provides a convergence with C9orf72 expansion repeat mediated neurodegeneration, where this gene also acts as a downstream mediator.\n\nAuthor SummaryLoss of nuclear function of TDP-43 and its mislocalization into cytoplasmic inclusions are central features to a suite of neurodegenerative disorders. We screened 2700 Drosophila genes to identify downstream mediators that suppress an age-dependent motor dysfunction phenotype when they are knocked down by RNA interference. We identified both previously implicated pathways and several novel genes whose knock down is sufficient to dramatically and robustly rescue TDP-43 toxicity both in neuronal and glial contexts. Notably, we report that SF2/SRSF1, which was previously reported as a suppressor of C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion repeat toxicity, also is a potent suppressor of TDP-43 mediated neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Chronic heavy drinking (CHD) of alcohol is a known risk factor for increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infection as well as impaired wound healing. Evidence suggests that these defects are mediated by a dysregulated inflammatory response originating from myeloid cells, notably monocytes and macrophages, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our ability to study CHD is impacted by the complexities of human drinking patterns and behavior as well as comorbidities and confounding risk factors for patients with alcohol use disorders. To overcome these challenges, we utilize a translational rhesus macaque model of voluntary ethanol self-administration that closely recapitulates human drinking patterns and chronicity. In this study, we examined the effects of CHD on blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages in control and CHD female macaques after 12 months of daily ethanol consumption. While monocytes from CHD female macaques generated a hyper-inflammatory response to ex vivo LPS stimulation, their response to E.Coli was dampened. In depth scRNA-Seq analysis of purified monocytes revealed significant shifts in classical monocyte subsets with accumulation of cells expressing markers of hypoxia (HIF1A) and inflammation (NFkB signaling pathway) in CHD macaques. The increased presence of monocyte subsets poised to generate a hyperinflammatory response was confirmed by the epigenetic analysis which revealed higher accessibility of promoter regions that regulate genes involved in cytokine signaling pathways. Finally, alveolar macrophages (AM) from the same animals produced higher levels of inflammatory mediators in response to LPS stimulation, but reduced ability to phagocytose bacteria. Collectively, data presented in this manuscript demonstrate that CHD primes monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages towards a more hyper-inflammatory immune response with compromised functional abilities, which could be used in diagnostic purposes or preventative measures for patients with alcohol use disorders.",

    "abstract": "As central effectors of ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated proteolysis, proteasomes are regulated at multiple levels, including degradation of unwanted or dysfunctional particles via autophagy (termed proteaphagy). In yeast, inactive proteasomes are exported from the nucleus, sequestered into cytoplasmic aggresomes via the Hsp42 chaperone, extensively ubiquitylated, and then tethered to the expanding phagophore by the autophagy receptor Cue5. Here, we demonstrate the need for ubiquitylation driven by the trio of Ub ligases (E3s) San1, Rsp5 and Hul5, which, together with their corresponding E2s, work sequentially to promote nuclear export and Cue5 recognition. Whereas San1 functions prior to nuclear export, Rsp5 and Hul5 likely decorate aggresome-localized proteasomes in concert. Ultimately, topologically complex Ub chain(s) containing both K48 and K63 Ub-Ub linkages are assembled, mainly on the regulatory particle, to generate autophagy-competent substrates. As San1, Rsp5, Hul5, Hsp42, and Cue5 also participate in general proteostasis, proteaphagy likely engages an essential mechanism for eliminating inactive/misfolded proteins.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIUbiquitylation is essential for the autophagic turnover of dysfunctional proteasomes.\nC_LIO_LIThe San1, Rsp5 and Hul5 E3s act sequentially to drive proteaphagy.\nC_LIO_LIThe E2s Ubc1, Ubc4 and Ubc5 are collectively required.\nC_LIO_LIBoth K48- and K63-mediated Ub-Ub linkages are assembled for efficient proteaphagy.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock perceives photoperiodic changes and initiates processes leading to floral transition. GIGANTEA (GI) primarily functions as a principal clock component that integrates environmental cues into regulation of growth and development in Arabidopsis. However, it is unclear whether ZmGIs regulate photoperiodic flowering and abiotic stress response. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of ZmGI1 depicted a typical circadian pattern and was differentially expressed under LDs and SDs in photoperiodic sensitive and insensitive maize lines. The transcription level was significantly and positively correlated with days to silking and photoperiodic sensitivity in maize. Moreover, natural variation in ZmGI1 was associated with maize photoperiod response and the fine-tuning of plant development traits. Overexpression of ZmGI1Huangzao4 induced early flowering and enhanced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis relative to the wild-type and gi mutants. ZmGI1 formed a protein complex with ZmFKF1 and acted as a positive regulator of flowering time by regulating CONSTANS transcription in the photoperiod pathway. The ZmGI1/ZmThox complex regulates oxidative stress induced by salt stress via a redox balance pathway. Over all, we have provided compelling evidence to suggest that ZmGI1 is a pleotropic gene whose expression depicts a typical circadian rhythmic pattern and regulates flowering time and confers salt stress tolerance.",

    "abstract": "AimsVegetation sampling typically involves the use of quadrats, often 1m2, to estimate species cover-abundance. Such surveys do not generally record small-scale vegetation patch structure at sub-quadrat scales, for example 10 cm2. Here we test a simple method to quantify patch structure that complements conventional techniques. We compare the two methods, and analyse metrics derived from small-scale patch surveys with environment / management data.\n\nLocationNorthumberland, United Kingdom\n\nMethodsWe recorded cover-abundance of all species in an upland moor with 1m2 quadrats. These were divided into 100  sub-quadrats, 10 x 10 cm, and the dominant and subdominant species identified. Patch metrics (number, area and shape) for individual species recorded as dominant or subdominant in the sub-quadrat survey were analysed using multivariate generalised linear models with environmental and management data. Sub-quadrat data were also aggregated for each quadrat, to create species composition data. The two sets of compositional data, from whole-quadrat and sub-quadrat aggregations, were compared via Procrustes rotation of ordination scores.\n\nResultsPatch number, area and shape for dominant and subdominant species were all significantly affected by soil pH, soil water content, slope and elevation. Effects of proximity to sheep tracks and drainage ditches were less consistent amongst species. Ordinations of vegetation data from conventional and sub-quadrats were similar, with significant Procrustes R-squared of 67% and 70% for dominant and subdominant species respectively.\n\nConclusionsSub-quadrat surveys can easily be used to complement existing whole-quadrat surveys at little cost in time or resources. Their patch metrics can provide additional insights into the environmental and management drivers that may affect the growth of individual plants or clumps, potentially in relation to plant traits, and thus alter the overall community composition. The methods we describe can readily be adapted to other sizes of quadrats and sub-quadrats in a wide range of vegetation communities.",

One of their most common uses is to scan the genome for signals of natural selection. However, it is well understood that deviance measures like D and H are confounded by other evolutionary forces--in particular, population expansion--that may be unrelated to selection. Because they are not model-based, it is not clear how to deconfound these statistics in a principled way.\n\nIn this paper we derive new likelihood-based methods for detecting natural selection which are robust to confounding by fluctuations in effective population size. At the core of our method is a novel proba-bilistic model of tree imbalance, which generalizes Kingmans coales-cent to allow certain aberrant tree topologies to arise more frequently than is expected under neutrality. We derive a frequency spectrum-based estimator which can be used in place of D, and also extend to the case where genealogies are first estimated.

    "abstract": "The ability of a cell to regulate its mechanical properties is central to its function. Emerging evidence suggests that interactions between the cell nucleus and cytoskeleton influence cell mechanics through poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show that A- and B-type nuclear lamin isoforms distinctively modulate both nuclear and cellular volume and selectively stabilize the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes that couple the nucleus to cytoskeletal actin and vimentin. We reveal, further, that loss of each of the four-known lamin isoforms in the mouse embryonic fibroblasts differentially affects cortical and cytoplasmic stiffness as well as cellular contractility, and then propose a LINC complex mediated model that explains these impaired mechanical phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of each lamin isoform softens the nucleus in a manner that correlates with loss of heterochromatin. Together, these findings uncover distinctive roles for each lamin isoform in maintaining cellular and nuclear mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Anoxia induces a reversible coma in insects. Coma onset is triggered by the arrest of mechanisms responsible for maintaining membrane ion homeostasis in the CNS, resulting in a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization known as spreading depolarization (SD). Different methods of anoxia influence the behavioural response but their effects on SD are unknown. We investigated the effects of CO2, N2, and H2O on the characteristics of coma induction and recovery in Locusta migratoria. Water immersion delayed coma onset and recovery, likely due to involvement of the tracheal system and the nature of asphyxiation but otherwise resembled N2 delivery. The main difference between N2 and CO2 was that CO2 hastened onset of neural failure and SD and delayed recovery. In the CNS, this was associated with CO2 inducing an abrupt and immediate decrease of interstitial pH and increase of extracellular [K+]. Recording of the transperineurial potential showed that SD propagation and a postanoxic negativity (PAN) were similar with both gases. The PAN increased with ouabain treatment, likely due to removal of the counteracting electrogenic effect of Na+/K+-ATPase, and was inhibited by bafilomycin, a proton pump inhibitor, suggesting that it was generated by the electrogenic effect of a Vacuolar-type ATPase (VA). Muscle fibres depolarized by [~]20 mV, which happened more rapidly with CO2 compared with N2. Wing muscle motoneurons depolarized nearly completely in two stages, with CO2 causing more rapid onset and slower recovery than N2. Other parameters of SD onset and recovery were similar with the two gases. Electrical resistance across the ganglion sheath increased during anoxia and at SD onset. We provisionally attribute this to cell swelling reducing the dimensions of the interstitial pathway from neuropil to the bathing saline. Neuronal membrane resistance decreased abruptly at SD onset indicating opening of an unidentified membrane conductance. Consideration of the intracellular recording relative to the saline suggests that the apical membrane of perineurial glia depolarizes prior to neuron depolarization. We propose that SD is triggered by events at the perineurial sheath and then propagates laterally and more deeply into the neuropil. We conclude that the fundamental nature of SD is not dependent on the method of anoxia however the timing of onset and recovery are influenced; water immersion is complicated by the tracheal system and CO2 delivery has more rapid and longer lasting effects, associated with severe interstitial acidosis.",

    "abstract": "Comparison of brain samples representing different developmental stages often necessitates registering the samples to common coordinates. Although the available software tools are successful in registering 3D images of adult brains, registration of perinatal brains remains challenging due to rapid growth-dependent morphological changes and variations in developmental pace between animals. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-step algorithm for the registration of perinatal brains. First, we optimized image preprocessing to increase the algorithms sensitivity to mismatches in registered images. Second, we developed an attention-gated simulated annealing (Monte Carlo) procedure capable of focusing on the differences between perinatal brains. Third, we applied classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) to align (\"synchronize\") brain samples in time, accounting for individual development paces. We tested this multi-step algorithm on 28 samples of whole-mounted perinatal mouse brains (P0 - P9) and observed accurate registration results. Our computational pipeline offers a runtime of several minutes per brain on a personal computer and automates brain registration tasks including mapping brain data to atlases, comparison of averaged experimental groups, and monitoring brain development dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Genes associated with risk for brain disease exhibit characteristic expression patterns that reflect both anatomical and cell type relationships. Brain-wide transcriptomic patterns of disease risk genes provide a molecular based signature for identifying disease association, often differing from common phenotypic classification. Analysis of adult brain-wide transcriptomic patterns associated with 40 human brain diseases identified five major transcriptional patterns, represented by tumor-related, neurodegenerative, psychiatric and substance abuse, and two mixed groups of diseases. Brain disease risk genes exhibit unique anatomic transcriptomic signatures, based on differential co-expression, that often uniquely identify the disease. For cortical expressing diseases, single nucleus data in the middle temporal gyrus reveals cell type expression gradients separating neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and substance abuse diseases. By homology mapping of cell types across mouse and human, transcriptomic disease signatures are found largely conserved, but with psychiatric and substance abuse related diseases showing important specific species differences. These results describe the structural and cellular transcriptomic landscape of disease in the adult brain, highlighting significant homology with the mouse yet indicating where human data is needed to further refine our understanding of disease-associated genes.",

This study quantifies the contribution of brace roots to anchorage, brace root traits, plant height, and root lodging susceptibility in 52 maize inbred lines. We show that the contribution of brace roots to anchorage and root lodging susceptibility varies among genotypes and this contribution can be explained by plant architectural variation. Additionally, supervised machine learning models were developed and show that multiple plant architectural phenotypes can predict the contribution of brace roots to anchorage and root lodging susceptibility. Together these data define the plant architectures that are important in lodging resistance and show that the contribution of brace roots to anchorage is a good proxy for root lodging susceptibility.",

Here, we compare the immunogenicity of a first-generation mRNA vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, with a second-generation mRNA vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, in rats. Higher levels of spike (S) protein expression were observed in cell culture with CV2CoV mRNA than with CVnCoV mRNA. Vaccination with CV2CoV also induced higher titres of virus neutralising antibodies with accelerated kinetics in rats compared with CVnCoV. Significant cross-neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and the  mink variant (B1.1.298) that were circulating at the time in early 2021 was also demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic of unprecedented dimensions. SARS-CoV-2 infects airway and lung cells causing viral pneumonia. The importance of type I interferon (IFN) production for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with inborn errors of type I IFN response or auto-antibodies against IFN-. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique immune cell population specialized in recognizing and controlling viral infections through the production of high concentrations of type I IFN. In this study, we isolated pDCs from healthy donors and showed that pDCs are able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and rapidly produce large amounts of type I IFN. Sensing of SARS-CoV-2 by pDCs was independent of viral replication since pDCs were also able to recognize UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and produce type I IFN. Transcriptional profiling of SARS-CoV-2 and UV-SARS-CoV-2 stimulated pDCs also showed a rapid type I and III IFN response as well as induction of several chemokines, and the induction of apoptosis in pDCs. Moreover, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung using primary human airway epithelial cells (pHAEs) and showed that co-culture of pDCs with SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAEs induces an antiviral response and upregulation of antigen presentation in pHAE cells. Importantly, the presence of pDCs in the co-culture results in control of SARS-CoV-2 replication in pHAEs. Our study identifies pDCs as one of the key cells that can recognize SARS-CoV-2 infection, produce type I and III IFN and control viral replication in infected cells.\n\nImportanceType I interferons (IFNs) are a major part of the innate immune defense against viral infections. The importance of type I interferon (IFN) production for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with defects in the type I IFN response. Interestingly, many cells are not able to produce type I IFN after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cannot control viral infection. In this study we show that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and produce type I IFN, and that pDCs are able to help control viral infection in SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells.",

In addition to establishing a complete and automated analysis workflow with a graphical user interface, CsoDIAq introduces algorithmic concepts to improve peptide identification speed and sensitivity. These include spectra pooling to reduce search time complexity, and a new spectrum-spectrum match score called match count and cosine (MaCC), which improves target discrimination in a target-decoy analysis. We further show that reanalysis after fragment mass tolerance correction increased the number of peptide identifications.

    "abstract": "Reverse transcriptases (RTs) can template switch during cDNA synthesis, enabling them to join discontinuous nucleic acid sequences. Template switching plays crucial roles in retroviral replication and recombination, is used for adapter addition in RNA-seq, and may contribute to retroelement fitness by enabling continuous cDNA synthesis on damaged templates. Here, we determined an X-ray crystal structure of a template-switching complex of a group II intron RT bound simultaneously to an acceptor RNA and donor RNA template/DNA heteroduplex with a 1-nt 3-DNA overhang. The latter mimics a completed cDNA after non-templated addition (NTA) of a nucleotide complementary to the 3 nucleotide of the acceptor as required for efficient template switching. The structure showed that the 3 end of the acceptor RNA binds in a pocket formed by an N-terminal extension (NTE) present in non-long-terminal-repeat (LTR)-retroelement RTs and the RT fingertips loop, with the 3 nucleotide of the acceptor base paired to the 1-nt 3-DNA overhang and its penultimate nucleotide base paired to the incoming dNTP at the RT active site. Analysis of structure-guided mutations identified amino acids that contribute to acceptor RNA binding and a phenylalanine near the RT active site that mediates NTA. Mutation of the latter residue decreased multiple sequential template switches in RNA-seq. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of template switching and NTA by RTs, suggest how these reactions could be improved for RNA-seq, and reveal common structural features for template switching by non-LTR-retroelement RTs and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.",

    "abstract": "Transglutaminases (TGs) are a family of crosslinking enzymes catalyzing the formation of intra- and inter-molecular glutamine-lysine isopeptide bonds in a calcium dependent manner. Activation of transglutaminases is pathogenically associated with severe human diseases including neurodegenerations, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune diseases. Although continuous efforts determining the enzymes substrate preference have been witnessed, a high-throughput assay platform with the \"omic\" efficiency is still missing for the global identification of substrate-specific TG modification sites. In this study we report a protein microarray-based in vitro TG assay platform for rapid and large-scale (up to 30000 reactions per chip) determination of the glutamine (Q)-bearing TG modification motifs. With this platform we identified the Q16 in superoxide dismutase 1 and Q109 in alpha-synuclein as the primary modification sites for tissue transglutaminase (TG2), the most ubiquitous member of the enzyme family. Of particular interest, we found a close match between the modification motifs and published vaccine epitope sequences in alpha-synuclein, implying an essential and intrinsic role transglutaminase might play in the determination of immunodominant epitopes. Our data collectively suggest the glutamine and its follow-up five residues on the C terminal of a protein compose a minimal determinant motif for TG2 modification and, more importantly, the TG2 modification motifs determined by our platform could finally correspond to the substrates immunodominant epitope sequences in antigen processing. To establish an efficient approach to optimize the enzyme modification motifs and screen for site-specific interfering peptides, we scanned the known TG2 modification motifs with onchip amino-acid swapping and glutamine repeat addition, and obtained multiple variants with significantly upregulated TG2 reactivity. This approach could also be employed to improve the target peptides immunogenicity. Taken together, our synthetic transglutaminase assay platform might be able to deliver a precise epitope blueprint for immunotherapeutic targeting and provide pilot and directional studies for TG-based peptide discovery and immunogen design.",

Our data show that Pomc-expressing neurons originate from multiple developmental pathways expressing distinct combinations of transcription factors. The predominant cluster, featured by high levels of Pomc and Prdm12 transcripts represents the precursor of canonical arcuate POMC neurons. Additional clusters of progenitors expressing lower levels of Pomc mature into different neuronal phenotypes characterized by distinct combinations of transcription factors, neuropeptides, processing enzymes, cell surface and nuclear receptors. We conclude that the genetic programs specifying the identity and differentiation of arcuate POMC neurons are diverse and generate a heterogeneous repertoire of neuronal phenotypes early in development that continue to evolve postnatally.",

    "abstract": "Shigella flexneri, causative agent of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) as its primary virulence factor. The T3SS injectisome delivers effector proteins into host cells to promote entry and create an important intracellular niche. The injectisomes cytoplasmic sorting platform (SP) is a critical assembly that contributes to substrate selection and energizing secretion. The SP consists of oligomeric Spa33 \"pods\" that associate with the basal body via MxiK and connect to the Spa47 ATPase via MxiN. The pods contain heterotrimers of Spa33 with one full-length copy associated with two copies of a C-terminal domain (Spa33C). The structure of Spa33C is known, but the precise makeup and structure of the pods in situ remains elusive. We show here that recombinant wild-type Spa33 can be prepared as a heterotrimer that forms distinct stable complexes with MxiK and MxiN. In two-hybrid analyses, association of the Spa33 complex with these proteins occurs via the full-length Spa33 component. Furthermore, these complexes each have distinct biophysical properties. Based on these properties, new high-resolution cryo-electron tomography data and architectural similarities between the Spa33 and flagellar FliM-FliN complexes, we provide a preliminary model of the Spa33 heterotrimers within the SP pods. From these findings and evolving models of SP interfaces and dynamics in the Yersinia and Salmonella T3SS, we suggest a model for SP function in which two distinct complexes come together within the context of the SP to contribute to form the complete pod structures during the recruitment of T3SS secretion substrates.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of Trypanosoma brucei by tsetse flies involves the deposition of the cell cycle-arrested metacyclic life cycle stage into mammalian skin at the site of the flys bite. In the skin, the metacyclic parasites reactivate and differentiate into proliferative trypanosomes before colonizing the hosts blood and tissues. We generated an advanced human skin equivalent and used tsetse flies to naturally infect the artificial skin with trypanosomes. We detailed the chronological order of the parasites development in the skin, and found a rapid activation of metacyclic trypanosomes and differentiation to proliferative parasites. Single-cell parasite transcriptomics were used to document the biological events during differentiation and host invasion at five different timepoints. After the establishment of a proliferative trypanosome population in the skin, the parasites entered a reversible quiescent state characterized by slow replication and a strongly reduced metabolism. We termed these quiescent trypanosomes skin tissue forms (STF), a parasite population that may play an important role in maintaining the infection over long time periods and in asymptomatic infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between 3D chromatin architecture and gene silencing is incompletely understood. Here, we report a novel point mutation in the non-canonical SMC protein SMCHD1 that enhances its silencing capacity at endogenous developmental targets and at the facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy associated macro-array, D4Z4. Heightened SMCHD1 silencing perturbs developmental Hox gene activation, causing a homeotic transformation in mice. Paradoxically, the mutant SMCHD1 appears to enhance insulation against another epigenetic regulator complex, PRC2, while depleting long range chromatin interactions akin to what is observed in the absence of SMCHD1. These data suggest that SMCHD1s role in long range chromatin interactions is not directly linked to gene silencing or insulating the chromatin, refining the model for how the different levels of SMCHD1-mediated chromatin regulation interact to bring about gene silencing in normal development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules (SGs) are membraneless organelles composed of mRNAs and RNA binding proteins which undergo assembly in response to stress-induced inactivation of translation initiation. The biochemical criteria for mRNA recruitment into SGs are largely unknown. In general, SG recruitment is limited to a subpopulation of a given mRNA species and RNA-seq analyses of purified SGs revealed that signal sequence-encoding (i.e. endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted) transcripts are significantly under-represented, consistent with prior reports that ER-localized mRNAs are excluded from SGs. Using translational profiling, cell fractionation, and single molecule mRNA imaging, we examined SG biogenesis during the unfolded protein response (UPR) and report that UPR-elicited SG formation is gene selective. Combined immunofluorescence-smFISH studies demonstrated that UPR-induced mRNA granules co-localized with SG protein markers and were in close physical proximity to or directly associated with the ER membrane. mRNA recruitment into ER-associated SGs required stress-induced translational inhibition, though translational inhibition was not solely predictive of mRNA accumulation in SGs. SG formation in response to UPR activation or arsenite addition was blocked by the transcriptional inhibitors actinomycin D or triptolide, suggesting a functional link between gene transcriptional state and SG biogenesis. These data demonstrate that ER-targeted mRNAs can be recruited into SGs and identify the ER as a subcellular site of SG assembly. On the basis of the transcriptional inhibitor studies, we propose that newly transcribed mRNAs undergoing nuclear export during conditions of suppressed translation initiation are key substrates for SG biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Egalitarian (Egl) is an RNA adaptor for the Dynein motor and is thought to link numerous, perhaps hundreds, of mRNAs with Dynein. Dynein, in turn, is responsible for the transport and localization of these mRNAs. Studies have shown that efficient mRNA binding by Egl requires the protein to dimerize. We recently demonstrated that Dynein light chain (Dlc) is responsible for facilitating the dimerization of Egl. Mutations in Egl that fail to interact with Dlc do not dimerize, and as such, are defective for mRNA binding. Consequently, this mutant does not efficiently associate with BicaudalD (BicD), the factor responsible for linking the Egl/mRNA complex with Dynein. In this report, we tested whether artificially dimerizing this Dlc-binding mutant using a leucine zipper would restore mRNA binding and rescue mutant phenotypes in vivo. Interestingly, we found that although artificial dimerization of Egl restored BicD binding, it only partially restored mRNA binding. As a result, Egl-dependent phenotypes, such as oocyte specification and mRNA localization, were only partially rescued. We hypothesize that Dlc-mediated dimerization of Egl results in a three-dimensional conformation of the Egl dimer that is best suited for mRNA binding. Although the leucine zipper restores Egl dimerization, it likely does not enable Egl to assemble into the conformation required for maximal mRNA binding activity.",

Although RNA sequencing has contributed to the understanding of brain endothelial cell diversity, bulk analysis and single-cell approaches have relied on fresh tissue digestion protocols for the isolation of single endothelial cells and flow cytometry-based sorting on surface markers or transgene expression. These approaches are limited in the analysis of the endothelium in human brain tissues, where fresh samples are difficult to obtain. Here, we developed an approach to examine endothelial RNA expression by using an endothelial-specific marker to isolate nuclei from abundant archived frozen brain tissues. We show that this approach rapidly and reliably extracts endothelial nuclei from frozen mouse brain samples, and importantly, from archived frozen human brain tissues. Furthermore, isolated RNA transcript levels are closely correlated with expression in whole cells from tissue digestion protocols and are enriched in endothelial markers and depleted of markers of other brain cell types. As high-quality RNA transcripts could be obtained from as few as 100 nuclei in archived frozen human brain tissues, we predict that this approach should be useful for both bulk analysis of endothelial RNA transcripts in human brain tissues as well as single-cell analysis of endothelial sub-populations.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression dynamics, such as stochastic oscillations and aperiodic fluctuations, have been associated with cell fate changes in multiple contexts, including development and cancer. Single cell live imaging of protein expression with endogenous reporters is widely used to observe such gene expression dynamics. However, the experimental investigation of regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed dynamics is challenging, since these mechanisms include complex interactions of multiple processes, including transcription, translation, and protein degradation. Here, we present a Bayesian method to infer kinetic parameters of oscillatory gene expression regulation using an auto-negative feedback motif with delay. Specifically, we use a delay-adapted nonlinear Kalman filter within a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to identify posterior probability distributions. Our method can be applied to time series data on gene expression from single cells and is able to infer multiple parameters simultaneously. We apply it to published data on murine neural progenitor cells and show that it outperforms alternative methods. We further analyse how parameter uncertainty depends on the duration and time resolution of an imaging experiment, to make experimental design recommendations. This work demonstrates the utility of parameter inference on time course data from single cells and enables new studies on cell fate changes and population heterogeneity.",

Natural and anthropogenic hybridization in the black basses (Micropterus spp.) is well documented, including an extensive intergrade zone between the widespread northern Largemouth Bass (M. salmoides) and the Florida Bass (M. floridanus). Phenotypic surveys have identified an estuarine population of Largemouth Bass (M. salmoides) in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, with larger relative weight and smaller adult size compared to inland populations, suggesting a potential third lineage of largemouth bass. To determine the evolutionary relationships between these Mobile Delta bass populations, M. salmoides, and M. floridanus, putative pure and intergrade populations of all three groups were sampled across the eastern United States. Phylogenetic analyses of 8,582 nuclear SNPs derived from genotype-by-sequencing and the ND2 mitochondrial gene determined that Delta bass populations stem from a recently diverged lineage of Largemouth Bass. Using a novel quantitative pipeline, a panel of 73 diagnostic SNPs was developed for the three lineages, evaluated for accuracy, and then used to screen 881 samples from 52 sites for genetic integrity and hybridization on the Agena MassARRAY platform. These results strongly support a redrawing of native ranges for both the intergrade zone and M. floridanus, which has significant implications for current fisheries management. Furthermore, Delta bass ancestry was shown to contribute significantly to the previously described intergrade zone between northern Largemouth Bass and Florida Bass, suggesting a more complex pattern of secondary contact and introgression among these diverged Micropterus lineages.",

    "abstract": "Genomic applications such as genomic selection and genome-wide association have become increasingly common since the advent of genome sequencing. Genotype imputation makes it possible to infer whole genome information from limited input data, making large sampling for genomic applications more feasible, especially in non-model species where resources are less abundant. Imputation becomes increasingly difficult in heterozygous species where haplotypes must be phased. The Practical Haplotype Graph is a recently developed tool that can accurately impute genotypes, using a reference panel of haplotypes. The Practical Haplotype Graph is a haplotype database that implements a trellis graph to predict haplotypes using minimal input data. Genotyping information is aligned to the database and missing haplotypes are predicted from the most likely path through the graph. We showcase the ability of the Practical Haplotype Graph to impute genomic information in the highly heterozygous crop cassava (Manihot esculenta). Accurately phased haplotypes were sampled from runs of homozygosity across a diverse panel of individuals to populate the graph, which proved more accurate than relying on computational phasing methods. At 1X input sequence coverage, the Practical Haplotype Graph achieves a high concordance between predicted and true genotypes (R=0.84), as compared to the standard imputation tool Beagle (R=0.69). This improved accuracy was especially visible in the prediction of rare and heterozygous alleles. We validate the Practical Haplotype Graph as an accurate imputation tool in the heterozygous crop cassava, showing its potential for application in heterozygous species.",

Gene collections such as GENCODE contain annotations for tens of thousands of TSSs, but not all of these annotations are experimentally validated nor do they contain information on cell type-specific usage. Therefore, we sought to generate a collection of experimentally validated TSSs by integrating RNA Annotation and Mapping of Promoters for the Analysis of Gene Expression (RAMPAGE) data from 115 cell and tissue types, which resulted in a collection of approximately 50 thousand representative RAMPAGE peaks. These peaks were primarily proximal to GENCODE-annotated TSSs and were concordant with other transcription assays. Because RAMPAGE uses paired-end reads, we were then able to connect peaks to transcripts by analyzing the genomic positions of the 3 ends of read mates. Using this paired-end information, we classified the vast majority (37 thousand) of our RAMPAGE peaks as verified TSSs, updating TSS annotations for 20% of GENCODE genes. We also found that these updated TSS annotations were supported by epigenomic and other transcriptomic datasets. To demonstrate the utility of this RAMPAGE rPeak collection, we intersected it with the NHGRI/EBI GWAS catalog and identified new candidate GWAS genes. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of integrating experimental data to further refine TSS annotations and provides a valuable resource for the biological community.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTopologically associating domains (TADs) are important building blocks of three-dimensional genome architectures. The formation of TADs was shown to depend on cohesin in a loop-extrusion mechanism. Recently, advances in an image-based spatial genomics technique known as chromatin tracing led to the discovery of cohesin-independent TAD-like structures, also known as single-cell domains -- highly variant self-interacting chromatin domains with boundaries that occasionally overlap with TAD boundaries but tend to differ among single cells and among single chromosome copies. Recent computational modeling studies suggest that epigenetic interactions may underlie the formation of the single-cell domains.\n\nResultsHere we use chromatin tracing to visualize in female human cells the fine-scale chromatin folding of inactive and active X chromosomes, which are known to have distinct global epigenetic landscapes and distinct population-averaged TAD profiles, with inactive X chromosomes largely devoid of TADs and cohesin. We show that both inactive and active X chromosomes possess highly variant single-cell domains across the same genomic region despite the fact that only active X chromosomes show clear TAD structures at the population level. These X chromosome single-cell domains exist in distinct cell lines. Perturbations of major epigenetic components did not significantly affect the frequency or strength of the single-cell domains. Increased chromatin compaction of inactive X chromosomes occurs at a length scale above that of the single-cell domains.\n\nConclusionsIn sum, this study suggests that single-cell domains are genome architecture building blocks independent of the tested major epigenetic components.",

    "abstract": "The deposition of immunoglobulin light chains (IgLCs) in the form of amorphous aggregates or amyloid fibrils in different tissues of patients can lead to severe and potentially fatal organ damage, requiring transplantation in some cases. There has been great interest in recent years to elucidate the origin of the very different in vivo solubilities of IgLCs, as well as the molecular determinants that drive either the formation of ordered amyloid fibrils or disordered amorphous aggregates. It is commonly thought that the reason of this differential aggregation behaviour is to be found in the amino acid sequences of the respective IgLCs, i.e. that some sequences display higher intrinsic tendencies to form amyloid fibrils. Here we perform in depth Thermodynamic and Aggregation Fingerprinting (ThAgg-Fip) of 9 multiple myeloma patient-derived IgLCs, the amino acid sequences of all of which we have solved by de novo protein sequencing with mass spectrometry. The latter technique was also used for one IgLc from a patient with AL amyloidosis. We find that all samples also contain proteases that fragment the proteins under physiologically relevant mildly acidic pH conditions, leading to amyloid fibril formation in all cases. Our results suggest that while every pathogenic IgLC has a unique ThAgg fingerprint, all sequences have comparable amyloidogenic potential. Therefore, extrinsic factors, in particular presence of, and susceptibility to, proteolytic cleavage is likely to be a strong determinant of in vivo aggregation behaviour. The important conclusion, which is corroborated by systematic analysis of our sequences, as well as many sequences of IgLCs from amyloidosis patients reported in the literature, challenges the current paradigm of the link between sequence and amyloid fibril formation of pathogenic light chains.",

Although a substantial progress has been achieved in studying the AMPs, the microscopic mechanisms of their functioning remain not well understood. Here, we develop a new theoretical framework to investigate how the AMPs are able to efficiently neutralize the bacteria. In our minimal theoretical model, the most relevant processes, AMPs entering into and the following inhibition of the single bacterial cell, are described stochastically. Using complementary master equations approaches, all relevant features of bacteria clearance dynamics by AMPs, such as the probability of inhibition and the mean times before the clearance, are explicitly evaluated. It is found that both processes, entering and inhibition, are equally important for the efficient functioning of AMPs. Our theoretical method naturally explains a wide spectrum of efficiencies of existing AMPs and their heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Theoretical calculations are also consistent with existing single-cell measurements. Thus, the presented theoretical approach clarifies some microscopic aspects of the action of AMPs on bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has uncovered diverse forms of synaptic plasticity and a wide array of molecular signaling mechanisms that act as positive or negative regulators. Specifically, cAMP-dependent signaling pathways have been crucially implicated in long-lasting synaptic plasticity. In this study, we examine the role of POPDC1 (or BVES), a cAMP effector protein expressed in brain, in modulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Unlike other cAMP effectors, such as PKA and EPAC, POPDC1 is membrane-bound and the sequence of the cAMP-binding cassette differs from canonical cAMP-binding domains. These properties suggest that POPDC1 may have a unique role in cAMP-mediated signaling underlying synaptic plasticity. Our results show that POPDC1 is enriched in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes. Acute hippocampal slices from Popdc1 knockout (KO) mice exhibit enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a variety of stimulation paradigms, particularly in response to weak stimulation paradigms that in slices from wildtype mice induce only transient LTP. Furthermore, Popdc1 KO mice did not display any further enhancement in forskolin-induced LTP observed following inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), suggesting a possible modulation of cAMP-PDE signaling by POPDC1. Taken together, these data reveal POPDC1 as a novel player in the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and as a potential target for cognitive enhancement strategies.",

    "abstract": "Despite a robust literature associating IL-31 with pruritic inflammatory skin diseases, its influence on cutaneous inflammation and on the interplay between inflammatory and neurosensory pathways remain unmapped. Here, we examined the effects of IL-31 and its receptor IL31RA on both inflammation and pruritus in mouse models of dermatitis, including chronic topical house dust mite (HDM) exposure. Unexpectedly, Il31 deficiency increased cutaneous adaptive type 2 cytokine-producing cells and serum IgE. In addition, M2-like macrophages capable of fueling feedforward pro-inflammatory loops were selectively enriched in Il31ra-deficient skin. Thus, IL-31 is not strictly a pro-inflammatory cytokine, but rather an immunoregulatory factor that limits the magnitude of allergic skin inflammation. In contrast, Il31-deficient mice displayed a deficit in HDM-induced scratching. Itch reduction occurred despite intact - and in some cases increased - responsiveness of sensory neurons to other pruritogens released during HDM challenge, highlighting the non-redundant contribution of IL-31-receptive sensory afferents to pruritus in environmental allergen-induced dermatitis. When present, therefore, IL-31 uncouples circuits driven by sensory neurons and immune cells that converge in inflamed skin.",

    "abstract": "The bone marrow niche plays a critical role in hematopoietic recovery and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration after myeloablation. However, it is not clear whether systemic factors beyond the local niche are required for these essential processes in vivo. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a critical cytokine promoting hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation and its transcripts are expressed by multiple cellular sources. The upregulation of bone marrow-derived TPO has been proposed to be crucial for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after stress. Nonetheless, the cellular source of TPO in stress has never been investigated genetically. We assessed the functional sources of TPO following two common myeloablative perturbations: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration and irradiation. Using a Tpo translational reporter, we found that the liver but not the bone marrow is the major source of TPO protein after myeloablation. Mice with conditional Tpo deletion from osteoblasts or bone marrow stromal cells showed normal recovery of HSCs and hematopoiesis after myeloablation. In contrast, mice with conditional Tpo deletion from hepatocytes showed significant defects in HSC regeneration and hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation. Thus, systemic TPO from the liver is necessary for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery in myeloablative stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTreatment of nerve injuries proves to be a worldwide clinical challenge. Vascularized nerve grafts are suggested to be a promising alternative for bridging a nerve gap to the current gold standard, an autologous non-vascularized nerve graft. However, there is no adequate clinical evidence for the beneficial effect of vascularized nerve grafts and they are still disputed in clinical practice.\n\nObjectiveTo systematically review whether vascularized nerve grafts give a superior nerve recovery compared to non-vascularized nerve autografts regarding histological and electrophysiological outcomes in animal models.\n\nMaterial and methodsPubMed and Embase were systematically searched. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) the study was an original full paper which presented unique data; 2) a clear comparison between a vascularized and a non-vascularized autologous nerve transfer was made; 3) the population study were animals of all genders and ages. A standardized mean difference and 95% confidence intervals for each comparison was calculated to estimate the overall effect. Subgroup analyses were conducted on graft length, species and time frames.\n\nResultsFourteen articles were included in this review and all of them were included in the meta-analyses. A vascularized nerve graft resulted in a significantly larger diameter, higher nerve conduction velocity and axonal count compared to an autologous non-vascularized nerve\n\ngraft. However, during sensitivity analysis the effect on axonal count disappeared. No significant difference was observed in muscle weight.\n\nConclusionTreating a nerve gap with a vascularized graft results in superior nerve recovery compared to non-vascularized nerve autografts in three out of four outcome measurements. However, this conclusion needs to be taken with some caution due to the inherent limitations of this meta-analysis. We recommend future studies to be performed under conditions more closely resembling human circumstances and to use long nerve defects.",

    "abstract": "How does the brain prioritize among the contents of working memory (WM) to appropriately guide behavior? Using inverted encoding modeling (IEM), previous work (Wan et al., 2020) showed that unprioritized memory items (UMI) are actively represented in the brain but in a \"flipped\", or opposite, format compared to prioritized memory items (PMI). To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the UMI-to-PMI representational transformation, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an LSTM (long short-term memory) architecture to perform a 2-back working memory task. Although visualization of LSTM hidden layer activity using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) suggested that stimulus representations undergo a smooth rotational transformation across the trial, demixed (d)PCA of the same data decomposed this pattern into a cascade of multiple trajectories, each with a different time course, unfolding within UMI and PMI subspaces. The application of the same analyses to the EEG dataset of Wan et al. (2020) indicated that an items trajectory through the UMI subspace closely mirrored that of the RNN, but that its trajectory through the PMI subspace differed markedly from the RNN. It may be a general principle that, at the level of the representational code, information held in WM undergoes priority-based transformations that allow for its retention while preventing it from interfering with concurrent behavior. Implementational details of this process may vary across model systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryHow is information held in working memory (WM) but outside the current focus of attention? Motivated by previous neuroimaging studies, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform a 2-back WM task that entails shifts of an items priority status. Dimensionality reduction of the resultant activity in the hidden layer of the RNN allowed us to characterize how a stimulus items representation follows a transformational trajectory through high-dimensional representational space as its priority status changes from memory probe to unprioritized to prioritized. This work illustrates the value of artificial neural networks for assessing and refining hypotheses about mechanisms for information processing in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Highly polymorphic interactions of KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1 with HLA class I ligands modulates the effector functions of natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This genetically determined diversity affects severity of infections, immune-mediated diseases, and some cancers, and impacts the course of cancer treatment, including transplantation. KIR3DL1 is an inhibitory receptor, and KIR3DS1 is an activating receptor encoded by the KIR3DL1/S1 gene that has more than 200 diverse and divergent alleles. Determination of KIR3DL1/S1 genotypes for medical application is hampered by complex sequence and structural variation that distinguishes individuals and populations, requiring targeted approaches to generate and analyze high-resolution allele data. To overcome these obstacles, we developed and optimized a model for imputing KIR3DL1/S1 alleles at high-resolution from whole-genome SNP data, and designed to represent a substantial component of human genetic diversity. We show that our Global model is effective at imputing KIR3DL1/S1 alleles with an accuracy ranging from 89% in Africans to 97% in East Asians, with mean specificity of 99.8% and sensitivity of 99% for named alleles >1% frequency. We used the established algorithm of the HIBAG program, in a modification named Pulling Out Natural killer cell Genomics (PONG). Because HIBAG was designed to impute HLA alleles also from whole-genome SNP data, PONG allows combinatorial diversity of KIR3DL1/S1 and HLA-A and B to be analyzed using complementary techniques on a single data source. The use of PONG thus negates the need for targeted sequencing data in very large-scale association studies where such methods might not be tractable. All code, imputation models, test data and documentation are available at https://github.com/NormanLabUCD/PONG.\n\nAuthor SummaryNatural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that identify and kill infected or malignant cells and guide immune responses. The effector functions of NK cells are modulated through polymorphic interactions of KIR3DL1/S1 on their surface with the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) that are found on most other cell types in the body. KIR3DL1/S1 is highly polymorphic and differentiated across human populations, affecting susceptibility and course of multiple immune-mediated diseases and their treatments. Genotyping KIR3DL1/S1 for direct medical application or research has been encumbered by the complex sequence and structural variation, which requires targeted approaches and extensive domain expertise to generate and validate high-resolution allele calls. We therefore developed Pulling Out Natural Killer Cell Genomics (PONG) to impute KIR3DL1/S1 alleles from whole genome SNP data, and which we implemented as an open-source R package. We assessed imputation performance using data from five broad population groups that represent a substantial portion of human genetic diversity. We can impute KIR3DL1/S1 alleles with an accuracy ranging from 89% in Africans and South Asians to 97% in East Asians. Globally, imputation of KIR3DL1/S1 alleles having frequency >1% has a mean sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 99.8%. Thus, the PONG method both enables highly sensitive individual-level calling and makes large scale medical genetic studies of KIR3DL1/S1 possible.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) infects the stratified epithelia of the epidermis, oral or genital mucosa, where the main cell type is the keratinocyte. Here we have used nTERT human keratinocytes to generate a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) of the primary candidate HSV1 receptor, nectin1, resulting in a cell line that is refractory to HSV1 entry. Nonetheless, a small population of KO cells was able to support infection, and strikingly at later times, those cells originally resistant to HSV1 infection had also been infected. Appearance of this later population was blocked by inhibition of virus genome replication, or infection with a{Delta} UL34 virus defective in capsid export to the cytoplasm, while newly formed GFP-tagged capsids were detected in cells surrounding the initial infected cell, suggesting that virus was spreading following replication in the original susceptible cells. Neutralizing human serum failed to block virus transmission in KO cells, which was dependent on the cell-to-cell spread glycoproteins gI and gE, indicating that virus was spreading by direct cell-to-cell transmission. In line with these results, both HSV1 and HSV2 formed plaques on nectin1 KO cells, albeit at a reduced titre, confirming that once the original cell population was infected, the virus could spread into all other cells in the monolayer. Additional siRNA depletion of the second major HSV1 receptor HVEM, or PTP1B, a cellular factor shown elsewhere to be involved in cell-to-cell transmission, had no effect on virus spread in the absence of nectin1. We conclude that although nectin1 is required for extracellular entry in to the majority of human keratinocytes, it is dispensable for direct cell-to-cell transmission.\n\nAuthor SummaryHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) infects the epithelia of the epidermis, oral or genital mucosa to cause cold sores, genital herpes, or more serious outcomes such as keratitis and neonatal herpes. Like many viruses, HSV1 can spread through the extracellular environment or by direct cell-to-cell transmission, with the latter mechanism being important for avoiding antibody responses in the host. Here we have studied HSV1 entry and transmission in the human keratinocyte, the main cell type in the target epithelia, by generating a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of the primary candidate virus receptor, nectin1. While HSV1 was unable to infect the majority of nectin1 knockout keratinocytes, a small population of these nectin1 KO cells remained susceptible to virus entry, and once infected, the virus was able to spread unhindered into the rest of the monolayer. This spread continued in the presence of neutralising serum which blocks extracellular virus, and required the glycoproteins gE and gI which are known to be involved in cell-to-cell spread. Hence, while nectin1 is required for virus entry into the majority of human keratinocyte cells, it is dispensable for cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. These data have implications for the mechanism of HSV1 epithelial spread and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic gene expression is an indispensable tool in biology and medicine, but is often limited by the low efficiency of DNA transfection. We previously reported that depletion of the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 enhances DNA transfection efficiency by preventing the degradation of transfected DNA. Therefore, p62 is a potential target for drugs to increase transfection efficiency. To identify such drugs, a non-biased high-throughput screening was applied to over 4,000 compounds from the Osaka University compound library, and their p62-dependency was evaluated. The top-scoring drugs were mostly microtubule inhibitors, such as colchicine and vinblastine, and all of them showed positive effects only in the presence of p62. To understand the p62-dependent mechanisms, the time required for p62-dependent ubiquitination, which is required for autophagosome formation, was examined using polystyrene beads that were introduced into cells as materials that mimicked transfected DNA. Microtubule inhibitors caused a delay in ubiquitination. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated p62 at S405 was markedly decreased in the drug-treated cells. These results suggest that microtubule inhibitors inhibit p62-dependent autophagosome formation. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that microtubule inhibitors suppress p62 activation as a mechanism for increasing DNA transfection efficiency and provide solutions to increase efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Numerous scientific experiments have been conducted in space. However, the precise mechanisms mediating successful human body adaption to the hostile space environment are still not delineated. The cost and logistic challenges of sending biological payloads to International Space Station are forcing scientists to find alternative research platforms. In this study, we investigated whether brief exposure to microgravity during the suborbital flight aboard Blue Origins New Shepard rocket modulated the behavior of the gravity-sensitive murine T cells. We assessed the effect of suborbital environment on different T cell subsets, activation markers, functionality, and cytokine secretion capabilities. Thus, to optimize the potential response of T cells, we cultured them in interleukin IL-2 alone or combined with IL-12. We found that exposure to microgravity decreased the expression of T cells with CD4+ cells being more sensitive to suborbital flight as compared to CD8+ cells. Our data indicate that the functional capabilities of flown T cells were reduced. Also, our findings suggest that supplementing cells with IL-2 and IL-12 cytokines may restore microgravity-mediated cellular alterations. Finally, our study provides insights on the microgravity effect on the murine T cells by utilizing a novel suborbital research platform.",

    "abstract": "Biological tubes serve as conduits through which gas, nutrients and other important fluids are delivered to tissues. Most biological tubes consist of multiple cells connected by epithelial junctions. Unlike these multicellular tubes, seamless tubes are unicellular and lack junctions. Seamless tubes are present in various organ systems, including the vertebrate vasculature, C.elegans excretory system, and Drosophila tracheal system. The Drosophila tracheal system is a network of air-filled tubes that delivers oxygen to all tissues. Specialized cells within the tracheal system, called terminal cells, branch extensively and form seamless tubes. Terminal tracheal tubes are polarized; the lumenal membrane has apical identity whereas the outer membrane exhibits basal characteristics. Although various aspects of membrane trafficking have been implicated in terminal cell morphogenesis, the precise secretory pathway requirements for basal and apical membrane growth have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that anterograde trafficking, retrograde trafficking and Golgi-to-plasma membrane vesicle fusion are each required for the complex branched architecture of the terminal cell, but their inputs during seamless lumen formation are more varied. The COPII subunit, Sec 31, and ER exit site protein, Sec16, are critical for subcellular tube architecture, whereas the SNARE proteins Syntaxin 5, Syntaxin 1 and Syntaxin15 are required for seamless tube growth and maintenance. These data suggest that distinct components of the secretory pathway have differential contributions to basal and apical membrane growth and maintenance during terminal cell morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Maternal and fetal pregnancy outcomes related to placental function vary based on fetal sex, which may be the result of sexually dimorphic epigenetic regulation of RNA expression. We identified sexually dimorphic miRNA expression throughout gestation in human placentae. Next-generation sequencing was used to identify miRNA expression profiles in first and third trimester uncomplicated pregnancies using tissue obtained at chorionic villous sampling (n=113) and parturition (n=47). Sequencing and differential expression (DE) analysis identified 432 mature miRNAs expressed in the first trimester female, 425 in the first trimester male, 400 in the third trimester female, and 508 in the third trimester male placenta (baseMean >10). Of these, 11 sexually dimorphic (FDR<0.05, baseMean >10) miRNAs were identified in the first and 4 miRNAs were identified in the third trimester, including miR-361-5p, significant in both trimesters, all upregulated in females. Across gestation, 207 miRNAs were DE across gestation, common to both females and males, miR-4483, the most DE across gestation. There were twice as many female-specific differences across gestation as male-specific (44 miRNAs vs 21 miRNAs), indicating that miRNA abundance across human gestation is sexually dimorphic. Pathway enrichment analysis identified significant pathways that were differentially regulated in first and third trimester as well as across gestation. This work provides the normative sex dimorphic miRNA atlas in first and third trimester, as well as the sex independent and sex specific placenta miRNA atlas across gestation which may be used to identify biomarkers of placental function and direct functional studies investigating placental sex differences.\n\nSummary SentenceSex dimorphism in miRNA expression is more pronounced in first compared to third trimester placenta, and there are twice as many female-specific gestational differences, indicating miRNA abundance across human gestation is also sexually dimorphic.",

    "abstract": "A common feature of morphogenesis is the formation of three-dimensional structures from the folding of two-dimensional epithelial sheets aided by spatio-temporal cell shape changes at the cellular-level. Studying cell shape dynamics and polarised processes that underpin them, requires orienting cells within the epithelial sheet. In epithelia with highly curved surfaces, assigning cell orientation can be difficult to automate in silico. We present  Origami, a MATLAB-based image analysis pipeline to compute oriented cell shape-features. Our automated method accurately computed cell orientation in regions with opposing curvature in synthetic epithelia and fluorescence images of zebrafish embryos. As proof of concept, we identified different cell shape signatures in the developing zebrafish inner ear, where the epithelium deforms in opposite orientations to form different structures. Origami is designed to be user-friendly and is generally applicable to fluorescence images of curved epithelia.",

    "abstract": "mTORC2 controls cell metabolism and promotes cell survival, yet its upstream regulation by diverse cellular cues remains poorly defined. While considerable evidence indicates that mTORC1 but not mTORC2 responds dynamically to amino acid levels, several studies reported activation of mTORC2 signaling by amino acids, a paradox that remains unresolved. Following amino acid starvation, we noted that addition of a commercial amino acid solution but not re-feeding with DMEM containing amino acids increased mTORC2 signaling. Interestingly, the pH of the amino acid solution was [~] 10. These key observations enabled us to discover that alkaline intracellular pH (pHi) represents a previously unknown activator of mTORC2. Using a fluorescent pH-sensitive dye (cSNARF-1-AM) coupled to live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that alkaline extracellular pH (pHe) increases intracellular pHi, which increases mTORC2 catalytic activity and downstream signaling to Akt. Alkaline pHi also activates AMPK, a sensor of energetic stress. Functionally, alkaline pHi attenuates apoptosis caused by growth factor withdrawal, which requires AMPK in part and mTOR in full. Collectively, these findings reveal that alkaline pHi increases AMPK-mTORC2 signaling to promote cell survival during growth factor limitation. As elevated pHi represents an under-appreciated hallmark of cancer cells, alkaline pH sensing by AMPK-mTORC2 may contribute to tumorigenesis.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAlkaline intracellular pH activates mTORC2",

    "abstract": "The study of microbial communities and their interactions has attracted the interest of the scientific community, because of their potential for applications in biotechnology, ecology and medicine. The complexity of interspecies interactions, which are key for the macroscopic behavior of microbial communities, cannot be studied easily experimentally. For this reason, the modeling of microbial communities has begun to leverage the knowledge of established constraint-based methods, which have long been used for studying and analyzing the microbial metabolism of individual species based on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of microorganisms. A main problem of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions is that they usually contain metabolic gaps due to genome misannotations and unknown enzyme functions. This problem is traditionally solved by using gap-filling algorithms that add biochemical reactions from external databases to the metabolic reconstruction, in order to restore model growth. However, gap-filling algorithms could evolve by taking into account metabolic interactions among species that coexist in microbial communities. In this work, a gap-filling method that resolves metabolic gaps at the community level was developed. The efficacy of the algorithm was tested by analyzing its ability to resolve metabolic gaps on a synthetic community of auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains. Subsequently, the algorithm was applied to resolve metabolic gaps and predict metabolic interactions in a community of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, two species present in the human gut microbiota, and in an experimentally studied community of Dehalobacter and Bacteroidales species of the ACT-3 community. The community gap-filling method can facilitate the improvement of metabolic models and the identification of metabolic interactions that are difficult to identify experimentally in microbial communities.\n\nAuthor summaryMicrobes compose the most abundant form of life on our planet and they are almost never found in isolation, as they live in close association with one another and with other organisms. The metabolic capacity of individual microbial species dictates their ways of interaction with other species as well as with their environment. The metabolic interactions among microorganisms have been recognised as the driving force for the emergence of the properties of microbial communities. For this reason, understanding the effect of microbial metabolism on interspecies metabolic interactions is detrimental for the study of microbial communities. This study can be benefited by metabolic modeling and the insights offered by constraint-based methods which have been developed for interrogating metabolic models. In this paper, we present an algorithm that predicts cooperative and competitive metabolic interactions between species, while it resolves metabolic gaps in their metabolic models in a computationally efficient way. We use our community gap-filling algorithm to study microbial communities with interesting environmental and health-related applications.",

    "abstract": "Variability of synapse numbers and partners despite identical genes reveals limits of genetic determinism. Non-genetic perturbation of brain wiring can therefore reveal to what extent synapse formation is precise and absolute, or promiscuous and relative. Here, we show the role of relative partner availability for synapse formation in the fly brain through perturbation of developmental temperature. Unexpectedly, slower development at lower temperatures substantially increases axo-dendritic branching, synapse numbers and non-canonical synaptic partnerships of various neurons, while maintaining robust ratios of canonical synapses. Using R7 photoreceptors as a model, we further show that scalability of synapse numbers and ratios is preserved when relative availability of synaptic partners is changed in a DIP{gamma} mutant that ablates R7s preferred synaptic partner. Behaviorally, movement activity scales inversely with synapse numbers, while movement precision and relative connectivity are congruently robust. Hence, the fly genome encodes scalable relative connectivity to develop functional, but not identical, brains.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryNon-identical connectivity and behavior result from temperature-dependent synaptic partner availability in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Tau protein is involved in maintaining neuronal structure. In Alzheimers disease, small numbers of tau molecules can aggregate to forms oligomers. However, how these oligomers produce changes in neuronal function remains unclear. Previously, oligomers made from full-length human tau were found to have multiple effects on neuronal properties. Here we have cut the tau molecule into two parts: the first 123 amino acids and the remaining 124-441 amino acids. These truncated tau molecules had specific effects on neuronal properties, allowing us to assign the actions of full-length tau to different regions of the molecule. We identified one key target for the effects of tau, the voltage gated sodium channel, which could account for the effects of tau on the action potential. By truncating the tau molecule, we have probed the mechanisms that underlie tau dysfunction, and this increased understanding of taus pathological actions, will build towards developing future tau-targeting therapies.",

    "abstract": "Compartmentalization of GTPase regulators into signaling nodules dictates the GTPase pathways selected. Rac and Cdc42 are synchronized at the cell edge for effective protrusion in motile cells but how their activity is coordinated remains elusive. Here, we discovered that ARHGAP39, a Rac and Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein, sequentially interacts with WAVE and mDia2 to control Rac/lamellipodia and Cdc42/filopodia protrusions, respectively. Mechanistically, ARHGAP39 binds to WAVE and, upon phosphorylation by Src kinase, inactivates Rac to promote Cdc42-induced filopodia formation. With our optimized FRET biosensor, we detected active Cdc42 at the filopodia tips that controls filopodia extension. ARHGAP39 is transported to filopodia tips by Myosin-X where it binds mDia2 and inactivates Cdc42 leading to filopodia retraction. Failure in lamellipodia to filopodia switch by defective ARHGAP39 impairs cell invasion and metastasis. Our study reveals that compartmentalization of ARHGAP39 within Rac/Cdc42 signaling nodules orchestrates the synchronization of lamellipodia/filopodia crosstalk and highlights the intricate regulation of leading edge dynamics in migrating cells.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces is a model filamentous prokaryote to study multicellular differentiation and a rich reservoir for antibiotics discovery. In their natural conditions, Streptomyces grows at the interface of porous soil, air, and water. The morphological development of Streptomyces is traditionally performed on agar plates and mostly studied at the population levels. However, the detailed lifecycle of Streptomyces has not been well studied due to its complexity and lack of research tools which can mimic their natural conditions in the soil. Here, we developed a simple assembled microfluidic device for cultivation and the entire lifecycle observation of Streptomyces development from single-cell level. The microfluidic device composed of a microchannel for loading samples and supplying nutrients, microwell arrays for seeding and growth of single spores, and air-filled chambers aside of the microwells that facilitate growth of aerial hyphae and spores. A unique feature of this device is that each microwell is surrounded by a 1.5 {micro}m gap connected to an air-filled chamber which provide stabilized water-air interface. We used this device to observe the development of single Streptomyces spores and found that unlike those in bulk liquid culture, Streptomyces can differentiate at water-air interfaces in microscale liquid culture. Finally, we demonstrated that phenotypic A-Factor assay can be performed at defined time point of its lifecycle. This microfluidic device could become a robust tool for studying Streptomyces multi-cellular differentiation and interaction at single cell level.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe describe a microfluidic device that mimics the natural porous environment for the growth and development of Streptomyces, the model system for bacterial multicellularity. The microfluidic device is used for cultivation and the entire lifecycle observation of Streptomyces development from single-cell level, including growth of aerial filaments. The aerial hyphae development of Streptomyces at the water-air interface was observed at real time in the microfluidic device. The early growth, opportunistic transformation (in the gap), and merging of aerial hyphae of Streptomyces in the microfluidic device were observed for the first time. It will play an important role in finding single-cell heterogeneity to study secondary metabolites related to the complex lifecycle of Streptomyces.",

    "abstract": "The ocular lens proteome undergoes post-translational and progressive degradation as fiber cells age. The oldest fiber cells and the proteins therein are present at birth and are retained through death. Transparency of the lens is maintained in part by the high abundance crystallin family proteins (up to 300 mg/mL), which establishes a high dynamic range of protein abundance. As a result, previous Data Dependent Analysis (DDA) measurements of the lens proteome are less equipped to identify the lowest abundance proteins. In an attempt to probe more deeply into the lens proteome, we measured the insoluble lens proteome of an 18-year-old human with DDA and newer Data Independent Analysis (DIA) methods. By applying library free DIA search methods, 4,564 protein groups, 48,474 peptides and 5,577 deamidation sites were detected: significantly outperforming the quantity of identifications in using DDA and Pan-Human DIA library searches. Finally, by segmenting the lens into multiple fiber cell-age related regions, we uncovered cell-age resolved changes in proteome composition and putative function.",
