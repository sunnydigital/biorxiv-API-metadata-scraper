    "abstract": "The Connexin43 gap junction gene GJA1 has one coding exon, but its mRNA undergoes internal translation to generate N-terminal truncated isoforms of Connexin43 with the predominant isoform being only 20 kDa in size (GJA1-20k). Endogenous GJA1-20k protein is not membrane bound, and has been found to increase in response to ischemic stress, localize to mitochondria, and mimic ischemic preconditioning protection in the heart. However, it is not known how GJA1-20k benefits mitochondria to provide this protection. Here, we identify that GJA1-20k polymerizes actin around mitochondria which induces focal constriction sites. Mitochondrial fission events occur within about 45 seconds of GJA1-20k recruitment of actin. Interestingly, GJA1-20k mediated fission is independent of canonical Dynamin Related Protein 1 (DRP1). We find that GJA1-20k induced smaller mitochondria have decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and, in hearts, provide potent protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results indicate that stress responsive internally translated GJA1-20k stabilizes polymerized actin filaments to stimulate non-canonical mitochondrial fission which limits ischemic-reperfusion induced myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate retinas originate from a specific anlage in the anterior neural plate called the eyefield. The eyefield shares its anterior border with the prospective telencephalon and is in contact ventrally and posteriorly with hypothalamic and diencephalic precursors. Eyefield identity is conferred by a set of \"eye transcription factors\", whose combinatorial expression has not been precisely characterized. Here, we use the dimorphic teleost species Astyanax mexicanus, which develops proper eyes in the wild type and smaller colobomatous eyes in the blind cavefish embryo, to unravel the molecular anatomy of the eyefield and its micro-evolutionary variations in the two Astyanax morphs. Using a series of markers (Rx3, Pax6, CxCr4b, Zic1, Lhx2, Emx3, Nkx2.1), we draw a comparative 3D expression map at the end of gastrulation/onset of neurulation, which highlights hyper-regionalization of the eyefield into sub-territories of distinct sizes, shapes, cell identities and putative fates along the three body axes. We also discover sub-domains within the prospective telencephalon, and we characterize cell identities at the frontiers of the eyefield. Analyses at the tissue scale and single cell level show variations in volumes and shapes of eyefield subdivisions as well as cellular gene expression levels and identity changes in cavefish. The ventro-medial border and the anterior border of the eyefield contain cells co-expressing hypothalamic and telencephalic marker, respectively, in cavefish embryos. Altogether, we provide a new model of eyefield patterning in 3D and suggest a developmental origin for the emergence of the coloboma phenotype in the natural mutant cavefish embryo.",

We test these assumptions using a dataset comprising 2,487 stomach contents of fish species across functional groups, feeding strategies, and prey availability in the environment over 12 years. Our results show that foraging shifts from trait-dependent prey selectivity to density dependence in warmer and more productive environments. This behavioral change leads to lower consumption efficiency as species shift away from their optimal trophic niche, undermining species persistence and biodiversity. By integrating this adaptive behavior into dynamic models, our study reveals that adaptive foraging yields higher risk profiles for ecosystems under global warming.",

    "abstract": "Human-induced environmental change can influence populations both at the global level through climatic warming and at the local level through habitat fragmentation. As populations become more isolated, they can suffer from high levels of inbreeding which contributes to a reduction in fitness, termed inbreeding depression. However, it is still unclear if this increase in homozygosity also results in a corresponding increase in sensitivity to stressful conditions, which could intensify the already detrimental effects of environmental warming. Here, in a fully factorial design, we assessed the life-long impact of increased mutation load and elevated temperature on key life history traits in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. We found that beetles raised at higher temperatures had far reduced fitness and survival than beetles from control temperatures. Importantly, these negative effects were exacerbated in inbred beetles as a result of increased mutation load, with further detrimental effects manifesting on individual hatching probability and lifetime reproductive success. These results reveal the harmful impact that increasing temperature and likelihood of habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenetic changes in environmental conditions could have on populations of organisms worldwide.",

    "abstract": "ContextFunctional genomics studies have revealed genomic regions with regulatory and evolutionary significance. Such information independent of association analysis may benefit fine-mapping and genomic selection of economically important traits. However, systematic evaluation of the use of functional information in mapping, and genomic selection of cattle traits is lacking. Also, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from the high-density (HD) panel are known to tag informative variants, but the performance of genomic prediction using HD SNPs together with variants supported by different functional genomics is unknown.\n\nAimsWe selected six sets of functionally important variants and modelled each set together with HD SNPs in Bayesian models to map and predict protein, fat, and milk yield as well as mastitis, somatic cell count and temperament of dairy cattle.\n\nMethodsTwo models were used: 1) BayesR which includes priors of four distribution of variant-effects, and 2) BayesRC which includes additional priors of different functional classes of variants. Bayesian models were trained in 3 breeds of 28,000 cows of Holstein, Jersey and Australian Red and predicted into 2,600 independent bulls.\n\nKey resultsAdding functionally important variants significantly increased the enrichment of genetic variance explained for mapped variants, suggesting improved genome-wide mapping precision. Such improvement was significantly higher when the same set of variants were modelled by BayesRC than by BayesR. Combining functional variant sets with HD SNPs improves genomic prediction accuracy in the majority of the cases and such improvement was more common and stronger for non-Holstein breeds and traits like mastitis, somatic cell count and temperament. In contrast, adding a large number of random sequence variants to HD SNPs reduces mapping precision and has a worse or similar prediction accuracy, compared to using HD SNPs alone to map or predict. While BayesRC tended to have better genomic prediction accuracy than BayesR, the overall difference in prediction accuracy between the two models was insignificant.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the usefulness of functional data in genomic mapping and prediction.\n\nImplicationsWe highlight the need for effective tools exploiting complex functional datasets to improve genomic prediction.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer somatic mutations are the product of multiple mutational and repair processes, which are tightly associated with DNA replication. Distinctive patterns of somatic mutations accumulation in tumors, termed mutational signatures, are indicative of processes the tumors underwent. While tumor mutational load is correlated with late replicating regions and spatial genome organization, much is unknown about the association of many different mutational processes and replication timing, and the interplay with chromatin structure remains an open question.\n\nMethodsWe systematically analyzed the mutational landscape of 2,787 WGS tumors from 32 different tumor types separately for early and late replicating regions. We used sequence context normalization and chromatin data to account for sequence and chromatin accessibility differences between early and late replicating regions. Moreover, we expanded the signature analyses to doublet base substitutions and small insertions and deletions by developing an artificial genomes-based approach to account for sequence differences between various genomic regions.\n\nResultsWe revealed the replication timing (RT) association of single base, doublet base and small insertions and deletions mutational signatures. The association is signature specific: some are associated with early or late replication (such as UV-exposure signatures SBS7b and SBS7a, respectively) and others have no association. Most associations exist even after normalizing for genome accessibility. We further developed a focused mutational signature identification approach, which uses RT information to improve signature identification, and found that SBS16, which is biased towards early replication, is strongly associated with better survival rates in liver cancer.\n\nConclusionsOur comprehensive analyses enabled a more robust classification of RT association of single base, doublet base and indels signatures. By doing so, we demonstrated a variation in the association with RT, as many mutational processes biased towards either early or late replication timing, and others have an equal RT distribution. These associations were independent from chromatin accessibility in most cases. This work highlights that restricting signatures analyses to concise genomic regions improves identification of signatures, such as SBS16, and demonstrates its clinically relevance as a predictor of improved survival of liver cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver the last decade, progress in DNA sequencing technologies and assembly methods allowed plant scientists to move beyond the use of model organisms and work directly on the genomes of the major crops. Forage grass research can also benefit from this revolution, enabling progress in population genetic studies, functional biology, and genomics-assisted breeding. Due to its large genome size and high repeat content, so far only incomplete and fragmented assemblies are available for the grasses of the Lolium and Festuca species complex.\n\nFindingsHere, we report a highly contiguous draft assembly of Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum Lam.), spanning 4.5 Gb and with a N50 of 3 Mb, containing ~70,000 gene models. Thanks to its relatedness to barley, 78% of the assembly was anchored on seven pseudomolecules. The high heterozygosity of the plant allowed obtaining a diploid assembly - i.e. across 95% of the assembly, both alleles were assembled on separate sequences. This feature allowed unraveling a very high amount of intergenic sequence variation between allelic sequences.\n\nConclusionsWe present a nearly complete genome assembly of a genotype used in contemporary Swiss forage grass breeding programs. This work shows how genomic research has improved, allowing to decode the genetic code of large, complex, and heterozygous plants. It also allows the functional characterization of the ryegrass gene repertoire and the large-scale development of molecular markers. Furthermore, it paves the road for a reference-based characterization and exploitation of the genetic variation within the Lolium and Festuca species complex.",

    "abstract": "Three-component ParABS systems are widely distributed factors for plasmid partitioning and chromosome segregation in bacteria. ParB protein acts as an adaptor between the 16 bp centromeric parS DNA sequences and the DNA segregation ATPase ParA. It accumulates at high concentrations at and near a parS site by assembling a partition complex. ParB dimers form a DNA sliding clamp whose closure at parS requires CTP binding. The mechanism underlying ParB loading and the role of CTP hydrolysis however remain unclear. We show that CTP hydrolysis is dispensable for Smc recruitment to parS sites in Bacillus subtilis but is essential for chromosome segregation by ParABS in the absence of Smc. Our results suggest that CTP hydrolysis contributes to partition complex assembly via two mechanisms. It recycles off-target ParB clamps to allow for new attempts at parS targeting and it limits the extent of spreading from parS by promoting DNA unloading. We also propose a model for how parS DNA catalyzes ParB clamp closure involving a steric clash between ParB protomers binding to opposing parS half sites.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important reversible post-translational modifications. It affects every cellular process including differentiation, metabolism and cell cycle. Eukaryotic protein kinases (ePK) catalyse the transfer of a phosphate from ATP onto proteins, which regulates fast changes in protein activity, structure or subcellular localisation. The systematic identification of substrates is thus crucial to characterise the functions of kinases and determine the pathways they regulate, and even more so when studying the impact of pathogens-excreted kinases on the host cell signal transduction. Several strategies and approaches have been used to identify substrates, but all show important limitations thus calling for the development of new efficient and more convenient approaches for kinase substrate identification.\n\nHerein, we present SILAkin, a novel and easy method to identify substrates that is applicable to most kinases. It combines phosphatase treatment, pulse heating, in vitro kinase assay (IVKA) and SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture)-based quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). We developed SILAkin using the Leishmania casein kinase 1 (L-CK1.2) as experimental model. Leishmania, an intracellular parasite causing Leishmaniasis, releases L-CK1.2 in its host cell. Applying this novel assay allowed us to gain unprecedented insight into host-pathogen interactions through the identification of host substrates phosphorylated by pathogen-excreted kinases. We identified 225 substrates, including 85% previously unknown that represent novel mammalian CK1 targets, and defined a novel CK1 phosphorylation motif. The substratome was validated experimentally by L-CK1.2 and human CK1{delta}, demonstrating the efficiency of SILAkin to identify new substrates and revealing novel regulatory pathways. Finally, SILAkin was instrumental in highlighting host pathways potentially regulated by L-CK1.2 in Leishmania-infected host cells, described by the GO terms  viral & symbiotic interaction,  apoptosis,  actin cytoskeleton organisation, and  RNA processing and splicing. SILAkin thus can generate important mechanistic insights into the signalling of host subversion by these parasites and other microbial pathogen adapted for intracellular survival.",

    "abstract": "Fibrinolysis is the enzymatic degradation of fibrin, the biopolymer that gives blood clots their mechanical integrity. To reestablish blood flow in vessels occluded by clots, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can be used; however, its efficacy is limited by transport to and into a clot and by the depletion of its substrate, plasminogen. To overcome these rate limitations, we design a platform to co-deliver tPA and plasminogen based on microwheels (wheels), wheel-like assemblies of superparamagnetic colloidal beads that roll along surfaces at high speeds and carry therapeutic payloads in applied magnetic fields. By experimentally measuring fibrinolysis of plasma clots at varying concentrations of tPA and plasminogen, the biochemical speed limit was first determined. These data, in conjunction with measurements of wheel translation, activity of immobilized tPA on beads, and plasminogen release kinetics from magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (mMSN), were used in a mathematical model to identify the optimal tPA:plasminogen ratio and guide the coupling of plasminogen-loaded mMSN to tPA functionalized superparamagnetic beads. Once coupled, particle-bead assemblies form into a co-delivery vehicle that rolls to plasma clot interfaces and lyses them at rates comparable to the biochemical speed limit. With the addition of mechanical action provided by rotating wheels to penetrate clots, this barrier was exceeded by rates 40-fold higher lysis by 50 nM tPA. This co-delivery of an immobilized enzyme and its substrate via a microbot capable of mechanical work has the potential to target and rapidly lyse clots that are inaccessible by mechanical thrombectomy devices or recalcitrant to systemic tPA delivery.",

However, the reciprocal influence of bone cells on the primary tumor is relatively overlooked. Here, to study the bone-tumor paracrine influence, a tri-cellular 3-D vascularized breast cancer tissue (VBCTs) model is engineered which comprised MDA-MB231, a triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC), fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. The VBCTs are indirectly co-cultured with osteoblasts (OBs), thereby constituting a complex quad-cellular tumor progression model. MDA-MB231 alone and in conjunction with OBs led to abnormal vasculature and reduced vessel density but enhanced VEGF production. A total of 1476 significantly upregulated and 775 downregulated genes are identified in the VBCTs exposed to OBs. HSP90N, CYCS, RPS27A, and EGFR are recognized as upregulated hub-genes. Kaplan Meier plot shows HSP90N to have a significant outcome in TNBC patient survivability. Furthermore, compared to cancer tissues without vessels, gene analysis recognized 1278 significantly upregulated and 566 downregulated genes in VBCTs. DKK1, CXCL13, C3 protein and BMP4 are identified to be downregulated hub genes in VBCTs.

Here, we investigated the efficacy and safety of Brom and Ac (BromAc) in the pancreatic cancer model in vivo.\n\nDesignBoth low dose and high dose studies for safety and efficacy of BromAc and GEM were conducted in nude mice. Body weight, wellbeing and tumor volume were monitored. At autopsy, tumor weight, tumor density, percentage of tumor necrosis, expression of Ki67 antigen, and immunohistological evaluation of vital organs were compared between the treatment groups.\n\nResultsThe low and high doses of BromAc alone and with chemotherapy agents were safe. A very significant reduction in pancreatic tumor volume, weight, and ki67 were seen with BromAc therapy and was equal to treatment with GEM alone and better than treatment with 5-FU. In addition, tumor density was significantly reduced by BromAc.\n\nConclusionThese encouraging results are the first in vivo evidence of the efficacy of BromAc in pancreatic cancer and provide some mechanistic leads.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCOPD patients exhibit skeletal muscle atrophy, denervation, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Whilst chronic tobacco smoke exposure is implicated in COPD muscle impairment, the mechanisms involved are ambiguous. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that activates detoxifying pathways with numerous exogenous ligands, including tobacco smoke. Whereas transient AHR activation is adaptive, chronic activation can be toxic. On this basis, we tested the hypothesis that chronic smoke-induced AHR activation causes adverse muscle impact.\n\nMethodsWe used clinical patient muscle samples, and in vitro (C2C12 myotubes) and in vivo models (mouse), to perform gene expression, mitochondrial function, muscle and neuromuscular junction morphology, and genetic manipulations (adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer).\n\nResults16 weeks tobacco smoke exposure in mice caused: muscle atrophy, neuromuscular junction degeneration, and reduced oxidative capacity. Similarly, smoke exposure reprogrammed the muscle transcriptome, with down-regulation of mitochondrial and neuromuscular junction genes. In mouse and human patient specimens, smoke exposure increased muscle AHR signaling. Mechanistically, experiments in cultured myotubes demonstrated that smoke condensate activated the AHR, caused mitochondrial impairments, and induced an AHR-dependent myotube atrophy. Finally, to isolate the role of AHR activity, expression of a constitutively active AHR mutant without smoke exposure caused atrophy and mitochondrial impairments in cultured myotubes, and muscle atrophy and neuromuscular junction degeneration in mice.\n\nConclusionsThese results establish that chronic AHR activity, as occurs in smokers, phenocopies the atrophy, mitochondrial impairment and neuromuscular junction degeneration caused by chronic tobacco smoke exposure.",

    "abstract": "In most plant tissues, threads of cytoplasm, or plasmodesmata, connect the protoplasts via pores in the cell walls. This enables symplasmic transport, for instance in phloem loading, transport, and unloading. Importantly, the geometry of the wall pore limits the size of the particles that may be transported, and also (co-)defines plasmodesmal resistance to diffusion and convective flow. However, quantitative information on transport through plasmodesmata in non-cylindrical cell wall pores is scarce. We have found conical, funnel-shaped cell wall pores in the phloem-unloading zone in growing root tips of five eudicot and two monocot species, specifically between protophloem sieve elements and phloem pole pericycle cells. 3D reconstructions by electron tomography suggested that funnel plasmodesmata possess a desmotubule but lack tethers to fix it in a central position. Model calculations showed that both diffusive and hydraulic resistance decrease drastically in conical cell wall pores compared to cylindrical channels, even at very small opening angles. Notably, the effect on hydraulic resistance was relatively larger. We conclude that funnel plasmodesmata generally are present in specific cell-cell interfaces in angiosperm roots, where they appear to facilitate symplasmic phloem unloading. Interestingly, cytosolic sleeves of most plasmodesmata reported in the literature do not resemble straight annuli but possess variously shaped widenings. Our evaluations suggest that widenings too small for identification on electron micrographs may drastically reduce the hydraulic and diffusional resistance of these pores. Consequently, theoretical models assuming cylindrical symmetries will underestimate plasmodesmal conductivities.",

Here, we develop a method to modulate thylakoid biogenesis in the rod-shaped cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 by modulating light intensity during cell growth, and probe the spatial-temporal stepwise biogenesis process of thylakoid membranes in cells. Our results reveal that the plasma membrane and regularly arranged concentric thylakoid layers have no physical connections. The newly synthesized thylakoid membrane fragments emerge between the plasma membrane and pre-existing thylakoids. Photosystem I monomers appear in the thylakoid membranes earlier than other mature photosystem assemblies, followed by generation of Photosystem I trimers and Photosystem II complexes. Redistribution of photosynthetic complexes during thylakoid biogenesis ensures establishment of the spatial organization of the functional thylakoid network. This study provides insights into the dynamic biogenesis process and maturation of the functional photosynthetic machinery.",

    "abstract": "In Venezuela the oldest, although anecdotical, record known of a captive jaguar is a male in the city of Maracay between 1918 and 1935. Body measurements were made on 22 jaguars kept in Venezuelan zoos between 1996 and 2009 to provide data on external morphometrics and compare with the measurements of 25 free-living animals, published by Hoogesteijn and Mondolfi (1992) and determine whether there are significant differences in the morphology between sexes of captive and free-living animals. The evaluation of morphometric variation was focused on three body measurements and body weight: Head-and-body length (HBL) and Tail length (Tl). Total body length (TBL) was calculated by adding HBL and Tl. Body weight (BW) was determined using a clock scale to the nearest gramme/kilogram. To determine the values all animals were anesthetized. The sexes were analyzed separately. All data were used for the calculation of descriptive statistics. Student t-tests were used with a significance level  0.05 to establish if there is a significant difference between the measurements and weights of the sexes. The TBL and HBL in captive males were observed to be 8.78% and 12.13%, respectively, less than that of free-living males. A principal components analysis made it possible to assess the variability between HBL, TBL, and BW between sexes and between free-living/wild and captive animals. This study showed no significant differences in the BW of captives and wild females. Some captive males jaguars in this study may be thinner than normal, because of their diet and others may be fatter because of the lack of physical activity imposed by captivity. Body mass index (BMI) was used to contrast the difference in the average mass of each sex in both captive and free-living animals. Simple linear regressions and correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between body mass and male/female size. According to correlation coefficients, the change in weight that can be attributed to the ratio of weight to body length is 8.55 % for males and 9.83 % for females.",

    "abstract": "The rising of multiresistant bacterial pathogens is currently one of the most critical threats to global health, demanding a better understanding of the origin and spread of antibiotic resistance. In this regard, the resistome hosted by the microbiota from natural and remote environments remains poorly explored. Moreover, little is known about the availability of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) from these environments to be disseminated through horizontal transfer, potentially mediating the rise of novel resistance factors among clinically relevant pathogens. In this context, the North Antarctica soils are attractive ecosystems to study due to the presence of a microbiota naturally adapted to thrive in harsh conditions, including potential factors to resist natural toxic substances. In this work, we evaluated the antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolated from soils collected in humanized and non-intervened areas of North Antarctica. We identified resistance to a wide array of antibiotics, with isolates harboring up to 10 simultaneous resistances, mainly native Pseudomonas. Genomic analysis revealed the presence of a wide array of genes encoding efflux pumps but the lack of genes explaining some of the resistance phenotypes, suggesting novel uncharacterized mechanisms. Also, using 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing, we explored the microbial diversity in the sampled soils and evaluated the presence of ARGs and their host microbiota. High microbial diversity was found in all the sites, with Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Acidobacteriota, and Verrucomicrobiota being the most abundant Phyla, while Candidatus Udaeobacter, RB41, Polaromonas, and Ferruginibacter the most abundant genera. We identified hundreds of genes potentially conferring resistance to more than 15 drug classes, both by short reads analyses and ARG detection among assembled contigs and MAGs obtained combining short and long-read sequence data. Polaromonas, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Variovorax, Bhurkolderia, and Gemmatimonas were the main host taxa of the identified ARGs. Part of these ARGs was found inside predicted plasmids, including a putative OXA-like beta-lactamase from Polaromonas harboring the key conserved residues of this kind of enzyme and a conserved predicted protein structure. All this evidence indicates that microbial communities from North Antarctica soil have a highly diverse natural resistome, part of it located inside mobile genetic elements, which would act as a source of novel ARGs.",

    "abstract": "No phenotypic trait evolves independently of all other traits, but the cause of trait-trait coevolution is poorly understood. While the coevolution could arise simply from pleiotropic mutations that simultaneously affect the traits concerned, it could also result from multivariate natural selection favoring certain trait relationships. To gain a general mechanistic understanding of trait-trait coevolution, we examine the evolution of 220 cell morphology traits across 16 natural strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the evolution of 24 wing morphology traits across 110 fly species of the family Drosophilidae, along with the variations of these traits among gene deletion or mutation accumulation lines (a.k.a. mutants). For numerous trait pairs, the phenotypic correlation among evolutionary lineages differs significantly from that among mutants. Specifically, we find hundreds of cases where the evolutionary correlation between traits is strengthened or reversed relative to the mutational correlation, which, according to our population genetic simulation, is likely caused by multivariate selection. Furthermore, we detect selection for enhanced modularity of the yeast traits analyzed. Together, these results demonstrate that trait-trait coevolution is shaped by natural selection and suggest that the pleiotropic structure of mutation is not optimal. Because the morphological traits analyzed here are chosen largely because of their measurability and thereby are not expected to be biased with regard to natural selection, our conclusion is likely general.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy - a hallmark of cancer - has tissue-specific recurrence patterns suggesting it plays a driving role in cancer initiation and progression. However, the contribution of aneuploidy to tumorigenesis depends on the cellular and genomic context in which it arises. Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is a common macro-evolutionary event that occurs in >25% of human tumors during the early stages of tumorigenesis. Although tumors that have undergone WGD are reported to be more permissive to aneuploidy than tumors that have not, it remains unknown whether WGD affects aneuploidy recurrence patterns in human cancers. Here we analyzed clinical tumor samples from 449 WGD- tumors and 157 WGD+ tumors across 22 tumor types. We found distinct recurrence patterns of aneuploidy in WGD- and WGD+ tumors. The relative prevalence of recurrent aneuploidies decreased in WGD+ tumors, in line with increased aneuploidy tolerance. Moreover, the genetic interactions between chromosome arms differed between WGD- and WGD+ tumors, giving rise to distinct co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity aneuploidy patterns. The proportion of whole-chromosome aneuploidy vs. arm-level aneuploidy was significantly higher in WGD+ tumors, indicating distinct dominant mechanisms for aneuploidy formation in WGD- and WGD+ tumors. Human cancer cell lines successfully reproduced these WGD/aneuploidy interactions, confirming the relevance of studying this phenomenon in culture. Lastly, we induced WGD in human colon cancer cell lines, and followed aneuploidy formation in the isogenic WGD+/WGD-cells under standard or selective conditions. These experiments validated key findings from the clinical tumor analysis, and revealed a causal link between WGD and altered aneuploidy landscapes.

    "abstract": "When an action potential arrives at a synapse there is a large probability that no neurotransmitter is released. Surprisingly, simple computational models suggest that these synaptic failures enable information processing at lower metabolic costs. However, these models only consider information transmission at single synapses ignoring the remainder of the neural network as well as its overall computational goal. Here, we investigate how synaptic failures affect the energy efficiency of models of entire neural networks that solve a goal-driven task. We find that presynaptic stochasticity and plasticity improve energy efficiency and show that the network allocates most energy to a sparse subset of important synapses. We demonstrate that stabilising these synapses helps to alleviate the stability-plasticity dilemma, thus connecting a presynaptic notion of importance to a computational role in lifelong learning. Overall, our findings present a set of hypotheses for how presynaptic plasticity and stochasticity contribute to sparsity, energy efficiency and improved trade-offs in the stability-plasticity dilemma.",

    "abstract": "Many Brassica species require vernalization (long-term winter-like cooling) for transition to the reproductive stage. In the past several decades, scientific efforts have been made to discern the molecular mechanisms underlying vernalization in many species. Thus, to identify the key regulators required for vernalization in Brassica rapa L., we constructed a linkage map composed of 7,833 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using the late-flowering Chinese cabbage (B. rapa L. ssp. pekinensis) inbred line  Chiifu and the early-flowering yellow sarson (B. rapa L. ssp. trilocularis (Roxb.)) line  LP08 and identified a single major QTL on the upper-arm of the chromosome A02. In addition, we compared the transcriptomes of the lines  Chiifu and  LP08 at five vernalization time points, including both non-vernalized and post-vernalization conditions. We observed that BrFLC2 was significantly downregulated in the early flowering  LP08 and had two deletion sites around the BrFLC2 genomic region compared with the BrFLC2 genomic region in  Chiifu. In the present study, we also demonstrate that early flowering in  LP08 line is attributed to the low expression of BrFLC2, which is caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Therefore, this study provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying floral transition in B. rapa.\n\nOne sentence summaryNMD-mediated degradation of BrFLC2 mRNA transcripts is the main cause of rapid flowering of oilseed-type B. rapa  LP08 plants.",

    "abstract": "The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a rapid response in terms of vaccine and drug development targeting the viral pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this work, we modelled a complete membrane-embedded SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the primary target of vaccine and therapeutics development, based on available structural data and known glycan content. We then used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the system in the presence of benzene probes designed to enhance discovery of cryptic, potentially druggable pockets on the S protein surface. We uncovered a novel cryptic pocket with promising druggable properties located underneath the 617-628 loop, which was shown to be involved in the formation of S protein multimers on the viral surface. A marked multi-conformational behaviour of this loop in simulations was validated using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, supportive of opening and closing dynamics. Interestingly, the pocket is also the site of the D614G mutation, known to be important for SARS-CoV-2 fitness, and within close proximity to mutations in the novel SARS-CoV-2 strains B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.28, both of which are associated with increased transmissibility and severity of infection. The pocket was present in systems emulating both immature and mature glycosylation states, suggesting its druggability may not be dependent upon the stage of virus maturation. Overall, the predominantly hydrophobic nature of the cryptic pocket, its well conserved surface, and proximity to regions of functional relevance in viral assembly and fitness are all promising indicators of its potential for therapeutic targeting. Our method also successfully recapitulated hydrophobic pockets in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain associated with detergent or lipid binding in prior cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. Collectively, this work highlights the utility of the benzene mapping approach in uncovering potential druggable sites on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 targets.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has had a disproportionate impact on non-hospital healthcare settings such as long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The communal nature of these facilities, paired with the high-risk profile of residents, has resulted in thousands of infections and deaths and a high case fatality rate. To detect pre-symptomatic infections and identify infected workers, we performed weekly surveillance testing of staff at two LTCFs which revealed a large outbreak at one of the sites. We collected serum from staff members throughout the study and evaluated it for binding and neutralization to measure seroprevalence, seroconversion, and type and functionality of antibodies. At the site with very few incident infections, we detected that over 40% of the staff had preexisting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting prior exposure. At the outbreak site, we saw rapid seroconversion following infection. Neutralizing antibody levels were stable for many weeks following infection, suggesting a durable, long-lived response. Receptor-binding domain antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated. The site with high seroprevalence among staff had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility through seronegative infected staff during the period of study but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Together our results reveal that high seroprevalence rate among staff can contribute to herd immunity within a workplace and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 binds to cell-surface receptors and is activated for membrane fusion and cell entry via proteolytic cleavage. Phenomenological data have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be activated for entry at either the cell surface or in endosomes, but the relative roles in different cell types and mechanisms of entry have been debated. Here we use single-virus fusion experiments and exogenously controlled proteases to probe activation directly. We find that plasma membrane and an appropriate protease are sufficient to support SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus fusion. Furthermore, fusion kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses are indistinguishable no matter which of a broad range of proteases was used to activate the virus. This suggests that fusion mechanism is insensitive to protease identity or even whether activation occurs before or after receptor binding. These data support a model for opportunistic fusion by SARS-CoV-2, where subcellular location of entry likely depends on the differential activity of airway, cell-surface, and endosomal proteases, but all support infection. Inhibiting any single host protease may thus reduce infection in some cells but may be less clinically robust.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 can use multiple pathways to infect cells, as demonstrated recently when new viral variants switched dominant infection pathways. Here, we use single-virus fusion experiments together with biochemical reconstitution to show that these multiple pathways coexist simultaneously and specifically that the virus can be activated by different proteases in different cellular compartments with mechanistically identical effect. The consequences of this are that the virus is evolutionarily plastic and that therapies targeting viral entry should address multiple pathways at once to achieve optimal clinical effects.",

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply in recent weeks and a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyzed whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 entered two out of eight cell lines tested with slightly increased efficiency and was blocked by entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 was resistant against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. Finally, B.1.617 evaded antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although with moderate efficiency.

A metagenomics sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform following by bioinformatic analyses on a local server in Mali. We recovered a full genome of SARS-CoV-2 of 29 kb with an average depth coverage of 200x. We have demonstrated our capability of generating a high quality genome with limited resources and highlight the need to develop genomics capacity locally to solve health problems.

    "abstract": "S-adenosylmethionine lyase (SAMase) of bacteriophage T3 degrades the intracellular SAM pools of the host E. coli cells, thus inactivating a crucial metabolite involved in plethora of cellular functions, including DNA methylation. SAMase is the first viral protein expressed upon infection and its activity prevents methylation of the T3 genome. Maintenance of the phage genome in a fully unmethylated state has a profound effect on the infection strategy -- it allows T3 to shift from a lytic infection under normal growth conditions to a transient lysogenic infection under glucose starvation. Using single-particle Cryo-EM and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that SAMase performs its function by not only degrading SAM, but also by interacting with and efficiently inhibiting the hosts methionine S-adenosyltransferase (MAT) -- the enzyme that produces SAM. Specifically, SAMase triggers open-ended head-to-tail assembly of E. coli MAT into an unusual linear filamentous structure in which adjacent MAT tetramers are joined together by two SAMase dimers. Molecular dynamics simulations together with normal mode analyses suggest that the entrapment of MAT tetramers within filaments leads to an allosteric inhibition of MAT activity due to a shift to low-frequency high-amplitude active site-deforming modes. The amplification of uncorrelated motions between active site residues weakens MATs ability to withhold substrates, explaining the observed loss of function. We propose that the dual function of SAMase as an enzyme that degrades SAM and as an inhibitor of MAT activity has emerged to achieve an efficient depletion of the intracellular SAM pools.\n\nIMPORTANCESelf-assembly of enzymes into filamentous structures in response to specific metabolic cues has recently emerged as a widespread strategy of metabolic regulation. In many instances filamentation of metabolic enzymes occurs in response to starvation and leads to functional inactivation. Here, we report that bacteriophage T3 modulates the metabolism of the host E. coli cells by recruiting a similar strategy -- silencing a central metabolic enzyme by subjecting it to phage-mediated polymerization. This observation points to an intriguing possibility that virus-induced polymerization of the host metabolic enzymes might be a common mechanism implemented by viruses to metabolically reprogram and subdue infected cells.",

    "abstract": "Coevolution between bacteriophage (or phage) and their bacterial host is thought to be key for the coexistence of these antagonists. Recent studies have revealed the major role of mobile genetic elements in the emergence of phage resistant hosts but how phage escape these defenses in the wild remained to be explored. Here we show a striking parallel in phage evolving counter defenses to host defenses in natural population. We established a large collection of phages and their bacterial hosts and we explored the genetic structure of their interaction. We find that clearly delineated genomic clusters of phage are specific for distinct clades within a bacterial species, Vibrio crassostreae, yet while all phages can adsorb, only a subset of hosts are killed due to intracellular defense mechanisms. Host genomes contain multiple mobile defense genes and susceptibility to phage is negatively correlated with genome size. Phages also display extensive gene content variation, but their genome size remains conserved. We show that this gene content variation in hosts and phage is due to rapid turnover of genes involved in defense and escape, and that by exchanging anti-defense genes, phages irreversibly switch host. This could be indicative of co-evolution following the matching-allele-model of specificity and the spatial and temporal variability of phage infectivity further suggests that negative-frequency dependent selection drives phage-vibrio coevolutionary dynamics. We propose a \"pan-escape system\" that can be shared among phages by homologous recombination within a population that infects a bacterial host.",

    "abstract": "The 2019 outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally with high morbidity and mortality. Co-circulating seasonal influenza has greatly diminished recently, but expected to return with novel strains emerging, thus requiring annual strain adjustments. We have developed a recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) quadrivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine (qNIV) produced using an established recombinant insect cell expression system to produce nanoparticles. Influenza qNIV adjuvanted with Matrix-M was well-tolerated and induced robust antibody and cellular responses, notably against both homologous and drifted A/H3N2 viruses in Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials. We also developed a full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine which is stable in the prefusion conformation (NVX-CoV2373) using the same platform technology. In phase 3 clinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and protective against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant. Here we describe the immunogenicity and efficacy of a combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccine (qNIV/CoV2373) in ferret and hamster models. The combination qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine produces high titer influenza hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) and neutralizing antibodies against influenza A and B strains. The combination vaccine also elicited antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor. Significantly, hamsters immunized with qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected against weight loss and were free of replicating SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower respiratory tract with no evidence of viral pneumonia. This study supports evaluation of qNIV/CoV2373 combination vaccine as a preventive measure for seasonal influenza and CoVID-19.\n\nHighlightsO_LICombination qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine induced protective hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) responses to seasonal influenza A and B unchanged when formulated with recombinant spike.\nC_LIO_LICombination qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine maintained clinical and virologic protection against experimental challenge with SARS-CoV-2.\nC_LIO_LICombination qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine showed no clinical or histological sign of enhanced disease following experimental challenge with SARS-CoV-2.\nC_LIO_LICombination qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitopes common between US-WA and B.1.352 variant.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "To determine the role of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) ICP22 in viral transcription we performed precise nuclear run-on followed by deep sequencing (PRO-Seq) to map active RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on viral and cellular genomes in cells infected with a viral mutant lacking the entire ICP22-encoding 22 (US1/US1.5) gene, or a virus derived from the deletion mutant but bearing a restored 22 gene. At 3 hours post infection (hpi), the lack of ICP22 reduced Pol II activity at promoter proximal pause (PPP) sites on the 4 and 0 genes, and on the bodies of the 4, 0, and 27 genes. The decreased activity at 0 and 4 PPP sites at 3 hpi was distinguishable from effects caused by treatment with a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor. The ICP22 mutant had multiple defects at 6 hpi, including lower viral DNA replication and reduced Pol II activity on viral genes of all temporal classes. Between 3 and 6 hpi the repair virus, like wild type HSV-1, redirected Pol II activity from cellular genes to viral genes. In the absence of ICP22, the opposite occurred inasmuch as Pol II activity returned from the viral genome to cellular genes. These data indicate that ICP22 acts to increase Pol II activity at the PPP sites and bodies of viral immediate early genes at early times post infection, and directly or indirectly helps retain Pol II activity on the viral genome later in infection.\n\nImportanceUsing a mutant lacking the full US1/US1.5 gene, this study establishes a role for ICP22 in increasing Pol II activity on viral immediate early genes by enhancing transcription initiation and/or elongation onto immediate early gene bodies. Unlike truncation mutants studied previously, the full null virus is unable to sustain DNA replication and Pol II activity on late genes, precluding later stages of the viral life cycle.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has posed a global threat to human lives and economics. One of the best ways to determine protection against the infection is to quantify the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Multiple assays have been developed to validate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; most of them utilized lentiviral or vesicular stomatitis virus-based particles pseudotyped with the spike (S) protein, making them safe and acceptable to work with in many labs. However, these systems are only capable of measuring infection with purified particles. This study has developed a pseudoviral assay with replication-dependent reporter vectors that can accurately quantify the level of infection directly from the virus producing cell to the permissive target cell. Comparative analysis of cell-free and cell-to-cell infection revealed that the neutralizing activity of convalescent sera was more than tenfold lower in cell cocultures than in the cell-free mode of infection. As the pseudoviral system could not properly model the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, similar experiments were performed with replication-competent coronavirus, which detected nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera. Based on available studies, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection, for which the mechanisms are largely unknown. The findings suggest that this route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be of great importance for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.\n\nImportanceImmune surveillance of viral or bacterial infections is largely mediated by neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are produced after vaccination or infection, but their titers only partly reflect the degree of protection against infection. To identify protective antibodies, a neutralization test with replicating viruses or pseudoviruses (PVs) is required. This study developed lentiviral-based PV neutralization assays that, unlike similar systems reported earlier, enable quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell cocultures. Using both PVs and replication-competent virus, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell infection is considerably more resistant to serum neutralization than infection with purified viral particles. The tests are easy to set up in many labs, and are believed to be more informative for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 collective immunity or entry inhibitor screening.",

    "abstract": "Thiolutin is a well-known and long-used natural product transcription inhibitor with an unresolved mode of action. Recent studies have identified Zn2+-chelation activity for both thiolutin and the related dithiolopyrrolone holomycin, with direct inhibition of RNA polymerases ruled out as a mode of action. However, negative results for direct transcription inhibition of RNA polymerases in recent studies are contradicted by previously observed thiolutin inhibition of extract fractions containing yeast RNA Polymerases I, II, and III. Here, we present chemical genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the mode of action of thiolutin. We identify diverse classes of mutant that alter sensitivity to thiolutin. We functionally dissect the multidrug resistance and thioredoxin pathways controlling thiolutin sensitivity. We provide genetic evidence that thiolutin causes oxidation of thioredoxins in vivo and suggest that thiolutin both induces oxidative stress and alters Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ homeostasis in vivo, recapitulating previously observed thiolutin interactions with Zn2+. Finally, our results resolve contradictory biochemical results for thiolutin inhibition of transcription by direct demonstration of thiolutin inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in vitro. Inhibitory activity requires both appropriate reduction of thiolutin and the presence of Mn2+. Thio/Mn2+ inhibition is abrogated when template DNA is pre-bound to Pol II or when excess DTT is present, and renders Pol II pause prone in elongation if initiation is bypassed using a pre-formed Pol II elongation complex. Together, we propose that thiolutin directly inhibits Pol II transcription through a novel mechanism distinct from known transcription inhibitors.",

Here, we show that deletion of the nuclear-localized NAD+ synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-1 (NMNAT1) in the developing murine retina causes early and severe degeneration of photoreceptors and select inner retinal neurons via multiple distinct cell death pathways. This severe phenotype is associated with disruptions to retinal central carbon metabolism, purine nucleotide synthesis, and amino acid pathways. Furthermore, large-scale transcriptomics reveals dysregulation of a collection of photoreceptor and synapse-specific genes in NMNAT1 knockout retinas prior to detectable morphological or metabolic alterations. Collectively, our study reveals previously unrecognized complexity in NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration and suggests a yet-undescribed role for NMNAT1 in gene regulation during photoreceptor terminal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) selects transcription start sites (TSS) by a unidirectional scanning process. During scanning, a preinitiation complex (PIC) assembled at an upstream core promoter initiates at select positions within a window [~]40-120 basepairs downstream. Several lines of evidence indicate that Ssl2, the yeast homolog of XPB and an essential and conserved subunit of the general transcription factor (GTF) TFIIH, drives scanning through its DNA-dependent ATPase activity, therefore potentially controlling both scanning rate and scanning extent (processivity). To address questions of how Ssl2 functions in promoter scanning and interacts with other initiation activities, we leveraged distinct initiation-sensitive reporters to identify novel ssl2 alleles. These ssl2 alleles, many of which alter residues conserved from yeast to human, confer either upstream or downstream TSS shifts at the model promoter ADH1 and genome-wide. Specifically, tested ssl2 alleles alter TSS selection by increasing or narrowing the distribution of TSSs used at individual promoters. Genetic interactions of ssl2 alleles with other initiation factors are consistent with ssl2 allele classes functioning through increasing or decreasing scanning processivity but not necessarily scanning rate. These alleles underpin a residue interaction network that likely modulates Ssl2 activity and TFIIH function in promoter scanning. We propose that the outcome of promoter scanning is determined by two functional networks, the first being Pol II activity and factors that modulate it to determine initiation efficiency within a scanning window, and the second being Ssl2/TFIIH and factors that modulate scanning processivity to determine the width of the scanning widow.",

We compared the 668 RdRp sequences reported from India with the first reported RdRp sequence from Wuhan, China. Our data revealed that RdRp have acquired sixty mutations among Indian isolates. Our protein modelling study also revealed that several mutants including D833Y, A699S, Y149C and C464F can potentially alter stability and flexibility of RdRp. We also predicted the potential B cell epitopes contributed by RdRp and identified thirty-six linear continuous and twenty-five discontinuous epitopes. Among sixty RdRp mutants identified in this study, 40% of them localises in the B cell epitopes region. Altogether, this study highlights the need to identify and characterize the variations in RdRp to understand the impact of these mutations on SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Transdifferentiation, or direct cell reprogramming, is the direct conversion of one fully differentiated cell type into another. Whether core mechanisms are shared between different transdifferentiation events, which can occur naturally in presence or in absence of cell division, is unclear. Our lab has previously characterized the Y-to-PDA natural transdifferentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans, which occurs without cell division and requires orthologs of vertebrates reprogramming factors. In this study, focusing on another transdifferentiation process, the K rectal cell-to-DVB GABAergic neuron, we report that the Y-to-PDA reprogramming factor SEM-4/SALL, SOX-2, CEH-6/POU are required for K-to-DVB transdifferentiation to allow the erasure of the rectal identity. In addition, cell division is necessary but not sufficient for this transdifferentiation event while the Wnt signaling plays distinct functions during the process including the selection of the daughter cell with a different fate, loss of the rectal identity and imposition of the specific neuronal subtype identity. We provide evidence that both the Wnt signaling and Y-to-PDA reprogramming factor SEM-4/SALL, SOX-2, CEH-6/POU act in parallel for the rectal identity erasure. Our results further support a model where antagonistic activities of SOX-2 and POP-1 and decreasing SOX-2 levels over time provide a timer for the acquisition of the final identity. In addition, the different levels of SOX-2 provide a mechanism for the integration of Wnt opposite dedifferentiation and re-differentiation functions during K-to-DVB transdifferentiation.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila establishes a replication vacuole by translocating hundreds of protein effectors through a type IV secretion system (T4SS). Among these translocated effectors are members of the Sde family, which catalyze phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination (pR-Ub) of host targets. Previous work has posited that Sde proteins solely target serine (Ser) residues within acceptor protein substrates. We show here that SdeC-mediated pR-Ub modification results from a stepwise reaction that also modifies tyrosine (Tyr) residues. Unexpectedly, the presence of an HA tag on Ub resulted in poly-pR-ubiquitination, consistent with the HA tag acting as an acceptor target. Interrogation of phosphoribosyl-linked HA-Ub revealed that Tyr4 was the preferred targeted residue, based on LC-MS/MS analysis of the crosslinked product. Further analysis using synthetic HA variants revealed promiscuous modification of Tyr, as crosslinking was prevented only by constructing a triple mutant in which all three Tyr within the HA sequence were substituted with Phe. Although previous work has indicated that Ser is the sole acceptor residue, we found no evidence of Ser preference over Tyr using Tyr->Ser replacement mutants. This work demonstrates that pR-ubiquitination by the Sde family is not limited to Ser-modification as previously proposed, and broadens the potential sites targeted by this family.",

Intriguingly, even though each enzyme can independently methylate H3K9, the predominant active form in vivo is a heterodimer of G9a and GLP. How dimerization influences the central H3K9 methyl binding (\"reading\") and deposition (\"writing\") activity of G9a and GLP, and why heterodimerization is essential in vivo remains opaque. Here, we examine the H3K9me \"reading\" and \"writing\" activities of defined, recombinantly produced homo- and heterodimers of G9a and GLP. We find that both reading and writing are significantly enhanced in the heterodimer. Compared to the homodimers, the heterodimer has higher recognition of H3K9me2, and a striking [~] 10-fold increased turnover rate for nucleosomal substrates under multiple turnover conditions, which is not evident on histone tail peptide substrates. Crosslinking Mass Spectrometry suggests that differences between the homodimers and the unique activity of the heterodimer may be encoded in altered ground state conformations, as each dimer displays different domain contacts. Our results indicate that heterodimerization may be required to relieve autoinhibition of H3K9me reading and chromatin methylation evident in G9a and GLP homodimers. Relieving this inhibition may be particularly important in early differentiation when large tracts of H3K9me2 are deposited by G9a-GLP, which may require a more active form of the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "The development of phenotypic models of Parkinsons disease (PD) has enabled screening and identification of phenotypically active small molecules that restore complex biological pathways affected by PD toxicity. While these phenotypic screening platforms are powerful, they do not inherently enable direct identification of the cellular targets of promising lead compounds. To overcome this, chemoproteomic platforms like Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) and Stability of Proteins from Rates of Oxidation (SPROX) can be implemented to reveal protein targets of biologically active small molecules. Here we utilize both of these chemoproteomic strategies to identify targets of an N-arylbenzdiimidazole compound, NAB2, which was previously identified for its ability to restore viability in cellular models of PD-associated -synuclein toxicity. The combined results from our TPP and SPROX analyses of NAB2 and the proteins in a neuroblastoma-derived SHSY5Y cell lysate reveal a previously unrecognized protein target of NAB2. This newly recognized target, Rab1a, is a small GTPase that acts as a molecular switch to regulate ER-to-Golgi trafficking, a process that is disrupted by -synuclein toxicity and restored by NAB2 treatment. Further validation reveals that NAB2 binds to Rab1a with selectivity for its GDP-bound form and that NAB2 treatment phenocopies Rab1a overexpression in alleviation of -synuclein toxicity. Finally, we conduct a preliminary investigation into the relationship between Rab1a and the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4, a previously identified NAB2 target. Together, these efforts expand our understanding of the mechanism of NAB2 in the alleviation of -synuclein toxicity and reinforce the utility of chemoproteomic identification of the targets of phenotypically active small molecules that regulate complex biological pathways.",

We performed shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) and targeted next generation sequencing to investigate somatic mutations and copy number alterations. We compared results to 51 stage IIIC/IV HGSC patients from the BriTROC-1 study.\n\nResultsThere was no difference in median age between the early stage (median 61.3 years, range 40-84) and late stage (median 62.3 years, range 34-76) patients at diagnosis. TP53 mutations were near-universal (92% early stage, 100% late stage samples) and there were no significant differences in the rates of other somatic mutations, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, or focal copy number alterations between early- and late-stage cohorts. There were also no unique amplifications or deletions in either cohort. However, median ploidy was greater in late stage (median 3.1) than early stage (median 2.0) samples. In addition, there were higher numbers of breakpoints per 10MB and per chromosome arm and higher absolute copy number in late stage than early stage cohorts; early stage samples had longer segment length. Overall copy number signature exposures were significantly different between early and late stage samples with greater signature 3 exposure in early stage and greater signature 4 in late stage. Both simplex plot and unsupervised hierarchical clustering suggested that a subset of late stage samples retain early stage appearances with high signature 3 and co-clustering with the early stage samples\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that there are no unique mutations or focal copy number alterations in early stage HGSC. However, whole genome duplication is significantly more common in late-stage disease, suggesting evolution during disease progression. However, a subset of late stage HGSC retains early-stage features, which are associated with improved overall survival.",

    "abstract": "Ooids (subspherical particles with a laminated cortex growing around a nucleus) are ubiquitous in the geological record since the Archean and have been widely studied for more than two centuries. However, various questions about them remain open, particularly about the role of microbial communities and organic matter in their formation and development. Although ooids typically occur rolling around in agitated waters, here we describe for the first time aragonite ooids forming statically within microbial mats from hypersaline ponds of Kiritimati (Kiribati, central Pacific). Subspherical particles had been previously observed in these mats and classified as spherulites, but they grow around autochthonous micritic nuclei, and many of them have laminated cortices, with alternating radial fibrous laminae and micritic laminae. Thus, they are compatible with the definition of  ooid and are in fact identical to many modern and fossil examples. Kiritimati ooids are more abundant and developed in some ponds and in some particular layers of the microbial mats, which has led to the discussion and interpretation of their formation processes as product of mat evolution, through a combination of organic and environmental factors. Radial fibrous laminae are formed during periods of increased supersaturation, either by metabolic or environmental processes. Micritic laminae are formed in closer association with the mat exopolymer (EPS) matrix, probably during periods of lower supersaturation and/or stronger EPS degradation. Therefore, this study represents a step forward in the understanding of ooid development as influenced by microbial communities, providing a useful analogue for explaining similar fossil ooids.",

ProLung-budesonide enables the sustained, low dose administration of budesonide within a delivery vehicle similar to lung surfactant. ProLung-budesonide may offer anti-inflammatory and protective effects to the lung in COVID-19, yet its effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication is unknown.\n\nObjectiveTo determine the efficacy of ProLung-budesonide against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, evaluate its ability to decrease inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness in an animal model of lung inflammation.\n\nMethodsSARS-CoV-2-infected Vero 76 cells were treated with ProLung-budesonide ([0.03- 100 g/ml]) for 3 days, and virus yield in the supernatant was measured. Ovalbumin-sensitized C57BL/6 mice received aerosolized (a) ProLung-budesonide weekly, (b) only budesonide, either daily or weekly, or (c) weekly empty ProLung-carrier (without budesonide). All treatment groups were compared to sensitized untreated, or normal mice using histopathologic examination, electron microscopy (EM), airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to Methacholine (Mch) challenge, and eosinophil peroxidase activity (EPO) measurements in bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL).\n\nResultsProLung-budesonide showed significant inhibition on viral replication of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with the selectivity index (SI) value > 24.

ProLung-budesonide localized in type II pneumocytes, and was the only group to significantly decrease AHR, and EPO in BAL with Mch challenge\n\nConclusionsProLung-budesonide significantly inhibited viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. It localized into type II pneumocytes, decreased lung inflammation, AHR and EPO activity with Mch challenge. This novel drug formulation may offer a potential inhalational treatment for COVID-19.",

While there is considerable effort in the liquid biopsy field to determine disease tissue-of-origin, pathophysiology occurs at the cellular level. Here, we describe two approaches to identify cell type contributions to cfRNA. First we used Tabula Sapiens, a transcriptomic cell atlas of the human body to computationally deconvolve the cell-free transcriptome into a sum of cell type specific transcriptomes, thus revealing the spectrum of cell types readily detectable in the blood. Second, we used individual tissue transcriptomic cell atlases in combination with the Human Protein Atlas RNA consensus dataset to create cell type signature scores which can be used to infer the implicated cell types from cfRNA for a variety of diseases. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cfRNA reflects cellular contributions in health and disease from diverse cell types, potentially enabling determination of pathophysiological changes of many cell types from a single blood test.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in {beta}-catenin can inhibit degradation of {beta}-catenin by preventing phosphorylation of its degron. Degron phosphorylation is mediated by the Axin scaffold, Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3). We studied an oncogenic form of {beta}-catenin with a deletion of serine 45 (S45), a site that is phosphorylated by the kinase CK1. When the S45 site is phosphorylated, it promotes the GSK3-mediated phosphorylations of the {beta}-catenin degron. Deletion of S45 would be expected to prevent GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the mutant protein and thus block degradation. We found that the S45 mutant was still phosphorylatable by GSK3, and its expression increased the concentration of Axin, restoring the rate of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation to levels comparable to those observed for the wild-type {beta}-catenin. We conclude that there is one core mechanism for creating the phosphodegron for both primed and unprimed {beta}-catenin, which involves the generation of an Axin-GSK3 complex.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEUnderstanding how the Wnt pathway responds to mutations in {beta}-catenin phosphodegron can reveal important properties of the pathway in normal and cancer cells and is valuable for the design of more effective therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.617 in India has been associated with a surge in the number of daily infections. This variant has combination of specific mutations L452R, E484Q and P681R reported to possibly enhance the transmissibility with likelihood of escaping the immunity. We investigated the viral load and pathogenic potential of B.1.617.1 in Syrian golden hamsters.\n\nMethodsTwo groups of Syrian golden hamsters (9 each) were inoculated intranasally with SARS CoV-2 isolates, B.1 (D614G) and B.1.617.1 respectively. The animals were monitored daily for the clinical signs and body weight. The necropsy of three hamsters each was performed on 3, 5- and 7-days post-infection (DPI). Throat swab (TS), nasal wash (NW) and organ samples (lungs, nasal turbinate, trachea) were collected and screened using SARS-CoV-2 specific Real-time RT-PCR.\n\nResultsThe hamsters infected with B.1.617.1 demonstrated increased body weight loss compared to B.1 variant. The highest viral load was observed in nasal turbinate and lung specimens of animals infected with B.1.167.1 on 3 DPI. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) and IgG response in hamsters of both the groups were observed from 5 and 7 DPI respectively. However, higher neutralizing antibody titers were observed against B.1.167.1. Gross pathology showed pronounced lung lesions and hemorrhage with B.1.671 compared to B.1.\n\nConclusionsB.1617.1 and B.1 variant varied greatly in their infectiousness, pathogenesis in hamster model. This study demonstrates higher pathogenicity in hamsters evident with reduced body weight, higher viral load in lungs and pronounced lung lesions as compared to B.1 variant.\n\nSummaryB.1.617.1 is the new SARS-CoV-2 lineage that emerged in India. Maximal body weight loss and higher viral load in hamsters infected with B.1.617.1. It caused pronounced lung lesions in hamsters compared to B.1 variant which demonstrates the pathogenic potential of B.1.617.1.",

    "abstract": "DNA partitioning CTPases of the ParB family mediate the segregation of bacterial chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids. They act as DNA-sliding clamps that are loaded at parS motifs in the centromeric region of target DNA molecules and then spread laterally to form large nucleoprotein complexes that serve as docking points for the DNA segregation machinery. Here, we identify conformational changes that underlie the CTP- and parS-dependent closure of ParB clamps. Moreover, we solve crystal structures of ParB in the pre- and post-hydrolysis state and provide insights into the catalytic mechanism underlying nucleotide hydrolysis. The characterization of CTPase-deficient ParB variants reveals that CTP hydrolysis serves as a timing mechanism to control the sliding time of ParB. Hyperstable clamps are trapped on the DNA, leading to excessing spreading and severe chromosome segregation defects in vivo. These findings clarify the role of the ParB CTPase cycle in partition complex dynamics and function and thus complete our understanding of this prototypic CTP-dependent molecular switch.",

    "abstract": "Production and use of proteins is under strong selection in microbes, but its unclear how proteome-level traits relate to ecological strategies. We identified and quantified proteomic traits of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes through an Antarctic phytoplankton bloom using in situ metaproteomics. To do this, we first used simulations, cultures, and bioinformatic methods to rigorously assess our inferences about various proteomic traits and use these assessments to provide several practical recommendations for researchers using metaproteomics. Different taxa, rather than different environmental conditions, formed distinct clusters based on their ribosomal and photosynthetic proteomic proportions, and we propose that these characteristics relate to ecological differences. We defined and used a proteomic proxy for regulatory cost, which showed that SAR11 had the lowest regulatory cost of any taxa we observed at our summertime Southern Ocean study site. Haptophytes had lower regulatory cost than diatoms, which may underpin haptophyte-to-diatom bloom progression in the Ross Sea. Using metaproteomics, we have quantified several proteomic traits (ribosomal and photosynthetic proteomic proportions, regulatory cost) in eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa, which can then be incorporated into trait-based models of microbial communities that reflect resource allocation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). It is currently unclear whether previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection with VOCs. Here, we show that low dose aerosol exposure to hCoV-19/human/USA/WA-CDC-WA1/2020 (WA1, lineage A), resulted in a productive mild infection. In contrast, low dose of SARS-CoV-2 via fomites did not result in productive infection in the majority of exposed hamsters and these animals remained non-seroconverted. After recovery, hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19/South African/KRISP-K005325/2020 (VOC B.1.351) via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for 3 days. They had little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast, shedding, weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication was observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit virus to naive sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titers against lineage A, but also titers against B.1.351. Our results confirm that aerosol exposure is a more efficient infection route than fomite exposure. Furthermore, initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351 but prevents disease and onward transmission. These data suggest that previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces partial protective immunity. The reinfection generated a broadly neutralizing humoral response capable of effectively neutralizing B.1.351 while maintaining its ability to neutralize the virus to which the initial response was directed against.",

Inclusion of these exons affects fibril formation, fibrosis, and inflammation. To define upstream regulators of alternative splicing in FN, we have developed an in vitro flow-cytometry based assay, using RNA-binding probes to determine alternative exon inclusion level in aortic endothelial cells. This approach allows us to detect exon inclusion in the primary transcripts themselves, rather than in surrogate splicing reporters. We validated this assay in cells with and without FN-EIIIA and -EIIIB expression. In a small-scale CRISPR KO screen of candidate regulatory splice factors, we successfully detected known regulators of EIIIA and EIIIB splicing, and detected several novel regulators. Finally, we show the potential in this approach to broadly interrogate upstream signaling pathways in aortic endothelial cells with a genome-wide CRISPR-KO screen, implicating the TNFalpha and RIG-I-like signaling pathways and genes involved in the regulation of fibrotic responses. Thus, we provide a novel means to screen the regulation of splicing of endogenous transcripts, and predict novel pathways in the regulation of FN-EIIIA inclusion.",

    "abstract": "Male sex determination in mammals is initiated by SRY, a Y-encoded architectural transcription factor. The protein contains a high-mobility-group (HMG) box that mediates sequence-specific DNA bending. Mutations in SRY causing XY gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome) cluster in the box. Although such mutations usually arise de novo in spermatogenesis, some are inherited: male development occurs in one genetic background (the father) but not another (the sterile XY daughter). Here, we compare de novo and inherited mutations at an invariant Tyr adjoining the motifs basic tail (consensus position 72; Y127C and Y127F in intact SRY). Crystal structures of homologous SOX-DNA complexes suggest that the wild-type side chains para-OH group anchors a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the DNA backbone. In an embryonic gonadal cell line, Y127C (de novo) led to accelerated proteasomal proteolysis and blocked transcriptional activity; activity remained low on rescue of expression by chemical proteasome inhibition. Y127F (inherited) preserved substantial transcriptional activity: 91({+/-}11)% on SRY overexpression and 65({+/-}17)% at physiological expression. Control studies indicated no change in protein lifetime or nuclear localization. Only subtle biophysical perturbations were observed in vitro. Although though inherited variants specific DNA affinity was only twofold lower than wild type, stopped-flow kinetic analysis revealed a sevenfold decrease in lifetime of the complex. Time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (using a 15-base pair DNA site) demonstrated native mean DNA bending but with a slightly widened distribution of end-to-end DNA distances. Our findings highlight the contribution of a single water-mediated hydrogen bond to robustness of a genetic switch in human development.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids are recognized as signals by various receptors in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. However, no common mechanism for amino acid recognition is currently known. Here we show that a subclass of a ubiquitous extracellular domain dCache_1 contains a simple amino acid recognition motif, and it is found throughout the Tree of Life. In bacteria, this motif exclusively binds amino acids, including GABA, and it is present in all major receptor types. In humans, this motif is found in 2{delta} subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels that are implicated in neuropathic pain and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings suggest that GABA-derived drugs bind to the same motif in human 2{delta} subunits that binds natural GABA ligands in bacterial chemoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Various bioactive food compounds may confer health and longevity benefits, possibly through altering or preserving the human epigenome. While bioactive food compounds are widely being marketed as  improving health and longevity by counteracting harmful effects of poor nutrition and lifestyle, claimed effects are often not adequately documented. Using the honey bee (Apis mellifera) as a model species, we here employed a multi-step screening approach to investigate seven compounds for effects on lifespan and DNA methylation using ELISA and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). A positive longevity effect was detected for valproic acid, isovaleric acid, and cyanocobalamin. For curcumin, we found that lifespan shortening caused by ethanol intake, was restored when curcumin and ethanol were co-administered. Furthermore, we identified region specific DNA methylation changes as a result of ethanol intake. Ethanol specific changes in DNA methylation were fully or partially blocked in honey bees receiving ethanol and curcumin together. Ethanol-affected and curcumin-blocked differentially methylated regions covered genes involved in fertility, temperature regulation and tubulin transport. Our results demonstrate fundamental negative effects of low dose ethanol consumption on lifespan and associated DNA methylation changes and present a proof-of-principle on how longevity and DNA methylation changes can be negated by the bioactive food component curcumin. Our findings provide a fundament for further studies of curcumin in mice and humans and offer an avenue to explore regarding possible prevention of health issues related to alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is a P-type ATPase embedded in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. For each enzymatic cycle, SERCA transports 2 Ca2+ ions per ATP hydrolyzed in exchange for 2 to 3 H+ ions. SERCA is responsible for approximately 70% of Ca2+ transport and plays a central role in muscle relaxation. SERCAs function is regulated by endogenous regulins, single-pass membrane proteins that bind the ATPase within the membrane. While most of the regulins, such as phospholamban and sarcolipin, inhibit SERCAs activity, a newly discovered protein DWarf Open Reading Frame (DWORF) has a unique activating effect. DWORF is a 3.8 kDa bitopic membrane protein expressed in cardiac muscle. In this work, we determine the structure, topology, and per-residue lipid interactions of DWORF in lipid bilayers using a combination of high-resolution oriented sample solid-state NMR (OS-ssNMR) spectroscopy and refinement by replica-averaged orientationally-restrained molecular dynamics (RAOR-MD). We found that DWORFs structural topology consists of a dynamic N-terminal domain, an amphipathic juxtamembrane helix that crosses the lipid groups at an angle of 64{degrees} and a transmembrane (TM) C-terminal helix with an angle of 32{degrees}. A kink induced by Pro15, unique to DWORF, separated the two helical domains. A single Pro15Ala mutant significantly decreases the kink and eliminates DWORFs activating effect on SERCA. Overall, our findings directly link DWORFs structural topology to its unique activating effect on SERCA.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes acute and lasting impacts on the brain, driving pathology along anatomical, cellular, and behavioral dimensions. Rodent models offer the opportunity to study TBI in a controlled setting, and enable analysis of the temporal progression that occurs from injury to recovery. We applied transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis, characterize gene expression and in ipsilateral hippocampus at 1 and 14 days following moderate lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury. This approach enabled us to identify differential gene expression (DEG) modules with distinct expression trajectories across the two time points. The major DEG modules represented genes that were up- or downregulated acutely, but largely recovered by 14 days. As expected, DEG modules with acute upregulation were associated with cell death and astrocytosis. Interestingly, acutely downregulated DEGs related to neurotransmission mostly recovered by two weeks. Upregulated DEG modules related to inflammation were not necessarily elevated acutely, but were strongly upregulated after two weeks. We identified a smaller DEG module with delayed downregulation at 14 days including genes related to cholesterol metabolism and amyloid beta clearance. Finally, differential expression was paralleled by changes in H3K4me3 at the promoters of differentially expressed genes at one day following TBI. Following TBI, changes in cell viability, function and ultimately behavior are dynamic processes. Our results show how transcriptomics in the preclinical setting has the potential to identify biomarkers for injury severity and/or recovery, to identify potential therapeutic targets, and, in the future, to evaluate efficacy of an intervention beyond measures of cell death or spatial learning.",

Using an assay-guided approach, we found that out of the many different sensory cells in the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG), DIMTA selectively affected low-threshold cold thermosensors. Whole-cell electrophysiology experiments using DRG cells, channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and human cell lines revealed that DIMTA blocks several potassium channels, reducing the magnitude of the afterhyperpolarization and increasing the baseline [Ca2+]i of low-threshold cold thermosensors. When injected into mice, DIMTA increased the threshold of cold sensation by >3 oC. DIMTA may thus serve as a lead in the further design of compounds that inhibit problems in the cold-sensory system, such as cold allodynia and other neuropathic pain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Most efforts to understand the biology of Vibrio cholerae have focused on a single group, the pandemic-generating lineage harbouring the strains responsible for all known cholera pandemics. Consequently, little is known about the diversity of this species in its native aquatic environment. To understand the differences in the V. cholerae populations inhabiting in regions with varying history of cholera cases and how that might influence the abundance of pandemic strains, a comparative analysis of population composition was performed. Little overlap was found in lineage compositions between those in Dhaka (cholera endemic) located in the Ganges delta, and of Falmouth (no known history of cholera), a small coastal town on the US East Coast. The most striking difference was the presence of a group of related lineages at high abundance in Dhaka which was completely absent from Falmouth. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that these lineages form a cluster at the base of the phylogeny of V. cholerae species, sufficiently differentiated genetically and phenotypically to form a novel species. Strains from this species have been anecdotally isolated from around the world and were isolated as early as 1916 from a British soldier in Egypt suffering from choleraic diarrhoea. In 1935 Gardner and Venkatraman unofficially referred to a member of this group as Vibrio paracholerae. In recognition of this earlier designation, we propose the name Vibrio paracholerae, sp. nov. for this bacterium. Genomic analysis suggests a link with human populations for this novel species and substantial interaction with its better-known sister species.\n\nImportanceCholera continues to remain a major public health threat around the globe. Understanding the ecology, evolution and environmental adaptation of the causative agent Vibrio cholerae and tracking the emergence of novel lineages with pathogenic potential are essential to combat the problem. In this study, we investigated the population dynamics of Vibrio cholerae in an inland locality which is known as endemic for cholera and compared with that of a cholera free coastal location. We found the consistent presence of the pandemic generating V. cholerae in cholera-endemic Dhaka and an exclusive presence of a lineage phylogenetically distinct from other V. cholerae. Our study suggests that this lineage represents a novel species having pathogenic potential and a human link to its environmental abundance. The possible association with human population, co-existence and interaction with toxigenic V. cholerae in the natural environment make this potential human pathogen an important subject for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosomatids are a diverse family of protozoan parasites, some of which cause devastating human and livestock diseases. There are two distinct infection life-cycles in trypanosomatids; some species complete their entire life-cycle in a single host (monoxenous) while others infect two hosts (dixenous). Dixenous trypanosomatids are mostly vectored by insects, and the human trypanosomatid diseases are caused mainly by vectored parasites. While infection prevalence has been described for subsets of hosts and trypanosomatids, little is known about whether monoxenous and dixenous trypanosomatids differ in infection prevalence. Here, we use meta-analyses to synthesise all published evidence of trypanosomatid infection prevalence for the last two decades, encompassing 931 unique host-trypansomatid systems. In examining 581 studies that describe infection prevalence, we find, strikingly, that monoxenous species are two-fold more prevalent than dixenous species across all hosts. We also find that dixenous trypanosomatids have significantly lower infection prevalence in insects than their non-insect hosts. Within monoxenous trypanosomatids, genera infecting bees are most prevalent and infection prevalence does not vary between wild and managed bees. To our knowledge, these results reveal for the first time, a fundamental difference in infection prevalence according to host specificity where vectored species suffer from lower infection prevalence as a result of a  jack of all trades, master of none style trade-off between the vector and subsequent hosts.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-borne infectious diseases cause wide-spread loss of life and livelihood often in low-income settings. However, control of mosquito-vectored viral diseases such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) remains challenging. Here we use an existing feature of the insect immune system to effectively vaccinate Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes against WNV infection. We find that priming mosquitoes by exposure to inactivated WNV reduces their likelihood of developing transmissible infections of WNV after live infection. We used RNA sequencing to identify gene expression in response to WNV and JEV infection, and the role of prior priming exposure on constitutive and induced expression on infection. Infection with either Flavivirus causes broad suppression of gene expression. WNV and JEV infection resulted in suppression of different suites of genes with notable immune genes, such as antimicrobial peptides, being strongly suppressed on WNV infection. We hypothesise that the increased resistance to WNV infection seen in primed mosquitoes may be the result of priming nullifying the immune suppression found in non-primed WNV-fed mosquitoes, potentially through greater expression of mRNA regulatory genes such as cap-binding proteins in primed mosquitoes.\n\nAuthor summaryMosquitoes vector many devastating infectious diseases. Two such vectored viral diseases are West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Control of these diseases remains challenging, and no vaccine exists for WNV. Here, we tested whether we could instead vaccinate the mosquitoes against WNV. By injecting mosquitoes with dead WNV we found that we could reduce the number of infected mosquitoes by half. We then used whole-genome RNA sequencing to identify which genes are transcribed, which will help us understand genes that are important for this form of insect immune priming, and for responses to normal WNV and JEV infection. We found that WNV suppresses the expression of many immune genes but these genes are expressed normally in vaccinated mosquitoes. Our findings expand our understanding of mosquito infection with these viruses but also demonstrate how prior exposure to a disease can produce lasting protection.",

    "abstract": "Graph representations are traditionally used to represent protein structures in sequence design protocols where the folding pattern is known. This infrequently extends to machine learning projects: existing graph convolution algorithms have shortcomings when representing protein environments. One reason for this is the lack of emphasis on edge attributes during massage-passing operations. Another reason is the traditionally shallow nature of graph neural network architectures. Here we introduce an improved message-passing operation that is better equipped to model local kinematics problems such as protein design. Our approach, XENet, pays special attention to both incoming and outgoing edge attributes.\n\nWe compare XENet against existing graph convolutions in an attempt to decrease rotamer sample counts in Rosettas rotamer substitution protocol. This use case is motivating because it allows larger protein design problems to fit onto near-term quantum computers. XENet outperformed competing models while also displaying a greater tolerance for deeper architectures. We found that XENet was able to decrease rotamer counts by 40% without loss in quality. This decreased the problem size of our use case by more than a factor of 3. Additionally, XENet displayed an ability to handle deeper architectures than competing convolutions.\n\nAuthor summaryGraphs data structures are ubiquitous in the field of protein design and are at the core of the recent advances in artificial intelligence brought forth by graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs have led to some impressive results in modeling protein interactions, but are not as common as other tensor representations.\n\nMost GNN architectures tend to put little to no emphasis on the information stored on edges; however, protein modeling tools often use edges to represent vital geometric relationships about residue pair interactions. In this paper, we show that a more advanced processing of edge attributes can lead to considerable benefits when modeling chemical data.\n\nWe introduce XENet, a new member of the GNN family that is shown to have improved ability to model protein residue environments based on chemical and geometric data. We use XENet to intelligently simplify the optimization problem that is solved when designing proteins. This task is important to us and others because it allows larger proteins to be designed on near-term quantum computers. We show that XENet is able to train on our protein modeling data better than existing methods, successfully resulting in a dramatic decrease in protein design sample space with no loss in quality.",

A full understanding is required to understand the entire itinerary and functional consequences of the occurrence of insulin resistance to develop a potent drug in diabetes management. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of known phytochemical constituents of Tinospora crispa and its interaction with insulin resistant target proteins by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The insulin sensitizer activities of Tinospora crispa may be associated with the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory pathway and the activation of insulin signaling. Tinoscorside A, Makisterone C, Borapetoside A and B, and {beta} sitosterol consider the main phytoconstituents of Tinospora crispa by its binding with active sites of main protein targets of insulin resistance potential therapy. In conclusion, Tinospora crispa was one of the promising therapeutic agent in type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Regulation in glucose homeostasis, adipolysis, cell proliferation, and antiapoptosis may be the critical mechanism of Tinospora crispa as an insulin sensitizer.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is a major global health problem and is still among the top 10 causes of death. The increasing rate of drug resistance to infectious agents has provoked an urgent need to discover novel anti-tuberculosis agents with novel modes of action. In this study, small molecule inhibitors of the proteins encoded by the drug resistant genes, i.e., katG, gyrA, pncA and rpoB of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), were identified using computational methods. In the ligand base pharmacophore, an already reported four ligands for the four proteins encoded by the resistant genes of M. tuberculosis were selected for the generation of pharmacophores. The validated pharmacophores model of all the four proteins, generated on the basis of ligand base, were selected for further screening of ZINC drug like database. As screening results 486 structurally diverse hits for katG, 542 for PncA, 112 for rpoB and 365 for gyrA were mapped and filtered via Lipinskis rule of five. Finally, on the basis of docking score and binding interactions, ten small molecules were selected for each protein as novel inhibitors. These selected novel inhibitors have significant interaction with the active site of the protein and a strong possibility to act as an additional starting opinion in the development of new and potential inhibitors. The result indicates that novel inhibitors could be a promising lead compound and be effective in treating sensitive as well as multi drug resistant tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Tumour progression is an evolutionary process in which different clones evolve over time, leading to intra-tumour heterogeneity. Interactions between clones can affect tumour evolution and hence disease progression and treatment outcome. Pairs of mutations that are overrepresented in a clonally exclusive fashion over a cohort of patient samples may be suggestive of a synergistic effect between the different clones carrying these mutations. We therefore developed a novel statistical test, called GeneAccord, to identify such gene pairs that are altered in distinct subclones of the same tumour. We analysed our test for calibration and power. By comparing its performance to baseline methods, we demonstrate that to control type I errors, it is essential to account for the evolutionary dependencies among clones. In applying GeneAccord to the single-cell sequencing of a cohort of 123 acute myeloid leukaemia patients, we find 6 clonally exclusive and 2 clonally co-occurring gene pairs. The clonally exclusive pairs mostly involve genes of the key signalling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Protoceratids are an extinct family of endemic North American artiodactyls. The phylogenetic position of protoceratids in relation to camelids and ruminants has been contentious for over a century. The petrosal morphology of basal (Leptotragulus) and derived (Syndyoceras) protoceratids has suggested that protoceratids are closely related to ruminants, whereas a prior description of a disarticulated intermediate protoceratid petrosal (Protoceras celer) indicated that protoceratids were closely related to camelids. This contradictory evidence implied that there were several character reversals within the protoceratid lineage and brought into question the utility of basicranial characters in artiodactyl phylogenetics. Here, we provide descriptions of an additional P. celer petrosal. The descriptions are based on data produced by computed tomography scans, which allowed us to image the petrosal in situ in the skull. Our results indicate that the petrosal morphology of P. celer is similar to that of other protoceratids, implying that, contrary to previous evidence, petrosal morphology is conserved within the Protoceratidae.",

    "abstract": "Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) play a central role in regulating intracellular calcium signals in response to a variety of internal/external cues. Dysregulation of IP3R signaling is the underlying cause for numerous pathological conditions. It is also well established that the activity of IP3Rs is governed by several post-translational modifications including phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). However, the long-term effects of PKA activation on expression of IP3R sub-types, remains largely unexplored. In this report, we investigate the effect of chronic activation of PKA on expression of IP3R sub-types. We demonstrate that expression of IP3R1 is augmented upon prolonged activation of PKA or upon ectopic over-expression of CREB but does not alter IP3R2 and IP3R3 sub-type abundance. Conversely, inhibition of PKA or blocking endogenous CREB diminished IP3R1 expression. We also demonstrate that agonist-induced Ca2+-release mediated by IP3R1 is significantly attenuated upon blocking endogenous CREB. Moreover, CREB by regulating the expression of KRAS-induced actin-interacting protein (KRAP) ensures proper localization and licensing of IP3R1. Overall, we report a crucial role for CREB in governing both the expression and proper localization of IP3R1.\n\nSummary statementWe report a critical role of CREB in regulating the expression and proper localization of IP3R1. Agonist-induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+ puffs generated by IP3R1 are diminished upon blocking the function of endogenous CREB.",

At three sites, root fungal symbionts (=mycobionts) were isolated into pure cultures and identified using sequencing of the ITS rDNA gene.\nC_LIO_LIPosidoniomyces atricolor represented the most frequent mycobiont (56 isolates), closely followed by lulworthioid fungi (51).

The characteristic DSE root colonization similar to those occurring in terrestrial plants but not known from any other seagrass was found in all investigated P. oceanica individuals. The microscopic screening suggests that P. atricolor is indeed responsible for the observed DSE colonization.\nC_LIO_LIThis study extends the known range of P. atricolor and the DSE association characteristic for P. oceanica for southern Tyrrhenian Sea/Sicily.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma is among the leading causes of cancer related deaths globally due to its extreme difficulty to detect and treat. Recently, research focus has shifted to analyzing the microenvironment of pancreatic cancer to better understand its key molecular mechanisms. This microenvironment can be represented with a multi-scale model consisting of pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs), pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), as well as cytokines and growth factors which are responsible for intercellular communication between the PCCs and PSCs. We have built a stochastic Boolean network (BN) model, validated by literature and clinical data, in which we probed for intervention strategies that force this gene regulatory network (GRN) from a diseased state to a healthy state. To do so, we implemented methods from phenotype control theory to determine a procedure for regulating specific genes within the microenvironment. We identify target genes and molecules such that the application of their control drives the GRN to the desired state by suppression (or expression) and disruption of specific signaling pathways that will eventually lead to the eradication of the cancer cells. After applying well studied control methods such as stable motifs, feedback vertex set, and computational algebra, we discovered that each produces a different set of control targets that are not necessarily minimal nor unique. Yet, we were able to gain more insight about the performance of each process and the overlap of targets discovered. Nearly every control set contains cytokines, KRas, and HER2/neu which suggests they are key players in the systems dynamics. To that end, this model can be used to produce further insight into the complex biological system of pancreatic cancer with hopes of finding new potential targets.",

    "abstract": "Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is rapidly becoming the assay of choice to investigate chromatin-mediated gene regulation, largely because of low input requirements, a fast workflow, and the ability to interrogate the entire genome in an unbiased manner. Many studies using ATAC-seq use mammalian or human-derived tissues, and established protocols work well in these systems. However, ATAC-seq is not yet widely used in Drosophila. Vinegar flies present several advantages over mammalian systems that make them an excellent model for ATAC-seq studies, including abundant genetic tools that allow straightforward targeting, transgene expression, and genetic manipulation, and are not available in mammalian models. Because current ATAC-seq protocols are not optimized to use flies, we developed an optimized workflow that accounts for several complicating factors present in Drosophila. We examined parameters affecting nuclei isolation, including input size, freezing time, washing, and possible confounds from retinal pigments. Then, we optimized the enzymatic steps of library construction to account for the smaller Drosophila genome size. Finally, we used our optimized protocol to generate ATAC-seq libraries that meet ENCODE quality metrics. Our optimized protocol enables extensive ATAC-seq experiments in Drosophila, thereby leveraging the advantages of this powerful model system to understand chromatin-mediated gene regulation.",

Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) in 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice weighing 30-35 g. A full-thickness skin defect was treated by applying a dressing every 3 days. The mice were divided into three groups. Group 1 was administered an extract of red ginseng (10 mg/kg/d, n = 27, oral) and group 2 was administered Rg1 (10 mg/kg/d, n = 27, oral). Group 3 was a control group treated with phosphate-buffered saline (0.3 mL/kg/d, n = 27, oral). Red ginseng extract and Rg1 were orally administered to mice daily for 10 days following injury in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Both increased mRNA and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta}1 compared to controls. In addition, the wounds of animals in the Rg1 group were significantly smaller between days 7 and 10 (p < 0.05). VEGF and TGF-{beta}1 were not expressed in diabetic mice in the control group. Both red ginseng extract and Rg1 promoted the production of VEGF and TGF-{beta}1, which are important in wound healing. Our results for Rg1 suggest its potential to promote diabetic wound healing by stimulating the production or activity of VEGF and TGF-{beta}1 factors involved in the wound healing process.",

As a first step in the NMR studies of the protein, we report the 1H, 13C and 15N resonance backbone assignment as well as the C{beta} of the apo form of the full-lengthSARS-CoV-2 nsp1 including folded domain together with the flaking N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered fragments. The 19.8 kD protein was characterized by high-resolution NMR. Validation of assignment have been done by using two different mutants, H81P and K129E/D48E as well as by amino acid specific experiments. According to the obtained assignment, the secondary structure of the folded domain in solution was almost identical to its previously published X-ray structure, but some discrepancies have been detected. In the solution SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 exhibited disordered, flexible N- and C-termini with different dynamic characteristics. The short peptide in the beginning of the disordered C-terminal domain adopted two different conformations distinguishable on the NMR time scale. We propose that the disordered and folded nsp1 domains are not fully independent units but are rather involved in intramolecular interactions. Studies of the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 mutant in solution are on-going and will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions.",

Oxidative damage to telomeric DNA is proposed to trigger premature senescence by accelerating telomere shortening. Here we tested this model directly using a precision tool to produce the common base lesion 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) exclusively at telomeres in human fibroblast and epithelial cells. A single induction of telomeric 8oxoG is sufficient to trigger multiple hallmarks of p53-dependent senescence. Telomeric 8oxoG activates ATM and ATR signaling, and enriches for markers of telomere dysfunction in replicating, but not quiescent cells. Acute 8oxoG production fails to shorten telomeres, but rather generates fragile sites and delayed mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, indicative of impaired replication. Based on our results we propose that oxidative stress promotes rapid senescence by producing oxidative base lesions which drive replication-dependent telomere fragility and dysfunction in the absence of shortening and shelterin loss.",

    "abstract": "The Hippo pathway regulates the development and homeostasis of many tissues and in many species. It controls the activity of two paralogous transcriptional coactivators, YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ). Although previous studies have established that aberrant YAP/TAZ activation is detrimental to mammalian brain development, whether and how endogenous levels of YAP/TAZ activity regulate brain development remain unclear. Here, we show that during mammalian cortical development, YAP/TAZ are specifically expressed in apical neural progenitor cells known as radial glial cells (RGCs). The subcellular localization of YAP/TAZ undergoes dynamic changes as corticogenesis proceeds. YAP/TAZ are required for maintaining the proliferative potential and structural organization of RGCs, and their ablation during cortical development reduces the numbers of cortical projection neurons and causes the loss of ependymal cells, resulting in hydrocephaly. Transcriptomic analysis using sorted RGCs reveals gene expression changes in YAP/TAZ-depleted cells that correlate with mutant phenotypes. Thus, our study has uncovered essential functions of YAP/TAZ during mammalian brain development and revealed the transcriptional mechanism of their action.",

    "abstract": "Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) impacts human outdoor activity because of its aggressive biting behavior, and as a major vector of mosquito-borne diseases, it is also of public health importance. Although most mosquito species exhibit crepuscular activity by primarily host seeking at dawn and dusk, Ae. albopictus has been traditionally characterized as a diurnal or day-biting mosquito. With the global expansion and increased involvement of Ae. albopictus in mosquito-borne diseases, it is imperative to elucidate the diel activity of this species, particularly in newly invaded areas. Human sweep netting and carbon dioxide-baited rotator traps were used to evaluate the diel activity of Ae. albopictus in two study sites. Both trapping methods were used in New Jerseys Mercer County, USA (temperate urban), while only human sweep netting was used in Floridas Volusia County, USA (subtropical suburban). Human sweep netting was performed to determine adult mosquito activity at sunrise, solar noon, sunset, and lunar midnight. Because New Jersey is in a temperate area, diel activity was investigated during the early season (3-19 July), peak season (25 July-19 September), and late season (22 September-22 October). Aedes albopictus showed the highest activity during peak and late seasons at solar noon (P < 0.05). At sunrise and sunset during the peak season, Ae. albopictus activity was similar. Lunar midnight activity was significantly lower than sunrise and solar noon (P < 0.05) but was similar to that of sunset. In the late season, the highest activity was observed during solar noon while the least activity was observed during sunrise and lunar midnight (P<0.05). Rotator traps used in conjunction with the human sweep net technique exhibited similar results. Seasonal activity was not differentiated in Florida due to the consistent subtropical weather. The highest adult activity was observed at sunrise using human sweep netting but it was not significantly different from solar noon and sunset. The lowest adult activity was observed at lunar midnight; however, it was not significantly different from solar noon and sunset. These results provide evidence that the diel activity of Ae. albopictus, contrary to the common perception of its diurnal activity, is much more varied. Because of the involvement of the species in the transmission of debilitating mosquito-borne pathogens such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika virus, coupled with its affinity to thrive in human peridomestic environments, our findings have global implications in areas where Ae. albopictus thrives. It also highlights the importance of behavioral studies of vector species which will not only help mosquito control professionals plan the timing of their control efforts but also provide empirical evidence against conventional wisdoms that may unjustly persist within public health stewards.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive mosquito which is now established in at least 40 states in the USA. Lack of efficient surveillance and control methods against Ae. albopictus, in addition to human-aided accidental transportations, have played a great role in its rapid expansion. Although surveillance measures are becoming more systematic and effective, control of this species still poses a great challenge. Aedes albopictus is difficult to control in the larval stage because it primarily develops in artificial containers that are widespread in peridomestic habitats. These habitats are not only ubiquitous in these environments, they are also cryptic, inaccessible, and extremely difficult to control. Therefore, control of Ae. albopictus in these environments often relies on adult control measures which utilize insecticides dispersed through ultra-low volume equipment as a cold aerosol space spray. These adulticide applications are often conducted at night against endemic mosquito species which are primarily active between dawn and dusk. However, since Ae. albopictus has been traditionally classified as a day-biting mosquito, mosquito control specialists have had doubts about the efficacy of a nocturnal application against a diurnally active mosquito. These uncertainties about intervention efforts become even more important during public health outbreaks of mosquito-borne pathogens such as chikungunya, dengue, or Zika viruses when protection of public health is of paramount importance in peridomestic habitats. Our investigations provide evidence that Ae. albopictus exhibits activity throughout the day and night and that nighttime adulticide applications may indeed be effective against this species, and should not be disregarded.",

    "abstract": "It is not feasible to continuously observe ecological succession in lakes because of the long time-scales generally involved. Thus, the process has been inductively deduced by comparing many lakes with different succession states, or indirectly simulated by tracking studies of smaller water bodies, experiments using microcosms or mesocosms, and reconstruction of lake history by sediment analysis. However, the reality of succession processes in large lakes with slow succession is not well understood, and new approaches are needed. Theoretically, in a group of large and small lakes of similar ages and with similar initial and watershed environments, the rate of nutrient accumulation in each lake depends on the ratio of watershed area to lake size, and the lakes are predicted to evolve to different trophic levels over time. Here, we tested this hypothesis on the 10 lakes of varying sizes in Akan Caldera, Japan, which were formed thousands of years ago by fragmentation due to volcanic eruptions within the caldera. Topographic and water quality studies showed that the ratio of accumulated watershed area to lake size (area and volume), expressed logarithmically, had a positive linear regression with the total phosphorus concentration, an indicator of trophic level. The trophic levels of the lakes were diverse, including oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic types in the traditional \"lake type\" classification based on total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Furthermore, 21 species of aquatic macrophytes were observed by a diving survey, and the plant species composition was classified into five groups corresponding to the trophic status of the lakes, indicating a conventional \"hydrarch succession\". The diversity of water quality and aquatic vegetation in a group of lakes with similar origins paves the way for new comparative studies of lakes, including large lakes.",

    "abstract": "After transcription termination, cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are occasionally trapped on DNA, impounded in an undefined Post-Termination Complex (PTC), limiting free RNAP pool and making transcription inefficient. In Escherichia coli, a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase RapA is involved in countering such inefficiency through RNAP recycling. To understand its mechanism of RNAP recycling, we have determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of two sets of E. coli RapA-RNAP complexes along with RNAP core enzyme and elongation complex (EC). The structures revealed the large conformational changes of RNAP and RapA upon their association implicated in the hindrance in PTC formation. Our study reveals that although RapA binds away from the DNA binding channel of RNAP, it can close the RNAP clamp allosterically thereby preventing its non-specific DNA binding. Together with DNA binding assays, we propose that RapA acts as a guardian of RNAP by which prevents non-specific DNA binding of RNAP without affecting the sigma factor binding to RNAP core enzyme, thereby enhancing RNAP recycling.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic profiling in eukaryotes is of continued interest to study and predict the functional relationships between proteins. This interest is likely driven by the increased number of available diverse genomes and computational methods to infer orthologies. The evaluation of phylogenetic profiles has mainly focussed on reference genome selection in prokaryotes. However, it has been proven to be challenging to obtain high prediction accuracies in eukaryotes. As part of our recent comparison of orthology inference methods for eukaryotic genomes, we observed a surprisingly high performance for predicting interacting orthologous groups. This high performance, in turn, prompted the question of what factors influence the success of phylogenetic profiling when applied to eukaryotic genomes.\n\nHere we analyse the effect of species, orthologous group and interactome selection on protein interaction prediction using phylogenetic profiles. We select species based on the diversity and quality of the genomes and compare this supervised selection with randomly generated genome subsets. We also analyse the effect on the performance of orthologous groups defined to be in the last eukaryotic common ancestor of eukaryotes to that of orthologous groups that are not. Finally, we consider the effects of reference interactome set filtering and reference interactome species.\n\nIn agreement with other studies, we find an effect of genome selection based on quality, less of an effect based on genome diversity, but a more notable effect based on the amount of information contained within the genomes. Most importantly, we find it is not merely selecting the correct genomes that is important for high prediction performance. Other choices in meta parameters such as orthologous group selection, the reference species of the interaction set, and the quality of the interaction set have a much larger impact on the performance when predicting protein interactions using phylogenetic profiles. These findings shed light on the differences in reported performance amongst phylogenetic profiles approaches, and reveal on a more fundamental level for which types of protein interactions this method has most promise when applied to eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The control of extensive complex biological systems is considered to depend on feedback mechanisms. Reduced systems modelling has been effective to describe these mechanisms, but this approach does not sufficiently encompass the required complexity that is needed to understand how localised control in a biological system can provide global stable states. Self-Organised Criticality (SOC) is a characteristic property of locally interacting physical systems which readily emerges from changes to its dynamic state due to small nonlinear perturbations. Small changes in the local states, or in local interactions, can greatly affect the total system state of critical systems. It has long been conjectured that SOC is cardinal to biological systems that show similar critical dynamics and also may exhibit near power-law relations. Rate Control of Chaos (RCC) provides a suitable robust mechanism to generate SOC systems which operates at the edge of chaos. The bio-inspired RCC method requires only local instantaneous knowledge of some of the variables of the system, and is capable of adapting to local perturbations. Importantly, connected RCC controlled oscillators can maintain global multi-stable states, and domains with power-law relations may emerge. The network of oscillators deterministically stabilises into different orbits for different perturbations and the relation between the perturbation and amplitude can show exponential and power-law correlations. This is representative of a basic mechanism of protein production and control, that underlies complex processes such as homeostasis. Providing feedback from the global state, the total system dynamic behaviour can be boosted or reduced. Controlled SOC can provide much greater understanding of biological control mechanisms, that are based on distributed local producers, remote consumers of biological resources, with globally defined control.\n\nAuthor summaryUsing a nonlinear control method inspired by enzymatic control, which is capable of stabilising chaotic systems into periodic orbits or steady-states, it is shown that a controlled system can be created that is scale-free and in a critical state. This means that the system can easily move from one stable orbit to another using only a small local perturbation. Such a system is known as self-organised criticality, and is shown in this system to be deterministic. Using a known perturbation, it will result in a scale-free response of the system that can be in a power law relation. It has been conjectured that biosystems are in a self-organised critical state, and these models show that this is a suitable approach to allow local systems to control a global state, such as homeostatic control. The underlying principle is based on rate control of chaos, and can be used to understand how biosystems can use localised control to ensure stability at different dynamic scales without supervising mechanisms.",

Underpinning cellular life is the ability to process several external chemical signals, often in parallel. Until now, however, cell- and tissue-like structures have only been constructed with one signalling pathway. Here, we construct a dual-signal processor from the bottom up in a modular fashion. The processor comprises three aqueous compartments bounded by lipid bilayers and operates in an aqueous environment. It can receive two chemical signals from the external environment, process them orthogonally, and then produce a distinct output for each signal. It is suitable for both sensing and enzymatic processing of environmental signals with fluorescence and molecular outputs. In the future, such processors could serve as smart drug delivery vehicles or as modules within synthetic tissues to control their behaviour in response to external chemical signals.",

    "abstract": "Voluntary movement requires communication from cortex to the spinal cord, where a dedicated pool of motor units (MUs) activates each muscle. The canonical description of MU function rests upon two foundational tenets. First, cortex cannot control MUs independently but supplies each pool with a common drive. Second, MUs are recruited in a rigid fashion that largely accords with Hennemans size principle. While this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs across diverse force profiles. We developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings even during rapidly changing forces. MU activity patterns were surprisingly behavior-dependent. MU activity could not be accurately described as reflecting common drive, but could be captured by assuming multiple drives. Neuropixels probe recordings revealed that, consistent with the requirements of flexible control, the motor cortex population response displays a great many degrees of freedom. Neighboring cortical sites recruited different MUs. Thus, MU activity is flexibly controlled to meet task demands, and cortex may contribute to this ability.",
