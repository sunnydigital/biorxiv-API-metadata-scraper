    "abstract": "In meiosis, cells undergo two sequential rounds of cell division, termed meiosis I and meiosis II. Textbook models of the meiosis I substage called pachytene show that nuclei have conspicuous 100-nm-wide, ladder-like synaptonemal complexes (SC), which form between homologous chromosomes. It remains unknown if cells have any other large, meiosis-specific nuclear structures. Here we present cryo-ET analysis of frozen-hydrated budding yeast cells before, during, and after pachytene. We found no evidence for the dense ladder-like structures expected of the SC or the ordered chromatin loops expected to project from their sides. Instead, we found large quantities of 12-nm-wide triple-helices that pack into crystalline bundles. These structures are present in meiotic cells, but not in interphase cells, so we call them meiotic triple helices (MTHs). MTHs are enriched in the nucleus but not enriched in the cytoplasm. Bundles of MTHs form at the same time as SCs in wild-type cells and also in mutant cells that are unable to form SCs. These results suggest that in yeast, SCs are not crystalline and that they coexist with large, previously unreported meiotic machines.",

    "abstract": "Condensation of hundreds of mega-base-pair-long human chromosomes in a small nuclear volume is a spectacular biological phenomenon. This process is driven by the formation of chromosome loops. The ATP consuming motor, condensin, interacts with chromatin segments to actively extrude loops. Motivated by real-time imaging of loop extrusion (LE), we created an analytically solvable model, predicting the LE velocity and step size distribution as a function of external load. The theory fits the available experimental data quantitatively, and suggests that condensin must undergo a large conformational change, induced by ATP binding, bringing distant parts of the motor to proximity. Simulations using a simple model confirm that the motor transitions between an open and a closed state in order to extrude loops by a scrunching mechanism, similar to that proposed in DNA bubble formation during bacterial transcription. Changes in the orientation of the motor domains are transmitted over ~ 50 nm, connecting the motor head and the hinge, thus providing an allosteric basis for LE.",

    "abstract": "The potential to treat diabetes by increasing beta-cell mass is driving a major effort to identify beta-cell mitogens. Demonstration of mitogen activity in human beta cells is frequently performed in ex vivo assays. However, reported disparities in the efficacy of beta-cell mitogens led us to investigate the sources of this variability. We studied 35 male (23) and female (12) human islet batches covering a range of donor ages and BMI. Islets were kept intact or dispersed into single cells and cultured in the presence of harmine, glucose, or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and subsequently analyzed by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. Proliferating cells were identified by double labelling with EdU and Ki67 and glucagon, c-peptide or Nkx6.1, and cytokeratin-19 to respectively label alpha, beta, and ductal cells. Harmine and HB-EGF stimulated human beta-cell proliferation, but the effect of glucose was dependent on the assay and the donor. Harmine potently stimulated alpha-cell proliferation and both harmine and HB-EGF increased proliferation of insulin- and glucagon-negative cells, including cytokeratin 19-positive cells. Given the abundance of non-beta cells in human islet preparations, our results suggest that assessment of beta-cell mitogens requires complementary approaches and rigorous identification of cell identity using multiple markers.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid fitness can be negatively impacted by trait mismatch, whereby hybrids resemble one parent population for some phenotypic traits and the other parent population for other traits. In this study, we used threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) to test whether trait mismatch in hybrids increases with the magnitude of phenotypic divergence between parent populations. We measured morphological traits in parents and hybrids in crosses between a marine population representing the ancestral form and twelve freshwater populations that have diverged from this ancestral state to varying degrees according to their environments. We found that trait mismatch was greater in more divergent crosses for both F1 and F2 hybrids. In the F1, the divergence-mismatch relationship was caused by traits having dominance in different directions whereas it was caused by segregating phenotypic variation in the F2. Selection against mismatched traits is an ecological analogue to selection against intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities, and our results imply that extrinsic hybrid incompatibilities accumulate predictably as phenotypic divergence proceeds.",

    "abstract": "1Gait and whole body posture are sensitive measures of the proper functioning of numerous neural circuits, and are often perturbed in many neurological, neuromuscular, and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Rodents provide a tractable model for elucidating disease mechanisms and interventions, however, studying gait and whole body posture in rodent models requires specialized methods and remains challenging. Here, we develop a simple assay that allows adoption of the commonly used open field apparatus for gait and whole body posture analysis. We leverage modern neural networks to abstract a mouse into keypoints and extract gait and whole body coordination metrics of the animal. Gait-level analysis allows us to detect every step of the animals movement and provides high resolution information about the animals behavior. We quantitate gait and whole body posture with high precision and accuracy across 62 highly visually diverse strains of mice. We apply our approach to characterize four genetic mutants with known gait deficits. In extended analysis, we demonstrate that multiple autism spectrum disorder (ASD) models show gait and posture deficits, implying this is a general feature of ASD. We conduct a large strain survey of 1898 mice, and find that gait and whole body posture measures are highly heritable in the laboratory mouse, and fall into three classes. Furthermore, the reference mouse strain, C57BL/6J, has a distinctly different gait and posture compared to other standard laboratory and wild-derived strains. We conduct a genome wide association study (GWAS) to define the genetic architecture of mouse movement in the open field. In sum, we describe a simple, sensitive, accurate, scalable, and ethologically relevant method of mouse gait and whole body posture analysis for behavioral neurogenetics. These results provide one of the largest laboratory mouse gait-level data resources for the research community and show the utility of automated machine learning approaches for deriving biological insights.",

    "abstract": "Foundations of photosynthesis research have been established mainly by studying the response of plants to changing light, typically to sudden exposure to a constant light intensity after a dark acclimation or light flashes. This approach remains valid and powerful, but can be limited by requiring dark acclimation before time-domain measurements and often assumes that rate constants determining the photosynthetic response do not change between the dark- and light-acclimation.\n\nWe present experimental data and mathematical models demonstrating that these limits can be overcome by measuring plant responses to sinusoidally modulated light of varying frequency. By its nature, such frequency-domain characterization is performed in light-acclimated plants with no need for prior dark acclimation. Amplitudes, phase shifts, and upper harmonic modulation extracted from the data for a wide range of frequencies can target different kinetic domains and regulatory feedbacks. The occurrence of upper harmonic modulation reflects non-linear phenomena, including photosynthetic regulation. To support these claims, we present a frequency- and time-domain response in chlorophyll fluorescence emission of the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana in the frequency range 1000 - 0.001 Hz. Based on these experimental data and numerical as well as analytical mathematical models, we propose that frequency-domain measurements can become a versatile new tool in plant sensing.\n\nOne sentence summaryIt is proposed to characterize photosynthesis in the frequency domain without the need for dark adaptation and, thus, without assumptions about the dark-to-light transition.",

    "abstract": "In a multicentric, observational, investigator-blinded, and longitudinal clinical study of 764 ART-naive subjects, we identified nine different promoter-variant strains of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) emerging in the Indian population, with some of these variants being reported for the first time. Unlike several previous studies, our work here focuses on the evolving viral regulatory elements, not coding sequences. The emerging viral strains contain additional copies of the existing transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), including TCF-1/LEF-1, RBEIII, AP-1, and NF-{kappa}B, created by sequence duplication. The additional TFBS are genetically diverse and may blur the distinction between the modulatory region of the promoter and the viral enhancer. In a follow-up analysis, we found trends, but not significant associations between any specific variant promoter and prognostic markers, probably because the emerging viral strains might not have established mono infections yet. Illumina sequencing of four clinical samples containing a co-infection indicated the domination of one strain over the other and establishing a stable ratio with the second strain at the follow-up time-points. Since a single promoter regulates viral gene expression and constitutes the master regulatory circuit with Tat, the acquisition of additional and variant copies of the TFBS may significantly impact viral latency and latent reservoir characteristics. Further studies are urgently warranted to understand how the diverse TFBS profiles of the viral promoter may modulate the characteristics of the latent reservoir, especially following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.\n\nSignificance StatementA unique conglomeration of TFBS enables the HIV-1 promoter to accomplish two diametrically opposite functions - transcriptional activation and transcriptional silencing. The various phases of viral latency -establishment, maintenance, and reversal -collectively determine the replication fitness of individual viral strains. A profound variation in the TFBS composition of the viral promoter may significantly alter the viral latency properties and the latent reservoir characteristics. Although the duplication of certain TFBS remains a quality unique to HIV-1C, the high-level genetic recombination of HIV-1 may promote the transfer of such molecular properties to the other HIV-1 subtypes. The emergence of several promoter-variant viral strains may make the task of a  functional cure more challenging in HIV-1C.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing neural activity has been observed across several brain regions and thought to reflect the internal state of the brain. Yet, it is not fully understood how ongoing brain activity interacts with sensory experience and shape sensory representations. Here, we show that projection neurons of the fruit fly antennal lobe exhibit spatiotemporally organized ongoing activity in the absence of odor stimulation. Upon repeated exposure to odors, we observe a gradual and long-lasting decrease in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous calcium events, as well as a reorganization of correlations between olfactory glomeruli during ongoing activity. Accompanying these plastic changes, we find that repeated odor experience reduces trial-to-trial variability and enhances the specificity of odor representations. Our results reveal a previously undescribed experience-dependent plasticity of ongoing and sensory driven activity at peripheral levels of the fruit fly olfactory system.",

    "abstract": "Maize is a staple food all over the world. Models for climate change suggest that, in the future, cloud formation might be reduced in the tropics increasing the exposure to Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, a DNA-damaging agent. UV-B (290 to 320 nm) has been shown to affect yield in maize. In this project we have determined the differences in DNA repair efficiencies between U.S. inbred lines B73 and Mo17, and Central American purple landraces from Guatemala and Costa Rica. Our results from single cell electrophoresis experiments (Comet Assay) suggest that the landrace Pujagua Santa Cruz (P1, Costa Rican) was resistant to damage caused by the radiomimetic agent zeocin (24h/100 micrograms per mL), while landrace Pujagua La Cruz (P2, Costa Rican) was able to repair DNA damage after one hour. On the other hand, line Mo17 (Missouri, USA) was unable to repair the damage, while B73 (Iowa, USA) and the landraces Jocopilas (Guatemalan), Orotina Congo (Costa Rican) and Talamanca (Costa Rican) were partially able to repair DNA damage. High Resolution Melting (HRM) curve analysis of putative homologous DNA repair gene ZeaATM1 showed that both P1 and P2 had differences in the melting temperatures for this gene compared to B73 and Mo17, while P1 showed additional differences in ZeaSOG1, ZeaRAD51 and ZeaBRCA1, suggesting that in this landrace the presence of polymorphisms may be common among key genes for this pathway. Taken together our results suggest that key adaptive differences in DNA repair efficiencies exist between inbred lines and landraces of maize and that some Central America landraces could be used as a valuable pool of alleles for plant breeding aiming to increase tolerance to radiation.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes chronic infections like cystic fibrosis, endocarditis, bacteremia and sepsis, which are life-threatening and difficult to treat. The lack of antibiotic response in P. aeruginosa is due to adaptive resistance mechanism, which prevents the entry of antibiotics into cytosol of the cell to achieve tolerance. Among different groups of antibiotics, aminoglycosides are used as a parental antibiotic for treatment of P. aeruginosa. This study aims to determine the kinetics of antibiotic tolerance and gene expression changes in P. aeruginosa exposed to amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. These antibiotics were exposed to P. aeruginosa at their MICs and the experimental setup was monitored till 72 hours, followed by the measurement of optical density in the interval of every 12 hours. The growth of P. aeruginosa in MICs of antibiotics represents the kinetics of antibiotic tolerance in amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Transcriptomic profile of antibiotic exposed P. aeruginosa PA14 was taken from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), NCBI as microarray datasets. The gene expressions of two datasets were compared by test versus control. Tobramycin exposed P. aeruginosa failed to develop tolerance in MICs 0.5{micro}g/mL, 1{micro}g/mL and 1.5{micro}g/mL. Whereas amikacin and gentamicin treated P. aeruginosa developed tolerance in MICs. This depicts the superior in vitro response of tobramycin over the gentamicin and amikacin. Further, in silico transcriptomic analysis of tobramycin treated P. aeruginosa resulted in low expression of 16s rRNA Methyltransferase E, B & L, alginate biosynthesis genes and several proteins of Type 2 Secretory System (T2SS) and Type 3 Secretory System (T3SS). The Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) of alginate biosynthesis, and RNA Methyltransferases suggests increased antibiotic response and low probability of developing resistance. The use of tobramycin as a parental antibiotic with its synergistic combination might combat P. aeruginosa with increased response.",

We address this gap and present a proof-of-concept study for classifying fungal taxa using linked machine learning classifiers. We demonstrate the capability of linked machine learning classifiers to accurately classify species and strains using real-world and simulated fungal ribosomal DNA datasets, including plant and human pathogens. We benchmark our new approach in comparison to current alignment and k-mer based methods based on synthetic mock communities. We also assess real world applications of species identification in complex unlabelled datasets.\n\nResultsOur machine learning approach assigned individual nanopore long-read amplicon sequences to fungal species with high recall rates and low false positive rates. Importantly, our approach successfully distinguished between closely-related species and strains when individual read errors were higher than the genetic distance between individual taxa, which the alignment and k-mer methods could not do. The machine learning approach showed an ability to identify key species with high recall rates, even in complex samples of unknown species composition.\n\nConclusionsA proof of concept machine learning approach using a tree-descent approach on a decision tree of classifiers can identify known taxa with high accuracy, and precisely detect known target species from complex samples with high recall rates. We propose this approach is suitable for detecting the known knowns of pathogens or invasive species in any environment of mostly unknown composition, including agriculture and wild ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Detection and accurate quantitation of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis is fundamental to understanding mycobacterial pathogenicity, tuberculosis (TB) disease progression and outcomes; TB transmission; drug action, efficacy and drug resistance. Despite this importance, methods for determining numbers of viable bacilli are limited in accuracy and precision owing to inherent characteristics of mycobacterial cell biology - including the tendency to clump, and \"differential\" culturability - and technical challenges consequent on handling an infectious pathogen under biosafe conditions. We developed an absolute counting method for mycobacteria in liquid cultures using a bench-top flow cytometer, and the low-cost fluorescent dyes Calcein-AM (CA) and SYBR-gold (SG). During exponential growth CA+ cell counts are highly correlated with CFU counts and can be used as a real-time alternative to simplify the accurate standardisation of inocula for experiments. In contrast to CFU counting, this method can detect and enumerate cell aggregates in samples, which we show are a potential source of variance and bias when using established methods. We show that CFUs comprise a sub-population of intact, metabolically active mycobacterial cells in liquid cultures, with CFU-proportion varying by growth conditions. A pharmacodynamic application of the flow cytometry method, exploring kinetics of fluorescent probe defined subpopulations compared to CFU is demonstrated. Flow cytometry derived Mycobacterium bovis BCG time-kill curves differ for rifampicin and kanamycin versus isoniazid and ethambutol, as do the relative dynamics of discrete morphologically-distinct subpopulations of bacilli revealed by this high-throughput single-cell technique.",

The spatial distribution of genetic diversity, referred to as fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS), also carries information about recent demographic changes, yet it has rarely been connected to range scale processes. We studied eight silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) population pairs (sites), growing at high and low elevations, representative of the main genetic lineages of the species. A total of 1368 adult trees and 540 seedlings were genotyped using 137 and 116 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively. Sites revealed a clear east-west isolation-by-distance pattern consistent with the post-glacial colonization history of the species. Genetic differentiation among sites (FCT=0.148) was an order of magnitude greater than between elevations within sites (FSC=0.031), nevertheless high elevation populations consistently exhibited a stronger FSGS. Structural equation modeling revealed that elevation and, to a lesser extent, post-glacial colonization history, but not climatic and habitat variables, were the best predictors of FGSG across populations. These results may suggest that high elevation habitats have been colonized more recently across the species range. Additionally, paternity analysis revealed a high reproductive skew among adults and a stronger FSGS in seedlings than in adults, suggesting that FSGS may conserve the signature of demographic changes for several generations. Our results emphasize that spatial patterns of genetic diversity within populations provide complementary information about demographic history and could be used for defining conservation priorities.",

    "abstract": "Mortality rates among patients suffering from acute respiratory failure remain perplexingly high despite maintenance of blood homeostasis. The biotrauma hypothesis advances that mechanical forces from invasive ventilation trigger immunological factors that spread systemically. Yet, how these forces elicit an immune response remains unclear. Here we show that flow-induced stresses under mechanical ventilation can injure the bronchial epithelium of ventilated in vitro upper airway models and directly modulate inflammatory cytokine secretion associated with pulmonary injury. We identify site-specific susceptibility to epithelial erosion in airways from jet-flow impaction and measure an increase in cell apoptosis and modulated secretions of cytokines IL-6, 8 and 10. We find that prophylactic pharmacological treatment with anti-inflammatory therapeutics reduces apoptosis and pro-inflammatory signaling during ventilation. Our 3D in vitro airway platform points to a previously overlooked origin of lung injury and showcases translational opportunities in preclinical pulmonary research towards protective therapies and improved protocols for patient care.",

    "abstract": "More than 95% of human genes are alternatively spliced. Yet, the extent splicing is regulated at single-cell resolution has remained controversial due to both available data and methods to interpret it. We apply the SpliZ, a new statistical approach that is agnostic to transcript annotation, to detect cell-type-specific regulated splicing in > 110K carefully annotated single cells from 12 human tissues. Using 10x data for discovery, 9.1% of genes with computable SpliZ scores are cell-type specifically spliced. These results are validated with RNA FISH, single cell PCR, and in high throughput with Smart-seq2. Regulated splicing is found in ubiquitously expressed genes such as actin light chain subunit MYL6 and ribosomal protein RPS24, which has an epithelial-specific microexon. 13% of the statistically most variable splice sites in cell-type specifically regulated genes are also most variable in mouse lemur or mouse. SpliZ analysis further reveals 170 genes with regulated splicing during sperm development using, 10 of which are conserved in mouse and mouse lemur. The statistical properties of the SpliZ allow model-based identification of subpopulations within otherwise indistinguishable cells based on gene expression, illustrated by subpopulations of classical monocytes with stereotyped splicing, including an un-annotated exon, in SAT1, a Diamine acetyltransferase. Together, this unsupervised and annotation-free analysis of differential splicing in ultra high throughput droplet-based sequencing of human cells across multiple organs establishes splicing is regulated cell-type-specifically independent of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "RNA-Seq data are usually summarized by counting the number of transcript reads aligned to each gene. However, count-based methods do not take alignment information, where and how each read was mapped in the gene, into account. This information is essential to characterize samples accurately. In this study, we developed a method to summarize RNA-Seq data without losing alignment information. To include alignment information, we introduce \"q-mer analysis,\" which summarizes RNA-Seq data with 4q kinds of q-length oligomers. Using publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, we demonstrate that at least q [greater double equals] 9 is required for capturing alignment information in Homo sapiens. Furthermore, principal component analysis showed that q-mer analysis with q = 14 linearly distinguished samples from controls, while a count-based method failed. These results indicate that alignment information is essential to characterize transcriptomics samples. In conclusion, we introduce q-mer analysis to include alignment information in RNA-Seq analysis and demonstrate the superiority of q-mer analysis over count-based methods in that q-mer analysis can distinguish case samples from controls. Combining RNA-Seq research with q-mer analysis could be useful for identifying distinguishing transcriptomic features that could provide hypotheses for disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Reporting biomarkers assessed by routine immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tissue is broadly used in diagnostic pathology laboratories for patient care. To date, clinical reporting is predominantly qualitative or semi-quantitative. By creating a multitask deep learning framework referred to as DeepLIIF, we present a single-step solution to stain deconvolution/separation, cell segmentation, and quantitative single-cell IHC scoring. Leveraging a unique de novo dataset of co-registered IHC and multiplex immunofluorescence (mpIF) staining of the same slides, we segment and translate low-cost and prevalent IHC slides to more expensive-yet-informative mpIF images, while simultaneously providing the essential ground truth for the superimposed brightfield IHC channels. Moreover, a new nuclear-envelop stain, LAP2beta, with high (>95%) cell coverage is introduced to improve cell delineation/segmentation and protein expression quantification on IHC slides. By simultaneously translating input IHC images to clean/separated mpIF channels and performing cell segmentation/classification, we show that our model trained on clean IHC Ki67 data can generalize to more noisy and artifact-ridden images as well as other nuclear and non-nuclear markers such as CD3, CD8, BCL2, BCL6, MYC, MUM1, CD10, and TP53.

    "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) heterogeneity is increasingly appreciated, but the origins and functions of distinct CAF subtypes remain poorly understood. The abundant and transcriptionally diverse CAF population in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is thought to arise from a common cell of origin, pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), with diversification resulting from cytokine and growth factor gradients within the tumor microenvironment. Here we analyzed the differentiation and function of PSCs during tumor progression in vivo. Contrary to expectations, we found that PSCs give rise to a numerically minor subset of PDAC CAFs. Targeted ablation of PSC-derived CAFs within their host tissue revealed non-redundant functions for this defined CAF population in shaping the PDAC microenvironment, including production of specific components of the extracellular matrix. Together, these findings link stromal evolution from distinct cells of origin to transcriptional heterogeneity among PDAC CAFs, and demonstrate unique functions for CAFs of a defined cellular origin.\n\nStatement of significanceBy tracking and ablating a specific CAF population, we find that a numerically minor CAF subtype from a defined cell of origin plays unique roles in establishing the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Together with prior studies, this work suggests that mesenchymal lineage heterogeneity as well as signaling gradients diversify PDAC CAFs.",

The study aimed to mutate N-glycosylation as it thought to be important in mediating many glycoproteins function.\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis performed to mutate N-glycosylation sites by converting asparagine residues to glutamine. Each site was mutated individually (CD24N36Q and CD24N52Q) and in combination (CD24N[36,52]Q) and were overexpressed in HCT116 and SW480 cell lines. The effect of the mutant CD24 on cell viability, cell motility and induction of downstream targets was compared to wild-type CD24 and empty vector control (EVC).\n\nOverexpression of the individually mutated clones increased cell motility compared to EVC but was significantly less than that induced by CD24WT. Overexpression of the double mutant clone resulted in near-complete abrogation of cell motility induction. Unexpectedly, the expression of mutant clones (single and double) increased cell viability.

    "abstract": "Decision-making in breeding increasingly depends on the ability to capture and predict crop responses to changing environmental factors. Advances in crop modeling as well as high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) hold promise to provide such insights. Processing HTFP data is an interdisciplinary task that requires broad knowledge on experimental design, measurement techniques, feature extraction, dynamic trait modeling, and prediction of genotypic values using statistical models. To get an overview of sources of variation in HTFP, we develop a general plot-level model for repeated measurements. Based on this model, we propose a seamless step-wise procedure that allows for carry on of estimated means and variances from stage to stage. The process builds on the extraction of three intermediate trait categories; (1) timing of key stages, (2) quantities at defined time points or periods, and (3) dose-response curves. In a first stage, these intermediate traits are extracted from low-level traits time series (e.g., canopy height) using P-splines and the quarter of maximum elongation rate method (QMER), as well as final height percentiles. In a second and third stage, extracted traits are further processed using a stage-wise linear mixed model analysis. Using a wheat canopy growth simulation to generate canopy height time series, we demonstrate the suitability of the stage-wise process for traits of the first two above-mentioned categories. Results indicate that, for the first stage, the P-spline/QMER method was more robust than the percentile method. In the subsequent two-stage linear mixed model processing, weighting the second and third stage with error variance estimates from the previous stages improved the root mean squared error. We conclude that processing phenomics data in stages represents a feasible approach if estimated means and variances are carried forward from one processing stage to the next. P-splines in combination with the QMER method are suitable tools to extract timing of key stages and quantities at defined time points from HTFP data.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGeneral plot-level model for repeated high-throughput field phenotyping measurements\nC_LIO_LIExtraction of three main intermediate trait categories for dynamic modeling\nC_LIO_LISeamless processing approach that integrates temporal and spatial modeling\nC_LIO_LIPhenomics data processing cheatsheet\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Amphibious fishes and salamanders are valuable functional analogs for vertebrates that spanned the water-to-land transition. However, investigations of walking mechanics have focused on terrestrial salamanders and, thus, may better reflect the capabilities of stem tetrapods that were already terrestrial. The earliest tetrapods were aquatic, so salamanders that are not primarily terrestrial may yield more appropriate data for modelling the incipient stages of terrestrial locomotion. In the present study, locomotor biomechanics were quantified from semi-aquatic Pleurodeles waltl, a salamander that spends most of its adult life in water, and then compared to a primarily terrestrial salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) and semi-aquatic fish (Periophthalmus barbarus) to evaluate whether walking mechanics show greater similarity between species with ecological versus phylogenetic similarities. Ground reaction forces (GRFs) from individual limbs or fins indicated that the pectoral appendages of each taxon had distinct patterns of force production, but hind limb forces were comparable between the salamanders. The rate of force development ( yank) was sometimes slower in P. waltl but generally comparable between the three species. Finally, medial inclination of the GRF in P. waltl was intermediate between semi-aquatic fish and terrestrial salamanders, potentially elevating bone stresses among more aquatic taxa as they move on land. These data provide a framework for modelling stem tetrapods using an earlier stage of quadrupedal locomotion that was powered primarily by the hind limbs (i.e., \"rear-wheel drive\"), and reveal mechanisms for appendages to generate propulsion in three locomotor strategies that are presumed to have occurred across the water-to-land transition in vertebrate evolution.\n\nSummary statementSemi-aquatic salamanders had limb mechanics that were intermediate in magnitude yet steadier than the appendages of terrestrial salamanders and semi-aquatic fish, providing a framework to model semi-aquatic early tetrapods.",

The exploitation of this physiological process has a clear benefit to promote the recovery from a wide range of neurological disorders. Here, we show that plasticity-promoting regimes provide candidate mechanisms to supplement the classically used antidotes for anti-cholinesterase poisoning. These neurotoxins inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing the overstimulation of cholinergic transmission at synapses and neuromuscular junctions. The model organism C. elegans exhibits organophosphate-induced mitigating plasticity that impacts on the recovery of neuromuscular phenotypes, initially impaired by the drug. This is underpinned by overstimulation of nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Intrinsic determinants of receptors location and sensitivity modulate the extent of plasticity in the context of persistent cholinergic stimulation. Our results indicate that pharmacological intervention of nicotinic receptors and/or scaffolding proteins that support receptor function might provide a novel treatment route for anti-cholinesterase poisoning.",

    "abstract": "The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is critical for both learned and innate fear, but how discrete projections control different types of fear is poorly understood. Here, we report a novel excitatory circuit from a subpopulation of the ventral hippocampus CA1 subfield (vCA1) to the inhibitory peri-paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pPVN) which then routes to the periaqueductal grey (PAG). We find that vCA1[-&gt;]pPVN projections modulate both learned and innate fear. Fiber photometric calcium recordings reveal that activity in vCA1[-&gt;]pPVN projections increases during the first moments of exposure to an unconditioned threat. Chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of vCA1[-&gt;]pPVN cell bodies or vCA1[-&gt;]pPVN axon terminals in the pPVN enhances the initial magnitude of both active and passive unconditioned defensive responses, irrespective of the sensory modalities engaged by a particular innate threat. Moreover, silencing produces a dramatic impact on learned fear without affecting milder anxiety-like behaviors. We also show that vCA1[-&gt;]pPVN projections monosynaptically route to the PAG, a key brain region that orchestrates the fear response. Surprisingly, optogenetic silencing of vCA1 terminals in the pPVN titrates the level of c-Fos neural activity in the PAG differently for learned versus innate threats. Together, our results show how a novel vCA1[-&gt;]pPVN circuit modulates neuronal activity in the PAG to regulate both learned and innate fear. These findings have implications for how initial trauma processing may influence maladaptive defensive behaviors across fear and trauma-related disorders.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA multisensory gate for high intensity aversive experiences.",

    "abstract": "The Ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of thalamus is the most targeted structure for the treatment of drug-refractory tremors. Since methodological differences across existing studies are remarkable and no gold-standard pipeline is available, in this study, we tested different parcellation pipelines for tractography-derived putative Vim identification.\n\nThalamic parcellation was performed on a high quality, multi-shell dataset and a downsampled, clinical-like dataset using two different diffusion signal modeling techniques and two different voxel classification criteria, thus implementing a total of four parcellation pipelines. The most reliable pipeline in terms of inter-subject variability has been picked and parcels putatively corresponding to motor thalamic nuclei have been selected by calculating similarity with a histology-based mask of Vim. Then, spatial relations with optimal stimulation points for the treatment of essential tremor have been quantified. Finally, effect of data quality and parcellation pipelines on a volumetric index of connectivity clusters has been assessed.\n\nWe found that the pipeline characterized by higher-order signal modeling and threshold-based voxel classification criteria was the most reliable in terms of inter-subject reliability regardless data quality. The maps putatively corresponding to Vim were those derived by precentral- and dentate nucleus-thalamic connectivity. However, tractography-derived functional targets showed remarkable differences in shape and sizes when compared to a ground truth model based on histochemical staining on seriate sections of human brain. Thalamic voxels connected to contralateral dentate nucleus resulted to be the closest to literature-derived stimulation points for essential tremor but at the same time showing the most remarkable inter-subject variability. Finally, the volume of connectivity parcels resulted to be significantly influenced by data quality and parcellation pipelines. Hence, caution is warranted when performing thalamic connectivity-based segmentation for stereotacting targeting.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, olfactory information received by the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) is first processed by an incoherent feed forward neural circuit in the antennal lobe (AL) that consists of ORNs (input), the inhibitory local neurons (LNs), and projection neurons (PNs). This \"early\" olfactory information process has two important characteristics. First, response of a PN to its cognate ORN is normalized by the overall activity of other ORNs, a phenomenon termed \"divisive normalization\". Second, PNs respond strongly to the onset of ORN activities, but they adapt to prolonged or continuously increasing inputs. Despite the importance of these characteristics for learning and memory, their underlying mechanism remains not fully understood. Here, we develop a circuit model for describing the ORN-LN-PN dynamics by including key features of neuron-neuron interactions, in particular short-term plasticity (STP) and presynaptic inhibition (PI). Our model shows that STP is critical in shaping PNs steady-state response properties. By fitting our model to experimental data quantitatively, we found that strong and balanced short-term facilitation (STF) and short-term depression (STD) in STP is crucial for the observed nonlinear divisive normalization in Drosophila. By comparing our model with the observed adaptive response to time-varying signals quantitatively, we find that both STP and PI contribute to the highly adaptive response with the latter being the dominant factor for a better fit with experimental data. Our model not only helps reveal the mechanisms underlying two main characteristics of the early olfactory process, it can also be used to predict the PN responses to arbitrary time-dependent signals and to infer microscopic properties of the circuit (such as the strengths of STF and STD) from the measured input-output relation.",

    "abstract": "Individuals differ in their responsiveness to hypnotic suggestions. However, defining and measuring hypnotizability is contentious because standardized scales, such as the Harvard group scale (HGSHS:A), measure a mixture of general suggestibility and its alteration due to hypnotic induction (hypnotizability). Exploratory factor analyses (FA) of standardized scales indicated their multidimensionality; however, the number and nature of latent factors are debated. We applied Confirmatory FA to the HGSHS:A scores of 477 volunteers and tested several theory-driven models. Scores were best explained by a bifactor model consisting of a G-factor and three correlated minor factors. The presented bifactor model shows that two sources of variability affect HGSHS:A simultaneously. Structural equation modeling revealed that the challenge-ideomotor factor predicts the other two minor factors, implying these suggestions might require more fundamental processes than other types. These results demonstrate the multifaceted and bifactorial structure of hypnotic suggestibility and underscore the desideratum for developing more differentiated scales.",

Inspired by clinical observations, we ask if this bilateral representation differs for the left and right hemispheres. Electrocorticography (ECoG) was recorded in human participants during an instructed-delay reaching task, with movements produced with either the contralateral or ipsilateral arm. Using a cross-validated kinematic encoding model, we found stronger bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere, an effect that was present during preparation and was amplified during execution. Consistent with this asymmetry, we also observed better across-arm generalization in the left hemisphere, indicating similar neural representations for right and left arm movements. Notably, these left hemisphere electrodes were centered over premotor and parietal regions. The more extensive bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere adds a new perspective to the pervasive neuropsychological finding that the left hemisphere plays a dominant role in praxis.",

    "abstract": "Cytolytic T cell responses are predicted to be biased towards membrane proteins. The peptide-binding grooves of most haplotypes of histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) are relatively hydrophobic, therefore peptide fragments derived from human transmembrane helices (TMHs) are predicted to be presented more often as would be expected based on their abundance in the proteome. However, the physiological reason of why membrane proteins might be over-presented is unclear. In this study, we show that the over-presentation of TMH-derived peptides is general, as it is predicted for bacteria and viruses and for both MHCI and MHC-II. Moreover, we show that TMHs are evolutionarily more conserved, because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present relatively less frequently in TMH-coding chromosomal regions compared to regions coding for extracellular and cytoplasmic protein regions. Thus, our findings suggest that both cytolytic and helper T cells respond more to membrane proteins, because these are evolutionary more conserved. We speculate that TMHs therefore are less prone to escape mutations that enable pathogens to evade T cell responses.",

Here we report the development of a therapeutic cocktail comprising two broadly neutralizing human antibodies rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-442 that recognize non-overlapping sites on the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). Antibodies in the cocktail exhibited synergistic neutralizing activity and resisted viral escape, and they were optimized for their Fc-mediated effector function activities. The cocktail protected non-human primates from ebolavirus disease caused by EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV with high therapeutic effectiveness. High-resolution structures of the cocktail antibodies in complex with GP revealed the molecular determinants for neutralization breadth and potency.

We hypothesize that the screening of S protein sequences of all the HCoVs would result in the identification of potential multi-epitope vaccine candidates capable of conferring immunity against various HCoVs. In the present study, several machine learning-based in-silico tools were employed to design a broad-spectrum multi-epitope vaccine candidate against S protein of human coronaviruses. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first study, where multiple B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes (CTL and HTL) were predicted from the S protein sequences of all seven known HCoVs and linked together with an adjuvant to construct a potential broad-spectrum vaccine candidate. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted, validated and the refined 3D-model was docked with an immune receptor. The vaccine candidate was evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and its ability to achieve high-level expression in bacterial hosts. Finally, the immune simulation was carried out to evaluate the immune response after three vaccine doses. The designed vaccine is antigenic (with or without the adjuvant), non-allergenic, binds well with TLR-3 receptor and might elicit a diverse and strong immune response.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix is a defining feature of bacterial biofilms and provides structural stability to the community by binding cells to the surface and to each other. Transitions between bacterial biofilm initiation, growth, and dispersion require different regulatory programs, all of which result in modifications to the extracellular matrix composition, abundance, or functionality. However, the mechanisms by which individual cells in biofilms disengage from the matrix to enable their departure during biofilm dispersal are unclear. Here, we investigated active biofilm dispersal of Vibrio cholerae during nutrient starvation, resulting in the discovery of the conserved Vibrio biofilm dispersal regulator VbdR. We show that VbdR triggers biofilm dispersal by controlling cellular release from the biofilm matrix, which is achieved by inducing the retraction of the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) type IV pili and the expression of a matrix protease IvaP. We further show that MSHA pili have numerous binding partners in the matrix and that the joint effect of MSHA pilus retraction and IvaP activity is necessary and sufficient for causing biofilm dispersal. These results highlight the crucial role of type IV pilus dynamics during biofilm dispersal and provide a new target for controlling V. cholerae biofilm abundance through the induction and manipulation of biofilm dispersal.",

Here, we show that aminoglycosides, a well-known class of antibiotics produced by Streptomyces, are potent inhibitors of phage infection in widely divergent bacterial hosts. We demonstrate that aminoglycosides block an early step of the viral life cycle, prior to genome replication. Phage inhibition was also achieved using supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers, hinting at a broad physiological significance of the antiviral properties of aminoglycosides. Strikingly, we show that acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic apramycin abolishes its antibacterial effect, but retains its antiviral properties. Altogether, this study expands the knowledge of potential aminoglycoside functions in bacterial communities suggesting that aminoglycosides are not only used by their producers as toxic molecules against their bacterial competitors, but could also provide protection against the threat of phage predation at the community level.",

    "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains that express various fimbrial or nonfimbrial colonization factors and enterotoxins are critical causes of diarrheal diseases. Human ETEC serotype O169:H41 (O169) has been a representative of epidemic ETEC worldwide; the organism shows massive adherence to HEp-2 cells similar to enteroaggregative E. coli. Previously, we determined the complete sequence of the unstable virulence plasmid, pEntYN10. The plasmid included a unique set of genes encoding a novel colonization factor (CF) resembling K88 (F4) of porcine ETEC, in addition to CS6, a well-known representative CF of human ETEC, and another novel CF similar to CS8 (CFA/III) of human ETEC. To determine whether the K88-like CF (after this, K88O169) allows the organisms to infect domestic animals like the original K88-harboring strains that can cause diarrhea in piglets, samples were tested for antibodies against recombinant proteins of possible paralogous adhesins, FaeG1 and FaeG2, from K88O169 and the FaeG of typical K88 (F4). The seroepidemiological study using recombinant antigens (two paralogs FaeG1 and FaeG2 from K88O169) showed reactivity of porcine (18.0%) and bovine (17.1%) sera to K88O169 FaeG1 and/or FaeG2 antigens on indirect ELISA tests. These results suggest that E. coli with K88O169 adhesin can infect various hosts, including pigs and cattle. This is the first report of domestic animals having antibodies to K88O169 of human ETEC. Although human ETEC had been thought to be distinguished from those of domestic animals based on colonization factors, zoonotic strains may conceal themselves among human ETEC organisms. The concept of One Health should be adopted to intervene in ETEC infections among animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "We define a molecular connection between ribosome biogenesis and desiccation tolerance in lichens, widespread symbioses between specialized fungi (mycobionts) and unicellular phototrophs. Our experiments test whether the introns present in the nuclear ribosomal DNA of lichen mycobionts contribute to their anhydrobiosis. Self-splicing introns are found in the rDNA of several eukaryotic microorganisms, but most introns populating lichen rDNA are unable to self-splice, being either degenerate group I introns lacking the sequences needed for catalysis, or spliceosomal introns ectopically present in rDNA. Although all introns are eventually removed from rRNA by the splicing machinery of the mycobiont, Northern analysis of its RNA indicates that they are not removed quickly during rRNA transcription but are still present in early post-transcriptional processing and ribosome assembly stages, suggesting that delayed splicing interferes with ribosome assembly. To study the phenotypic repercussions of lichen introns in a model system, we used CRISPR to introduce a spliceosomal intron from the rDNA of the lichen fungus Cladonia grayi into all nuclear rDNA copies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks rDNA introns. Three intron-bearing yeast mutants were constructed with the intron inserted either in the 18S rRNA genes, the 25S rRNA genes, or in both. The mutants removed the introns correctly but had half the rDNA genes of the wildtype strain, grew 4.4 to 6 times slower, and were 40 to 1700 times more desiccation tolerant depending on intron position and number. Intracellular trehalose, a disaccharide implicated in desiccation tolerance, was detected, but at low concentration. Overall, our data suggest that the constitutive interference of the intron splicing machinery with ribosome assembly and the consequent lowering of the cytoplasmic concentration of ribosomes and proteins are the primary causes of slow growth and increased desiccation tolerance in the yeast mutants. The relevance of these findings for slow growth and desiccation tolerance in lichens is discussed.",

    "abstract": "ASC-containing inflammasomes form specks, extracellular aggregates which enhance the aggregation of A{beta} amyloid in Alzheimers disease. This raises the question whether ASC participates to additional aggregation proteinopathies. Here we show that ASC controls the extent of inflammation-related AA amyloidosis, a systemic disease caused by the aggregation of the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA). Using superresolution microscopy, we found that ASC colocalized tightly with SAA in human AA amyloidosis. Purified recombinant ASC specks accelerated SAA fibril formation in vitro. Mass spectrometry after limited proteolysis showed that ASC interacts with SAA via its pyrin domain. In a murine model of inflammation-related AA amyloidosis, splenic AA amyloid load was conspicuously decreased in Pycardtm1Vmd/tm1Vmd mice which lack ASC. This reduction was not a consequence of enhanced amyloid phagocytosis, as SAA stimulation increased phagocytic activity in Asc+/+, but not in Asc-/- macrophages. Treatment with anti-ASC antibodies decreased the amyloid loads and attenuated the body-weight loss of wild-type mice suffering from AA amyloidosis. The prevalence of natural anti-ASC IgG (-logEC50 [&ge;] 2) in 19,334 hospital patients was <0.01%, suggesting that anti-ASC antibody treatment modalities would not be confounded by natural autoimmunity. These findings expand the role played by ASC to extraneural proteinopathies of humans and experimental animals and suggest that anti-ASC immunotherapy may contribute to resolving such diseases.",

    "abstract": "Leeches play important roles in food webs due to their abundance, diversity and feeding habits. Studies using invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) extracted from leech gut contents to target vertebrate DNA have focused on the Indo-Pacific region and mainly leveraged the leech family Haemadipsidae, composed of haematophagous terrestrial leeches, while the aquatic haematophagous, liquidosomatophagous and macrophagous counterparts have largely been disregarded. While there is general knowledge regarding the taxonomic groups that leeches prefer to feed on, detailed taxonomic resolution is still missing and therefore, their potential use for monitoring animals is not known. In this study, 116 non-haemadipsid leeches belonging to 12 species and spanning the three feeding habits were collected in Mexico and Canada. We used DNA metabarcoding to investigate their diet and assess their potential use for vertebrate monitoring. We detected vertebrate taxa from five orders including fish, turtles and birds in the diet of the aquatic haematophagous leeches; eight invertebrate orders of annelids, arthropods and molluscs in the liquidosomatophagous leeches; and ten orders of invertebrates belonging to Arthropoda and Annelida, as well as one vertebrate and one parasitic nematode, in the macrophagous leeches. These results show the potential use of iDNA from the gut content of aquatic haematophagous leeches for retrieving vertebrate taxa, and from macrophagous and liquidosomatophagous counterparts for invertebrates. Our study provides information about the dietary range of the freshwater leeches and the non-haemadipsid terrestrial leech and proof-of-concept for the use of non-haemadipsid leeches for animal monitoring, expanding our knowledge of the use of iDNA from leech gut contents to North America.",

    "abstract": "Land-use intensification imposes selective pressures that systematically change the frequency of wild population phenotypes. Growing evidence is biased towards the comparison of populations from discrete categories of land uses, ignoring the role of landscape emerging properties on the phenotype selection of wild fauna. Across the largest urban-rural gradient of the Colombian Orinoquia, we measured ecomorphological traits of 216 individuals of the Flat-faced Fruit-eating Bat Artibeus planirostris, to evaluate the scale of effect at which landscape transformation better predicts changes in phenotype and abundance of an urban-tolerant species. Forest percentage at 1.25 km was the main predictor affecting abundance, wing aspect ratio, and body mass of this phyllostomid; but the direction of the effect differed between abundance and ecomorphological traits. Although landscape factors explained changes in the forearm length at all spatial scales, the effect was sex-dependent and the most important predictor was forest percentage at 0.5 km. Our results indicate that landscape elements and spatial scale interact to shape ecomorphological traits and the abundance of A. planirostris. Interestingly, the scale of effect was congruent among all biological responses. A pattern that likely arises since species abundance can reflect the variation on phenotype under different environmental filters across landscape scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) cell culture devices are often fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) because it is biocompatible, transparent, elastomeric, and oxygen permeable; however, hydrophobic small molecules can absorb to PDMS, which makes it challenging to predict drug responses. Here, we describe a combined simulation and experimental approach to predict the spatial and temporal concentration profile of a drug under continuous dosing in a PDMS Organ Chip containing two parallel channels separated by a porous membrane that is lined with cultured cells, without prior knowledge of its log P value. First, a three-dimensional finite element simulation of drug loss into the chip was developed that incorporates absorption, adsorption, convection, and diffusion, which predicts changes in drug levels over time and space as a function of potential PDMS diffusion coefficients and log P values. By then experimentally measuring the diffusivity of the compound in PDMS and determining its partition coefficient through mass spectrometric analysis of the drug concentration in the channel outflow, it is possible to estimate the effective log P range of the compound. The diffusion and partition coefficients were experimentally derived for the antimalarial drug and potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic, amodiaquine, and incorporated into the model to quantitatively predict the drug-specific concentration profile over time measured in human Lung Airway Chips lined with bronchial epithelium interfaced with pulmonary microvascular endothelium. The same strategy can be applied to any device geometry, surface treatment, or in vitro microfluidic model to predict the spatial and temporal gradient of a drug in 3D without prior knowledge of the partition coefficient or the rate of diffusion in PDMS. Thus, this approach may expand the use of PDMS Organ Chip devices for various forms of drug testing.",

    "abstract": "Fertilization is the fundamental process that initiates the development of a new individual in all sexually reproducing species. Despite its importance, our understanding of the molecular players that govern mammalian sperm-egg interaction is incomplete, partly because many of the essential factors found in non-mammalian species do not have obvious mammalian homologs. We have recently identified the Ly6/uPAR protein Bouncer as a new, essential fertilization factor in zebrafish (Herberg et al., 2018). Here, we show that Bouncers homolog in mammals, SPACA4, is also required for efficient fertilization in mice. In contrast to fish, where Bouncer is expressed specifically in the egg, SPACA4 is expressed exclusively in the sperm. Male knockout mice are severely sub-fertile, and sperm lacking SPACA4 fail to fertilize wild-type eggs in vitro. Interestingly, removal of the zona pellucida rescues the fertilization defect of Spaca4-deficient sperm in vitro, indicating that SPACA4 is not required for the interaction of sperm and the oolemma but rather of sperm and zona pellucida. Our work identifies SPACA4 as an important sperm protein necessary for zona pellucida penetration during mammalian fertilization.",

By constructing classifiers that predict in which tissues enhancers are active, we are able to identify sequence features that might be recognized by the cell in order to regulate gene expression. While classification performances vary greatly between tissues, we show examples where our classifiers correctly predict tissue specific regulation from sequence alone. We also show that many of the informative patterns indeed harbor transcription factor footprints.",

The hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) may control escape, as it is activated by escape-inducing threats and projects to the region most implicated in flight, the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We show that in mice cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing PMd cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Lastly, human fMRI data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increased activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd as a central node of the escape network.",

    "abstract": "Pyk2 is a Ca2+-activated non-receptor tyrosine kinase enriched in the forebrain, especially in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Previous reports suggested its role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory but with contradictory findings possibly due to experimental conditions. Here we address this issue and show that novel object location, a simple test of spatial memory induced by a single training session, is altered in Pyk2 KO mice and that re-expression of Pyk2 in the dorsal hippocampus corrects this deficit. Bilateral targeted deletion of Pyk2 in dorsal hippocampus CA1 region also alters novel object location. Long term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 is impaired in Pyk2 KO mice using a high frequency stimulation induction protocol nut not with a theta burst protocol, explaining differences between previous reports. The same selective LTP alteration is observed in mice with Pyk2 deletion in dorsal hippocampus CA1 region. Thus, our results establish the role of Pyk2 in specific aspects of spatial memory and synaptic plasticity and show the dependence of the phenotype on the type of experiments used to reveal it. In combination with other studies they provide evidence for a selective role of non-receptor tyrosine kinases in specific aspects of hippocampal neurons synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Social interactions rely on the ability to interpret semantic and emotional information, often from multiple sensory modalities. In human and nonhuman primates, both the auditory and visual modalities are used to generate and interpret communicative signals. In individuals with autism, not only are there deficits in social communication, but in the integration of audio-visual information. At present, we know little about the neural mechanisms that subserve the interpretation of complex social events, including the audio-visual integration that is often required with accompanying communicative signals. Based on heart rate estimates and fMRI in two macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we show that individuals systematically associate affiliative facial expressions or social scenes with corresponding affiliative vocalizations, aggressive facial expressions or social scenes with corresponding aggressive vocalizations and escape visual scenes with scream vocalizations. In contrast, vocalizations that are incompatible with the visual information are fully suppressed, suggesting top-down regulation over the processing of sensory input. The process of binding audio-visual semantic and contextual information relies on a core functional network involving the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and lateral sulcus (LS). Peak activations in both sulci co-localize with face or voice patches that have been previously described. While all of these regions of interest (ROIs) respond to both auditory and visual information, LS ROIs have a preference for auditory and audio-visual congruent stimuli while STS ROIs equally respond to auditory, visual and audio-visual congruent stimuli. To further specify the cortical network involved in the control of this semantic association, we performed a whole brain gPPI functional connectivity analysis on the LS and STS cumulated ROIs. This gPPI analysis highlights a functional network connected to the LS and STS, involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), area 46 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the insular cortex and subcortically, the amygdala and the hippocampus. Comparing human and macaque results, we propose that the integration of audio-visual information for congruent, meaningful social events involves homologous neural circuitry, specifically, an emotional network composed of the STS, LS, ACC, OFC, and limbic areas, including the amygdala, and an attentional network including the STS, LS, IPS and DLPFC. As such, these networks are critical to the amodal representation of social meaning, thereby providing an explanation for some of deficits observed in autism.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian olfactory system, crosstalk among diverse olfactory signals is minimized through labelled line coding: individual neurons express one or few olfactory receptors among those encoded in the genome. Labelled line coding allows for separation of stimuli during mammalian olfactory signal transduction, however, in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, 1,300 olfactory receptors are primarily expressed in only 32 neurons, precluding this strategy. Here we report genetic, pharmacological and behavioural evidence that {beta}-arrestin-mediated desensitization of olfactory receptors, working downstream of the kinase GRK-1, enables discrimination between intra-neuronal olfactory stimuli, but that this discrimination relies on quantitative, rather than qualitative differences in signalling. Our findings suggest that C. elegans exploits {beta}-arrestin desensitization to maximize responsiveness to novel odors, allowing for behaviourally appropriate responses to olfactory stimuli despite the large number of olfactory receptors signalling in single cells. This represents a fundamentally different solution to the problem of olfactory discrimination than that which evolved in mammals, allowing for economical use of an extremely limited number of sensory neurons.",

Here we show that Vangl2-Pk3 association is inhibited by Frizzled3 (Fz3), a core PCP protein that is specifically expressed in the neuroectoderm and is essential for the establishment of PCP in this tissue. Proximity biotinylation and crosslinking studies revealed that the Vangl2-Pk3 interaction is suppressed by overexpressed Fz3, but enhanced in Fz3 morphants. In addition, Fz3 induced Vangl2 phosphorylation on T76 and T78, and this phosphorylation was required for Fz3-mediated inhibition of Vangl2-Pk3 complex formation. Consistent with this observation, the complex of Pk3 with nonphosphorylatable Vangl2 was not polarized in the neural plate. These findings provide evidence for in vivo regulation of the Vangl2-Pk3 complex formation and localization by a Frizzled receptor.",

    "abstract": "Chronic hyperglycemia has been linked to various long-term metabolic disruptions in adults, such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and diabetic retinopathy. According to the 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Report, 10.5% of the US population has diabetes and may be susceptible to long-term complications if blood glucose is not tightly regulated. Further, in 2018, 7.6% of US pregnancies were affected by gestational diabetes, with an average of 1-14% annually [1]. During pregnancy, glucose can pass through the placental barrier, and plays an important role in fetal development and survival. However, excess maternal glucose can also result in diabetic embryopathy. While many studies have examined the teratogenic effects of maternal diabetes on fetal heart development, little is known about the consequences of maternal hyperglycemia on the development of the embryonic retina. To address this question, we investigated retinal cell type differentiation and survival in both a genetic and nutritional model of embryonic hyperglycemia in zebrafish. Strikingly, we found that hyperglycemic larvae displayed a significant reduction in rod and cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells, whereas other retinal neurons were not affected. We also observed signs of reactive gliosis in the retinal Muller cells, as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in hyperglycemic retinas. Hyperglycemic larvae displayed altered expression of metabolism related genes and had a slower optokinetic response than normoglycemic larvae, indicating altered visual function. Further analysis of early events in retinogenesis revealed a delay in retinal cell differentiation at 48 hpf in hyperglycemic embryos, that coincided with an increase in reactive oxygen species. Taken together, our results suggest that embryonic hyperglycemia results in abnormal retinal cell development via altered timing of retinal cell differentiation and ROS production, which is accompanied by visual defects. As the population with diabetes continues to grow, it is imperative to pinpoint the effects of embryonic hyperglycemia on retinal development. Further studies using zebrafish models of hyperglycemia will allow us to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, which could aid in the development of therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Precisely regulated cell death plays a critical role in normal development and is controlled by the balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals. In Drosophila, transcription of the clustered cell death activators grim and reaper is turned on in the developing nervous system to eliminate neural stem cells at the end of embryonic development. This transcription is activated by a pulse of the Hox gene abdominal-A. We show here that the Sox2 homologue Dichaete inhibits neural stem cell death when overexpressed, and loss of Dichaete promotes premature neural stem cell death. The anti-apoptotic activity of Dichaete opposes the pro-apoptotic factors abdominal-A, as well as the transcription factor grainyhead. The function of all three genes impinge on an enhancer that regulates the transcription of grim and reaper. Furthermore, we find that the balance between abdominal-A and Dichaete is likely to regulate the death of other cells during development, including cells in the developing midline, the developing hindgut, and in the early abdominal epidermis. Loss of Dichaete results in premature death in these tissues. This death can be rescued by the deletion of the enhancer region between grim and reaper. These data suggest that Dichaete functions to inhibit cell death activated by abdominal-A in multiple developmental contexts.",

    "abstract": "Despite several discoveries in recent years, the physiology of acidophilic Micrarchaeota remains largely enigmatic. \"Candidatus Micrarchaeum harzensis A_DKE\", for example, highly expresses numerous genes encoding hypothetical proteins and their function is difficult to elucidate due to a lacking genetic system. Still, not even the intracellular pH value of A_DKE is known, and heterologous production attempts are generally missing so far. Hence, A_DKEs isocitrate dehydrogenase (MhIDH) was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli and purified for bio-chemical characterisation. MhIDH appeared to be specific for NADP+, yet promiscuous regarding divalent cations as cofactors. Kinetic studies showed KM-values of 53.03{+/-}5.63 {micro}M and 1.94{+/-}0.12 mM and kcat-values of 38.48{+/-}1.62 s-1 and 43.99{+/-}1.46 s-1 for DL-isocitrate and NADP+, respectively. MhIDHs exceptionally low affinity for NADP+, potentially limiting its reaction rate, can be likely attributed to the presence of a proline residue in the NADP+ binding-pocket, which might cause a decrease in hydrogen bonding of the cofactor and a distortion of local secondary structure. Furthermore, a pH optimum of 7.89 implies, that A_DKE applies potent mechanisms of proton homoeostasis, to maintain a slightly alkaline cytosolic milieu in a highly acidic environment.",

Accurate quantification of the two-step splicing kinetics is of high interests not only for understanding the regulatory machinery, but also for estimating the RNA velocity in single cells. However, the kinetic rates remain poorly understood due to the intrinsic low content of unspliced RNAs and its stochasticity across contexts. Here, we estimated the relative splicing efficiency across a variety of single-cell RNA-Seq data with scVelo. We further extracted three large feature sets including 92 basic genomic sequence features, 65,536 octamers and 120 RNA binding proteins features and found they are highly predictive to RNA splicing efficiency across multiple tissues on human and mouse. A set of important features have been identified with strong regulatory potentials on splicing efficiency. This predictive power brings promise to reveal the complexity of RNA processing and to enhance the estimation of single-cell RNA velocity.",

Results indicated that most of the Rumex biotypes were found resistant against sulfosulfuron + metsulfuron application. Majority of biotypes were moderately controlled by the application of halauxifen. Carfentrazone + metsulfuron effectively controlled the Rumex spp. and provided 70-90 % control to all biotypes at double of the recommended dose.

Here, we experimentally test that possibility using wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). First, we used natural and playback-simulated foraging displacements to demonstrate that bystanders take notice of the vocalisations produced during such within-group conflict events. We then used another playback experiment to assess delayed effects of within-group conflict on grooming interactions. Overall, fewer individuals groomed on evenings following an afternoon of simulated conflict, but those that did groomed more than on control evenings. Subordinate bystanders groomed with the simulated aggressor significantly less, and groomed more with one another, on conflict compared to control evenings. Our study provides experimental evidence that dwarf mongooses acoustically obtain information about within-group contests (including protagonist identity), retain that information and use it to inform conflict-management decisions with a temporal delay.",

    "abstract": "Negative Urgency (NU) is a prominent risk factor for hazardous alcohol use. While research has helped elucidate how NU relates to neurobiological functioning with respect to alcohol use, no known work has contextualized such functioning within existing neurobiological theories in addiction. Therefore, we elucidated mechanisms contributing to the NU-hazardous alcohol use relationship by combining NU theories with neurobiological dual models of addiction, which posit addiction is related to cognitive control and reinforcement processing. Fifty-five undergraduates self-reported NU and hazardous alcohol use. We recorded EEG while participants performed a reinforced flanker task. We measured cognitive control using N2 activation time-locked to the incongruent flanker stimulus, and we measured reinforcement processing using the feedback-related negativity (FRN) time-locked to better-than-expected negative reinforcement feedback. We modeled hazardous drinking using hierarchical regression, with NU, N2, and FRN plus their interactions as predictors. The regression model significantly predicted hazardous alcohol use, and the three-way interaction (NUxN2xFRN) significantly improved model fit. In the context of inefficient processing (i.e., larger N2s and FRNs), NU demonstrated a strong relationship with hazardous alcohol use. In the context of efficient processing (i.e., smaller N2s and FRNs), NU was unrelated to hazardous alcohol use. This analysis provides preliminary evidence that brain mechanisms of cognitive control and reinforcement processing influence the relationship between NU and hazardous alcohol use, and confirms a specific influence of negative reinforcement processing. Future clinical research could leverage these neurobiological moderators for substance misuse treatment.",

Here we introduce ultrasonic bone age assessment to estimate biological maturity and disentangle the independent effects of chronological and biological age on adolescent cognitive abilities. Comparing cognitive performance of participants with different skeletal maturity we uncover the striking impact of biological age on both IQ and specific abilities. We find that biological age has a selective effect on abilities: more mature individuals within the same age group have higher working memory capacity and processing speed, while those with higher chronological age have better verbal abilities, independently of their maturity. Bone age appears to be a surprisingly strong predictor of cognitive abilities, and it seems that a teens IQ is determined by biological age.",

Following photothrombosis of left primary somatosensory forepaw (S1FP) cortex, mice received chronic excitation of right S1FP, a maneuver mimicking the use of the unaffected limb during recovery. Contralesional excitation suppressed perilesional S1FP remapping and was associated with abnormal patterns of evoked activity in the unaffected limb. Contralesional stimulation prevented the restoration of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the S1FP network, RSFC in several networks functionally-distinct from somatomotor regions, and resulted in persistent limb-use asymmetry. In stimulated mice, perilesional tissue exhibited suppressed transcriptional changes in several genes important for recovery. These results suggest that contralesional excitation impedes local and global circuit reconnection through suppression of several neuroplasticity-related genes after stroke.",

Both tasks involved an olfactory reward, thereby allowing us to measure Pavlovian-triggered motivation and sensory pleasure for the same reward within the same participants. Our findings show that different subregions of the ventral striatum are dissociable in their contributions to the motivational and the hedonic component of the affective processing of the reward. Parsing the neural mechanisms and the interplay between Pavlovian incentive processes and hedonic processes might have important implications for understanding compulsive reward-seeking behaviors such as addiction, binge eating, or gambling.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have demonstrated less favourable childhood outcomes in infants born in early term (37-38 weeks gestation) compared to those born at full term (40-41 weeks gestation). While this could be due to higher perinatal morbidity, gestational age at birth may also have a direct effect on the brain and subsequent neurodevelopment in term-born babies. Here we characterise structural brain correlates of gestational age at birth in healthy term-born neonates and their relationship to later neurodevelopmental outcome. We used T2 and diffusion weighted Magnetic Resonance Images acquired in the neonatal period from a cohort (n=454) of healthy babies born at term age (>37 weeks gestation) and scanned between 1 and 41 days after birth. Images were analysed using tensor based morphometry (TBM) and tract based spatial statistics (TBSS). Neurodevelopment was subsequently assessed at age 18 months using the Bayley-III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, and the effects of gestational age at birth and related neuroimaging findings on outcome were analysed with linear regression. Infants born earlier had areas of higher relative ventricular volume, and lower relative brain volume in the basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. Earlier birth was also associated with lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean, axial and radial diffusivity in major white matter tracts. Gestational age at birth was positively associated with all Bayley-III subscales at age 18 months. Linear regression models predicting outcome from gestational age at birth were significantly improved by adding neuroimaging features associated with gestational age at birth. This work adds to the growing body of evidence of the impact of early term birth and highlights the importance of considering the effect of gestational age at birth in future neuroimaging studies including term-born babies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe kingdom fungi is crucial for life on earth and is highly diverse. Yet fungi are challenging to characterize. They can be difficult to culture and may be morphologically indistinct in culture. They can have complex genomes of over 1 Gb in size and are still underrepresented in whole genome sequence databases. Overall their description and analysis lags far behind other microbes such as bacteria. At the same time, classification of species via high throughput sequencing without prior purification is increasingly becoming the norm for pathogen detection, microbiome studies, and environmental monitoring. However, standardized procedures for characterizing unknown fungi from complex sequencing data have not yet been established.\n\nResultsWe compared different metagenomics sequencing and analysis strategies for the identification of fungal species. Using two fungal mock communities of 44 phylogenetically diverse species, we compared species classification and community composition analysis pipelines using shotgun metagenomics and amplicon sequencing data generated from both short and long read sequencing technologies. We show that regardless of the sequencing methodology used, the highest accuracy of species identification was achieved by sequence alignment against a fungi-specific database. During the assessment of classification algorithms, we found that applying cut-offs to the query coverage of each read or contig significantly improved the classification accuracy and community composition analysis without significant data loss.\n\nConclusionOverall, our study expands the toolkit for identifying fungi by improving sequence-based fungal classification, and provides a practical guide for the design of metagenomics analyses.",

    "abstract": "In the thymus, the thymic epithelium provides a microenvironment essential for the development of functionally competent and self-tolerant T cells. Previous findings showed that modulation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) disrupts embryonic thymus organogenesis. However, the role of {beta}-catenin in TECs for postnatal T cell development remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) of {beta}-catenin highly specific in TECs. We found that GOF of {beta}-catenin in TECs results in severe thymic dysplasia and T cell deficiency beginning from the embryonic period. By contrast, LOF of {beta}-catenin in TECs reduces the number of cortical TECs and thymocytes modestly and only postnatally. These results indicate that fine-tuning of {beta}-catenin expression within a permissive range is required for TECs to generate an optimal microenvironment to support postnatal T cell development.",

    "abstract": "Isolation of antibodies from the egg yolk of chickens is of particular interest as a source of specific antibodies for oral administration to prevent infections and use them as immunodiagnostic reagents. The use of birds in antibody production results in a reduction in the use of laboratory animals. Immunized chickens produce larger quantities of antibodies (2000 mg IgY/month) than rodents (200 mg IgG/month) in the laboratory. According to Jernes network theory, it is possible to produce an antibody against the antigen-binding site of another antibody. This study assessed the hypothesis that immunization with viral peptides (immunogens) could provide a potent immune response that could be evaluated in chicken eggs. Human immunodeficiency virus 1(HIV-1) is used as an immunogen. The second hypothesis was that an orally administered antibody stimulates the production of a complementary antibody, the so-called anti-idiotypic antibody, which can potentially be therapeutical. This study reports and analyzes the use of eggs as therapeutic agents. We wanted to test the hypothesis that feeding chicks with hyperimmune eggs stimulates the production of anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies that neutralize the original HIV antigen fragments 308-331 or 421-438 of gp120 or fragment 579-601 of gp41. Future research could entail an anti-idiotype strategy for prophylactic vaccines. It is vital to note that it may need an anti-idiotype response to prime immunity against an HIV viral epitope, which may be used as a secondary element. The use of anti-idiotype immune responses in infected individuals may shift the balance of the immune system, allowing the organism to manage HIV infection. Therefore, it may be an avenue for immunotherapy to improve the fight against HIV infections. However, more studies and clinical trials are required to demonstrate similar human immune responses as observed in birds.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are organelles with their own genomes, but they rely on the import of nuclear-encoded proteins that are translated by cytosolic ribosomes. Therefore, it is important to understand whether failures in the mitochondrial uptake of these nuclear-encoded proteins can cause proteotoxic stress and identify response mechanisms that may counteract it. Here, we report that upon impairments in mitochondrial protein import, high-risk precursor and immature forms of mitochondrial proteins form aberrant deposits in the cytosol. These deposits then cause further cytosolic accumulation and consequently aggregation of other mitochondrial proteins and disease-related proteins, including -synuclein and amyloid {beta}. This aggregation triggers a cytosolic protein homeostasis imbalance that is accompanied by specific molecular chaperone responses at both the transcriptomic and protein levels. Altogether, our results provide evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically protein import defects, contributes to impairments in protein homeostasis, thus revealing a possible molecular mechanism by which mitochondria are involved in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Beamforming is one of the most commonly used source reconstruction methods for magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG). One underlying assumption, however, is that distant sources are uncorrelated and here we tested whether this is an appropriate model for the human hippocampal data. We revised the Empirical Bayesian Beamfomer (EBB) to accommodate specific a-priori correlated source models. We showed in simulation that we could use model evidence (as approximated by Free Energy) to distinguish between different correlated and uncorrelated source scenarios. Using group MEG data in which the participants performed a hippocampal-dependent task, we explored the possibility that the hippocampus or the cortex or both were correlated in their activity across hemispheres. We found that incorporating a correlated hippocampal source model significantly improved model evidence. Our findings help to explain why, up until now, the majority of MEG-reported hippocampal activity (typically making use of beamformers) has been estimated as unilateral.",
