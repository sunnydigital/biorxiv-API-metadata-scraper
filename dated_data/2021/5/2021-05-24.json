    "abstract": "Nicotine is one of the most important secondary metabolites in tobacco, and its biosynthesis can be induced by topping and jasmonic acid treatment. NtMYC2s play pivotal roles in the regulation of nicotine. The mediator server as a bridge betwen the transcription factors and RNA polymerase in order to facilitates transcription and functions in plants. However, the role of mediator in the regulation of nicotine biosynthesis remains unknown. In this study, we firstly identify the NtMED25 through homologous analysis. NtMED25 interacts with NtMYC2s through the MD region. Interestingly, the nicotine content is decreased in the the knock-down transgenic lines of NtMED25, and the expression levels of two nicotine biosynthesis genes, NtQPT2 and NtPMT2, are also reduced when compared with that in the wild-type plants. Furthermore, NtMED25 enhances the binding of NtMYC2a/ NtMYC2b to the promoter of NtPMT2 and NtQPT2, and then facilitates the nicotine biosynthesis. Therefore, our study revealed the function of mediator in the regulation of nicotine, and provide the insight role on the transcriptional regulation of plant secondary metabolites.",

    "abstract": "The formation of a diploid zygote is a highly complex cellular process that is entirely controlled by maternal gene products stored in the egg cytoplasm. This highly specialized transcriptional program is tightly controlled at the chromatin level in the female germline. As an extreme case in point, the massive and specific ovarian expression of the essential thioredoxin Deadhead (DHD) is critically regulated in Drosophila by the histone demethylase Lid and its partner, the histone deacetylase complex scaffold Sin3A, via yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we identified the Brahma chromatin remodeler sub-unit Snr1 and the insulator component Mod(mdg4) as essential for dhd expression and investigated how these epigenomic effectors act with Lid and Sin3A to hyperactivate dhd. Using Cut&Run chromatin profiling with a dedicated data analysis procedure, we found that dhd is intriguingly embedded in an H3K27me3/H3K9me3-enriched mini-domain flanked by DNA regulatory elements, including a dhd promoter-proximal element essential for its expression. Surprisingly, Lid, Sin3A, Snr1 and Mod(mdg4) impact H3K27me3 and this regulatory element in distinct manners. However, we show that these effectors activate dhd independently of H3K27me3/H3K9me3, and that these marks are not required to repress dhd. Together, our study demonstrates an atypical and critical role for chromatin regulators Lid, Sin3A, Snr1 and Mod(mdg4) to trigger tissue-specific hyperactivation within a unique heterochromatin mini-domain.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGene expression is tightly regulated by conserved protein complexes that act at the chromatin level to allow or restrict transcription. Such epigenetic control of gene activity defines the identity of different cell types during development, as well as their response to environmental cues. Yet, how multiple chromatin factors converge to achieve precise gene regulation remains difficult to address, partly due to the lack of biological situations where these intricate relationships can be studied. In this paper, we have addressed this issue by dissecting the regulation of deadhead, an essential gene specifically and massively expressed in the Drosophila germline. Unexpectedly, we found that its hyperactivation occurs despite deadhead being embedded in an apparently unfavorable chromatin mini-domain, notably featuring repressive histone modifications. We further demonstrate that four chromatin effectors, Lid, Sin3A, Snr1 and Mod(mdg4), have distinct, atypical and essential roles to ensure deadhead expression within this chromatin environment. Together, our findings put into perspective our understanding on these regulatory factors by illustrating how they can exert a biologically essential function via non-canonical mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Over-representation analysis (ORA) is one of the commonest pathway analysis approaches used for the functional interpretation of metabolomics datasets. Despite the widespread use of ORA in metabolomics, the community lacks guidelines detailing its best-practice use. Many factors have a pronounced impact on the results, but to date their effects have received little systematic attention in the field. We developed in-silico simulations using five publicly available datasets and illustrated that changes in parameters, such as the background set, differential metabolite selection methods, and pathway database choice, could all lead to profoundly different ORA results. The use of a non-assay-specific background set, for example, resulted in large numbers of false-positive pathways. Pathway database choice, evaluated using three of the most popular metabolic pathway databases: KEGG, Reactome, and BioCyc, led to vastly different results in both the number and function of significantly enriched pathways. Metabolomics data specific factors, such as reliability of compound identification and assay chemical bias also impacted ORA results. Simulated metabolite misidentification rates as low as 4% resulted in both gain of false-positive pathways and loss of truly significant pathways across all datasets. Our results have several practical implications for ORA users, as well as those using alternative pathway analysis methods. We offer a set of recommendations for the use of ORA in metabolomics, alongside a set of minimal reporting guidelines, as a first step towards the standardisation of pathway analysis in metabolomics.\n\nAuthor summaryMetabolomics is a rapidly growing field of study involving the profiling of small molecules within an organism. It allows researchers to understand the effects of biological status (such as health or disease) on cellular biochemistry, and has wide-ranging applications, from biomarker discovery and personalised medicine in healthcare to crop protection and food security in agriculture. Pathway analysis helps to understand which biological pathways, representing collections of molecules performing a particular function, are involved in response to a disease phenotype, or drug treatment, for example. Over-representation analysis (ORA) is perhaps the most common pathway analysis method used in the metabolomics community. However, ORA can give drastically different results depending on the input data and parameters used. In this work, we have established the effects of these factors on ORA results using computational simulations applied to five real-world datasets. Based on our results, we offer the research community a set of best-practice recommendations applicable not only to ORA but also to other pathway analysis methods to help ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the secondary, i.e. base-pairing structure of a folded RNA strand is an important problem in synthetic and computational biology. First-principle algorithmic approaches to this task are challenging because existing models of the folding process are inaccurate, and even if a perfect model existed, finding an optimal solution would be in general NP-complete. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective data-driven approach. We represent RNA sequences in the form of three-dimensional tensors in which we encode possible relations between all pairs of bases in a given sequence. We then use a convolutional neural network to predict a two-dimensional map which represents the correct pairings between the bases. Our model achieves significant accuracy improvements over existing methods on two standard datasets. Our experiments show excellent performance of the model across a wide range of sequence lengths and RNA families. We also observe considerable improvements in predicting complex pseudoknotted RNA structures, as compared to previous approaches.\n\nAuthor summaryStructure prediction for RNA sequences is a computationally difficult task that is of increasing importance in applications such as medical diagnostics and drug design; this is because the structure of a folded RNA strand to a large extent defines its function. An open RNA strand can fold to many different structures of varying thermal stability, and the goal of structure prediction is to determine a most stable one among these. There are two main difficulties to this task. Firstly, a given RNA sequence can fold into an enormous number of alternative structures, and a computational search for a most stable one in this huge space can be very demanding. The search can however be facilitated by using heuristics that take into account some underlying principles of the folding process. Here is where machine learning methods come into play: they are suitable for discovering patterns in data, and can thus predict features of the desired structure based on previously learned patterns. Secondly, there do not yet exist fully satisfactory coarse-grained models for the most popular metric for stability, the free energy of the folded structure. Although in principle a minimum free energy (MFE) structure should be a good candidate for a most stable one, MFE structures determined according to current energy models do not match experimental data on native RNA conformations very well. We show how to use an artificial neural network design to predict the structure for a given RNA sequence with high accuracy only by learning from samples whose native structures have been experimentally characterized, independent of any stability metric or energy model.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies bind foreign antigens with high affinity and specificity leading to their neutralization and/or clearance by the immune system. The conserved N-glycan on IgG has significant impact on antibody effector function, with the endoglycosidases of Streptococcus pyogenes deglycosylating the IgG to evade the immune system, a process catalyzed by the endoglycosidase EndoS2. Studies have shown that two of the four domains of EndoS2, the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) and the glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain site are critical for catalytic activity. To yield structural insights into contributions of the CBM and the GH domains, as well as the overall flexibility of EndoS2, to the proteins catalytic activity, models of EndoS2-Fc complexes were generated through enhanced-sampling molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation and site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) docking followed by reconstruction and long-time MD simulations. Modeling results predict that EndoS2 initially interacts with the IgG through its CBM followed by interactions with the GH yielding catalytically competent states. These may involve the CBM and GH of EndoS2 simultaneously interacting with either the same Fc CH2/CH3 domain or individually with the two Fc CH2/CH3 domains, with EndoS2 predicted to assume closed conformations in the former case and open conformations in the latter. Apo EndoS2 is predicted to sample both the open and closed states, suggesting that either complex can directly form following initial IgG-EndoS2 encounter. Interactions of the CBM and GH domains with the IgG are predicted to occur through both its glycan and protein regions. Simulations also predict that the Fc glycan can directly transfer from the CBM to the GH, facilitating formation of catalytically competent complexes. The predicted models are compared and consistent with Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange data. In addition, the complex models are consistent with the high specificity of EndoS2 for the glycans on IgG supporting the validity of the predicted models.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes uses the endoglycosidases S and S2 to cleave the glycans on the Fc portion of IgG antibodies, leading to a decreased cytotoxicity of the antibodies, thereby evading the host immune response. To identify potential structures of the complex of EndoS2 with IgG that could lead to the catalytic hydrolysis of the IgG glycan, molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations were applied. The resulting structural models predict that EndoS2 initially interacts through its carbohydrate binding module (CBM) with the IgG with subsequent interactions with the catalytic glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain yielding stable complexes. In the modeled complexes the CBM and the GH interact either simultaneously with the same Fc CH2/CH3 domain or with the two individual Fc CH2/CH3 domains separately to yield potentially catalytically competent species. In addition, apo EndoS2 is shown to assume both open and closed conformations allowing it to directly form either type of complex from which deglycosylation of either mono- or diglycosylated IgG species may occur.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=99 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/445403v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15ffa95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c8032org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@452bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3f85a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Models of collective behaviour have been proved helpful in revealing what mechanism may underlie characteristics of a flock of birds, a school of fish, and a swarm of herds. Recently, the metric-free model gradually occupies a dominant position in the research field of collective intelligence. Most of these models endow every single individual with the ability of a global visual field, which can offer each particle sufficient external information. In this paper, we mainly focus on whether the global visual field is necessary to form a consistent and cohesive group or not. Inspired by the biological characteristic of starlings, we develop a three-dimensional restricted visual field metric-free(RVFMF) model based on Pearce and Turners previous work. We further investigate several vital factors governing the convergent consistency of the RVFMF model with the assistance of extensive numerical simulations. According to the simulation results, we conclude that the best view angle of each particle in a swarm increases with the expansion of the population size. Besides, the best view angle gradually becomes stable around 155 degrees when the population size is larger than 1000. We also offer quantitative analysis data to prove that a flock of birds could obtain better consistency under optimal restricted visual field than under global visual field.",

    "abstract": "Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is a common infection that complicates a wide range of medical conditions which can cause either mild or severe disease depending on the patient. The pathobiology of OPC shares many features with candidal biofilms of abiotic surfaces. The transcriptional regulation of C. albicans formation of biofilms on abiotic surfaces has been extensively characterized and involves six key transcription factors (Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, Bcr1, Brg1, and Tec1). To determine whether this same in vitro biofilm transcriptional regulatory network played a role in OPC, we have carried out the first systematic genetic interaction analysis in a mouse model of C. albicans infection. Whereas all six transcription factors are required for in vitro biofilm formation, only three homozygous deletion mutants (tec1{Delta}{Delta}, bcr1{Delta}{Delta}, and rob1{Delta}{Delta}) and one heterozygous mutant (tec1{Delta}/TEC1) have reduced infectivity in a mouse model of OPC, indicating the network is more robust in vivo than in vitro. Although single mutants (heterozygous or homozygous) of BRG1 and EFG1 have no effect on fungal burden, the double heterozygous and homozygous mutants have dramatically reduced infectivity, indicating a critical genetic interaction between these two transcription factors. Using epistasis analysis, we have formulated a genetic circuit [EFG1+BRG1][-&gt;]TEC1[-&gt;]BCR1 that is required for OPC infectivity and oral epithelial cell endocytosis. Surprisingly, we also found transcription factor mutants with in vitro defects in filamentation such as efg1{Delta}{Delta} and brg1{Delta}{Delta} filament during oral infection and that decreased filamentation did not correlate with decreased infectivity. Taken together, these data indicate that key in vitro biofilm transcription factors are involved in OPC but that the network characteristics and functional connections are remodeled significantly during interactions with tissues.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe pathology of oral candidiasis has features of biofilm formation, a well-studied process in vitro. Based on that analogy, we hypothesized that network of transcription factors that regulates in vitro biofilm formation might have similarities and differences in during oral infection. To test this, we employed the first systematic genetic interaction analysis of C. albicans in a mouse model of oropharyngeal infection. This revealed that the six regulators involved in in vitro biofilm formation played roles in vivo but that the functional connections between factors were quite distinct. Surprisingly, we also found that, while many of the factors are required for filamentation in vitro, none of the transcription factor deletion mutants was deficient for this key virulence trait in vivo. These observations clearly demonstrate that C. albicans regulates key aspects of its biology differently in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) uses powerful molecular machines to package its genome into a viral capsid employing ATP as fuel. Although, recent bioinformatics and structural studies have revealed detailed mechanism of DNA packaging, little is known about the mechanochemistry of genome packaging in small plant viruses such as PLRV. We have identified a novel P-loop-containing ATPase domain with two Walker A-like motifs, two arginine fingers, and two sensor motifs distributed throughout the polypeptide chain of PLRV capsid protein (CP). The composition and arrangement of the ATP binding and hydrolysis domain of PLRV CP is unique and rarely reported. The discovery of the system sheds new light on the mechanism of viral genome packaging, regulation of viral assembly process, and evolution of plant viruses. Here, we used the RNAi approach to suppress CP gene expression, which in turn prevented PLRV genome packaging and assembly in Solanum tuberosum cv. Khufri Ashoka. Potato plants agroinfiltrated with siRNA constructs against the ATPase domain of CP exhibited no rolling symptoms upon PLRV infection, indicating that the silencing of CP gene expression is an efficient method for generating PLRV-resistant potato plants. Moreover, our findings provide a robust approach to generate PLRV-resistant potato plants, which can be further extended to other species. Finally, we propose a new mechanism of genome packaging and assembly in plant viruses.",

Despite this potentially significant role, the effects of soluble phenolic compounds on bog peat C mineralization remain unclear.\n\nWe analyzed this effect by manipulating the concentration of free soluble phenolics in anaerobic bog peat incubations using water-soluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a compound that binds with and inactivates phenolics, preventing phenolic-enzyme interactions. CO2 and CH4 production rates (end-products of C mineralization) correlated positively with PVP concentration following Michaelis-Menten (M.M.) saturation functions. Using M.M. parameters, we determined that soluble phenolics inhibit, at minimum, 57 {+/-} 16% of total C (CO2+CH4) mineralization in the anaerobic incubation conditions studied.

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes vector harmful pathogens that infect millions of people every year, and developing approaches to effectively control mosquitoes is a topic of great interest. However, the success of many control measures is highly dependent upon ecological, physiological, and life history traits of the mosquito species. The behavior of mosquitoes and their potential to vector pathogens can also be impacted by these traits. One trait of interest is mosquito body mass, which depends upon many factors associated with the environment in which juvenile mosquitoes develop. Our experiments examined the impact of larval density on the body mass of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are important vectors of dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and other pathogens. To investigate the interactions between the larval environment and mosquito body mass, we built a discrete time mathematical model that incorporates body mass, larval density, and food availability and fit the model to our experimental data. We considered three categories of model complexity informed by data, and selected the best model within each category using Akaikes Information Criterion. We found that the larval environment is an important determinant of the body mass of mosquitoes upon emergence. Furthermore, we found that larval density has greater impact on body mass of adults at emergence than on development time, and that inclusion of density dependence in the survival of female aquatic stages in models is important. We discuss the implications of our results for the control of Aedes mosquitoes and on their potential to spread disease.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this work we examined how the environment in which young mosquitoes develop affects their adult body size as measured by adult body mass. Adult size has potential impacts on mosquito behavior and the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease. We used a combination of experimental work and mathematical modeling to determine important factors affecting adult mosquito body size. In our model, we incorporated potentially interacting aspects of the mosquito life cycle and traits that affect mosquito growth as juveniles. These aspects include body mass, density of the population, and level of available resource. We compared different models to determine the one that best describes the data. As mass at emergence is linked to the success of adult mosquitoes to produce offspring and to their ability transmit pathogens, we discuss how important influences on development and survival of young mosquitoes affect mosquito control and disease spread.",

    "abstract": "Livestock grazing is one of the major land uses, causing changes in the plant community's structure and grasslands composition. We assessed the effect of grazing intensity on aboveground biomass, species richness, and plant functional group (PFG) diversity in a temperature meadow steppe in Hulunbuir in northern China, involving 78 plant species from eight functional groups. Four grazing intensity classes were characterized, including light, moderate, heavy, and no grazing, based on stocking rates of 0.23, 0.46, 0.92, and 0.00 animal units per hectare. Our results show that the richness of short species, including perennial short grass, perennial short grass, and legume increased under light to moderate grazing, while no effect of grazing was observed on the richness of shrubs. With increasing grazing intensity, the aboveground biomass of perennial tall grasses and perennial tall forbs decreased significantly, while that of annual/biennial plant functional groups increased. The community diversity and evenness of annual/biennial plants increased significantly with grazing intensity. We concluded that heavy grazing has negative impacts on plant functional group richness and aboveground biomass.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell genome sequencing provides a highly granular view of biological systems but is affected by high error rates, allelic amplification bias, and uneven genome coverage. This creates a need for data-specific computational methods, for purposes such as for cell lineage tree inference. The objective of cell lineage tree reconstruction is to infer the evolutionary process that generated a set of observed cell genomes. Lineage trees may enable a better understanding of tumor formation and growth, as well as of organ development for healthy body cells. We describe a method, Scelestial, for lineage tree reconstruction from single-cell data, which is based on an approximation algorithm for the Steiner tree problem and is a generalization of the neighbor-joining method. We adapt the algorithm to efficiently select a limited subset of potential sequences as internal nodes, in the presence of missing values, and to minimize cost by lineage tree-based missing value imputation. In a comparison against seven state-of-the-art single-cell lineage tree reconstruction algorithms - BitPhylogeny, OncoNEM, SCITE, SiFit, SASC, SCIPhI, and SiCloneFit - on simulated and real single-cell tumor samples, Scelestial performed best at reconstructing trees in terms of accuracy and run time. Scelestial has been implemented in C++. It is also available as an R package named RScelestial.",

    "abstract": "While acquired chemoresistance is recognized as a key challenge to treating many types of cancer, the dynamics with which drug sensitivity changes after exposure are poorly characterized. Most chemotherapeutic regimens call for repeated dosing at regular intervals, and if drug sensitivity changes on a similar time scale then the treatment interval could be optimized to improve treatment performance. Theoretical work suggests that such optimal schedules exist, but experimental confirmation has been obstructed by the difficulty of deconvolving the simultaneous processes of death, adaptation, and regrowth taking place in cancer cell populations. Here we present work characterizing dynamic changes in sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in three breast cancer cell lines subjected to treatment schedules varying in concentration, interval between pulse treatments, and number of sequential pulse treatments. Cell populations are monitored longitudinally through automated imaging for 600-800 hours, and this data is used to calibrate a family of cancer growth models derived from the bi-exponential model which characterizes resistant and sensitive subpopulations. We identify a model incorporating both a period of growth arrest in surviving cells and a delay in the death of chemosensitive cells which outperforms the original bi-exponential growth model in Akaike Information Criterion based model selection, and use the calibrated model to quantify the performance of each drug schedule. We find that the inter-treatment interval is a key variable in determining the performance of sequential dosing schedules and identify an optimal retreatment time for each cell line which extends regrowth time by 40%-106%, demonstrating that the time scale of changes in chemosensitivity following doxorubicin exposure allows optimization of drug scheduling by varying this inter-treatment interval.",

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of varieties is paramount to optimizing efficiencies in the management and conservation of genetic resources. A relatively inexpensive, rapid methodology is required to identify putative duplicates from any collection, when morphological traits give insufficient discrimination. Here we select a panel of 36 SNPs, visualized using the Kompetitive Allele-specific PCR (KASP) system. We used a panel of 95 cassava genotypes from Cote dIvoire to identify varieties that are not duplicates and few potential duplicates which could be put forward for further verification. The genetic variability and population structure of the germplasm is also described. 36 SNPs were polymorphic across the panel of 95 varieties with polymorphic information contents ranging from 0.23 to 0.37. Using these SNPs, we were able to identify 66 unique genotypes from the panel of 95 genotypes, discriminate three sets of known duplicates and identify 11 sets of unknown putative duplicates which can be subjected to further verification using higher density genotyping. As expected in an outcrossing species, both expected heterozygosity (0.46) and observed heterozygosity (0.48) were high with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicating that the majority of variation was within individuals. Three statistical approaches i.e., hierarchical ascending clustering, Bayesian analysis and discriminant analysis of principal components were used and all revealed low genetic differentiation between sub-populations, a conclusion that was supported by the low value of the fixation index (0.05). This panel of SNPs can be used to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency of germplasm conservation and enhance quality control at various stages in the breeding process through varietal tracking.",
