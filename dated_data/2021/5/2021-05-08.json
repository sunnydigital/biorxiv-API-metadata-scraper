    "abstract": "Torpor is a state of controlled reduction of metabolic rate (M) in endotherms. Assigning measurements of M to torpor or euthermy can be challenging, especially when the difference between euthermic M and torpid M is small, in species defending a high minimal body temperature in torpor, in thermolabile species, and slightly below the thermoneutral zone (TNZ). Here, we propose a novel method for distinguishing torpor from euthermy. We use the variation in M measured during euthermic rest and torpor at varying ambient temperatures (Ta) to objectively estimate the lower critical temperature (Tlc) of the TNZ and to assign measurements to torpor, euthermic rest or rest within TNZ. In addition, this method allows the prediction of M during euthermic rest and torpor at varying Ta, including resting M within the TNZ. The present method has shown highly satisfactory results using 28 published sets of metabolic data obtained by respirometry on 26 species of mammals. Ultimately, this novel method aims to facilitate analysis of respirometry data in heterothermic endotherms. Finally, the development of the associated R-package (torpor) will enable widespread use of the method amongst biologists.\n\nSummary statementThe presented method and its associated R-package (torpor) enable the assignment of metabolic rate measurements to torpor or euthermy, ultimately improving the standardization of respirometry analyses in heterotherms.",

    "abstract": "In the ocean, viruses impact microbial mortality, regulate biogeochemical cycling, and alter the metabolic potential of microbial lineages. At deep-sea hydrothermal vents, abundant viruses infect a wide range of hosts among the archaea and bacteria that inhabit these dynamic habitats. However, little is known about viral diversity, host range, and biogeography across different vent ecosystems, which has important implications for how viruses manipulate microbial function and evolution. Here, we examined viral diversity, viral and host distribution, and viral-host interactions in microbial metagenomes generated from venting fluids from several vent sites within three different geochemically and geographically distinct hydrothermal systems: Piccard and Von Damm vent fields at the Mid-Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea, and at several vent sites within Axial Seamount in the Pacific Ocean. Analysis of viral sequences and Clustered Regularly InterSpaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) spacers revealed highly diverse viral assemblages and evidence of active infection. Network analysis revealed that viral host range was relatively narrow, with very few viruses infecting multiple microbial lineages. Viruses were largely endemic to individual vent sites, indicating restricted dispersal, and in some cases viral assemblages persisted over time. Thus, we show that hydrothermal vent fluids are home to novel, diverse viral assemblages that are highly localized to specific regions and taxa.\n\nImportanceViruses play important roles in manipulating microbial communities and their evolution in the ocean, yet not much is known about viruses in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. However, viral ecology and evolution are of particular interest in hydrothermal vent habitats because of their unique nature: previous studies have indicated that most viruses in hydrothermal vents are temperate rather than lytic, and it has been established that rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are particularly high among thermophilic vent microbes, and viruses are common vectors for HGT. If viruses have broad host range or are widespread across vent sites, they have increased potential to act as gene-sharing \"highways\" between vent sites. By examining viral diversity, distribution, and infection networks across disparate vent sites, this study provides the opportunity to better characterize and constrain the viral impact on hydrothermal vent microbial communities. We show that viruses in hydrothermal vents are diverse and apparently active, but most have restricted host range and are not widely distributed among vent sites. Thus, the impacts of viral infection are likely to be highly localized and constrained to specific taxa in these habitats.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapies provide effective treatments for previously untreatable tumors and identifying tumor-specific epitopes can help elucidate the molecular determinants of therapy response. Here, we describe a pipeline, ISOTOPE (ISOform-guided prediction of epiTOPEs In Cancer), for the comprehensive identification of tumor-specific splicing-derived epitopes. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry for MHC-I associated proteins, ISOTOPE identified neoepitopes from tumor-specific splicing events that are potentially presented by MHC-I complexes. Analysis of multiple samples indicates that splicing alterations may affect the production of self-epitopes and generate more candidate neoepitopes than somatic mutations. Although there was no difference in the number of splicing-derived neoepitopes between responders and non-responders to immune therapy, higher MHC-I binding affinity was associated with a positive response. Our analyses highlight the diversity of the immunogenic impacts of tumor-specific splicing alterations and the importance of studying splicing alterations to fully characterize tumors in the context of immunotherapies. ISOTOPE is available at https://github.com/comprna/ISOTOPE\n\nAuthor summaryImmune cells have the ability to attack tumor cells upon the identification of tumor-specific peptides, i.e., epitopes, that are presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). New cancer immunotherapies that help trigger this process provide a promising therapeutic strategy. One crucial aspect for their success is the ability to determine the molecular properties of a tumor that are informative about the effectiveness of the therapy. Alterations in the way genes are processed to express RNA molecules could lead to the production of new peptides, with some of them potentially being presented as tumor epitopes and facilitate the attack of immune cells. It is therefore essential to facilitate the identification of these splicing-derived epitopes. In this work, we describe a computational pipeline that performs a comprehensive identification of splicing alterations in a tumor and the potential epitopes that they would produce. Analysis of tumor samples with our pipeline show that responders and non-responders to immune therapy do not show differences in the number of splicing-derived epitopes, but splicing neoepitopes have higher affinity to the MHC complex in responders. Our new pipeline facilitates the genome-scale analysis of the role of splicing alterations in shaping the molecular properties that influence response to immunotherapy.",

The Cytek Aurora flow cytometer has three excitation lasers (405nm, 488nm, and 640nm) and incorporates the latest Avalanche Photodiode (APD) technology, demonstrating significant improvement in sensitivity for fluorescent emission signals longer than 800nm. However, there are limited commercially available fluorochromes capable of excitation with peak emission signals beyond 800nm. To address this gap, we engineered 6 new fluorochromes: PE-750, PE-800, PE-830 for the 488nm laser and APC-750, APC-800, APC-830 for the 640nm laser. Utilizing the principal of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), these novel structures were created by covalently linking a protein donor dye with an organic small molecule acceptor dye. Additionally, each of these fluorochrome conjugates were shown to be compatible with Fixation/Permeabilization buffer reagents, and demonstrated acceptable brightness and stability when conjugated to antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. These six novel fluorochrome reagents can increase the numbers of fluorochromes that can be used on a 3-laser spectral flow cytometer.",

    "abstract": "The behavioral strategies that mammals use to learn multi-step routes in natural settings are unknown. Here we show that mice spontaneously adopt a subgoal memory strategy. We first investigated how mice navigate to shelter in response to threats when the direct path is blocked. Initially, they fled toward the shelter and negotiated obstacles using sensory cues. Within twenty minutes, they adopted a subgoal strategy, initiating escapes by running directly to the obstacles edge. Mice continued to target this subgoal location after the obstacle was removed, indicating use of spatial memory. However, standard models of spatial learning - egocentric-movement repetition and internal-map building - did not explain how subgoal memories formed. Instead, mice used a hybrid approach: memorizing salient locations encountered during spontaneous  practice runs. This strategy was also used during geometrically identical reward-seeking behavior. These results suggest that subgoal memorization is a fundamental strategy by which rodents learn efficient multi-step routes in new environments.",

    "abstract": "Photoisomerisation in retinal leads to a channel opening in the rhodopsins that triggers translocation or pumping of an ion/proton. Crystal structures of rhodopsins contain several structurally conserved water molecules. It has been suggested that water plays an active role in facilitating the ion pumping/translocation process by acting as a lubricant in these systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the localisation, structure, dynamics and energetics of the water molecules along the channel for the resting/dark state of KR2 rhodopsin. Employing several microseconds long atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of this trans-membrane protein system, we demonstrate the presence of five distinct water containing pockets/cavities separated by gateways controlled by the protein side-chains. There exists a strong hydrogen bonded network involving these buried water molecules and functionally important key residues. We present evidence of significant structural and dynamical heterogeneity in the water molecules present in these cavities with very rare exchange between them. The exchange time-scale of these buried water with bulk has an extremely wide range from tens of nanoseconds to > 1.5s! The translational and rotational dynamics of buried water are found to be strongly dependent on the protein cavity size and local interactions with classic signature of trapped diffusion and rotational anisotropy.",

    "abstract": "The manner in which inserted foreign coding sequences become transcriptionally activated and fixed in the plant genome is poorly understood. To examine such processes of gene evolution, we performed an artificial evolutionary experiment in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a model of gene-birth events, we introduced a promoterless coding sequence of the firefly luciferase (LUC) gene and established 386 T2-generation transgenic lines. Among them, we determined the individual LUC insertion loci in 76 lines and found that one-third of them were transcribed de novo even in the intergenic or inherently unexpressed regions. In the transcribed lines, transcription-related chromatin marks were detected across the newly activated transcribed regions. These results agreed with our previous findings in A. thaliana cultured cells under a similar experimental scheme. A comparison of the results of the T2-plant and cultured cell experiments revealed that the de novo-activated transcription concomitant with local chromatin remodelling was inheritable. During one-generation inheritance, it seems likely that the transcription activities of the LUC inserts trapped by the endogenous genes/transcripts became stronger, while those of de novo transcription in the intergenic/untranscribed regions became weaker. These findings may offer a clue for the elucidation of the mechanism by which inserted foreign coding sequences become transcriptionally activated and fixed in the plant genome.",

Although KLRD1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for influenza susceptibility, it remains unclear whether forecasting symptomatic flu infection based on pre-exposure host gene expression might be possible.\n\nMethodTo examine this hypothesis, we developed DeepFlu using the state-of-the-art deep learning approach on the human gene expression data infected with IAV subtype H1N1 or H3N2 viruses to forecast who would catch the flu prior to an exposure to IAV.\n\nResultsThe results indicated that such forecast is possible and, in other words, gene expression could reflect the strength of host immunity. In the leave-one-person-out cross-validation, DeepFlu based on deep neural network outperformed the models using convolutional neural network, random forest, or support vector machine, achieving 70.0% accuracy, 0.787 AUROC, and 0.758 AUPR for H1N1 and 73.8% accuracy, 0.847 AUROC, and 0.901 AUPR for H3N2.

In addition, DeepFlu which was trained only by pre-exposure data worked the best than by other time spans and mixed training data of H1N1 and H3N2 did not necessarily enhance prediction.

While neural activity has been shown to ramp up to a threshold before single saccades, the neural underpinnings of multiple saccades is unknown. To understand the neural control of rapid saccade sequences, we recorded from the frontal eye field (FEF) of macaque monkeys while they performed a sequential saccade task. We show that concurrent planning of two saccade plans brings forth processing bottlenecks, specifically by decreasing the growth rate and increasing the threshold of saccade-related ramping activity. The rate disruption affected both saccade plans, and a computational model wherein activity related to the two saccade plans bilaterally and asymmetrically inhibited each other, predicted the behavioral and neural results observed experimentally. Borrowing from models in psychology, our results demonstrate a capacity-sharing mechanism of processing bottlenecks, wherein multiple saccade plans in a sequence, compete for the processing capacity by perturbation of the saccade-related ramping activity. Finally, we show that in contrast to movement related neurons, visual activity in FEF neurons is not affected by the presence of multiple saccade targets, indicating that for perceptually simple tasks, inhibition amongst movement-related neurons mainly instantiates capacity sharing. Taken together, we show how psychology-inspired models of capacity sharing can be mapped onto neural responses to understand the control of rapid saccade sequences.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating cell movement are not fully understood. One feature of cell movement that determines how far cells displace from an initial position is persistence, the ability to perform movements in a direction similar to the previous movement direction. Persistence is thus determined by turning angles between two sequential displacements and be characterized by an average turning angle or persistence time. Recent studies found that a cells average speed and turning are negatively correlated, suggesting a fundamental cell-intrinsic program whereby cells with a lower turning ability (i.e., larger persistence time) are intrinsically faster (or faster cells turn less). By simulating correlated or persistent random walks (PRWs) using two different frameworks (one based on von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and another based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process) we show that the negative correlation between speed and turning naturally arises when cell trajectories are sub-sampled, i.e., when the frequency of sampling is lower than frequency at which cells make movements. This effect is strongest when the sampling frequency is on the order of magnitude with the typical cell persistence time and when cells vary in persistence time. Both conditions are observed for datasets of T cell movements in vivo that we have analyzed. In simulations the correlation arises due to randomness of cell movements resulting in highly variable persistence times for individual cells that with sub-sampling leads to large variability of average cell speeds. Interestingly, previously suggested methodology of calculating displacement of cell cohorts with different speeds resulted in similar results whether or not there is a cell-intrinsic correlation between cell speed and persistence. For both vMF- and OU-based simulations of PRWs we could find parameter values (distribution of persistence times, speeds, and sampling frequency) that matched experimentally measured correlations between speed and turning for two datasets of T cell movement in vivo suggesting that such simple correlations are not fully informative on the intrinsic link between speed and persistence. Our results thus suggest that sub-sampling may contribute to (and perhaps fully explains) the observed correlation between speed and turning at least for some cell trajectory data and emphasize the role of sampling frequency in inference of critical cellular parameters of cell motility such as speeds.\n\nSecondary AbstractMeasurement of cell movements often results in a negative correlation between average speed and average turning angle suggesting an existence of a universal, cell-intrinsic movement program. We show that such a negative correlation may arise if cells in the population differ in their ability for persistent movement when the movement data are sub-sampled. We show that sub-sampling of cell trajectories generated using two different frameworks of persistent random walk can match the experimentally observed correlation between speed and turning for T cell movements in vivo.",

    "abstract": "One of the oldest and most persistent questions in ecology and evolution is whether natural communities tend to evolve toward saturation and maximal diversity. Robert MacArthurs classical theory of niche packing and the theory of adaptive radiations both imply that populations will diversify and fully partition any available niche space. However, the saturation of natural populations is still very much an open area of debate and investigation. Additionally, recent evolutionary theory suggests the existence of alternative evolutionary stable states (ESSs), which implies that some stable communities may not be fully saturated. Using models with classical Lokta-Volterra ecological dynamics and three formulations of evolutionary dynamics (a model using adaptive dynamics, an individual-based model, and a partial differential equation model), we show that following an adaptive radiation, communities can often get stuck in low diversity states when limited by mutations of small phenotypic effect. These low diversity metastable states can also be maintained by limited resources and finite population sizes. When small mutations and finite populations are considered together, it is clear that despite the presence of higher-diversity stable states, natural populations are likely not fully saturating their environment and leaving potential niche space unfilled. Additionally, within-species variation can further reduce community diversity from levels predicted by models that assume species-level homogeneity.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding if and when communities evolve to saturate their local environments is imperative to our understanding of natural populations. Using computer simulations of classical evolutionary models, we study whether adaptive radiations tend to lead toward saturated communities, in which no new species can invade or remain trapped in alternative, lower diversity stable states. We show that with asymmetric competition and small effect mutations, evolutionary Red Queen dynamics can trap communities in low diversity metastable states. Moreover, limited resources not only reduces community population sizes, but also reduces community diversity, denying the formation of saturated communities and stabilizing low diversity, non-stationary evolutionary dynamics. Our results are directly relevant to the longstanding questions important to both ecological empiricists and theoreticians on the species packing and saturation of natural environments. Also, by showing the ease evolution can trap communities in low diversity metastable states, we demonstrate the potential harm in relying solely on ESSs to answer questions of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Nrf1 and Nrf2, as two principal CNC-bZIP transcription factors, regulate similar but different targets involved in a variety of biological functions for maintaining cell homeostasis and organ integrity. Of note, the unique topobiological behavior of Nrf1 makes its functions more complicated than Nrf2, because it is allowed for alternatively transcribing and selectively splicing to yield multiple isoforms (e.g., TCF11, Nrf1). In order to gain a better understanding of their similarities and differences in distinct regulatory profiles, all four distinct cell models for stably expressing TCF11, TCF11{Delta}N, Nrf1 or Nrf2 have been herein established by an Flp-In T-REx-293 system and then identified by transcriptomic sequencing. Further analysis revealed that Nrf1 and TCF11 have similar yet different regulatory profiles, although both contribute basically to positive regulation of their co-targets, which are disparate from those regulated by Nrf2. Such disparity in those gene regulation by Nrf1 and Nrf2 was further corroborated by scrutinizing comprehensive functional annotation of their specific and/or common target genes. Conversely, the mutant TCF11{Delta}N, resulting from a deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 2-156 from TCF11, resembles Nrf2 with the largely consistent structure and function. Interestingly, our further experimental evidence demonstrates that TCF11 acts as a potent tumor-repressor relative to Nrf1, albeit both isoforms possess a congruous capability to prevent malignant growth of tumor and upregulate those genes critical for improving the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive resilience is the ability to withstand the negative effects of stress on cognitive functioning and is important for maintaining quality of life while aging. UK Biobank (UKB) does not have direct measurements of the same cognitive phenotype at distal timepoints. Therefore, we used number of education years (EY) as a proxy phenotype for past cognitive performance. Current cognitive performance was determined based on processing speed. This approach captured an average time span of 40 years between past and current cognitive performance in 330,097 individuals. A confounding factor was that EY is highly polygenic and masked the genetics of resilience. To overcome this, we employed Genomics Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to perform a GWAS-by-subtraction using two GWAS, one GWAS of EY and resilience and a second GWAS of EY but not resilience. Subtracting one from the other generated a GWAS of Resilience. Replication of this approach was shown using independent discovery and replication samples within UKB and the full UKB GWAS results show significant genetic correlation with a GWAS of cognitive change in the independent Health and Retirement Study (N=9,526; P=1.5x10-3). We found 13 independent genetic loci for Resilience. Functional analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including GABAergic neurons (P=6.59x10-8) and glutamatergic neurons (P=6.98x10-6) in the cortex. Gene-set analyses implicated the biological process \"neuron differentiation\" (P=9.7x10-7) and the cellular component \"synaptic part\" (P=2.14x10-6). Mendelian randomization analysis showed a causative effect of white matter volume on cognitive resilience. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of resilience.",

    "abstract": "Image simulation plays a central role in the development and practice of high-resolution electron microscopy, including transmission electron microscopy of frozen-hydrated specimens (cryo-EM). Simulating images with contrast that matches the contrast observed in experimental images remains challenging, especially for amorphous samples. Current state-of-the-art simulators apply post hoc scaling to approximate empirical solvent contrast, attenuated image intensity due to specimen thickness, and amplitude contrast. This practice fails for images that require spatially variable scaling, e.g., simulations of a crowded or cellular environment. Modeling both the signal and the noise accurately is necessary to simulate images of biological specimens with contrast that is correct on an absolute scale. The \"Frozen-Plasmon\" method is introduced which explicitly models spatially variable inelastic scattering processes in cryo-EM specimens. This approach produces amplitude contrast that depends on the atomic composition of the specimen, reproduces the total inelastic mean free path as observed experimentally, and allows for the incorporation of radiation damage in the simulation. These improvements are quantified using the matched-filter concept to compare simulation and experiment. The Frozen-Plasmon method, in combination with a new mathematical formulation for accurately sampling the tabulated atomic scattering potentials onto a Cartesian grid, is implemented in the open-source software package cisTEM.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 system is an extremely powerful technique that is extensively used for various genome modifications in different organisms including parasitic protists. Giardia intestinalis, a protist parasite infecting about 280 million people around the world each year, has been eluding the routine use of CRISPR/Cas9 for generating knock-out cell lines due to the presence of four copies of each gene in its two nuclei. Apart from single exception employing rather laborious Cre/loxP system, no full knock-out cell line has been established yet. In this work, we show the ability of in-vitro assembled CRISPR/Cas9 components to successfully edit the genome of G. intestinalis. We further established a cell line stably expressing Cas9 in both G. intestinalis nuclei. Subsequent introduction of a template for homologous recombination containing the transcription units for the resistance marker and gRNA resulted in the removal of all gene copies at once for three independent experimental genes, mem, cwp1 and mlf1. The method was also applicable for the incomplete disruption of an essential gene, as documented by markedly decreased expression of tom40. Finally, testing the efficiency of Cas9-induced recombination revealed that homologous arms as short as 150 bp can be sufficient to establish a full knock-out cell line in G. intestinalis.",

    "abstract": "In a multicentric, observational, investigator-blinded, and longitudinal clinical study of 764 ART-naive subjects, we identified nine different promoter-variant strains of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) emerging in the Indian population, with some of these variants being reported for the first time. Unlike several previous studies, our work here focuses on the evolving viral regulatory elements, not coding sequences. The emerging viral strains contain additional copies of the existing transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), including TCF-1/LEF-1, RBEIII, AP-1, and NF-{kappa}B, created by sequence duplication. The additional TFBS are genetically diverse and may blur the distinction between the modulatory region of the promoter and the viral enhancer. In a follow-up analysis, we found trends, but not significant associations between any specific variant promoter and prognostic markers, probably because the emerging viral strains might not have established mono infections yet. Illumina sequencing of four clinical samples containing a co-infection indicated the domination of one strain over the other and establishing a stable ratio with the second strain at the follow-up time-points. Since a single promoter regulates viral gene expression and constitutes the master regulatory circuit with Tat, the acquisition of additional and variant copies of the TFBS may significantly impact viral latency and latent reservoir characteristics. Further studies are urgently warranted to understand how the diverse TFBS profiles of the viral promoter may modulate the characteristics of the latent reservoir, especially following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.\n\nSignificance StatementA unique conglomeration of TFBS enables the HIV-1 promoter to accomplish two diametrically opposite functions - transcriptional activation and transcriptional silencing. The various phases of viral latency -establishment, maintenance, and reversal -collectively determine the replication fitness of individual viral strains. A profound variation in the TFBS composition of the viral promoter may significantly alter the viral latency properties and the latent reservoir characteristics. Although the duplication of certain TFBS remains a quality unique to HIV-1C, the high-level genetic recombination of HIV-1 may promote the transfer of such molecular properties to the other HIV-1 subtypes. The emergence of several promoter-variant viral strains may make the task of a  functional cure more challenging in HIV-1C.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses a new method for the classification of white blood cells (WBCs) using image processing techniques and machine learning methods. The proposed method consists of three steps: detecting the nucleus and cytoplasm, extracting features, and classification. At first, a new algorithm is designed to segment the nucleus. For the cytoplasm to be detected, only a part of it located inside the convex hull of the nucleus is involved in the process. This attitude helps us overcome the difficulties of segmenting the cytoplasm. In the second phase, three shapes and four novel color features are devised and extracted. Finally, by using an SVM model, the WBCs are classified. The segmentation algorithm can detect the nucleus with a dice similarity coefficient of 0.9675. The proposed method can categorize WBCs in Raabin-WBC, LISC, and BCCD datasets with accuracies of 94.65 %, 92.21 %, and 94.20 %, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the hyperparameters of the classifier are fixed only with the Raabin-WBC dataset, and these parameters are not readjusted for LISC and BCCD datasets. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust, fast, and accurate.",

    "abstract": "The ability to comprehend phrases is an essential integrative property of the brain. Here we evaluate the neural processes that enable the transition from single word processing to a minimal compositional scheme. Previous research has reported conflicting timing effects of composition, and disagreement persists with respect to inferior frontal and posterior temporal contributions. To address these issues, 19 patients (10 male, 19 female) implanted with penetrating depth or surface subdural intracranial electrodes heard auditory recordings of adjective-noun, pseudoword-noun and adjective-pseudoword phrases and judged whether the phrase matched a picture. Stimulus-dependent alterations in broadband gamma activity, low frequency power and phase-locking values across the language-dominant left hemisphere were derived. This revealed a mosaic located in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), in which closely neighboring cortical sites displayed exclusive sensitivity to either lexicality or phrase structure, but not both. Distinct timings were found for effects of phrase composition (210-300 ms) and pseudoword processing (approximately 300-700 ms), and these were localized to neighboring electrodes in pSTS. The pars triangularis and temporal pole encode anticipation of composition in broadband low frequencies, and both regions exhibit greater functional connectivity with pSTS during phrase composition. Our results suggest that the pSTS is a highly specialized region comprised of sparsely interwoven heterogeneous constituents that encodes both lower and higher level linguistic features. This hub in pSTS for minimal phrase processing may form the neural basis for the human-specific computational capacity for forming hierarchically organized linguistic structures.\n\nSignificanceLinguists have claimed that the integration of multiple words into a phrase demands a computational procedure distinct from single word processing. Here, we provide intracranial recordings from a large patient cohort, with high spatiotemporal resolution, to track the cortical dynamics of phrase composition. Epileptic patients volunteered to participate in a task in which they listened to phrases (\"red boat\"), word-pseudoword or pseudoword-word pairs (e.g., \"red fulg\"). At the onset of the second word in phrases, greater broadband high gamma activity was found in posterior superior temporal sulcus in electrodes that exclusively indexed phrasal meaning, and not lexical meaning. These results provide direct, high-resolution signatures of minimal phrase composition in humans, a potentially species-specific computational capacity.",

Although there are LULC datasets available under current conditions, there is a lack of such data under historical and future climatic conditions. This hinders, for example, projecting niche and distribution models under global change scenarios at different time scenarios. The Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2) is a global terrestrial dataset at 0.25{degrees} spatial resolution that provides LULC data from 850 to 2300 for 12 LULC state classes. The dataset, however, is compressed in a file format (NetCDF) that is incompatible for many analyses and requires layer extractions and transformations that are intractable for most researchers. Here we selected and transformed the LUH2 in a standard GIS format data to make it more user-friendly. We provide LULC for every year from 850 to 2100, and from 2015 on, the LULC dataset is provided under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). We provide two types of files for each year: separate files with continuous values for each of the 12 LULC state classes, and a single categorical file with all state classes combined. To create the categorical layer, we assigned the state with the highest value in a given pixel among the 12 continuous data. LUH2 predicts a pronounced decrease in primary forest, particularly noticeable in the Amazon, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, the Congo Basin and the boreal forests, an equally pronounced increase in secondary forest and non-forest lands, and in croplands in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and sub-Saharan Africa. The final dataset provides LULC data for 1251 years that will be of interest for macroecology, ecological niche modeling, global change analysis, and other applications in ecology and conservation.",

    "abstract": "The amino acid sequence of a protein contains all the necessary information to specify its shape, which dictates its biological activities. However, it is challenging and expensive to experimentally determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins. The backbone torsion angles, as an important structural constraint, play a critical role in protein structure prediction, and accurately predicting the angles can considerably advance the tertiary structure prediction by accelerating efficient sampling of the large conformational space for low energy structures. On account of the rapid growth of protein databases and striking breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms, computational advances allow us to extract knowledge from large-scale data to address key biological questions. Here we propose evolutionary signatures that are computed from protein sequence profiles, and a deep neural network, termed ESIDEN, that adopts a straightforward architecture of recurrent neural networks with a small number of learnable parameters. The proposed ESIDEN is validated on three benchmark datasets, including D2020, TEST2016/2018, and CASPs datasets. On the D2020, using the combination of the four novel features and basic features, the ESIDEN achieves the mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.7 and 19.8 for{phi} and{psi} , respectively. Comparing to the best-so-far methods, we show that the ESIDEN significantly improves the angle{psi} by the MAE decrements of more than 3.5 degrees on both TEST2016 and TEST2018 and achieves better MAE of the angle{phi} by decrements of at least 0.3 degrees although it adopts simple architecture and fewer learnable parameters. On fifty-nine template-free modeling targets, the ESIDEN achieves high accuracy by reducing the MAEs by 0.6 and more than 2.3 degrees on average for the torsion angles{phi} and{psi} in the CASPs, respectively. Using the predicted torsion angles, we infer the tertiary structures of four representative template-free modeling targets that achieve high precision with regard to the root-mean-square deviation and TM-score by comparing them to the native structures. The results demonstrate that the ESIDEN can make accurate predictions of the torsion angles by leveraging the evolutionary signatures. The proposed evolutionary signatures would be also used as alternative features in predicting residue-residue distance, protein structure, and protein-ligand binding sites. Moreover, the high-precision torsion angles predicted by the ESIDEN can be used to accurately infer protein tertiary structures, and the ESIDEN would potentially pave the way to improve protein structure prediction.",

    "abstract": "Melanins are structurally complex pigments produced by organisms in all domains of life. In insects, melanins are essential for survival and have key roles in cuticle sclerotization, wound healing and innate immunity. In this study, we used a diverse set of molecular, biochemical, and imaging approaches to characterize mosquito melanin involved in innate immune defense (melanotic capsules). We observed that melanotic capsules enclosing Plasmodium berghei ookinetes were composed of an acid-resistant and highly hydrophobic material with granular appearance, which are characteristic properties of melanins. Spectroscopical analyses reveal chemical signatures of eumelanins and pheomelanin. Furthermore, we identified a set of 14 acid-resistant mosquito proteins embedded within the melanin matrix possibly related to an anti-Plasmodium response. Among these, AgMESH, a mucin-related protein highly conserved among insects that is associated with the midgut brush border microvilli proteome of Anopheles gambiae and A. albimanus. AgMESH gene silencing in mosquitos was associated with reduced Plasmodium parasite infection, compromised integrity of the peritrophic matrix, and inability to synthesize a dityrosine network. Our results provide a new approach to study aspects of insect melanogenesis that revealed proteins associated with melanotic capsule, one of which was strongly implicated in the stabilization of the peritrophic matrix and pathogenesis of Plasmodium spp. mosquito infection. Given the conservation of AgMESH among disease-transmitting insect vector species, future analysis of this protein could provide fertile ground for the identification of strategies that block transmission of vector borne diseases to humans.\n\nSignificance StatementMalaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquito bites. Here, we adapt methodologies to study fungal melanogenesis to explore the melanin-based immune response of Anopheles gambiae against malaria parasites. We reveal that melanotic capsules against Plasmodium are composed of pheomelanin and eumelanin. We demonstrate that melanin-encapsulated Plasmodium is associated to acid-resistant mosquito gut proteins and identify several putative factors of the melanin-mediated immunity. Disruption of AgMESH, a surface-associated protein conserved among other mosquito vectors, demonstrates its ability to impaired formation of the dityrosine network and peritrophic matrix compromising parasite development within the mosquito gut. Our study provides a new approach to investigate the melanin-based defense mechanism in insects and identified a potential host molecule for developing novel universal vector-control schemes.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare-associated outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) are a worldwide problem with increasing prevalence. The genomic plasticity of this hospital-adapted pathogen contributes to its efficient spread despite infection control measures. Here, we aimed to identify the genomic and phenotypic determinants of healthcare-associated transmission of VREfm. We assessed the VREfm transmission networks at the tertiary-care University Hospital of Zurich (USZ) between October 2014 and February 2018 and investigated microevolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. We performed whole-genome sequencing for the 69 VREfm isolates collected during this timeframe and assessed the population structure and variability of the vancomycin resistance transposon. Phylogenomic analysis allowed us to reconstruct transmission networks and to unveil external or indirect transmission networks, not detectable by traditional surveillance. Notably, it unveiled a persistent clone, sampled 31 times over a 29-month period. Exploring the evolutionary dynamics of this clone and characterizing the phenotypic consequences revealed the spread of a variant with decreased daptomycin susceptibility and the acquired ability to utilize N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), one of the primary constituents of the human gut mucins. This nutrient utilization advantage was conferred by a novel plasmid, termed pELF_USZ, which exhibited a linear topology. This plasmid, which was harbored by two distinct clones, was transferable by conjugation. Overall, this work provides an example of the potential of the integration of epidemiological, functional genomic and evolutionary perspectives to understand adaptation strategies contributing to the successful spread of VREfm.\n\nSignificance statementSequencing microbial pathogens causing outbreaks has become a common practice to characterize transmission networks. In addition to the signal provided by vertical evolution, bacterial genomes harbor mobile genetic elements, shared horizontally between clones. While macroevolutionary studies have revealed an important role of plasmids and genes encoding carbohydrate utilization systems in the adaptation of Enterococcus faecium to the hospital environment, mechanisms of dissemination and the specific function of many of these genetic determinants remain to be elucidated. Here, we characterize a plasmid providing a nutrient utilization advantage and show evidence for its clonal and horizontal spread at a local scale. Further studies integrating epidemiological, functional genomics and evolutionary perspectives will be critical to identify changes shaping the success of this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell engineering is a powerful platform to address numerous challenges in regenerative medicine and developmental biology. Typically, engineered populations are derived by exposing pluripotent stem cells to a series of signaling cues meant to recapitulate developmental milestones, such as the induction of the primitive streak. Morphologic, genetic, transcriptomic, and functional differences between fully differentiated in vivo and engineered populations have long been recognized. However, the correspondence between engineered and native embryonic progenitors has been relatively less well characterized, largely due to their transient and highly heterogenous nature, and therefore many studies have relied on expression of a few canonical markers to ensure that their cells are on the correct path. To address this challenge, we first generated an in vivo gastrulation mouse single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reference data set and used it to train a collection of computational tools for comparing cell types, states, regulators, and trajectories across studies. Then we used these tools to evaluate a commonly used protocol designed to promote mesoderm derivation, as well as four previously published biomimetic protocols. Finally, we diversified our toolkits to reach a broader scientific community by implementing our primary analysis tool in Python and as an interactive web application.",

We observed extensive physiological, morphological and transcriptional changes in surviving recruits, and the transition to a less-skeleton/more-tissue phenotype. We found that decreased pH conditions stimulate photosynthesis and endosymbiont growth, and gene expression potentially linked to photosynthates translocation.

    "abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, its co-receptor Lrp4 and the Agrin ligand constitute a signaling pathway critical in axial muscle for neuromuscular synapse development, yet whether this pathway functions similarly in appendicular muscle is unclear. Here, using the larval zebrafish pectoral fin, equivalent to tetrapod forelimbs, we show that like axial muscle, developing appendicular muscles develop aneural acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters prior to innervation. As motor axons arrive, neural AChR clusters form, eventually leading to functional synapses in a MuSK-dependent manner. Surprisingly, we find that loss of Agrin or Lrp4 function, which abolishes synaptic AChR clusters in axial muscle, results in enlarged presynaptic nerve endings and progressively expanding appendicular AChR clusters, mimicking the consequences of motoneuron ablation. Moreover, musk depletion in lrp4 mutants partially restores synaptic AChR patterning. Combined, our results provide compelling evidence that, in contrast to axial muscle in which Agrin/Lrp4 stimulates MuSK activity, Agrin/Lrp4 signaling in appendicular muscle constrains MuSK activity to organize neuromuscular synapses. Thus, we reveal a previously unappreciated role for Agrin/Lrp4 signaling, thereby highlighting distinct differences between axial and appendicular synapse development.",

Several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that regulate Insulin mRNA stability and translation also bind mRNAs coding for other insulin secretory granule (ISG) proteins. However, an overview of these interactions and their glucose-induced remodelling is still missing. Here we identify two distinct sets of RBPs that were preferentially pulled down with the 5-UTRs of mouse Ins1, Ins2, spliced Ins2, Ica512/Ptprn and Pc2/Pcsk2 mRNAs from extracts of either resting or stimulated mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells. Among RBPs binding to all tested transcripts in resting conditions was hnRNP A2/B1. Hnrnpa2b1 KO MIN6 cells contained lower levels of Ins1 mRNA, proinsulin and insulin, and had reduced insulin secretion. In resting cells, both hnRNP A2/B1 and Insulin mRNAs localized to stress granules, which dissolved upon glucose stimulation. Insulin mRNA-positive RNA granules were also found in human pancreatic beta cells in situ. Our results suggest that resting beta cells store mRNAs for insulin secretory granule proteins in stress granules through specific RNA protein interactions. Glucose stimulation remodels these interactions, releasing the transcripts, and another set of RBPs coordinates their translation.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblasts produce the majority of collagen in the heart and are thought to regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Although fibrosis accompanies many cardiac pathologies and is generally deleterious, the role of fibroblasts in maintaining the basal ECM network and in fibrosis in vivo is poorly understood. We genetically ablated fibroblasts in mice to evaluate the impact on homeostasis of adult ECM and cardiac function after injury. Fibroblast-ablated mice demonstrated a 60-80% reduction in cardiac fibroblasts, which did not overtly alter fibrillar collagen or the ECM proteome evaluated by quantitative mass spectrometry and N-terminomics. However, the distribution and quantity of collagen VI, a microfibrillar collagen that forms an open network with the basement membrane, was altered. In fibroblast-ablated mice, cardiac function was better preserved following angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE)-induced fibrosis and myocardial infarction. Analysis of cardiomyocyte function demonstrated weaker contractions and slowed calcium decline in both uninjured and AngII/PE infused fibroblast-ablated mice. Moreover, fibroblast-ablated hearts had a similar gene expression profile to hearts with physiological hypertrophy after AngII/PE infusion. Our results indicate that the adult mouse heart tolerated a significant degree of fibroblast loss with potential beneficial impacts on cardiac function. Controlled fibroblast reduction may have therapeutic value in heart disease by providing cardioprotective effects.",

    "abstract": "Because it is impossible to comprehensively characterize biodiversity at all levels of organization, conservation prioritization efforts need to rely on surrogates. As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found that bird species were a better surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. Highly ranked areas based on habitat diversity were represented better than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion.",

    "abstract": "The most commonly used antifungal drugs are the azole compounds that interfere with biosynthesis of the fungal-specific sterol: ergosterol. The pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata commonly acquires resistance to azole drugs like fluconazole via mutations in a gene encoding a transcription factor called PDR1. These PDR1 mutations lead to overproduction of drug transporter proteins like the ATP-binding cassette transporter Cdr1. In other Candida species, mutant forms of a transcription factor called Upc2 are associated with azole resistance, owing to the important role of this protein in control of expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Recently, the C. glabrata Upc2A factor was demonstrated to be required for normal azole resistance, even in the presence of a hyperactive mutant form of PDR1. Using genome-scale approaches, we define the network of genes bound and regulated by Upc2A. By analogy to a previously described hyperactive UPC2 mutation found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we generated a similar form of Upc2A in C. glabrata called G898D Upc2A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with Next Generation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that wild-type Upc2A binding to target genes was strongly induced by fluconazole while G898D Upc2A bound similarly, irrespective of drug treatment. We also carried out RNA-seq analysis to determine the genes that were direct or indirect targets of Upc2A transcriptional control. In addition to the well-described ERG genes as Upc2A transcriptional targets, we found a large group of genes encoding components of the translational apparatus along with membrane proteins. These Upc2A-regulated membrane protein-encoding genes are often targets of the Pdr1 transcription factor, demonstrating the high degree of overlap between these two regulatory networks. Finally, we provide evidence that Upc2A impacts the Pdr1-Cdr1 system during the anaerobic response and also modulates resistance to caspofungin. These studies provide a new perspective of Upc2A as a master regulator of lipid and membrane protein biosynthesis.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata, expression of the genes encoding enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is controlled by the transcription factor Upc2A. C. glabrata has a low intrinsic susceptibility to azole therapy and acquires fluconazole resistance at high frequency. These azole resistant mutants typically contain substitution mutations in a gene encoding the transcription factor Pdr1. Pdr1 does not appear to regulate ergosterol genes and instead induces expression of genes encoding drug transport proteins like CDR1. Here we establish that extensive overlap exists between the regulatory networks defined by Upc2A and Pdr1. Genomic approaches are used to describe the hundreds of genes regulated by Upc2A that far exceed the well-described impact of this factor on genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. The overlap between Upc2A and Pdr1 is primarily described by co-regulation of genes encoding membrane transporters like CDR1. We provide evidence that Upc2A impacts the transcriptional control of the FKS1 gene, producing a target of a second major class of antifungal drugs, the echinocandins. Our data are consistent with Upc2A playing a role as a master regulator coordinating the synthesis of membrane structural components, both at the level of lipids and proteins, to produce properly functional biological membranes.",

    "abstract": "Self-assembly of biomembranes results from the intricate interactions between water and the lipids hydrophilic head groups. Therefore, the lipid-water interplay strongly contributes to modulating membranes architecture, lipid diffusion, and chemical activity. Here, we introduce a new method of obtaining dehydrated, phase-separated, supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) solely by controlling the decrease of their environments relative humidity. This facilitates the study of the structure and dynamics of SLBs over a wide range of hydration states. We show that the lipid domain structure of phase-separated SLBs is largely insensitive to the presence of the hydration layer. In stark contrast, lipid mobility is drastically affected by dehydration, showing a 6-fold decrease in lateral diffusion. At the same time, the diffusion activation energy increases approximately twofold for the dehydrated membrane. The obtained results, correlated with the hydration structure of a lipid molecule, revealed that about 6-7 water molecules directly hydrating the phosphocholine moiety play a pivotal role in modulating lipid diffusion. These findings could provide deeper insights into the fundamental reactions where local dehydration occurs, for instance during cell-cell fusion, and help us better understand the survivability of anhydrobiotic organisms. Finally, the strong dependence of lipid mobility on the number of hydrating water molecules opens up an application potential for SLBs as very precise, nanoscale hydration sensors.",

    "abstract": "ATPase and GTPase have been widely found as chemical energy-mechanical work transducers, whereas the physicochemical mechanisms are not satisfactorily understood. We addressed the problem by examining John Ross conjecture that repulsive Coulomb interaction between ADP/GDP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) does the mechanical work upon the system. We effectively simulated the consequence of GTP hydrolysis reaction in a complex system of Rat sarcoma (Ras) and GTPase activation protein (GAP) in the framework of classical molecular dynamics by switching force field parameters between the reactant and product systems. We then observed ca. 5 kcal/mol raise of potential energy about the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) in Ras protein, indicating that the mechanical work generated via the GTP hydrolysis is converted into the local interaction energy and stored in the P-loop. Interestingly, this local energy storage in the P-loop depends on neither impulsive nor consecutive collisions of GDP and Pi with P-loop. Instead, GTP-GDP conversion itself does work on the Ras system, elevating the potential energy. These observations encourage us to challenge a conjecture previously given by Ross. We assert that triphosphate nucleotide hydrolyses do mechanical work by producing emergent steric interaction accompanied with relaxation, namely, a shift of biomolecular system to non-equilibrium state on the reshaped potential energy landscape. Recalling the universality of the P-loop motif among GTPases and ATPases, the observations that we obtained through this study would progress physicochemical understanding for the operating principles of GTP/ATP hydrolysis-driven biological nano-machines.",

    "abstract": "Cell dispersion from a confined area is fundamental in a number of biological processes, including cancer metastasis. To date, a quantitative understanding of the interplay of single cell motility, cell proliferation, and intercellular contacts remains elusive. In particular, the role of E- and N-Cadherin junctions, central components of intercellular contacts, is still controversial. Combining theoretical modeling with in vitro observations, we investigate the collective spreading behavior of colonies of human cancer cells (T24). Inhibition of E- and N-Cadherin junctions decreases colony spreading and average spreading velocities, without affecting the strength of correlations in spreading velocities of neighboring cells. Based on a biophysical simulation model for cell migration, we show that the behavioral changes upon disruption of these junctions can be explained by reduced repulsive excluded volume interactions between cells. This suggests that cadherin-based intercellular contacts sharpen cell boundaries leading to repulsive rather than cohesive interactions between cells, thereby promoting efficient cell spreading during collective migration.",

Here we take an integrated approach to dissect nutrient metabolism, both ex vivo and in vivo. We discover a castling effect of glucose and glutamine metabolism through ex vivo isotope tracing studies that limits the entrance of glucose carbon into the glutamine-dominated tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and DNL pathways. In vivo tracing studies with a high carbohydrate drink (glucose/amino acid, 3:1, w/w) confirm dietary amino acids are twice more efficient than glucose in labeling the hepatic acetyl-CoA and fatty acid pool, and together they account for over 70% of hepatic DNL substrate. Both glucose and glutamine carbon flux into DNL pathways are increased in obese hepatocytes, and metabolic rerouting of substrate carbon toward glycogen synthesis and energy production through GYS2 and GLUD1 overexpression improves hepatic steatosis. Together, these data reveal the quantitative contribution of glucose and amino acid carbon toward hepatic DNL and the development of hepatic steatosis in obesity.",

The pathological hallmark for PD involves the self-assembly of functional Alpha-Synuclein (S) into non-functional amyloid structures. One of the potential therapeutic interventions against PD is the effective inhibition of S aggregation. However, the bottleneck towards achieving this goal is the identification of S domains/sequences that are essential for aggregation. Using a protein mimetic approach, we have identified S sequences-based novel targets that are essential for aggregation and will have significant therapeutic implications. An extensive array of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays was utilized to validate S sequences and their structural characteristics that are essential for aggregation and propagation of PD phenotypes. The study aids in developing significant mechanistic and therapeutic insights into various facets of S aggregation, which will pave the way for novel and effective treatments for PD.",

Unfortunately, these approaches are challenged by not uncommon induced fit mecchanisms. Here, we present a variant of the recently reported volume-based metadynamics (MetaD) method which describes ligand binding even when it affects protein structure. The validity of the approach is established by applying it to a substrate/enzyme complexes of pharmacological relevance: this is the mono-ADP-ribose (ADPr) in complex with mono-ADP-ribosylation hydrolases (MacroD1 and MacroD2), where induced-fit phenomena are known to be operative. The calculated binding free energies are consistent with experiments, with an absolute error less than 0.5 kcal/mol. Our simulations reveal that in all circumstances the active loops, delimiting the boundaries of the binding site, rearrange from an open to a closed conformation upon ligand binding. The calculations further provide, for the first time, the molecular basis of the experimentally observed affinity changes in ADPr binding on passing from MacroD1 to MacroD2 and all its mutants. Our study paves the way to investigate in a completely general manner ligand binding to proteins and receptors.",

Expression of programed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), tumor immune infiltration, or tumor mutation burden have been widely investigated for predicting cancer immunotherapy response1-5. Whether specific oncogenes diminish response to immunotherapy6-10 and whether these effects are reversible remains poorly understood. We predicted that MYC, an oncogene that is frequently overexpressed11,12 and is associated with worse prognosis12, may predict immunotherapy response in patients with TNBC. Here, we report that MYC-elevated TNBCs are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Using mouse models of TNBC and patient data we report that MYC signaling is associated with low tumor cell PD-L1, low overall immune cell infiltration, and low tumor cell MHC-I expression. Restoring interferon signaling in the tumor reduces MYC expression and increases MHC-I expression. By combining a TLR9 agonist and an agonistic antibody against OX40 with anti-PD-L1, most mice experience complete tumor regression and are protected from new TNBC tumor outgrowth. Our findings demonstrate that MYC-dependent immune evasion is reversible and druggable, and if strategically targeted, may improve outcomes for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic reporters allow the measurement of regulatory DNA activity in vivo and consequently have long been useful tools in the study of enhancers. Despite the utility of transgenic reporters, few studies have investigated the potential effects these reporters have on the expression of other transgenic reporters or endogenous genes. A full understanding of the impacts transgenic reporters have on expression is required for accurate interpretation of transgenic reporter data and characterization of gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we investigate the impact transgenic reporters have on the expression of other transgenic reporters and endogenous genes. By measuring the expression of Kruppel (Kr) enhancer reporters in live Drosophila embryos that contain either one or two copies of identical reporters, we find reporters have an inhibitory effect on one anothers expression. Further, expression of a nearby endogenous gene is decreased in the presence of a Kr enhancer reporter. Through the use of competitor binding site arrays, we present evidence that reporters, and potentially endogenous genes, are competing for transcription factors (TFs). Increasing the number of competitor Bcd binding sites decreases the peak levels and spatial extent of Bcd-regulated enhancer reporters expression. To understand how small numbers of added TF binding sites could impact gene expression to the extent we observe, we develop a simple thermodynamic model of our system. Our model predicts competition of the measured magnitude specifically if TF binding is restricted to distinct nuclear subregions, underlining the importance of the non-homogenous nature of the nucleus in regulating gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is a common method for studying human brain function non-invasively. Gradient-echo (GRE) BOLD is highly sensitive to the blood oxygenation change in blood vessels; however, the spatial signal specificity can be degraded due to signal leakage from activated lower layers to superficial layers in depth-dependent (also called laminar or layer-specific) fMRI. Alternatively, physiological variables such as cerebral blood volume using the VAscular-Space-Occupancy (VASO) contrast have shown higher spatial specificity compared to BOLD. To better understand the physiological mechanisms such as blood volume and oxygenation changes and to interpret the measured depth-dependent responses, models are needed which reflect vascular properties at this scale. For this purpose, we extended and modified the \"cortical vascular model\" previously developed to predict layer-specific BOLD signal changes in human primary visual cortex to also predict a layer-specific VASO response. To evaluate the model, we compared the predictions with experimental results of simultaneous VASO and BOLD measurements in a group of healthy participants. Fitting the model to our experimental data provided an estimate of CBV change in different vascular compartments upon neural activity. We found that stimulus-evoked CBV change mainly occurs in small arterioles, capillaries and intracortical arteries, and that the contribution from venules and ICVs is small. Our results confirm that VASO is less susceptible to large vessel effects compared to BOLD, as blood volume changes in intracortical arteries did not substantially affect the resulting depth-dependent VASO profiles, whereas depth-dependent BOLD profiles showed a bias towards signal contributions from intracortical veins.",

However, factors governing the severity and regional distribution of TDP-43 pathology, which may account for the divergent clinical presentations of ALS and FTLD-TDP, are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the influence of genotypes at TMEM106B, a locus associated with risk for FTLD-TDP, and hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72, a known genetic cause for both ALS and FTLD-TDP, on global TDP-43 pathology and regional distribution of TDP-43 pathology in 899 postmortem cases from a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. We found that, among the 110 ALS cases, minor (C)- allele homozygotes at the TMEM106B locus sentinel SNP rs1990622 had more TDP-43 pathology globally, as well as in select brain regions. C9orf72 expansions similarly associated with greater TDP-43 pathology in ALS. However, adjusting for C9orf72 expansion status did not affect the relationship between TMEM106B genotype and TDP-43 pathology. In order to elucidate the direction of causality for this association, we directly manipulated TMEM106B levels in an inducible cell system that expresses mislocalized TDP-43 protein. We found that partial knockdown of TMEM106B, to levels similar to what would be expected in rs1990622 C allele carriers, led to development of more TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates, which were more insoluble, in this system. Taken together, our results support a causal role for TMEM106B in modifying the development of TDP-43 proteinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have long known that many animals live longer in colder climates than in warmer climates. The inverse relationship between temperature and lifespan was traditionally explained using the rate of living theory, which suggests that higher temperatures increase chemical reaction rates, thus speeding up the aging process. However, recent studies have identified specific molecules, cells and signaling pathways involved in the longevity response to temperature, indicating that such a response is not simply thermodynamic but a regulated process. Here, we report that Caenorhabditis elegans lacking OCTR-1, a neuronal G protein-couple receptor for the neurotransmitter octopamine, had extended lifespan at warm temperature but shortened lifespan at cool temperature, indicating that OCTR-1 modulates the longevity response to both warm and cool temperatures. We further found that these responses are regulated by the OCTR-1-expressing, chemosensory ASH neurons. Transcriptomic analysis and functional assays revealed that OCTR-1 mediates temperature effects on longevity by regulating a subset of immune response genes. Our study provides cellular and molecular insights into the relationship between temperature and longevity, which could be useful for developing strategies to extend human lifespan in the midst of global warming.",

There was strong phylogenetic support for a monophyletic group of PPRV from Mongolian wildlife and livestock, belonging to clade of lineage IV PPRV from livestock and wildlife from China since 2013. Discrete diffusion analysis found strong support for PPRV spread into Mongolia from China and phylogeographic analysis indicated Xinjiang Province as the most likely origin, although genomic surveillance for PPRV is poor and lack of sampling from other regions could bias this result. Times of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) were June 2015 (95% HPD: August 2014 - March 2016) for all Mongolian PPRV genomes and May 2016 (95% HPD: October 2015 - October 2016) for Mongolian wildlife-origin PPRV. This suggests that PPRV was circulating undetected in Mongolia for at least six months before the first reported outbreak in August 2016, and that wildlife were likely infected before livestock vaccination began in October 2016. Finally, genetic variation and positively-selected sites were identified that might be related to PPRV emergence in Mongolian wildlife. This study is the first to sequence multiple PPRV genomes from a wildlife outbreak, across several host species. Additional full PPRV genomes and associated metadata from the livestock-wildlife interface are needed to enhance the power of molecular epidemiology, support PPRV eradication and safeguard the health of the whole ungulate community.\n\nAuthor SummaryRecent mass mortality of critically endangered Mongolian saiga antelope due to peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) has dramatically highlighted the threat this viral disease represents for biodiversity. The genome of viruses such as PPRV evolve fast, so virus genetic data gathered from infected animals can be used to trace disease spread between livestock and wildlife, and to determine if the virus is adapting to infect wildlife more efficiently. Here we obtained PPRV virus genomes from Mongolian wildlife and compared them with other published PPRV genomes. Using a molecular clock, we estimated that the disease was circulating in Mongolia well before it was first reported. Genetic analyses support the hypothesis of virus spread from livestock to wildlife, with genetic changes potentially helping infection in Asian wild ungulates. However, more PPR virus genomes and epidemiology data are needed from disease outbreaks in areas shared between livestock and wildlife to confirm these results and take efficient actions to safeguard the health of the whole ungulate community.",

Extracellular vesicles like exosomes play a crucial role in communication and information exchange in between such systemic factors and solid tissues9,10. We sequenced freely circulating and vesicle-bound small regulatory RNAs in mice at five time points across the average life span from 2 to 18 months. Intriguingly, each small RNA class exhibits unique aging patterns, which showed differential signatures between vesicle-bound and freely circulating molecules. In particular, tRNA fragments showed overall highest correlation with aging which also matched well between sample types, facilitating age prediction with non-negative matrix factorization (86% accuracy). Interestingly, rRNAs exhibited inverse correlation trajectories between vesicles and plasma while vesicle-bound microRNAs (miRNAs) were exceptionally strong associated with aging. Affected miRNAs regulate the inflammatory response and transcriptional processes, and adipose tissues show considerable effects in associated gene regulatory modules. Finally, nanoparticle tracking and electron microscopy suggest a shift from overall many small to fewer but larger vesicles in aged plasma, potentially contributing to systemic aging trajectories and affecting the molecular aging of organs.",

Upon analysis of the splice variants of MAGOH-paralogs, we have found the presence of alternate protein isoforms which are also evolutionarily conserved. Further, comparison of the amino acid sequence of the principal and alternate protein isoforms has revealed absence of key amino acid residues in the alternate isoforms.

    "abstract": "Telomeres are essential for genome integrity and stability. In T. brucei that causes human African trypanosomiasis, the telomere structure and telomere proteins also influence the virulence of the parasite, as its major surface antigen involved in the host immune evasion is expressed exclusively from loci immediately upstream of the telomere repeats. However, telomere maintenance mechanisms are still unclear except that telomerase-mediated telomere synthesis is a major player. We now identify PolIE as an intrinsic telomere complex component. We find that depletion of PolIE leads to an increased amount of telomere/subtelomere DNA damage, an elevated rate of antigenic variation, and an increased amount of telomere T-circles and C-circles, indicating that PolIE suppresses telomere recombination and helps maintain telomere integrity. In addition, we observe much longer telomere G-rich 3 overhangs in PolIE-depleted cells, which is not dependent on telomerase. Furthermore, the level of telomere DNA synthesis is slightly increased in PolIE-depleted cells, which is dependent on telomerase. Therefore, we identify PolIE as a major player for telomere maintenance in T. brucei.",

To identify the causal defect in AOA2, patient-derived cells and SETX knockouts (human and mouse) were analyzed using integrated genomic and transcriptomic approaches. We observed a genome-wide increase in chromosome instability (gains and losses) within genes and at chromosome fragile sites, resulting in changes to gene expression profiles. Senataxin loss caused increased transcription stress near promoters that correlated with high GCskew and R-loop accumulation at promoter-proximal regions. Notably, the chromosomal regions with gains and losses overlapped with regions of elevated transcription stress. In the absence of Senataxin, we found that Cockayne Syndrome protein CSB was required for the recruitment of the transcription-coupled repair endonucleases (XPG and XPF) and recombination protein RAD52 to target and resolve transcription bubbles containing R-loops, leading to error prone repair and genomic instability. These results show that transcription stress is an important contributor to SETX mutation-associated chromosome fragility and AOA2.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas system has been implemented for various organisms and becomes increasingly popular even in the genetically tractable budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Since each CRISPR/Cas system recognizes only the sequences flanked by its unique protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), a certain single system often fails to target a region of interest due to the lack of PAM, thus necessitating the use of another system with a different PAM. Three CRISPR/Cas systems with distinct PAMs, namely SpCas9, SaCas9, and AsCas12a, have been successfully used in yeast genome editing and their combined use should expand the repertoire of editable targets. However, currently available plasmids for these systems were individually developed under different design principles, thus hampering their seamless use in the practice of genome editing. Here we report a series of Golden Gate Assembly-compatible backbone vectors designed under a unified principle to exploit the three CRISPR/Cas systems in yeast genome editing. We also created a software to assist the design of genome-editing plasmids for individual target sequences using the backbone vectors. Genome editing with these plasmids demonstrated practically sufficient efficiency in both insertion of gene fragments to essential genes and complete deletion of an open reading frame. The backbone vectors with the software would thus provide a versatile toolbox to facilitate the seamless use of SpCas9, SaCas9, and AsCas12a in various types of genome manipulation, especially those that are difficult to perform with conventional techniques in yeast genetics.",

DNA barcoding, the use of a single and often mitochondrial gene, has been increasingly employed as a universal approach for the identification of animal species. However, this approach faces several challenges. Here, we demonstrate with empirical data from a number of metazoan animal lineages that multiple nuclear-encoded markers, so called universal single-copy orthologs (USCOs) performs much better than the single barcode gene to discriminate closely related species. Overcoming the general shortcomings of mitochondrial DNA barcodes, USCOs also accurately assign samples to higher taxonomic levels. These loci thus provide a powerful and unifying framework for species delimitation which considerably improves the DNA-based inference of animal species.",

We examine patterns of deleterious mutation accumulation over multiple rounds of viral replication, with a focus on how cellular coinfection and heterogeneity in viral output affect these patterns. Specifically, using agentbased intercellular simulations we find, in agreement with previous studies, that coinfection of cells by viruses relaxes the strength of purifying selection, and thereby increases the rate of deleterious mutation accumulation. We further find that cellular heterogeneity in viral output exacerbates the rate of deleterious mutation accumulation, regardless of whether this heterogeneity in viral output is stochastic or is due to variation in cellular multiplicity of infection. These results highlight the need to consider the unique life histories of viruses and their population structure to better understand observed patterns of viral evolution.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens poses a major global health threat. M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) is estimated to have the highest resistance rates of any pathogen globally. Given the slow growth rate and the need for a biosafety level 3 laboratory, the only realistic avenue to scale up drug-susceptibility testing (DST) for this pathogen is to rely on genotypic techniques. This raises the fundamental question of whether a mutation is a reliable surrogate for phenotypic resistance or whether the presence of a second mutation can completely counteract its effect, resulting in major diagnostic errors (i.e. systematic false resistance results). To date, such epistatic interactions have only been reported for streptomycin that is now rarely used. By analyzing more than 31,000 MTBC genomes, we demonstrated that eis C-14T promoter mutation, which is interrogated by several genotypic DST assays endorsed by the World Health Organization, cannot confer resistance to amikacin and kanamycin if it coincides with loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in the coding region of eis. To our knowledge, this represents the first definitive example of antibiotic reversion in MTBC. Moreover, we raise the possibility that mmpR (Rv0678) mutations are not valid markers of resistance to bedaquiline and clofazimine if these coincide with LoF mutation in the efflux pump encoded by mmpS5 (Rv0677c) and mmpL5 (Rv0676c).",

Advancing additional therapeutic immune modulation approaches requires understanding ligand regulation of other co-signaling receptors. One poorly understood therapeutic target is TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing-3). Which ligands are relevant for TIM-3 signaling is unclear, and different studies have reported it as co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory. Here, we show that TIM-3 promotes NF-{kappa}B signaling and IL-2 secretion following T cell receptor stimulation in Jurkat cells, and is regulated by phosphatidylserine (PS) binding. TIM-3 signaling is stimulated by PS exposed constitutively in cultured Jurkat cells, and can be blocked by mutating the PS-binding site or by occluding this site with an antibody. We also find that TIM-3 signaling alters CD28 phosphorylation. Our findings help clarify conflicting literature results with TIM-3, and inform its exploitation as a therapeutic target.",

The higher dose (1.5 mg kg-1) of MoS2-NSs showed significant alteration in hematological markers and serum biochemical enzymes, as compared to control. Lipid peroxidation also shows significant alteration with respect to the control. Histopathological, hematological and biochemical examination, revealed no remarkable changes at lower concentration (less than 1.0 mg kg-1), however, higher concentration (1.5 mg kg-1) causes significant histopathological, antioxidants and biochemical alterations in tissues and serum, respectively.

    "abstract": "MAP4K4 has been correlated with increased cell motility and reduced proliferation in mammalian cells. Consequences and regulation of this dichotomous functionality of MAP4K4 in tumor cells remained elusive. We find that MAP4K4 interacts with the STRN3 protein in medulloblastoma and that STRN3 and MAP4K4 exert opposing functions in Hippo tumor suppressor signaling and clonal growth. However, depletion of either STRN3 or MAP4K4 reduces migration and tissue invasion, and concomitant loss of both proteins halts tumor cell growth in the cerebellar tissue. Mechanistically, STRN3 couples MAP4K4 to the protein phosphatase 2A, which inactivates growth repressing activities of MAP4K4. In parallel, STRN3 enables growth factor-induced PKC{theta} activation and the direct phosphorylation of VASPS157 by MAP4K4, which are necessary for efficient migration and tissue invasion. Thus, STRN3 controls MAP4K4 functionality in growth factor-activated tumor cells, and the cooperation of the two proteins promotes invasiveness through nPKCs and VASP and increases proliferation via inactivation of Hippo signaling. Targeting of the STRN3-MAP4K4 cooperation could reactivate Hippo signaling and repress invasiveness in growth factor-driven tumors.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/442906v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102b3c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6753ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1af2ff5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@759127_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Central carbon metabolism is highly conserved across microbial species, but can catalyze very different pathways depending on the organism and their ecological niche. Here, we study the dynamic re-organization of central metabolism after switches between the two major opposing pathway configurations of central carbon metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. We combined growth dynamics and dynamic changes of intracellular metabolite levels with a coarse-grained model that integrates fluxes, regulation, protein synthesis and growth and uncovered fundamental limitations of the regulatory network: after nutrient shifts, metabolite concentrations collapse to their equilibrium, rendering the cell unable to sense which direction the flux is supposed to flow through the metabolic network. The cell can partially alleviate this by picking a preferred direction of regulation at the expense of increasing lag times in the opposite direction. Moreover, decreasing both lag times simultaneously comes at the cost of reduced growth rate or higher futile cycling between metabolic enzymes. These three trade-offs can explain why microorganisms specialize for either glycolytic or gluconeogenic substrates and can help elucidate the complex growth patterns exhibited by different microbial species.\n\nGraphical synopsis O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nStandfirst textMicrobes face a series of fundamental trade-offs that limit their ability to optimize simultaneously for both glycolytic and gluconeogenic growth.\n\nBullet pointsO_LILag times between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis show asymmetry in many microbes: A long lag in one direction, but a short lag in the other.\nC_LIO_LILong lag times are caused by an inability to sense fluxes after nutrient shifts.\nC_LIO_LIWith existing regulation, lag time asymmetry can only be overcome by reducing either growth rate or increasing futile cycling in metabolism.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) plays a salient role in physiological processes such as spatial cognition and spatial coding. mEC layer II stellate neurons, in particular, influence these processes. Interestingly, ventral and dorsal stellate neurons diversely affect these processes and have distinct intrinsic membrane properties and action potential firing patterns. Little, though, is known about how ventral stellate neuron intrinsic excitability is regulated. We show that ventral stellate neurons predominantly possess T-type Ca2+ currents encoded by CaV3.2 subunits, with dorsal stellate neurons having small or no currents. Further, twice as much CaV3.2 mRNA was present in ventral than dorsal mEC. In line with T-type, CaV3.2 Ca2+ current biophysical properties, depolarising stimuli activated these currents in ventral, but not dorsal, neurons. Here, these currents acted in concert with persistent Na+ currents to elevate input resistance and tonic action potential firing. CaV3.2 currents also enhanced excitatory post-synaptic potential decay and integration solely in ventral neurons. These results reveal that CaV3.2 currents, together with persistent Na+ currents, impart the characteristic intrinsic membrane and firing properties of ventral stellate neurons. This signifies that specific voltage-gated conductances distinctly affect ventral and dorsal mEC stellate neuron activity and functions such as spatial memory and spatial navigation.",

    "abstract": "CD8 T cell activation prompts extensive transcriptome remodeling underlying effector differentiation and function. Regulation of transcriptome composition by the mitogen-inducible nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) adaptor protein ARS2 has critical cell type-specific consequences, including thymic T cell survival. Here we show that ARS2 was upregulated by CD28 during activation of peripheral T cells, was essential for anti-tumor immunity, and facilitated T cell activation-induced alternative splicing. The novel splicing function of ARS2 was mediated at least in part by recruitment of splicing factors to nascent transcripts including the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (Pkm2), a key determinant of CD8 T cell effector properties. Notably, ARS2-directed Pkm2 splicing occurred days after stimulation of PI3K-indepdendent CD28 signaling and increased glycolysis beyond levels determined by PI3K signaling during T cell priming. Thus, ARS2-directed Pkm2 splicing represents a mechanism by which CD28 drives glycolytic metabolism, allowing for optimal effector cytokine production and T cell anti-tumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are potent mediators of inflammation, acting to coordinate local and systemic immune responses to a wide range of stimuli. Aberrant signaling by IL-1 family cytokine members, however, is linked to myriad inflammatory syndromes, autoimmune conditions and cancers. As such, blocking the inflammatory signals inherent to IL-1 family signaling is an established and expanding therapeutic strategy. While several FDA-approved IL-1 inhibitors exists, including an Fc fusion protein, a neutralizing antibody, and an antagonist cytokine, none specifically targets the co-receptor IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP). Most IL-1 family cytokines form productive signaling complexes by binding first to their cognate receptors - IL-1RI for IL-1 and IL-1{beta}; ST2 for IL-33; and IL-36R for IL-36, IL-36{beta} and IL-36{gamma} - after which they recruit the shared secondary receptor IL-1RAcP to form a ternary cytokine/receptor/co-receptor complex. Recently, IL-1RAcP was identified as a biomarker for both AML and CML. IL-1RAcP has also been implicated in tumor progression in solid tumors and an anti-IL1RAP antibody (nadunolimab, CAN04) is in phase II clinical studies in pancreatic cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NCT03267316). As IL-1RAcP is common to all of the abovementioned IL-1 family cytokines, targeting this co-receptor raises the possibility of selective signaling inhibition for different IL-1 family cytokines. Indeed, previous studies of IL-1{beta} and IL-33 signaling complexes have revealed that these cytokines employ distinct mechanisms of IL-1RAcP recruitment even though their overall cytokine/receptor/co-receptor complexes are structurally similar. Here, using functional, biophysical, and structural analyses, we show that antibodies specific for IL-1RAcP can differentially block signaling by IL-1 family cytokines depending on the distinct IL-1RAcP epitopes that they engage. Our results indicate that targeting a shared cytokine receptor is a viable therapeutic strategy for selective cytokine signaling inhibition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCopepods are among the most numerous animals, and play an essential role in the marine trophic web and biogeochemical cycles. The genus Oithona is described as having the highest density of copepods, and as being the most cosmopolite copepods. The Oithona male paradox describes the activity states of males, which are obliged to alternate between immobile and mobile phases for ambush feeding and mate searching, respectively, while the female is typically less mobile and often feeding. To characterize the molecular basis of this sexual dimorphism, we combined immunofluorescence, genomics, transcriptomics, and protein-protein interaction approaches.\n\nResultsImmunofluorescence of {beta}3- and -tubulin revealed two male-specific nervous ganglia in the lateral first segment of the Oithona nana males prosome. In parallel, transcriptomic analysis showed male-specific enrichment for nervous system development-related transcripts. Twenty-seven Lin12-Notch Repeat domain-containing protein coding genes (LDPGs) of the 75 LDPGs identified in the genome were specifically expressed only in males. Furthermore, most of the LDPGs (27%) coded for proteins having predicted proteolytic activity, and non-LDPG proteolysis-associated transcripts showed a male-specific enrichment. Using yeast double-hybrid assays, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network involving two LDPs with proteases, extracellular matrix proteins, and neurogenesis-related proteins.\n\nConclusionsFor the first time, our study describes the lateral nervous ganglia of O. nana males, unique to copepods. We also demonstrated a role of LDPGs and their associated proteolysis in male-specific physiology, and we hypothesize a role of the LDPGs in the development of the lateral ganglia through directed lysis of the extracellular matrix for the growth of neurites and genesis of synapses.",

We identified 3 major cell subpopulations, namely osteo-MSCs, chondro-MSCs, adipo/myo-MSCs, across all MSC samples. MSCs from umbilical cord exhibited the highest immunosuppression, potentially indicating it is the best immune modulator for autoimmune diseases. The differentiation potentials of MSC subpopulations, which are strongly associated with their subtypes and tissue sources, showed pronounced subpopulation differences. We found MSC subpopulations expanded and differentiated when their subtypes consist with induction directions, while the other subpopulations shrank. We identified the genes and transcription factors underlying each induction at single cell level and subpopulation level, providing better targets for improving induction efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Despite reports of parental exposure to stress promoting physiological adaptations in progeny in diverse organisms, there remains considerable debate over the significance and evolutionary conservation of such multigenerational effects. Here, we investigate four independent models of intergenerational adaptations to stress in C. elegans - bacterial infection, eukaryotic infection, osmotic stress and nutrient stress - across multiple species. We found that all four intergenerational physiological adaptations are conserved in at least one other species, that they are stress-specific, and that they have deleterious trade-offs in mismatched environments. By profiling the effects of parental bacterial infection and osmotic stress exposure on progeny gene expression across species we established a core set of 279 highly conserved genes that exhibited intergenerational changes in expression in response to stress in all species tested and provide evidence suggesting that presumed adaptive and deleterious intergenerational effects are molecularly related at the gene expression level. By contrast, we found that these same stresses did not elicit any similarly conserved transgenerational changes in progeny gene expression three generations after stress exposure. We conclude that intergenerational responses to stress play a substantial and evolutionarily conserved role in regulating animal physiology and that the vast majority of the effects of parental stress on progeny gene expression are reversible and not maintained transgenerationally.",

Since the consensus sequence recognized by the response regulator DegU has not been clearly defined yet, mutations in either component have been crucial in the identification of the cellular targets of this regulatory system. Over the years, the degU32Hy mutant allele, that was supposed to mimic the activated regulator, has been commonly used to define the impact of this TCS on its regulated genes in domestic strains.\n\nSwrA encodes a small protein essential for swarming motility and for poly-{gamma}-glutamate biosynthesis and is only present in wild strains. Previous work indicated that SwrA is partnering with DegU~P in exerting its role on both phenotypes.\n\nIn this work, inserting a degS200Hy mutation in swrA+ and swrA- isogenic strains we demonstrate that SwrA modulates the action of DegU~P on two new phenotypes, subtilisin expression and competence for DNA uptake, with a remarkable effect on transformation. These effects cannot not be appreciated with the DegU32Hy mutant as it does not mirror the wild-type DegU protein in its ability to interact with SwrA.",

Under a model in which all loci and cell types within a co-cluster have a shared accessibility state, we show that roughly 80% of cell type associated accessibility variation can be captured through 12 cell type clusters and 20 genomic locus clusters. Using publicly available ChIPseq datasets, we show that our clustering reflects transcription factor binding patterns with implications for regulation across cell types.

However, with the plummeting costs of next-generation sequencing and the addition of genomic selection to the plant breeders toolbox, we now can more efficiently tap the genetic diversity within large germplasm collections. In this study, we applied and evaluated genomic selections potential to a set of 482 pea accessions - genotyped with 30,600 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers and phenotyped for seed yield and yield-related components - for enhancing selection of accessions from the USDA Pea Germplasm Collection. Genomic prediction models and several factors affecting predictive ability were evaluated in a series of cross-validation schemes across complex traits. Different genomic prediction models gave similar results, with predictive ability across traits ranging from 0.23 to 0.60, with no model working best across all traits. Increasing the training population size improved the predictive ability of most traits, including seed yield. Predictive abilities increased and reached a plateau with increasing number of markers presumably due to extensive linkage disequilibrium in the pea genome. Accounting for population structure effects did not significantly boost predictive ability, but we observed a slight improvement in seed yield. By applying the best genomic prediction model (e.g., RR-BLUP), we then examined the distribution of genotyped but nonphenotyped accessions and the reliability of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). The distribution of GEBV suggested that none of the nonphenotyped accessions were expected to perform outside the range of the phenotyped accessions. Desirable breeding values with higher reliability can be used to identify and screen favorable germplasm accessions. Expanding the training set and incorporating additional orthogonal information (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, physiological traits, etc.) into the genomic prediction framework could enhance prediction accuracy.",

We hoped to understand the molecular underpinnings of JDM, particularly in untreated disease, which would facilitate the identification of novel mechanisms and clinical targets that might disrupt disease progression. We studied the RNA-Seq data from untreated JDM peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; n=11), PBMCs from a subset of the same patients when clinically inactive (n=8/11), and separate samples of untreated JDM skin and muscle (n=4 each). All JDM samples were compared to non-inflammatory control tissues. The untreated JDM PBMCs showed a strong signature for type1 interferon response, along with IL-1, IL-10, and NF-{kappa}B. Surprisingly, PBMCs from clinically inactive JDM individuals had persistent immune activation that was enriched for IL-1 signaling. JDM skin and muscle both showed evidence for type 1 interferon activation and genes related to antigen presentation, and decreased expression of genes related for cellular respiration. Additionally we found that PBMC gene expression correlates with disease activity scores (DAS; skin, muscle, and total domains) and with nailfold capillary end row loop number (an indicator of microvascular damage). This included otoferlin, which was significantly increased in untreated JDM PBMCs and correlated with all 3 DAS domains. Overall, these data demonstrate that PBMC transcriptomes are informative of molecular disruptions in JDM and provide transcriptional evidence of chronic inflammation despite clinical quiescence.",

Our data demonstrate differential effects for the C-subregions in fibrin polymerisation, clot mechanical strength, and fibrinolytic susceptibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the C-subregions are key for promoting longitudinal fibre growth. Together, these findings highlight critical functions of the C-subregions in relation to clot structure and stability, with future implications for development of novel therapeutics for thrombosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdaptive sampling is a method of software-controlled enrichment unique to nanopore sequencing platforms recently implemented in Oxford Nanopores own control software. By examining the first few hundred bases of a DNA molecule as it passes through a pore, software can determine if the molecule is sufficiently interesting to sequence in its entirety. If not, the molecule is ejected from the pore by reversing the voltage across it, freeing the pore for a new molecule. User supplied sequences define the targets to be sequenced or ejected. Here we explore the potential of using adaptive sampling for enrichment of rarer species within metagenomic samples.\n\nResultsWe created a synthetic mock community consisting of seven bacterial species at different proportions ranging from 1.2% to 47% and used this as the basis for a series of enrichment and depletion experiments. To investigate the effect of DNA length on adaptive sampling efficiency, we created sequencing libraries with mean read lengths of 1.7 kbp, 4.7 kbp, 10.6 kbp, and 12.8 kbp and enriched or depleted for individual and multiple species over a series of sequencing runs. Across all experiments enrichment ranged from 1.67-fold for the most abundant species with the shortest read length to 13.87-fold for the least abundant species with the longest read length. Factoring in the reduction to sequence output associated with repeatedly rejecting molecules reduces the calculated efficiency of this enrichment to between 0.96-fold and 4.93-fold. We note that reducing ejections due to false negatives (approximately 36%) would significantly increase efficiency. We used the relationship between abundance, molecule length and enrichment factor to produce a mathematical model of enrichment based on molecule length and relative abundance, whose predictions correlated strongly with experimental data. A web application is provided to allow researchers to explore model predictions in advance of performing their own experiments.\n\nConclusionsOur data clearly demonstrates the benefit for enriching low abundant species in adaptive sampling metagenomic experiments, especially with longer molecules, and our mathematical model can be used to determine whether a given experimental DNA sample is suitable for adaptive sampling. Notably, repeated voltage reversals have no effect on pore stability.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a leading cause of disabilities around the world, and the underlying mechanisms involved in its pathophysiology are broad and complex. Exposure to chronic stress is a risk factor for developing depressive-symptoms and contributes to cellular and molecular changes precipitating the emergence of symptoms. In the brain, excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons and supporting astroglial cells are all sensitive to chronic stress exposure and are known to be impaired in depression.\n\nUsing an animal model of chronic stress, we assessed the impact of variable durations of chronic stress on the emergence of behavioral deficits and associated molecular changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), brain region highly sensitive to stress and impaired in depression. Mice were exposed to up to 35 days of chronic restraint stress and were assessed weekly on behavioral tests measuring anxiety and anhedonia. PFC Protein and RNA levels of specific markers of excitatory, inhibitory synapses and astroglia were quantified using western blot and qPCR, respectively. Correlation and integrative network analyses were used to investigated the impact of chronic stress on the different compartments.\n\nResults showed that chronic stress induces anxiety-like behaviors within 7 days, while anhedonia-like behaviors were observed only after 35 days. At the molecular level, alterations of many markers were observed, in particular with longer exposure to chronic stress. Finally, correlation analyses and integrative network analyses revealed that male and female mice react differently to chronic stress exposure and that some markers seem to be more correlated to behaviors deficits in males than in females.\n\nOur study demonstrate that chronic induces a dynamic changes that can be observed at the behavioral and molecular levels, and that male and female mice, while exhibiting similar symptoms, have different underlying pathologies.",
