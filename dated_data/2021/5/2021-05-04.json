    "abstract": "Drug development is costly and time-consuming, and developing novel practical strategies for creating more effective treatments is imperative. One possible solution is to prescribe drugs in combination. Synergistic drug combinations could allow lower doses of each constituent drug, reducing adverse reactions and drug resistance. However, it is not feasible to sufficiently test every combination of drugs for a given illness to determine promising synergistic combinations. Since there is a finite amount of time and resources available for finding synergistic combinations, a model that can identify synergistic combinations from a limited subset of all available combinations could accelerate development of therapeutics. By applying recommender algorithms, such as the low-rank matrix completion algorithm Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF), it may be possible to identify synergistic combinations from partial information of the drug interactions. Here, we use PMF to predict the efficacy of two-drug combinations using the NCI ALMANAC, a robust collection of pairwise drug combinations of 104 FDA-approved anticancer drugs against 60 common cancer cell lines. We find that PMF is able predict drug combination efficacy with high accuracy from a limited set of combinations and is robust to changes in the individual training data. Moreover, we propose a new PMF-guided experimental design to detect all synergistic combinations without testing every combination.",

    "abstract": "Miniature microscopes have gained considerable traction for in vivo calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon in vivo calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (Miniscope Analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware. Minian has been validated to reliably and robustly extract calcium events across different brain regions and from different cell types. In practice, Minian provides an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results.",

    "abstract": "The repressive effect of DNA methylation at promoters is well-known. However, its role within conserved sequences in intragenic and intergenic regions is less clear. Using Cd4 as a model gene, here we show that DNA methylation regulates the function of stimulus-responsive regulatory elements in effector T cells. Two cis-elements orchestrate intra-and intergenic DNA demethylation of the Cd4 gene during thymic development, which in turn licenses a stimulus-responsive element, E4a, for its later function in effector cells. Deficiency in DNA demethylation leads to impaired E4a function, reduced H3K4me3 promoter levels and an inability to repel de novo DNA methylation during replication, ultimately leading to gene silencing. This physiological reduction in CD4 expression leads to a defect in Th1 polarization during cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Similar patterns of regulation were observed in a broad number of genes, highlighting an essential role for DNA demethylation during thymic development in modulating the function of stimulus-responsive elements.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients wait months and undergo numerous invasive procedures between the initial appearance of symptoms and receiving a diagnosis. In order to reduce time until diagnosis and improve patient wellbeing, machine learning algorithms capable of diagnosing IBD from the gut microbiomes composition are currently being explored. To date, these models have had limited clinical application due to decreased performance when applied to a new cohort of patient samples. Various methods have been developed to analyze microbiome data which may improve the generalizability of machine learning IBD diagnostic tests. With an abundance of methods, there is a need to benchmark the performance and generalizability of various machine learning pipelines (from data processing to training a machine learning model) for microbiome-based IBD diagnostic tools.\n\nResultsWe collected fifteen 16S rRNA microbiome datasets (7707 samples) from North America to benchmark combinations of gut microbiome features, data normalization methods, batch effect reduction methods, and machine learning models. Pipeline generalizability to new cohorts of patients was evaluated with four binary classification metrics following leave-one dataset-out cross validation, where all samples from one study were left out of the training set and tested upon. We demonstrate that taxonomic features obtained from QIIME2 lead to better classification of samples from IBD patients than inferred functional features obtained from PICRUSt2. In addition, machine learning models that identify non-linear decision boundaries between labels are more generalizable than those that are linearly constrained. Prior to training a non-linear machine learning model on taxonomic features, it is important to apply a compositional normalization method and remove batch effects with the naive zero-centering method. Lastly, we illustrate the importance of generating a curated training dataset to ensure similar performance across patient demographics.\n\nConclusionsThese findings will help improve the generalizability of machine learning models as we move towards non-invasive diagnostic and disease management tools for patients with IBD.",

Nevertheless, each larval stage has a defined duration and entails specific events. We have measured the duration of each stage of development for over 2,500 larvae, under varied environmental conditions known to alter overall developmental rate. Our results show that distinct developmental stages respond differently to environmental perturbations, including changes in temperature, in food quantity and quality, and amount of insulin signaling. Furthermore, our high-resolution measurement of the effect of temperature on the stage-specific duration of development has unveiled novel features of temperature dependence in C. elegans postembryonic development. Altogether, our results support a model of linear progression of C. elegans development, with the duration of each stage determined by a unique program.",

Here, we describe GECCO (GEne Cluster prediction with COnditional random fields; https://gecco.embl.de), a high-precision, scalable method for identifying novel BGCs in (meta)genomic data using conditional random fields (CRFs). Based on an extensive evaluation of de novo BGC prediction, we found GECCO to be more accurate and over 3x faster than a state-of-the-art deep learning approach. When applied to over 12,000 genomes, GECCO identified nearly twice as many BGCs compared to a rule-based approach, while achieving higher accuracy than other machine learning approaches. Introspection of the GECCO CRF revealed that its predictions rely on protein domains with both known and novel associations to secondary metabolism. The method developed here represents a scalable, interpretable machine learning approach, which can identify BGCs de novo with high precision.",

    "abstract": "Hard graph problems are ubiquitous in Bioinformatics, inspiring the design of specialized Fixed-Parameter Tractable algorithms, many of which rely on a combination of tree-decomposition and dynamic programming. The time/space complexities of such approaches hinge critically on low values for the treewidth tw of the input graph. In order to extend their scope of applicability, we introduce the TO_SCPLOWREEC_SCPLOW-DO_SCPLOWIETC_SCPLOW problem, i.e. the removal of a minimal set of edges such that a given tree-decomposition can be slimmed down to a prescribed treewidth tw'. Our rationale is that the time gained thanks to a smaller treewidth in a parameterized algorithm compensates the extra post-processing needed to take deleted edges into account.\n\nOur core result is an FPT dynamic programming algorithm for TO_SCPLOWREEC_SCPLOW-DO_SCPLOWIETC_SCPLOW, using 2O(tw)n time and space. We complement this result with parameterized complexity lower-bounds for stronger variants (e.g., NP-hardness when tw' or tw - tw' is constant). We propose a prototype implementation for our approach which we apply on difficult instances of selected RNA-based problems: RNA design, sequence-structure alignment, and search of pseudoknotted RNAs in genomes, revealing very encouraging results. This work paves the way for a wider adoption of tree-decomposition-based algorithms in Bioinformatics.",

    "abstract": "The balance between fast synchronous and delayed asynchronous release of neurotransmitters has a major role in defining computational properties of neuronal synapses and regulation of neuronal network activity. However, how it is tuned at the single synapse level remains poorly understood. Here, using the fluorescent glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR, we image quantal vesicular release in tens to hundreds of individual synaptic outputs (presynaptic boutons) from single pyramidal cells in culture with 4 millisecond temporal resolution, and localise vesicular release sites with ~ 75 nm spatial resolution. We find that the ratio between synchronous and asynchronous synaptic vesicle exocytosis varies extensively among presynaptic boutons supplied by the same axon, and that asynchronous release fraction is elevated in parallel with short-term facilitation at synapses with low release probability. We further demonstrate that asynchronous exocytosis sites are more widely distributed within the presynaptic release area than synchronous sites. These findings are consistent with a model in which functional presynaptic properties are regulated via a synapsespecific adjustment of the coupling distance between presynaptic Ca2+ channels and releaseready synaptic vesicles. Together our results reveal a universal relationship between the two major functional properties of synapses - the timing and the overall probability of neurotransmitter release.",

Support comes from M/EEG studies, showing reduced auditory N1 and P2 responses to self-compared to externally generated events, or when stimulus properties are more predictable (e.g. prototypical). The current study examined the sensitivity of N1 and P2 responses to statistical regularities of speech. We employed a motor-to-auditory paradigm comparing ERP responses to externally and self-generated pseudowords, varying in phonotactic probability and syllable stress. We expected to see N1 and P2 suppression for self-generated stimuli, with greater suppression effect for more predictable features such as high phonotactic probability and first syllable stress in pseudowords. We observe an interaction between phonotactic probability and condition on the N1 amplitude, with an enhanced effect of phonotactic probability in processing self-generated stimuli. However, the directionality of this effect was reversed compared to what was expected, namely a larger N1 amplitude for high probability items, possibly indicating a perceptual bias toward the more predictable item. We further observed an effect of syllable stress on the P2 amplitude, with greater amplitudes in response to first syllable stress items. The current results suggest that phonotactic probability plays an important role in processing self-generated speech, supporting feedforward models involved in speech production.",

While activities of both isoforms regulate homeostatic Lyn expression, only LynB protects against autoimmune disease. LynBKO monocytes and dendritic cells are TLR4-hyper-responsive, and TLR4 expression increases with age in LynBKO myeloid and B cells. These changes are accompanied by the development of an inflammatory disease that resembles human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The interplay between LynB and TLR4 likely underlies the autoimmunity risk associated with LYN hypomorph and TLR4 hypermorph alleles.",

In the case of microRNAs, this process was shown to be functionally relevant for their maturation process and generation of isomiRs with non-canonical mRNA targets. Deconvolution of these posttranscriptional modifications is challenging in particular for extracellular miRNAs that are considered as a target for minimally-invasive diagnostics. Massively parallel RNA sequencing is the only method that can truthfully reveal isomiR diversity in biological samples and determine relative quantities. Improvements aside, current small RNA sequencing strategies remain imprecise. We developed IsoSeek that diverges from these methods by making use of randomized 5- and 3-adapters combined with a 10N unique molecular identifier (UMI). Using synthetic miRNA and isomiR spike-in sets and testing depletion and RNA competition strategies in 7 sequencing rounds of >100 samples, we rigorously optimized and validated the technical accuracy of the IsoSeek method. In genetically-altered HEK293, we characterized the terminal uridylase (TUT4/TUT7) dependent miRNA uridylome and discovered extensive uridylation of disease-associated miRNAs. Notably, 3-uridylated isomiR profiles of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) rely on UMI-correction.

    "abstract": "During sleep, the widespread coordination of neuronal oscillations across both cortical and subcortical brain regions is thought to support various physiological functions, including memory consolidation. However, how sleep-related activity within the brains largest sensorimotor structure, the cerebellum, is multiplexed with well described sleep-related mechanisms in regions such as the hippocampus remains unknown.\n\nTo address this gap in knowledge, we simultaneously recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and three distinct regions of the cerebellum (Crus I, lobule VI and lobules II/III) during natural murine sleep. We found that LFP oscillations are coordinated between the two structures in a sleep-stage specific manner. Particularly during non-REM sleep, prominent delta frequency coherence was observed between lobule VI and hippocampus. We additionally observed that non-REM associated hippocampal sharp wave ripple activity can drive discrete LFP modulation in all the recorded cerebellar regions, with the shortest latency effects observed in lobule VI.\n\nWe also describe discrete phasic sharp potentials, synchronized across cerebellar regions, which were strongly phase locked to the peak of ongoing cerebellar delta oscillations and found in greatest numbers during REM. These phasic sharp potentials recorded within the cerebellar cortex were found to be phase-locked to the trough of the hippocampal theta oscillation, further suggesting cross-structural coordination. During REM, cerebellar delta oscillation phase significantly modulated hippocampal theta frequency, and this effect was greatest when phasic sharp potentials were most abundant. Within all three cerebellar regions, prominent LFP oscillations were observed at both low (delta, <4 Hz) and very high frequencies (~ 250 Hz) during non-REM and REM sleep. Intra-cerebellar cross-frequency analysis revealed that delta frequency oscillations strongly modulate those in the very high frequency range.\n\nTogether, these results reveal multiple candidate physiological mechanisms to support  offline, bi-directional interaction within distributed cerebello-hippocampal networks. In particular, we describe a prominent cerebellar delta oscillation, which appears to act as a temporal coordinator of cerebellar activity at both local (intra-cerebellar) and distributed (cerebello-hippocampal) network levels.",

    "abstract": "Semantic information is important in eye-movement control. An important semantic influence on gaze guidance relates to object-scene relationships: objects that are semantically inconsistent with the scene attract more fixations than consistent objects. One interpretation of this effect is that fixations are driven towards inconsistent objects because they are semantically more informative. We tested this explanation using contextualized meaning maps, a method that is based on crowd-sourced ratings to quantify the spatial distribution of context-sensitive  meaning in images. In Experiment 1, we compared gaze data and contextualized meaning maps for images, in which objects-scene consistency was manipulated. Observers fixated more on inconsistent vs. consistent objects. However, contextualized meaning maps did not assigned higher meaning to image regions that contained semantic inconsistencies. In Experiment 2, a large number of raters evaluated the meaningfulness of a set of carefully selected image-regions. The results suggest that the same scene locations were experienced as slightly less meaningful when they contained inconsistent compared to consistent objects. In summary, we demonstrated that - in the context of our rating task - semantically inconsistent objects are experienced as less meaningful than their consistent counterparts, and that contextualized meaning maps do not capture prototypical influences of image meaning on gaze guidance.",

    "abstract": "Canopy gaps are openings in the forest canopy resulting from branch fall and tree mortality events. Light reaches the lower layers of the canopy through these gaps, enabling understory trees to grow and maintaining the high heterogeneity and biodiversity of tropical forests. The size-frequency distribution of canopy gaps follows a power-law distribution, and the slope of this power-law () is a key indicator of forest structure and dynamics.\n\nWe detected canopy gaps using a unique LiDAR data set consisting of 650 transects randomly distributed across the Brazilian Amazon Forest providing an unprecedented perspective on forest structural variation over 2500 km2 of forest. We then investigated how  varied with forest structure, elevation, soil fertility, water deficit, wind gust speed and lightning intensity.\n\nWe found that human modified forests had more large gaps than intact forests. Within the intact forests we observed a large-scale Northwest to Southeast pattern in  (more large gaps in the Southeast), which aligns with recent work on tree mortality rates. The two most important variables in predicting  were median canopy height and maximum modeled height, which had opposite effects on the number of large gaps. Forests with higher median canopy height contain fewer large gaps but the presence of very tall trees was associated with more large gaps. Environmental variables were of secondary importance in our model, with larger gaps occurring in drier forests with high soil fertility, wind speed, and lightning intensity.\n\nThe distribution of large gaps in the forest canopy varies substantially over the Brazilian Amazon as a result of canopy structure and mortality rates. We mapped this variation and found more large gaps in human modified forests, forests on fertile soils and those exposed to higher wind, lightning and drought stress. Increasing extreme weather events due to climate change may therefore increase the number of large gaps in currently intact forests, causing them to resemble human modified forests.",

    "abstract": "Even though people around the world tend to consume probiotic products for their beneficial health effects on a daily basis, recently, concerns were outlined regarding the uptake and potential intestinal colonisation of the bacteria that they transfer. These bacteria are capable of executing horizontal gene transfer (HGT) which facilitates the movement of various genes, including antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), among the donor and recipient bacterial populations. Within our study, 47 shotgun sequencing datasets deriving from various probiotic samples (isolated strains and metagenomes) were bioinformatically analysed. We detected more than 70 ARGs, out of which rpoB mutants conferring resistance to rifampicin, tet(W/N/W) and potentially extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) coding TEM-116 were the most common. Numerous ARGs were associated with integrated mobile genetic elements, plasmids or phages promoting the HGT. Our findings raise clinical and public health concerns as the consumption of probiotic products may lead to the transfer of ARGs to human gut bacteria.",

In this work, we analyzed a corpus of 66,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We developed a novel semi-supervised pipeline for automated gene, protein, and functional domain annotation of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that differentiates itself by not relying on use of a single reference genome and by overcoming atypical genome traits. Using this method, we identified the comprehensive set of known proteins with 98.5% set membership accuracy and 99.1% accuracy in length prediction compared to proteome references including Replicase polyprotein 1ab (with its transcriptional slippage site). Compared to other published tools such as Prokka (base) and VAPiD, we yielded an 6.4- and 1.8-fold increase in protein annotations. Our method generated 13,000,000 molecular target sequences-- some conserved across time and geography while others represent emerging variants. We observed 3,362 non-redundant sequences per protein on average within this corpus and describe key D614G and N501Y variants spatiotemporally. For spike glycoprotein domains, we achieved greater than 97.9% sequence identity to references and characterized Receptor Binding Domain variants.

Here, we present LiPyphilic - a fast, fully tested, and easy to install Python package for analysing such simulations. Analysis tools in LiPyphilic include the identification of cholesterol flip-flop events, the classification of local lipid environments, and the degree of interleaflet registration. LiPyphilic is both force field and resolution agnostic, and thanks to the powerful atom selection language of MDAnalysis it can handle membranes with highly complex compositions. LiPyphilic also offers two on-the-fly trajectory transformations to i) fix membranes split across periodic boundaries and ii) perform nojump coordinate unwrapping. Our implementation of nojump unwrapping accounts for fluctuations in box volume under the NPT ensemble -- an issue that most current implementations have overlooked.

    "abstract": "Mechanical forces, actin filament turnover, and adhesion to the extracellular environment regulate lamellipodial protrusions. Computational and mathematical models at the continuum level have been used to investigate the molecular clutch mechanism, calculating the stress profile through the lamellipodium and around focal adhesions. However, the forces and deformations of individual actin filaments have not been considered while interactions between actin networks and actin bundles is not easily accounted with such methods. We develop a filament-level model of a lamellipodial actin network undergoing retrograde flow using 3D Brownian dynamics. Retrograde flow is promoted in simulations by pushing forces from the leading edge (due to actin polymerization), pulling forces (due to molecular motors), and opposed by viscous drag in cytoplasm and focal adhesions. Simulated networks have densities similar to measurements in prior electron micrographs. Connectivity between individual actin segments is maintained by permanent and dynamic crosslinkers. Remodeling of the network occurs via the addition of single actin filaments near the leading edge and via filament bond severing. We investigated how several parameters affect the stress distribution, network deformation and retrograde flow speed. The model captures the decrease in retrograde flow upon increase of focal adhesion strength. The stress profile changes from compression to extension across the leading edge, with regions of filament bending around focal adhesions. The model reproduces the observed reduction in retrograde flow speed upon exposure to cytochalasin D, which halts actin polymerization. Changes in crosslinker concentration and dynamics, as well as in the orientation pattern of newly added filaments demonstrate the models ability to generate bundles of filaments perpendicular (actin arcs) or parallel (microspikes) to the protruding direction.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWRespiration and swallowing are vital orofacial motor behaviours that require the coordination of the activity of two brainstem central pattern generators (r-CPG, sw-CPG). Here, we use computational modelling to further elucidate the neural substrate for breathing-swallowing coordination. We progressively construct several computational models of the breathing-swallowing circuit, starting from two interacting half-centre oscillators for each CPG. The models are based exclusively on neuronal nodes with spike-frequency adaptation, having a parsimonious description of intrinsic properties. These basic models undergo a stepwise integration of synaptic connectivity between central sensory relay, sw- and r-CPG neuron populations to match experimental data obtained in a perfused brainstem preparation. In the model, stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN, 10s) reliably triggers sequential swallowing with concomitant glottal closure and suppression of inspiratory activity, consistent with the motor pattern in experimental data. Short SLN stimulation (100ms) evokes single swallows and respiratory phase resetting yielding similar experimental and computational phase response curves. Subsequent phase space analysis of model dynamics provides further understanding of SLN-mediated respiratory phase resetting. Consistent with experiments, numerical circuit-busting simulations show that deletion of ponto-medullary synaptic interactions triggers apneusis and eliminates glottal closure during sequential swallowing. Additionally, systematic variations of the synaptic strengths of distinct network connections predict vulnerable network connections that can mediate clinically relevant breathing-swallowing disorders observed in the elderly and patients with neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the present model provides novel insights that can guide future experiments and the development of efficient treatments for prevalent breathing-swallowing disorders.\n\nKO_SCPLOWEYC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWPOINTSC_SCPLOWO_LIThe coordination of breathing and swallowing depends on synaptic interactions between two functionally distinct central pattern generators (CPGs) in the dorsal and ventral brainstem.\nC_LIO_LIWe model both CPGs as half-centre oscillators with spike-frequency adaptation to identify the minimal connectivity sufficient to mediate physiologic breathing-swallowing interactions.\nC_LIO_LIThe resultant computational model(s) can generate sequential swallowing patterns including concomitant glottal closure during simulated 10s stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) consistent with experimental data.\nC_LIO_LIIn silico, short (100 ms) SLN stimulation triggers a single swallow which modulates the respiratory cycle duration consistent with experimental recordings.\nC_LIO_LIBy varying the synaptic connectivity strengths between the two CPGs and the sensory relay neurons, and by inhibiting specific nodes of the network, the model predicts vulnerable network connections that may mediate clinically relevant breathing-swallowing disorders.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The electrical and computational properties of neurons in our brains are determined by a rich repertoire of membrane-spanning ion channels and elaborate dendritic trees. However, the precise reason for this inherent complexity remains unknown. Here, we generated large stochastic populations of biophysically realistic hippocampal granule cell models comparing those with all 15 ion channels to their reduced but functional counterparts containing only 5 ion channels. Strikingly, valid parameter combinations in the full models were more frequent and more stable in the face of perturbations to channel expression levels. Scaling up the numbers of ion channels artificially in the reduced models recovered these advantages confirming the key contribution of the actual number of ion channel types. We conclude that the diversity of ion channels gives a neuron greater flexibility and robustness to achieve target excitability.\n\nSignificance statementOver the course of billions of years, evolution has led to a wide variety of biological systems. The emergence of the more complex among these seems surprising in the light of the high demands of searching for viable solutions in a correspondingly high-dimensional parameter space. In realistic neuron models with their inherently complex ion channel composition, we find a surprisingly large number of viable solutions when selecting parameters randomly. This effect is strongly reduced in models with fewer ion channel types but is recovered when inserting additional artificial ion channels. Because concepts from probability theory provide a plausible explanation for this improved distribution of valid model parameters, we propose that this may generalise to evolutionary selection in other complex biological systems.\n\nIn briefStudying ion channel diversity in neuronal models we show how robust biological systems may evolve not despite but because of their complexity.\n\nHighlightsO_LI15 channel model of hippocampal granule cells (GCs) reduces to 5 ion channels without loss of spiking behaviour.\nC_LIO_LIBut knocking out ion channels can be compensated only in the full model.\nC_LIO_LIRandom sampling leads to ~ 6% solutions in full but only ~ 1% in reduced model.\nC_LIO_LILaw of large numbers generalises our observations to other complex biological systems.\nC_LI",

However, cellular immunity is essential for long-term viral control and protection from disease severity. To understand T-cell immunity in the absence of antibody generation we focused on a group of SARS-CoV-2 Non-Seroconvertors (NSC) recovered from infection. We performed an immune comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals stratified by the absence or presence of seroconversion and disease severity. We report high levels of total naive and low effector CD8+ T cells in NSC. Moreover, polyfunctional Nucleocapsid (NP)-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, as well as reduced levels of T-cell activation monitored by PD-1 and activation-induced markers, were distinctive immunological traits in NSC. Longitudinal data support the stability of the NSC phenotype over three months. Our results implicate highly functional SARS-CoV-2 Spike and NP T-cell responses with low immune activation in protection from disease severity in the absence of seroconversion.\n\nSUMMARYTo understand SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell immunity in the absence of seroconversion, we characterized immunological features of Non-Seroconvertors recovered from infection.

Primary HTEC were grown using an air-liquid culture and infected apically with different influenza viruses (IVs) to measure viral growth kinetics. These cultures were highly differentiated, with subpopulations of heterogenous surface stratified squamous cells rich with both cilia and microvilli; these cells contained more 2,6-linked sialic acids, those preferentially bound by human IVs, than 2,3-linked avian like sialic acids. The stratified squamous cells were interrupted by patches of reticular epithelial cells rich in 2,3-linked sialic acids. The HTEC were permissive for influenza A and B virus replication. Following infection, a subset of cells, mostly ciliated cells, underwent apoptosis while others remained intact despite being positive for IV nucleoprotein. H3N2 virus antigen colocalized with non-ciliated cells while H1N1 virus antigen was mostly associated with ciliated cells. Exposure of HTECs to IVs triggers an early proinflammatory response that fluctuates between viruses. The H3N2 IV induces an early response that persists, whereas pH1N1 induces a primarily late response in HTECs. Our results implicated HTEC as a site for IV replication. The HTEC differentiated system provides a valuable in vitro model for studying cellular tropism, infectivity, cytokine responses and the pathogenesis of IVs.\n\nIMPORTANCETo develop an effective intervention against influenza, it is important to identify host factors affecting transmission, pathogenesis, and immune response. Tonsils are lymphoepithelial organs characterized by infiltration of B and T lymphocytes into the squamous epithelium of tonsillar crypts, beneath which germinal centers play key roles in antigen processing and immune response. The heterogenicity of HTECs as well as the sialic acid distributions supports the replication of IVs and may play a role in IV adaptation. Furthermore, Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure in which tonsils are fully removed from the human throat and may contribute to the diverse outcomes among infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a global public health crisis. Although widespread vaccination campaigns are underway, their efficacy is reduced against emerging variants of concern (VOCs) 1,2. Development of host-directed therapeutics and prophylactics could limit such resistance and offer urgently needed protection against VOCs 3,4. Attractive pharmacological targets to impede viral entry include type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as TMPRSS2, whose essential role in the virus lifecycle is responsible for the cleavage and priming of the viral spike protein 5-7. Here, we identify and characterize a small-molecule compound, N-0385, as the most potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2 reported to date. N-0385 exhibited low nanomolar potency and a selectivity index of >106 at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and in donor-derived colonoids 8. Importantly, N-0385 acted as a broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor of two SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Strikingly, single daily intranasal administration of N-0385 early in infection significantly improved weight loss and clinical outcomes, and yielded 100% survival in the severe K18-human ACE2 transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 disease. This demonstrates that TTSP-mediated proteolytic maturation of spike is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and suggests that N-0385 provides a novel effective early treatment option against COVID-19 and emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome fusions threaten genome integrity and promote cancer by engaging catastrophic mutational processes, namely chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and chromothripsis. Chromosome fusions are frequent in cells incurring telomere dysfunctions or those exposed to DNA breakage. Their occurrence and therefore their contribution to genome instability in unchallenged cells is unknown. To address this issue, we constructed a genetic assay able to capture and quantify rare chromosome fusions in budding yeast. This chromosome fusion capture assay (CFC) relies on the controlled inactivation of one centromere to rescue unstable dicentric chromosome fusions. It is sensitive enough to quantify the basal rate of end-to-end chromosome fusions occurring in wild-type cells. These fusions depend on canonical nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Our results show that chromosome end protection results from a trade-off at telomeres between positive effectors (Rif2, Sir4, telomerase) and a negative effector partially antagonizing them (Rif1). The CFC assay also captures NHEJ-dependent chromosome fusions induced by ionising radiation. It provides evidence for chromosomal rearrangements stemming from a single photon-matter interaction.",

    "abstract": "The Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 mediates docking of the virus onto cells and contributes to viral invasion. Several cellular receptors are involved in SARS-CoV-2 Spike docking at the cell surface, including ACE2 and neuropilin. The intermediate filament protein vimentin has been reported to be present at the surface of certain cells and act as a co-receptor for several viruses; furthermore, its potential involvement in interactions with Spike proteins has been proposed. Here we have explored the binding of Spike protein constructs to several cell types using low-temperature immunofluorescence approaches in live cells, to minimize internalization. Incubation of cells with tagged Spike S or Spike S1 subunit led to discrete dotted patterns at the cell surface, which showed scarce colocalization with a lipid raft marker, but consistent coincidence with ACE2. Under our conditions, vimentin immunoreactivity appeared as spots or patches unevenly distributed at the surface of diverse cell types. Remarkably, several observations including potential antibody internalization and adherence to cells of vimentin-positive structures present in the extracellular medium exposed the complexity of vimentin cell surface immunoreactivity, which requires careful assessment. Notably, overall colocalization of Spike and vimentin signals markedly varied with the cell type and the immunodetection sequence. In turn, vimentin-positive spots moderately colocalized with ACE2; however, a particular enrichment was detected at elongated structures positive for acetylated tubulin, consistent with primary cilia, which also showed Spike binding. Thus, these results suggest that vimentin-ACE2 interaction could occur at selective locations near the cell surface, including ciliated structures, which can act as platforms for SARS-CoV-2 docking.",

    "abstract": "One key feature of proteins that form liquid droplets by phase separation inside a cell is the presence of multiple sites - multivalency - that mediate interactions with other proteins. We know little about the variation of multivalency on evolutionary time scales. Here, we investigated the long-term evolution ([~]600 million years) of multivalency in fungal mRNA decapping subunit 2 protein (Dcp2), and in the FET protein family. We found that multivalency varies substantially among the orthologs of these proteins. However, evolution has maintained the length scale at which sequence motifs that enable protein-protein interactions occur. That is, the total number of such motifs per hundred amino acids is higher and less variable than expected by neutral evolution. To help explain this evolutionary conservation, we developed a conformation classifier using machine-learning algorithms. This classifier demonstrates that disordered segments in Dcp2 and FET proteins tend to adopt compact conformations, which is necessary for phase separation. Thus, the evolutionary conservation we detected may help proteins preserve the ability to undergo phase separation. Altogether, our study reveals that the length scale of multivalent interactions is an evolutionarily conserved feature of two classes of phase-separating proteins in fungi and vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Accurately reconstructing the reticulate histories of polyploids remains a central challenge for understanding plant evolution. Although phylogenetic networks can provide insights into relationships among polyploid lineages, inferring networks may be hampered by the complexities of homology determination in polyploid taxa. We use simulations to show that phasing alleles from allopolyploid individuals can improve inference of phylogenetic networks under the multispecies coalescent. Phased allelic data can also improve divergence time estimates for networks, which is helpful for evaluating allopolyploid speciation hypotheses and proposing mechanisms of speciation. To achieve these outcomes, we present a novel pipeline that leverages a recently developed phasing algorithm to reliably phase alleles from polyploids. This pipeline is especially appropriate for target enrichment data, where depth of coverage is typically high enough to phase entire loci. We provide an empirical example in the North American Dryopteris fern complex that demonstrates how phasing can help reveal the mode of polyploidization and improve network inference. We establish that our pipeline (PATE: Phased Alleles from Target Enrichment data) is capable of recovering a high proportion of phased loci from both diploids and polyploids, and that these data improve network estimates compared to using haplotype consensus assemblies. This approach is shown to be especially effective in reticulate complexes where there are multiple hybridization events. The pipeline is available at: https://github.com/gtiley/Phasing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearchers who perform systematic searches across multiple databases often identify duplicate publications. Identifying such duplicates (\"deduplication\") can be extremely time-consuming, but failure to remove these citations can, in the worst instance, lead to the wrongful inclusion of duplicate data. Many existing tools are not sensitive enough, lack interoperability with other tools, are not freely accessible, or are difficult to use without programming knowledge. Here, we report the performance of our Automated Systematic Search Deduplicator (ASySD), a novel tool to perform automated deduplication of systematic searches for biomedical reviews.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated ASySDs performance on 5 unseen biomedical systematic search datasets of various sizes (1,845 - 79,880 citations), which had been deduplicated by human reviewers. We compared the performance of ASySD with Endnotes automated deduplication option and with the Systematic Review Accelerator Deduplication Module (SRA-DM).\n\nResultsASySD identified more duplicates than either SRA-DM or Endnote, with a sensitivity in different datasets of 0.95 to 0.99. The false-positive rate was comparable to human performance, with a specificity of 0.94-0.99. The tool took less than 1 hour to deduplicate all datasets.\n\nConclusionsFor duplicate removal in biomedical systematic reviews, ASySD is a highly sensitive, reliable, and time-saving tool. It is open source and freely available online as both an R package and a user-friendly web application.",

Pre-exposure to alcohol did not change this relative preference, but acute exposure to an alcohol deterrent approved for human use decreased alcohol self-administration. A pigment mutant used in whole-brain imaging studies displayed a similar relative alcohol preference profile, however, mutants in CCSER1, a gene associated with alcohol dependence in human genetic studies, showed a reversal in relative preference. The presence of a biphasic response (hormesis) in zebrafish validated a key aspect of vertebrate responses to alcohol. SAZA adds a new dimension for discovering novel alcohol deterrents, and studying the neurogenetics of addiction using the zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a neuroinflammatory disease characterized partly by the inability to clear, and subsequent build-up, of amyloid-beta (A{beta}). A{beta} clearance is regulated by several pathways and has a circadian component. However, the mechanism underlying the circadian clearance of A{beta} has not been defined. Myeloid-based phagocytosis, a key mechanism in the metabolism of A{beta}, is circadianly-regulated, presenting a potential mechanism for the circadian clearance of A{beta}. In this work, we revealed that the phagocytosis of A{beta}42 undergoes a daily oscillation that is dependent on the circadian clock. We found the circadian timing of global heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) biosynthesis was the molecular timer for the clock-controlled phagocytosis of A{beta} and that both HSPG binding and A{beta}42 aggregation were essential for this oscillation. These data highlight that circadian regulation in immune cells may play a role in the intricate relationship between the circadian clock and AD.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/442651v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bca9b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29575corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2673c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a8daa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we sought to determine the impact of two conserved RNases, the endoribonuclease RNase Y and exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), on the physiology and virulence of S. pneumoniae serotype 2 strain D39. We report that RNase Y and PNPase are essential for pneumococcal pathogenesis as both deletion mutants showed strong attenuation of virulence in murine models of invasive pneumonia. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed that nearly 200 mRNA transcripts were significantly up-regulated, whereas the abundance of several pneumococcal sRNAs, including the Ccn (CiaR Controlled Noncoding RNA) sRNAs, were altered in the {Delta}rny mutant relative to the wild-type strain. Additionally, lack of RNase Y resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes that included defects in pneumococcal cell morphology and growth in vitro. In contrast, {Delta}pnp mutants showed no growth defect in vitro, but differentially expressed a total of 40 transcripts including the tryptophan biosynthesis operon genes and numerous 5-cis-acting regulatory RNAs, a majority of which were previously shown to impact pneumococcal disease progression in mice using the serotype 4 strain TIGR4. Altogether our data suggest that RNase Y exerts a global impact on pneumococcal physiology, while PNPase-mediates virulence phenotypes, likely through sRNA regulation.\n\nIMPORTANCEStreptococcus pneumoniae is a notorious human pathogen that adapts to conditions in distinct host tissues and responds to host cell interactions by adjusting gene expression. Ribonucleases (RNases) are key players that modulate gene expression by mediating the turnover of regulatory and protein-coding transcripts. Here, we characterized two highly conserved RNases, RNase Y and PNPase, and evaluated their impact on the S. pneumoniae transcriptome for the first time. We show that PNPase influences the levels of a narrow set of mRNAs, but a large number of regulatory RNAs primarily implicated in virulence control, whereas RNase Y has a more sweeping effect on gene expression, altering levels of transcripts involved in diverse cellular processes including cell division, metabolism, stress response, and virulence. This study further reveals that RNase Y regulates expression of genes governing competence by mediating the turnover of CiaR-controlled-noncoding (Ccn) sRNAs.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2) has been identified as the receptor enabling SARS-CoV-2 host entry. To establish a mouse model for COVID-19, we generated transgenic mouse lines using the (HS4)2-pCAG-hACE2-HA-(HS4)2 transgene cassette, which expresses HA-tagged hACE2 under control of the CAG promoter and is flanked by HS4 insulators. Expression levels of the hACE2 transgene are respectively higher in lung, brain and kidney of our CAG-hACE2 transgenic mice and relatively lower in duodenum, heart and liver. The CAG-hACE2 mice are highly susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 100 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 being sufficient to induce 87.5% mortality at 9 days post-infection and resulting in a sole (female) survivor. Mortality was 100% at the higher titer of 1000 PFU. At lower viral titers, we also found that female mice exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection suffered much less weight loss than male mice, implying sex-biased responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We subjected neuronal cultures to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection to ascertain the susceptibilities of neurons and astrocytes. Moreover, we observed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alters the synaptic responses of cultured neurons. Our transgenic mice may serve as a model for severe COVID-19 and sex-biased responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, aiding in the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatments for this disease.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and worldwide spread of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a threat to human health. While bacteriophages are recognized as an effective alternative to treat infections caused by drug resistant pathogens, some bacteriophages in particular the temperate bacteriophage may also influence the virulence of the host bacteria in distinct ways. In this study, we isolated a bacteriophage vB_Saus_PHB21 from an epidermal sample of Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) using a MRSA strain SA14 as the indicator. Our following laboratory tests and whole genome sequencing analyses revealed that vB_Saus_PHB21 was a temperate bacteriophage belonging to the Siphoviridae family, and this bacteriophage did not contain any virulence genes. However, the integration of PHB21 genome into the host MRSA increased the bacterial capacities of cell adhesion, cell invasion, anti-phagocytosis and biofilm formation. Challenge of the lysogenic strain (SA14+) caused severer mortalities in both Galleria mellonella and mouse models. Mice challenged with SA14+ showed more serious organ lesions and produced higher inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IFN-{gamma} and TNF-) compared to those challenged with SA14. In mechanism, we found the integration of PHB21 genome caused the upregulated expression of many genes encoding products involved in bacterial biofilm formation, adherence and invasion to host cells, anti-phagocytosis, and virulence. This study may provide novel knowledge of \"bacteria-phage-interactions\" in MRSA.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe interaction between bacteriophage and bacteria is like a \"double-edged sword\": phages can either kill bacteria, or they may contribute to the bacterial fitness and virulence. In general, phages have positive impacts on bacterial fitness and virulence mainly because they carry antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and/or virulence factors encoding genes (VFGs) and they can spread these harmful genes to the host bacteria. However, we found those phages which do not harbor ARGs and/or VFGs may also enhance the bacterial fitness and virulence. In addition, we also found the integration of phage genomes may lead to the upregulated expression of virulence associated genes in bacteria. Our study may provide new insights to redefine the relationship between phage and bacteria, and the results may also remind a cautious way to set phage-therapy for bacterial infections, before which the safety of a phage intends to be used should be fully evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic (As) metabolism genes are generally present in soils but their diversity, relative abundance, and transcriptional activity in response to different As concentrations remain unclear, limiting our understanding of the microbial activities that control the fate of an important environmental pollutant. To address this issue, we applied metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to paddy soils showing a gradient of As concentrations to investigate As resistance genes (ars) including arsR, acr3, arsB, arsC, arsM, arsI, arsP, and arsH as well as energy-generating As respiratory oxidation (aioA) and reduction (arrA) genes. Somewhat unexpectedly, the relative DNA abundances and diversity of ars, aioA, and arrA genes were not significantly different between low and high ([~]10 vs [~]100 mg kg-1) As soils. By comparison to available metagenomes from other soils, geographic distance rather than As levels drove the different compositions of microbial communities. Arsenic significantly increased ars genes abundance only when its concentration was higher than 410 mg kg-1. In contrast, between low and high As soils, metatranscriptomics revealed a significant increase in transcription of ars and aioA genes, which are induced by arsenite, the dominant As species in paddy soils, but not arrA genes, which are induced by arsenate. These patterns appeared to be community-wide as opposed to taxon-specific. Collectively, our findings advance understanding of how microbes respond to high As levels and the diversity of As metabolism genes in paddy soils and indicated that future studies of As metabolism in soil, or other environments, should include the function (transcriptome) level.\n\nIMPORTANCEArsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid pervasively present in the environment. Microorganisms have evolved the capacity to metabolize As, and As metabolism genes are ubiquitously present in the environment even in the absence of high concentrations of As. However, these previous studies were carried out at the DNA level and thus, the activity of the As metabolism genes detected remains essentially speculative. Here, we show that the high As levels in paddy soils increased the transcriptional activity rather than the relative DNA abundance and diversity of As metabolism genes. These findings advance our understanding of how microbes respond to and cope with high As levels, and have implications for better monitoring and managing an important toxic metalloid in agricultural soils and possibly other ecosystems.",

Here, high-resolution respirometry, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy experiments revealed that mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential increased during mouse sperm capacitation. Treatment with inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration prevented sperm from hyperactivating and fertilizing an oocyte. Mitochondrial respiration was impaired in sperm from mice lacking the calcium channel CatSper. We developed a method to image mitochondrial calcium in sperm and found that CatSper activation led to increased mitochondrial calcium concentration. Finally, treating sperm with an inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium import impaired mitochondrial function and sperm hyperactivation. Together, our results uncover a new role of sperm mitochondria and reveal a new pathway connecting calcium influx through CatSper to mitochondrial activity and the sperm hyperactivation required to fertilize an oocyte.\n\nSummaryThe source of ATP for sperm hyperactivation is unclear. Ferreira et al. show that mitochondrial activity increases during, and is required for, hyperactivation and fertilization ability. Increased mitochondrial activity depends on calcium influx through the channel CatSper.",

    "abstract": "Embryogenesis requires cells to change shape and move without disrupting epithelial integrity. This requires robust, responsive linkage between adherens junctions and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Using Drosophila morphogenesis we define molecular mechanisms mediating junction-cytoskeletal linkage and explore the role of mechanosensing. We focus on the junction-cytoskeletal linker Canoe, a multidomain protein. We engineered the canoe locus to define how its domains mediate its mechanism of action. To our surprise, the PDZ and FAB domains, which we thought connected junctions and F-actin, are not required for viability or mechanosensitive recruitment to junctions under tension. The FAB domain stabilizes junctions experiencing elevated force, but in its absence most cells recover, suggesting redundant interactions. In contrast, the Rap1-binding RA domains are critical for all Cno functions and for enrichment at junctions under tension. This supports a model in which junctional robustness derives from a large protein network assembled via multivalent interactions, with proteins at network nodes and some node connections more critical than others.",

    "abstract": "Environmental change, such as increased rates of urbanization, can induce shifts in phenotypic plasticity with some individuals adapting to city life while others are displaced. A key trait that can facilitate adaptation is the degree at which animals respond to stress. This stress response has a heritable component and exhibits intra- and inter-individual variation. However, the mechanisms behind this variability and whether they might be responsible for adaptation to different environments are not known. Variation in DNA methylation can be a potential mechanism that mediates environmental effects on the stress response. We used an inter- and intra-environmental cross-foster experiment to analyze the contribution of DNA methylation to early-life phenotypic variation. We found that at hatching, urban house wren (Troglodytes aedon) offspring had increased methylation as compared to their rural counterparts, and observed plasticity in methylation as offspring aged, indicating developmental effects of the rearing environment on methylation. Differential methylation analyses showed that cellular respiration genes were differentially expressed at hatching and behavioral and metabolism genes were differentially expressed at fledgling. Lastly, hyper-methylation of a single gene (CNTNAP2) is associated with increased glucocorticoid levels. These differential methylation patterns linked to a specific physiological phenotype suggest that DNA methylation may be a mechanism by which individuals adapt to novel environments. Characterizing genetic and environmental influences on methylation is critical for understanding the role of epigenetic mechanisms in evolutionary adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Although a large number of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out in a constant environment, as natural environments vary in time, it is important to ask if and how these results are affected by a changing environment. Here, we study the properties of the conditional fixation time of a mutant in a finite, randomly mating diploid population which is evolving in a periodically changing environment. In a static environment, as the conditional mean fixation time of a co-dominant beneficial mutant is equal to that of a deleterious mutant with the same magnitude of selection coefficient, similar patterns for beneficial and deleterious sweeps may result. We find that this symmetry breaks even when the environment is changing slowly. Furthermore, for intermediate dominance, the conditional mean fixation time of a beneficial mutant in a slowly changing environment depends weakly on the dominance coefficient and is close to the corresponding results in the static environment; however, the fixation time for a deleterious mutant under moderate selection with a slowly varying selection coefficient differs substantially from that in the constant environment when the mutant is recessive. Our results thus suggest that the variability patterns and levels for beneficial sweeps are mildly affected by temporally varying environment but changing environment is likely to strongly impact those due to recessive deleterious sweeps.",

HIF-1 is thought to promote glycolysis and suppress oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we show instead that HIF-1 can promote gluconeogenesis. Using a multiomics approach, we determined the genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic landscapes regulated by constitutively active HIF-1 in C. elegans. We performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq under aerobic conditions in mutants lacking EGL-9, a key negative regulator of HIF-1, and then integrated these approaches to identify over a hundred genes directly and functionally upregulated by HIF-1. We show that HIF-1 directly promotes the expression of PCK-1, a PEP carboxykinase that is a rate-limiting mediator of gluconeogenesis3. This activation of PCK-1 by HIF-1 promotes survival in response to both oxidative and hypoxic stress. Our work is the first to identify functional direct targets of HIF-1 in vivo, and it describes the first complete metabolome induced by constitutive HIF-1 activation in any organism.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive CRISPR-Cas immune system stores sequences from past invaders as spacers in CRISPR arrays and thereby provides direct evidence that links invaders to hosts. Mapping CRISPR spacers has revealed many aspects of CRISPR biology, including target requirements such as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). However, studies have so far been limited by a low number of mapped spacers in the database. By using vast metagenomic sequence databases, we mapped one third ([~]70,000) of more than 200,000 unique CRISPR spacers from a variety of microbes, and derived a catalog of more than one hundred unique PAM sequences associated with specific CRISPR subtypes. These PAMs were further used to correctly assign the orientation of CRISPR arrays, revealing conserved patterns between the last nucleotides of the CRISPR repeat and PAM. From the curated CRISPR arrays dataset we could also deduce CRISPR subtype specific preferences for targeting either template or coding strand of open reading frames. While some DNA-targeting systems (e.g. Type I-E and Type II systems) prefer the template strand and avoid mRNA, other DNA- and RNA-targeting systems (i.e. Type I-A, I-B and Type III systems) prefer the coding strand and mRNA. In addition, we found large scale evidence that both CRISPR adaptation machinery and CRISPR arrays are shared between different CRISPR-Cas systems. This could lead to simultaneous DNA- and RNA targeting of invaders, which may be effective at combating mobile genetic invaders.",

Using the in silico proteome and microarray analysis, interactions between PD genes and conditions affecting PD function are identified. High salinity and osmotic stress affect a significant number of PD candidate genes and we provide evidence that these conditions regulate symplasmic transport of GFP. Using the pipeline, the in silico PD proteome for Medicago truncatula was generated, as an example of a plant in which experimental data is not available. The identification of a candidate receptor like protein was experimentally validated in M. truncatula transgenic roots expressing fluorescently tagged protein fusion.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPsychiatric neuroimaging typically proceeds with one of two approaches: encoding models, which aim to model neural mechanisms, or decoding models, which aim to predict behavioral or clinical characteristics from brain imaging data. In this study, we seek to combine these aims by developing interpretable decoding models that offer both accurate prediction and novel neural insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this combined approach in a case study of chronic marijuana use.\n\nMethodsChronic marijuana (MJ) users (n=195) and non-using healthy controls (n=128) completed a cue-elicited craving task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Linear machine learning methods were used to classify individuals into chronic MJ users and non-users based on task-evoked, whole-brain functional connectivity. We then used graph theoretic analyses to identify  predictive functional connectivities among brain regions that contributed most substantially to the classification of chronic marijuana use.\n\nResultsWe obtained high (~80% out-of-sample) accuracy across four different classification models, demonstrating that task-evoked, whole-brain functional connectivity can successfully differentiate chronic marijuana users from non-users. Subsequent network analyses revealed key predictive regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and precuneus) that are often implicated in neuroimaging studies of substance use disorders, as well as some key exceptions. We also identified a core set of networks of brain regions that contributed to successful classification, comprised of many of the same predictive regions.\n\nConclusionsOur dual aims of accurate prediction and interpretability were successful, producing a predictive model that also provides interpretability at the neural level. This novel approach may complement other predictive-exploratory approaches for a more complete understanding of neural mechanisms in drug use and other neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of T-cell immunity to the COVID-19 coronavirus requires reliable assays and is of great interest, given the uncertain longevity of the antibody response. Some recent reports have used immunodominant spike (S) antigenic peptides and anti-CD28 co-stimulation in varying combinations to assess T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These assays may cause T-cell hyperstimulation and could overestimate antiviral immunity in chronically immunosuppressed transplant recipients, who are predisposed to infections and vaccination failures. Here, we evaluate CD154-expressing T-cells induced by unselected S antigenic peptides in 204 subjects-103 COVID-19 patients and 101 healthy unexposed subjects. Subjects included 72 transplanted and 130 non-transplanted subjects. S-reactive CD154+T-cells co-express and can thus substitute for IFN{gamma} (n=3). Assay reproducibility in a variety of conditions was acceptable with coefficient of variation of 2-10.6%. S-reactive CD154+T-cell frequencies were a) higher in 42 healthy unexposed transplant recipients who were sampled pre-pandemic, compared with 59 healthy non-transplanted subjects (p=0.02), b) lower in Tr COVID-19 patients compared with healthy transplant patients (p<0.0001), c) lower in Tr patients with severe COVID-19 (p<0.0001), or COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (p<0.05), compared with healthy Tr recipients. S-reactive T-cells were not significantly different between the various COVID-19 disease categories in NT recipients. Among transplant recipients with COVID-19, cytomegalovirus co-infection occurred in 34%; further, CMV-specific T-cells (p<0.001) and incidence of anti-receptor-binding-domain IgG (p=0.011) were lower compared with non-transplanted COVID-19 patients. Healthy unexposed transplant recipients exhibit pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 infection leads to impaired T-cell and antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and increased risk of CMV co-infection in transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has caused a historic pandemic of respiratory disease (COVID-19) and current evidence suggests severe disease is associated with dysregulated immunity within the respiratory tract. However, the innate immune mechanisms that mediate protection during COVID-19 are not well defined. Here we characterize a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and find that early CCR2-dependent infiltration of monocytes restricts viral burden in the lung. We find that a recently developed mouse-adapted MA-SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as the emerging B. 1.351 variant, trigger an inflammatory response in the lung characterized by expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes. scRNA-seq analysis of lung homogenates identified a hyper-inflammatory monocyte profile. Using intravital antibody labeling, we demonstrate that MA-SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to increases in circulating monocytes and an influx of CD45+ cells into the lung parenchyma that is dominated by monocyte-derived cells. We utilize this model to demonstrate that mechanistically, CCR2 signaling promotes infiltration of classical monocytes into the lung and expansion of monocyte-derived cells. Parenchymal monocyte-derived cells appear to play a protective role against MA-SARS-CoV-2, as mice lacking CCR2 showed higher viral loads in the lungs, increased lung viral dissemination, and elevated inflammatory cytokine responses. These studies have identified a CCR2-monocyte axis that is critical for promoting viral control and restricting inflammation within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In addition to Ca2+ signaling, STIM1 is also involved in regulation of a cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathway. Using ORAI1 and STIM1 knockout cells, we examined their contribution to the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. STIM1 knockout cells showed strong resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to enhanced type I interferon response. On the contrary, ORAI1 knockout cells showed high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection as judged by increased expression of viral proteins and a high viral load. Mechanistically, ORAI1 knockout cells showed reduced homeostatic cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and severe impairment in tonic interferon signaling. Transcriptome analysis showed downregulation of multiple cellular defense mechanisms, including antiviral signaling pathways in ORAI1 knockout cells, which are likely due to reduced expression of the Ca2+-dependent transcription factors of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family and MEF2C. Our results identify a novel role of ORAI1-mediated Ca2+ signaling in regulating the baseline type I interferon level, which is a determinant of host resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Efforts to understand the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease have been hampered by the lack of robust mouse models. To overcome this barrier, we utilized a reverse genetic system to generate a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Incorporating key mutations found in SARSCoV-2 variants, this model recapitulates critical elements of human infection including viral replication in the lung, immune cell infiltration, and significant in vivo disease. Importantly, mouse-adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 does not impair replication in human airway cells and maintains antigenicity similar to human SARS-CoV-2 strains. Utilizing this model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infected mice are protected from lethal challenge with the original SARS-CoV, suggesting immunity from heterologous CoV strains. Together, the results highlight the utility of this mouse model for further study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.",

    "abstract": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a muscle degenerative disease that disproportionally affects the muscles of the face, shoulder girdle and upper arms. FSHD is caused by the misexpression of Double Homeobox 4 (DUX4), a transcription factor that is normally expressed during early embryonic development. Ectopic expression of DUX4 in somatic cells is cytotoxic and leads to rapid apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism by which DUX4 induces apoptosis, we determined the temporal transcriptional changes induced by Dux4 at the single-cell level. We observed that induction of DUX4 expression induces a non-random, consecutive sequence of transcriptional changes. DUX4 homogenously induces the activation of a stem cell signature and activates a network of transcription factors that is typically expressed during early embryogenesis and in pluripotent stem cells. Ultimately, these transcriptional changes trigger the induction of apoptosis, suggesting that the induction of this early stemness program is incompatible with a somatic cell program. Our findings shed new light on the timing and dynamic of DUX4-mediated transcriptional reprogramming and may help elucidate why the DUX4 stemness program is required during early embryogenesis, but incompatible with somatic cell viability.",

However, very few studies have addressed the question of how enzyme concentrations change in response to positive selective pressure on the flux, considered a proxy of fitness. In particular, the way cellular constraints, such as resource limitations and co-regulation, affect the adaptive landscape of a pathway under selection has never been analyzed theoretically. To fill this gap, we developed a model of the evolution of enzyme concentrations that combines metabolic control theory and an adaptive dynamics approach, and integrates possible dependencies between enzyme concentrations. We determined the evolutionary equilibria of enzyme concentrations and their range of neutral variation, and showed that they differ with the properties of the enzymes, the constraints applied to the system and the initial enzyme concentrations. Simulations of long-term evolution confirmed all analytical and numerical predictions, even though we relaxed the simplifying assumptions used in the analytical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial monolayers are a hallmark of the architecture of metazoan tissues: they provide stability, serve as barriers, and fold into organs. Epithelial cells vary in shape, ranging from flat and spread out to tall and slim. Dynamic epithelial shape changes have been explored in the context of tissue folding, where local cytoskeletal modulations cause epithelial bending and folding. Comparatively little is known about how entire tissues are transformed from a short to tall architecture. Here we show that shape regulation in epithelia can be governed by the activity of a single gene. We use a comparative approach in distantly related flies to experimentally decode the developmental program that directs the formation of columnar epithelia in the blastoderm and thus determines the physiological features of the resulting epithelium. We uncover an evolutionary novel, membrane-associated protein that emerged in flies and triggered a new development program, the cuboidal-to-columnar transformation of epithelial tissues. slow-as-molasses (slam) encodes a Dia/F-actin regulator that exploits an intrinsic morphological plasticity of cells to transform tissues. Our findings demonstrate that a single, newly emerged factor that amplifies its activity in epithelia provides the basis for adaptation and initiates the evolution of novel developmental programs.",

Perception of Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) from invading microorganisms inhibits auxin signaling and growth. Conversely, pathogens manipulate auxin signaling to promote disease, but how this hormone inhibits immunity is not fully understood. Ustilago maydis is a maize pathogen that induces auxin signaling in its host. We characterized an U. maydis effector protein, Naked1 (Nkd1), that is translocated into the host nucleus. Through its native EAR motif, Nkd1 binds to the transcriptional co-repressors TOPLESS/TOPLESS related (TPL/TPRs) and prevents the recruitment of transcriptional repressors involved in hormonal signaling, leading to de-repression of auxin and jasmonate signaling. Moderate up-regulation of auxin signaling inhibits an early defense response, PAMP-triggered ROS burst. Thus, our findings establish a clear mechanism for auxin-induced pathogen susceptibility. Manipulation of TPL by Nkd1 is evolutionary well balanced as engineered Nkd1 variants with increased expression or increased EAR-mediated TPL/TPR binding trigger typical salicylic acid mediated defense reactions, leading to pathogen resistance.",

    "abstract": "Cell differentiation and reprogramming depend on coordinated changes in specific alternative splicing events. How these cell type-specific splicing patterns are dynamically modified in response to a stimulus remains elusive. Taking advantage of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a reversible cell reprogramming intimately involved in cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis, we found a strong correlation between changes in the alternative splicing of key exons for EMT, such as at the Fgfr2 and Cnntd1 loci, and changes in the enrichment levels of specific histone modifications, namely H3K27ac and H3K27me3. Localised CRISPR epigenome editing of these exon-specific histone marks was sufficient to induce changes in splicing capable of recapitulating important aspects of EMT, such as a motile and invasive cell phenotype. Whereas, impairment of the changes in H3K27 marks observed during EMT, using histone deacetylase inhibitors, repressed inclusion of the mesenchymal isoform despite an EMT induction, supporting a driving effect for H3K27 modifications in establishing the new cell type-specific splicing patterns necessary for EMT cell reprogramming. Finally, H3K27 marks were shown to impact splicing by modulating recruitment of the splicing factor PTB to its RNA binding sites, suggesting a direct link between chromatin modifications and the splicing machinery. Taken together, these results prove the causal role of H3K27 marks in driving the dynamic splicing changes necessary for induction of important aspects of EMT. They also prove that chromatin-mediated splicing changes are sufficient to impact the cells phenotype, which expands the cells toolkit to adapt and respond to diverse stimuli, such as EMT induction.",

Here, we implemented a multi-view multi-scale microscopy strategy based on confocal spinning disk microscopy, called Multi-View confocal microScopy (MuViScopy). MuViScopy enables live-imaging of multiple organs with cellular resolution using sample rotation and confocal imaging without the need of sample embedding. We illustrate the capacity of MuViScopy by live-imaging Drosophila melanogaster pupal development throughout metamorphosis, highlighting how internal organs are formed and multiple organ development is coordinated.

    "abstract": "Tropical forests support immense biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services for billions of people. Despite this value, tropical deforestation continues at a high rate. Emerging evidence suggests that elections can play an important role in shaping deforestation, for instance by incentivising politicians to allow increased utilisation of tropical forests in return for political support and votes. Nevertheless, the role of elections as a driver of deforestation has not been comprehensively tested at broad geographic scales. Here, we created an annual database from 2001 to 2018 on political elections and forest loss for 55 tropical nations and modelled the effect of elections on deforestation. In total, 1.5 million km2 of forest was lost during this time period, and the rate of deforestation increased in 37 (67%) of the analysed countries. Deforestation was significantly lower in years with presidential or lower chamber elections compared to non-election years, which is in contrast to previous local-scale studies. Moreover, deforestation was significantly higher in presidential or lower chamber elections that are competitive (i.e. when the opposition can participate in elections and has a legitimate chance to gain governmental power) compared to uncompetitive elections. Our results document a pervasive loss of tropical forests and suggest that competitive elections are potential drivers of deforestation. We recommned that organisations monitoring election transparency and fairness should also monitor environmental impacts such as forest loss, habitat destruction and resource exploitation. This would benefit the tracking of potential illegal vote buying with natural resources.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) diversify protein functions and dynamically coordinate their signalling networks, influencing most aspects of cell physiology. Nevertheless, their genetic regulation or influence on complex traits is not fully understood. Here, we compare for the first time the genetic regulation of the same PTM of two proteins - glycosylation of transferrin and immunoglobulin G (IgG). By performing genome-wide association analysis of transferrin glycosylation, we identified 10 significantly associated loci, all novel. Comparing these with IgG glycosylation-associated genes, we note protein-specific associations with genes encoding glycosylation enzymes (transferrin - MGAT5, ST3GAL4, B3GAT1; IgG - MGAT3, ST6GAL1) as well as shared associations (FUT6, FUT8). Colocalisation analyses of the latter suggest that different causal variants in the FUT genes regulate fucosylation of the two proteins. We propose that they affect the binding of different transcription factors in different tissues, with fucosylation of IgG being regulated by IKZF1 in B-cells and of transferrin by HNF1A in liver.",

While most of the genome has been assembled, the currently available genome assembly is not a completed telomere-to-telomere assembly. Here, we used Oxford Nanopore long reads to build a telomere-to-telomere genome for Phaeodactylum tricornutum. We developed a graph-based approach to extract all unique telomeres, and used this information to manually correct assembly errors. In total, we found 25 nuclear chromosomes that comprise all previously assembled fragments, in addition to the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. We found that chromosome 19 has filtered long-read coverage and a quality estimate that suggests significantly less haplotype sequence variation than the other chromosomes. This work improves upon the previous genome assembly and provides new opportunities for genetic engineering of this species, including creating designer synthetic chromosomes.",

However, this location for NmMetQ challenges the prevailing view that SBPs in Gram-negative bacteria are localized to the periplasmic space to promote interaction with their cognate ABC transporter embedded in the bacterial inner membrane. To address the roles of NmMetQ, we characterized NmMetQ with and without its cognate ABC transporter (NmMetNI). Here, we show that NmMetQ is a lipoprotein (lipo-NmMetQ) that binds multiple methionine analogs and stimulates the ATPase activity of NmMetNI. Using single-particle electron cryo-microscopy, we determined the structures of NmMetNI in the absence and presence of lipo-NmMetQ. Based on our data, we propose that NmMetQ tethers to membranes via a lipid anchor and has dual function/topology, playing a role in NmMetNI-mediated transport at the inner-membrane in addition to moonlighting functions on the bacterial surface.",

    "abstract": "Human melanomas are commonly driven by activating mutations in BRAF, which promote melanocyte proliferation through constitutive stimulation of the MAPK pathway. However, oncogenic BRAF alone is insufficient to promote melanoma; instead, its expression merely induces a transient burst of proliferation that ultimately ceases with the development of benign nevi (i.e. moles) comprised of growth-arrested melanocytes. The tumor suppressive mechanisms that induce this melanocytic growth arrest remain poorly understood. Recent modeling studies have suggested that the growth arrest of nevus melanocytes is not solely due to oncogene activation in individual cells, but rather due to cells sensing and responding to their collective overgrowth, similar to what occurs in normal tissues. This cell growth arrest is reminiscent of the arrest induced by activation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which is an evolutionarily conserved pathway known to regulate organ size. Herein, we demonstrate that oncogenic BRAF signaling activates the Hippo pathway in vitro, which leads to inhibition of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ, ultimately promoting the growth arrest of melanocytes. We also provide evidence that the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is activated in growth-arrested nevus melanocytes in vivo, both from single-cell sequencing of mouse models of nevogenesis and human tissue samples. Mechanistically, we observe that oncogenic BRAF promotes both ERK-dependent alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and whole-genome-doubling events, and that these two effects independently promote Hippo pathway activation. Lastly, we demonstrate that abrogation of the Hippo pathway, via melanocyte-specific deletion of the Hippo kinases Lats1/2, enables oncogenic BRAF-expressing melanocytes to bypass nevus formation, thus leading to the rapid onset of melanoma with 100% penetrance. This model is clinically relevant, as co-heterozygous loss of LATS1/2 is observed in [~]15% of human melanomas. Collectively, our data reveal that the Hippo pathway enforces the stable growth arrest of nevus melanocytes and therefore represents a critical and previously unappreciated barrier to melanoma development.",

    "abstract": "Phage therapy can be used in combination with antibiotics to combat infections with bacterial pathogens1-3. However, bacteria can rapidly evolve phage resistance via receptor mutation, or using their CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems4, which insert short phage-derived sequences into CRISPR loci in the bacterial genome5 to guide sequence-specific cleavage of cognate sequences6. Unlike CRISPR-Cas immunity, mutation of the phage receptor leads to attenuated virulence when the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is infected with its phage DMS3vir7, which underscores the need to predict how phage resistance evolves under clinically relevant conditions. Here, using eight antibiotics with various modes of action, we show that bacteriostatic antibiotics (which inhibit cell growth without killing) specifically promote evolution of CRISPR-Cas immunity in P. aeruginosa by slowing down phage development and providing more time for cells to acquire phage-derived sequences and mount an immune response. Our data show that some antimicrobial treatments can contribute to the evolution of phage-resistant pathogens with high virulence.",

    "abstract": "CFTR misfolding due to cystic fibrosis causing mutations can be corrected with small molecules designated as correctors. VX-809, an investigational corrector compound, is believed to bind CFTR directly to either the first membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) and/or the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1). Blind docking onto the 3D structures of these domains, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed the presence of two potential VX-809 binding sites which, when mutated, abrogated corrector rescue. Mutations altering protein maturation are also shown to be not equally sensitive to the occupancy of the two sites by VX-809, with the most frequent mutation F508del requiring integrity of both sites and allosteric coupling with the F508del region while L206W only requires the integrity of the MSD1 site. A network of charged amino acids in the lasso Lh2 helix and the intracellular loops ICL1 and ICL4 is involved in the allostery between MSD1 and NBD1. Corrector VX-445, which is used in combination in clinics with VX-661, a structurally close analog of VX-809, to fully correct F508del, is also shown to occupy two potential binding sites on MSD1 and NBD1, the latter being shared with VX-809. In conclusion, VX-809 and VX-445 appear to bind different CFTR domains to alleviate specific folding defects. These results provide new insights into therapeutics understanding and may help the development of efficient corrector combinations.",

    "abstract": "Naked viruses can escape host cells before the induction of lysis via release in extracellular vesicles (EVs). These nanosized EVs cloak the secreted virus particles in a host-derived membrane, which alters virus-host interactions that affect infection efficiency and antiviral immunity. Currently, little is known about the viral and host factors regulating this form of virus release. Here, we assessed the role of picornavirus security proteins by studying the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) Leader protein. EV release upon infection with wildtype virus or a Leader-deficient mutant was characterized at the single particle level using high-resolution flow cytometry. Inactivation of the Leader abolished EV induction during infection and strongly reduced EV-enclosed virus release. We demonstrate that the Leader promotes the release of virions within EVs by stimulating a secretory arm of autophagy. This newly discovered role of the EMCV Leader adds to the variety of mechanisms via which this protein affects virus-host interactions. Moreover, these data provide first evidence for a crucial role of non-structural viral proteins in the non-lytic release of picornaviruses via packaging in EVs.",

The HEK293 cell line was originally established by transfection of human embryonic kidney cells with sheared adenovirus 5 DNA and it is known that that HEK293 cells stably express the adenoviral E1A and E1B-55k proteins. Here we show that HEK293 cells display an unexpected distribution of key components of the WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway where AXIN1, APC, DVL2 and tankyrase are all co-localized in large spherical cytoplasmic aggregates. The cytoplasmic aggregates are enclosed by a narrow layer of the adenoviral E1B-55k protein. Reduction of E1B-55k protein levels leads to disappearance of the cytoplasmic aggregates thus corroborating an essential role of the E1B-55k protein in mediating the formation of the aggregates. Furthermore, HEK293 cells with reduced E1B-55k protein levels display reduced levels of transcriptional activation of WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling upon stimulation by the Wnt3A agonist. The demonstrated influence of the E1B-55k protein on the cellular localization of WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling components and on transcriptional regulation of WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling asks for caution in the interpretation of data derived from the HEK293 cell line.",

We present a metagenomic HiFi assembly of a complex microbial community from sheep fecal material that resulted in 428 high-quality MAGs from a single sample, the highest resolution achieved with metagenomic deconvolution to date. We applied a computational approach to separate distinct haplotype lineages and identified haplotypes of hundreds of variants across hundreds of kilobases of genomic sequence. Analysis of these haplotypes revealed 220 lineage-resolved complete MAGs, including 44 in single circular contigs, and demonstrated improvement in overall assembly compared to error-prone long reads.

We show that upon induction of neuronal differentiation MED25 is recruited to genomic loci co-occupied by ASCL1 to regulate neurogenic gene expression programs. MED24 and MED25 are sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation in GSC cultures and to mediate neuronal differentiation in multiple contexts.

We used TrendCatcher to perform a systematic temporal analysis of COVID-19 peripheral blood transcriptomes, including bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq time course data. TrendCatcher uncovered the early and persistent activation of neutrophils and coagulation pathways as well as impaired type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in circulating cells as a hallmark of patients who progressed to severe COVID-19, whereas no such patterns were identified in individuals receiving SARS- CoV-2 vaccinations or patients with mild COVID-19.

    "abstract": "Adaptive radiation of fishes was long thought to be possible only in lacustrine environments. Recently, several studies have shown that also riverine and stream environments provide the ecological opportunity for adaptive radiation. In this study, we report on a riverine adaptive radiation of six ecomorphs of cyprinid hillstream fishes of the genus Garra in a river located in the Ethiopian Highlands in East Africa. Garra are predominantly highly specialized algae-scrapers with a wide distribution ranging from Southeastern Asia to Western Africa. However, adaptive phenotypic diversification in mouth type, sucking disc morphology, gut length and body shape have been found among these new species in a single Ethiopian river. Moreover, we found two novel phenotypes of Garra ( thick-lipped and  predatory) that were not described before in this species-rich genus (>160 species). Mitochondrial and genome-wide data suggest monophyletic, intra-basin evolution of Garra phenotypic diversity with signatures of gene flow from other local populations. Although sympatric ecomorphs are genetically distinct and can be considered to being young species as suggested by genome-wide SNP data, mtDNA was unable to identify any genetic structure suggesting a recent and rapid speciation event. Furthermore, we found evidence for a hybrid origin of the novel  thick-lipped phenotype, as being the result of the hybridization of two other sympatrically occurring species. Here we highlight how, driven by ecological opportunity, an ancestral trophically highly specialized lineage is likely to have rapidly adaptively radiated in a riverine environment, and that this radiation was promoted by the evolution of novel feeding strategies.",

Females engaged the gustatory cortex and ventral tegmental area more than males during the Boost(R) task and males engaged the amygdala more than females in both the reinforcing and devalued tasks. Network analysis of correlated c-Fos responses across brain regions identified two unique networks characterizing the Boost(R) and LiCl (CTA) tasks, in both of which the VTA played a central role.

    "abstract": "BackgroundImmunotherapy is quickly coming to the forefront of cancer treatment; however, the implementation of immunotherapy in solid pediatric cancers, which classically display a low mutational load, is hindered by insufficient understanding of the determinants of cancer immune responsiveness in children. In order to better understand tumor-host interplay, we sought to characterize solid pediatric cancers based on immunological parameters using analytes extracted from gene expression data.\n\nMethodsWe used RNAseq data from the publicly available TARGET studies for five pediatric solid tumor types (408 patients): Wilms tumor (WT), neuroblastoma (NBL), osteosarcoma (OS), clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RT). We assessed the performance of previously identified immune signatures like the Immunologic Constant of Rejection (ICR), which captures an active Th1/cytotoxic response associated with favorable prognosis and responsiveness to immunotherapy. We also performed gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and clustering, using more than 100 immune signatures to define immune subtypes in pediatric tumors and compared the overall survival across subtypes. The expression of immune checkpoints and enrichment of oncogenic pathways were also assessed across the immune subtypes.\n\nResultsThe five tumor types showed distinct ICR score distributions. A higher ICR score was associated with better survival in OS and NBL-HR-MYCN_NA, but with poorer survival in WT. The clustering of immune signatures revealed the same five principal modules observed in adult solid tumors: Wound Healing, TGF-B signaling, IFN-G signaling, Macrophages, and Lymphocytes. These modules clustered pediatric patients into six immune subtypes (S1-S6) with distinct survival outcomes. The S2 cluster showed the best overall survival and was characterized by low enrichment of the wound healing signature, high Th1, low Th2. Conversely, cluster S4 showed the worst survival and highest enrichment of wound healing signature, low Th1, and high Th2. Furthermore, the upregulation of the WNT/Beta-catenin pathway is associated with unfavorable outcomes and lack of T-cell infiltration in OS.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated that extracranial solid pediatric tumors could be classified according to their immune disposition, unveiling similarity with adults tumors. Immunological parameters might be explored to refine diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and to identify potential immune-responsive tumors.",

These pathological changes are due to the neuroinflammation that characterizes MS and the strong interplay between the ER and mitochondria. We investigated whether immunomodulatory drug glatiramer acetate (GA) can reduce these changes in the spinal cords of chronic EAE mice by using routine histology, immunostaining, and electron microscopy. EAE spinal cord tissue exhibited increased infiltration/inflammation (upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines), demyelination, mitochondrial dysfunction (increased fission, decreased fusion, and increased biogenesis), ER stress, downregulation of NAD+ dependent pathways, and increased neuronal death. GA reversed these pathological changes, suggesting that immunomodulating therapy can attenuate ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptotic cell death, and demyelination in the CNS and increase NAD+ utilizing activities by suppressing neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Iron homeostasis is essential for both sides of the host-pathogen interface. Restricting access of iron slows bacterial growth while iron is also a necessary co-factor for host immunity. Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) is a critical regulator of iron homeostasis that catalyses the liberation of iron during degradation of heme. It is also a stress-responsive protein that can be rapidly upregulated and confers protection to the host. Although a protective role of HMOX1 has been demonstrated in a variety of diseases, the role of HMOX1 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is equivocal across experiments with different host-pathogen combinations. Here we use the natural host-pathogen pairing of the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection platform to study the role of zebrafish heme oxygenase in mycobacterial infection. We identify zebrafish Hmox1a as the relevant functional paralog of mammalian HMOX1 and demonstrate a conserved role for Hmox1a in protecting the host from mycobacterial infection. Using genetic and chemical tools, we show zebrafish Hmox1a protects the host against mycobacterial infection by reducing infection-induced iron accumulation and ferroptosis.",

Yet, the metabolic pathways of anaerobic bacteria and their associated constraints for maintaining energy and redox balance are often poorly described. We employ High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Carbon-13 (13C) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy with dynamic flux balance analysis to resolve real-time metabolism in living cells of the obligately anaerobic pathogen Clostridioides difficile. Using 13C-labeled carbon sources, we elaborate the time-dependent progression of reductive and oxidative anaerobic fermentation pathways. Analyses identified new integration points for redox and nitrogen coupling between carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, particularly in the production of 13C-alanine from 13C-glucose to provide an ammonia sink from co-occurring amino acid fermentation. Analyses conducted in the presence or absence of selenium, a required co-factor for the proline Stickland reductase, demonstrate further capacity to modulate cellular metabolism and resulting metabolites. Findings informed a genome-scale metabolic model of C. difficile, identifying alanine and associated electron carrier pools as critical metabolic integration points in energy flow and biomass expansion. We illustrate use of HRMAS NMR as a new analytical platform to resolve complex interactions in anaerobic metabolism and inform new metabolic targets to counter C. difficile infections.",

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative and invasive tumor caused by Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The cellular origin of KS tumor cells remains contentious. Recently, evidence has accrued indicating that KS may arise from KSHV-infected mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition (MEndT), but the transformation process has been largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the KSHV-mediated MEndT process and found that KSHV infection rendered MSCs incomplete endothelial lineage differentiation and formed hybrid mesenchymal/endothelial (M/E) state cells characterized by simultaneous expression of mesenchymal markers PDGFRA/Nestin and endothelial markers PDPN/CD31. The hybrid M/E cells have acquired high tumorigenic properties in vitro and the potential to form KS-like tumors after transplanted in mice under renal capsules. These results faithfully recapitulate Kaposis sarcoma where proliferating KS spindle-shaped cells and the cells that line KS-specific aberrant vessels were also found to exhibit a hybrid M/E state. Furthermore, the genetic analysis identified KSHV-encoded FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) as a crucial regulator controlling KSHV-induced MEndT and generating hybrid M/E state cells for tumorigenesis. Overall, KSHV-mediated MEndT that transforms MSCs to tumorigenic hybrid M/E state cells driven by vFLIP is an essential event in Kaposis sarcomagenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryKaposis sarcoma manifests as multifocal lesions with spindle cell proliferation, intense angiogenesis, and erythrocyte extravasation. Although the origin and true malignant nature of KS remains contentious, it is established that KSHV infection with concomitant viral oncogene expression in normal cell progenitors causes KS. The mechanism of KSHV oncogenesis could be revealed through reproduction of KS by infection of normal cells. This study reports that the KSHV infection of mesenchymal stem cells initiates mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition (MEndT) that generates mesenchymal/endothelial (M/E) hybrid state cells. The hybrid M/E cells acquired high tumorigenic properties, including tumor initiation, angiogenesis, migration, and the potential to form KS-like tumors after transplanted in mice. This finding faithfully recapitulates Kaposis sarcoma where proliferating KS spindle cells and the cells that line KS-specific aberrant vessels are also found to exhibit the hybrid M/E state. We also found that KSHV-encoded viral FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) plays a crucial role in promoting MEndT and the generation of M/E state cells. These results provide a new layer of evidence for MSCs being the cell source of KS spindle cells and reveal novel insight into KS pathogenesis and viral tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Female mate choice is thought to be responsible for the evolution of many extravagant male ornaments and displays, but the costs of being too selective may hinder the evolution of choosiness. Selection against choosiness should be strongest in socially monogamous mating systems, because females may end up without a partner and forego reproduction, especially when many females prefer the same few partners (frequency-dependent selection). Here we quantify the fitness costs of having mating preferences that are difficult to satisfy. We capitalise on the recent discovery that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males of familiar song dialect. We measured female fitness in captive breeding colonies in which one third of females were given ample opportunity to choose a mate of their preferred dialect (two thirds of all males;  relaxed competition), while two thirds of the females had to compete over a limited pool of mates they preferred (one third of all males;  high competition). As expected, social pairings were strongly assortative with regard to song dialect. In the high-competition group, 26% of the females remained unpaired, yet they still obtained relatively high fitness by using brood parasitism as an alternative reproductive tactic. Another 31% of high-competition females paired disassortatively for song dialect. These females showed increased levels of extra-pair paternity, mostly with same-dialect males as sires, suggesting that preferences were not abolished after social pairing. However, females that paired disassortatively for song dialect did not have lower reproductive success. Overall, females in the high-competition group reached equal fitness as those that experienced relaxed competition. Our study suggests that alternative reproductive tactics such as egg dumping can help overcome the frequency-dependent costs of being highly selective in a monogamous mating system, thereby facilitating the evolution of female choosiness.",

    "abstract": "Scleractinian corals are of great ecological interest as ecosystem engineer species. Accordingly, there is a wealth of studies on their adaptive abilities facing climate change. Such studies should rely on precise species and population delimitation. Nevertheless species delimitation in corals can be hindered by the lack of adequate genetic markers, by hybridization, and by morphological plasticity. Here we applied RAD sequencing to the study of species delimitation and genetic structure in populations of Pocillopora spp. from Oman and French Polynesia with the objectives to test primary species hypotheses based on mitochondrial DNA sequencing, and to study the genetic structure among sampling sites inside species. Regarding the varying levels of missing data observed among samples we tested different filtering strategy. The main genetic differentiation was observed between samples from Oman and French Polynesia, which also corresponded to different mitochondrial lineages and species hypotheses. In Oman, we did not observe any clear differentiation according to the main mitochondrial lineages considered here, nor between sampling sites. In French Polynesia where a single mitochondrial lineage was studied, we did not evidence any differentiation according to sampling sites. These results provide an additional example of the importance of using independent nuclear markers for the study of species delimitation. Our analyses also allowed the identification of clonal lineages in our samples, and to take them into account in our interpretations. We used simulations to study the impact of clonal reproduction on the distribution of statistics of genetic diversity and genetic structure among loci.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) can be used as a powerful method to identify and interpret the underlying biological mechanisms behind GWAS by mapping gene expression levels with phenotypes. In TWAS, gene expression is often imputed from individual-level genotypes of regulatory variants identified from external resources, such as Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. In this setting, a straightforward approach to impute expression levels of a specific tissue is to use the model trained from the same tissue type. When multiple tissues are available for the same subjects, it has been demonstrated that training imputation models from multiple tissue types improves the accuracy because of shared eQTLs between the tissues and increase in effective sample size. However, existing joint-tissue methods require access of genotype and expression data across all tissues. Moreover, they cannot leverage the abundance of various expression datasets across various tissues for non-overlapping individuals.\n\nHere, we explore the optimal way to combine imputed levels across training models from multiple tissues and datasets in a flexible manner using summary-level data. Our proposed method (SWAM) combines arbitrary number of transcriptome imputation models to linearly optimize the imputation accuracy given a target tissue. By integrating models across tissues and/or individuals, SWAM can improve the accuracy of transcriptome imputation or to improve power to TWAS without having to access each individual-level dataset. To evaluate the accuracy of SWAM, we combined 49 tissue-specific gene expression imputation models from the GTEx Project as well as from a large eQTL study of Depression Susceptibility Genes and Networks (DGN) Project and tested imputation accuracy in GEUVADIS lymphoblast cell lines samples. We also extend our meta-imputation method to meta-TWAS to leverage multiple tissues in TWAS analysis with summary-level statistics. Our results capitalize on the importance of integrating multiple tissues to unravel regulatory impacts of genetic variants on complex traits.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe gene expression levels within a cell are affected by various factors, including DNA variation, cell type, cellular microenvironment, disease status, and other environmental factors surrounding the individual. The genetic component of gene expression is known to explain a substantial fraction of transcriptional variation among individuals and can be imputed from genotypes in a tissue-specific manner, by training from population-scale transcriptomic profiles designed to identify expression quantitative loci (eQTLs). Imputing gene expression levels is shown to help understand the genetic basis of human disease through Transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS) and Mendelian Randomization (MR).\n\nHowever, it has been unclear how to integrate multiple imputation models trained from individual datasets to maximize their accuracy without having to access individual genotypes and expression levels that are often protected for privacy concerns. We developed SWAM (Smartly Weighted Averaging across Multiple datasets), a meta-imputation framework which can accurately impute gene expression levels from genotypes by integrating multiple imputation models without requiring individual-level data. Our method examines the similarity or differences between resources and borrowing information most relevant to the tissue of interest. We demonstrate that SWAM outperforms existing single-tissue and multi-tissue imputation models and continue to increase accuracy when integrating additional imputation models.",

Here, we characterized inflammatory and metabolic parameters in global Panx3 knockout (KO) mice in the context of forced treadmill running (FEX) and high fat diet (HFD).\n\nMethodsC57BL/6N (WT) and KO mice were randomized to either a FEX running protocol or no running (SED) from 24 until 30 weeks of age. Body weight was measured biweekly, and body composition was measured at 24 and 30 weeks of age. Male WT and KO mice were fed a HFD from 12 - 28 weeks of age. Metabolic organs were analyzed for a panel of inflammatory markers and PANX3 expression.\n\nResultsIn females there were no significant differences in body composition between genotypes, which could be due to the lack of PANX3 expression in female white adipose tissue, while male KOs fed a chow diet had lower body weight, and lower fat mass at 24 and 30 weeks of age, which was reduced to the same extent as 6 weeks of FEX in WT mice. Additionally, male KO mice exhibited significantly lower expression of multiple pro-inflammatory genes in white adipose tissue compared to WT mice. While on a HFD body weight differences were insignificant, in KO mice, multiple inflammatory genes were significantly differently expressed in quadriceps muscle and white adipose tissue resulting in a more anti-inflammatory phenotype compared to WT mice. The lower fat mass in male KO mice may be due to significantly fewer adipocytes in their subcutaneous fat compared to WT mice. Mechanistically, adipose stromal cells (ASCs) cultured from KO mice grow significantly slower than WT ASCs.\n\nConclusionPANX3 is expressed in male adult mouse adipose tissue and may regulate adipocyte numbers, influencing fat accumulation and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Plant roots change their morphological traits in order to adapt themselves to different environmental conditions, resulting in alteration of the root system architecture. To understand this mechanism, it is essential to visualize morphology of the entire root system. To reveal effects of long-term alteration of gravity environment on root system development, we have performed an experiment in the International Space Station using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.) plants and obtained dried root systems grown in rockwool slabs (mineral wool substrate). X-ray computer tomography (CT) technique using an industrial X-ray scanner has been introduced for the purpose to visualize root system architecture of crop species grown in soil in 3D non-invasively. In the case of the present study, however, root system of Arabidopsis is composed of finer roots compared with typical crop plants and rockwool is also composed of fibers having similar dimension to that of the roots. A higher spatial resolution imaging method is required for distinguishing roots from rockwool. Therefore, in the present study, we tested refraction-contrast X-ray micro-CT using coherent X-ray optics available at the beamline BL20B2 of the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8. Using this technique, both the primary and the secondary roots were successfully identified in the tomographic slices, clearly distinguished from the individual rockwool fibers and resulting in successful tracing of these roots from their basal regions.

    "abstract": "The biology of the immune second messenger cGAMP depends on its cellular localization. cGAMP, which is synthesized in response to cytosolic double-stranded DNA, also exists in the extracellular space as a paracrine immunotransmitter that enhances the anticancer immune response. However, the role of extracellular cGAMP is unexplored outside of cancer due to a lack of tools to systemically manipulate it. The extracellular enzyme ENPP1, the only known hydrolase of cGAMP, is a promising target. However, because ENPP1 also degrades extracellular ATP, using genetic knockouts of ENPP1 to study extracellular cGAMP leads to confounding effects. Here we report the H362A point mutation in ENPP1, the dominant cGAMP hydrolase, which selectively abolishes ENPP1s ability to degrade cGAMP, while retaining activity toward other substrates. H362 is not necessary for binding cGAMP or the catalytically-essential zinc atoms but instead supports the in-line reaction geometry. H362 is evolutionarily conserved down to bacteria, suggesting an ancient origin for extracellular cGAMP biology. Enpp1H362A mice do not display the systemic calcification seen in Enpp1-/- mice, highlighting the substrate-specific phenotype of ENPP1. Remarkably, Enpp1H362A mice were resistant to HSV-1 infection, demonstrating the antiviral role of endogenous extracellular cGAMP. The ENPP1H362A mutation is the first genetic tool to enable exploration of extracellular cGAMP biology in a wide range of tissues and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is the etiological agent of bovine papillomatosis, infectious disease characterized by the presence of benign tumors that can progress to malignancy. The phylogenetic classification of the PVs is performed based on the sequence homology of the Open Reading Frame L1, the most conserved among different viral serotypes. Given the immunogenicity of saponins, it,s has been used as a candidate as adjuvant use. For this reason, the safety of using saponin as an adjuvant has to be better determined to human or veterinary vaccine use. So, this study aimed to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effect of saponins in comparison with the adjuvant widely used aluminum hydroxide using an isolated and purified L1 protein from BPV as model. In this study, genomic lesions, which after processed without repair can result in mutations, were detected by comet assay. Possible damages to genetic material caused by structural chromosomal changes (clastogenesis), as well as chromosomal losses (aneugenesis) were evaluated by the micronucleus test. Both tests were done on polychromatic erythrocytes and Vero cells. The evaluation of apoptosis and necrosis of treated Vero cells was made by Annexin V / PI staining and flow cytometry. The two vaccine products (L1 +Saponin and L1 + Aluminum Hydroxide) showed damages compatible with the positive control in the comet assay and both slightly elevated the micronucleus levels, in the Cell Viability Assay the results with Aluminum Hydroxide were satisfactory, characterizing Aluminum Hydroxide as a safer adjuvant according to the proposed tests, better than the saponins. Some fractions of the saponin extract separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography were evaluated against genotoxic activity by comet assay, and their identities were confirmed by similarity to the reference standard by mass spectrometry.",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells can exist in either the naive state representing a developmental blank slate or the downstream primed state poised for differentiation. Currently, known differences between these two states are mostly phenomenological, and none can adequately explain why the two states should differ in developmental priming. Gene occlusion is a mode of epigenetic inactivation that renders genes unresponsive to their cognate transcriptional activators. It plays a crucial role in lineage restriction. Here, we report that a defining feature distinguishing the two pluripotent states lies in the ability of naive but not primed cells to erase occlusion. This \"deocclusion\" capacity requires Esrrb, a gene expressed only in the naive but not primed state. Notably, Esrrb silencing in the primed state is itself due to occlusion. Collectively, our data argue that the Esrrb-dependent deocclusion capacity in naive cells is key for sustaining naive pluripotency, and the loss of this capacity in the primed state via the occlusion of Esrrb poises cells for differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma is among the leading causes of cancer related deaths globally due to its extreme difficulty to detect and treat. Recently, research focus has shifted to analyzing the microenvironment of pancreatic cancer to better understand its key molecular mechanisms. This microenvironment can be represented with a multi-scale model consisting of pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs), pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), as well as cytokines and growth factors which are responsible for intercellular communication between the PCCs and PSCs. We have built a stochastic Boolean network (BN) model, validated by literature and clinical data, in which we probed for intervention strategies that force this gene regulatory network (GRN) from a diseased state to a healthy state. To do so, we implemented methods from phenotype control theory to determine a procedure for regulating specific genes within the microenvironment. We identify target genes and molecules such that the application of their control drives the GRN to the desired state by suppression (or expression) and disruption of specific signaling pathways that will eventually lead to the eradication of the cancer cells. After applying well studied control methods such as stable motifs, feedback vertex set, and computational algebra, we discovered that each produces a different set of control targets that are not necessarily minimal nor unique. Yet, we were able to gain more insight about the performance of each process and the overlap of targets discovered. Nearly every control set contains cytokines, KRas, and HER2/neu which suggests they are key players in the systems dynamics. To that end, this model can be used to produce further insight into the complex biological system of pancreatic cancer with hopes of finding new potential targets.",

    "abstract": "Declining insect populations emphasize the importance of understanding the drivers underlying reductions in insect fitness. Here, we investigated viruses as a threat to social insect reproduction, using honey bees as a model species. We report that in a sample of N = 93 honey bee (Apis mellifera) queens from nine beekeeping operations across a wide geographic range, high levels of natural viral infection are associated with decreased ovary mass. We confirmed this finding in an independent sample of N = 54 queens. Failed (poor quality) queens displayed higher levels of viral infection, reduced sperm viability, smaller ovaries, and altered ovary protein composition compared to healthy queens. We experimentally infected queens with Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and found that the ovary masses of IAPV-injected queens were significantly smaller than control queens, demonstrating a causal relationship between viral infection and ovary size. Queens injected with IAPV also had significantly lower expression of vitellogenin, the main source of nutrition deposited into developing oocytes, and higher levels of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which are part of the honey bees antiviral response. This work together shows that viral infections occurring naturally in the field are compromising queen reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, cryo-EM single particle analysis achieved true atomic resolution, thanks to technological developments in hardware and software. The number of high resolution reconstructions continues to grow, increasing the importance of accurate determination of atomic coordinates. Here, a new Python package and program called Servalcat is presented that is designed to facilitate atomic model refinement. Servalcat implements a refinement pipeline, using the program REFMAC5 from the CCP4 package. After the refinement, Servalcat calculates a weighted Fo - Fc difference map, which was derived from Bayesian statistics. This map helps manual and automatic model building in real space, as is common practice in crystallography. The Fo - Fc map helps visualisation of weak features including hydrogen densities. Although hydrogen densities are weak, they are stronger than in electron density maps produced by X-ray crystallography, and some hydrogen atoms are even visible at [~] 1.8 [A] resolution. Servalcat also facilitates atomic model refinement under symmetry constraints. If a point group symmetry has been applied to the map during reconstruction, the asymmetric unit model is refined with appropriate symmetry constraints.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute proteins use nucleic acid guides to find and bind specific DNA or RNA target sequences. Argonaute proteins can be found in all kingdoms of life, and play diverse biological functions including genome defense, gene regulation, and chromosome partitioning. Many Argonautes retain their ancestral endoribonuclease activity, cleaving the phosphodiester bond between target nucleotides t10 and t11. In animals, a specialized class of Argonautes, the PIWI proteins, use 21-35 nt PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to direct transposon silencing, protect the germline genome, and regulate gene expression during gametogenesis1. The piRNA pathway is required for fertility in one or both sexes of nearly all animals. Both piRNA production and function require RNA cleavage catalyzed by PIWI proteins. Spermatogenesis in mice and other placental mammals requires three distinct, developmentally regulated PIWI proteins: MIWI (PIWIL1), MILI (PIWIL2), and MIWI2 (PIWIL4)2-4. The piRNA-guided endoribonuclease activities of MIWI and MILI are essential to produce functional sperm5, 6. piRNA-directed silencing in mice and insects also requires Gametocyte-Specific Factor 1 (GTSF1), a PIWI-associated protein of unknown function7-12. Here, we report that GTSF1 potentiates the weak, intrinsic, piRNA-directed RNA cleavage activities of PIWI proteins, transforming them into efficient endoribonucleases. GTSF1 represents the first example of an auxiliary protein that potentiates the catalytic activity of an Argonaute protein.",

    "abstract": "Fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) channelize fatty acids towards biosynthesis of virulent lipids in mycobacteria and other pharmaceutically or ecologically important polyketides and lipopeptides in other microbes. They do so by bypassing the ubiquitous coenzyme A-dependent activation and rely on the acyl carrier protein-tethered 4-phosphopantetheine (holo-ACP). The molecular basis of how FAALs strictly reject chemically identical and abundant acceptors like coenzyme A (CoA) and accept holo-ACP unlike other members of the ANL superfamily remains elusive. We show FAALs have plugged the promiscuous canonical CoA-binding pockets and utilize highly selective alternative binding sites. These alternative pockets can distinguish adenosine 3, 5-bisphosphate-containing CoA from holo-ACP and thus FAALs can distinguish between CoA and holo-ACP. These exclusive features helped identify the omnipresence of FAAL-like proteins and their emergence in plants, fungi, and animals with unconventional domain organisations. The universal distribution of FAALs suggests they are parallelly evolved with FACLs for ensuring a CoA-independent activation and redirection of fatty acids towards lipidic metabolites.",
