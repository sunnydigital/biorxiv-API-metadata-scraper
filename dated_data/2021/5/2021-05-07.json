    "abstract": "Fluids in natural systems, like the cytoplasm of a cell, often contain thousands of molecular species that are organized into multiple coexisting phases that enable diverse and specific functions. How interactions between numerous molecular species encode for various emergent phases is not well understood. Here we leverage approaches from random matrix theory and statistical physics to describe the emergent phase behavior of fluid mixtures with many species whose interactions are drawn randomly from an underlying distribution. Through numerical simulation and stability analyses, we show that these mixtures exhibit staged phase separation kinetics and are characterized by multiple coexisting phases at equilibrium with distinct compositions. Random-matrix theory predicts the number of existing phases at equilibrium, validated by simulations with diverse component numbers and interaction parameters. Surprisingly, this model predicts an upper bound on the number of phases, derived from dynamical considerations, that is much lower than the limit from the Gibbs phase rule, which is obtained from equilibrium thermodynamic constraints. Using a biophysically motivated model of pairwise interactions between components, we design ensembles that encode either linear or non-monotonic scaling relationships between number of components and co-existing phases, which we validate through simulation and theory. Finally, inspired by parallels in biological systems, we show that including nonequilibrium turnover of components through chemical reactions can tunably modulate the number of coexisting phases at steady-state without changing overall fluid composition. Together, our study provides a model framework that describes the emergent dynamical and steady-state phase behavior of liquid-like mixtures with many interacting constituents.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in American men. Several therapies have been developed to treat advanced prostate cancer, but these therapies often have severe side effects. To improve the outcome with fewer side effects we focused on the furanocoumarin bergamottin, a natural product found in grapefruit juice and a potent CYP3A inhibitor. Our recent studies have shown that CYP3A5 inhibition can block androgen receptor (AR) signaling, critical for prostate cancer growth. We observed that bergamottin reduces prostate cancer (PC) cell growth by decreasing both total and nuclear AR (AR activation) reducing downstream AR signaling. Bergamottins role in reducing AR activation was confirmed by confocal microscopy studies and reduction in PSA levels. Further studies revealed that bergamottin promotes cell cycle block and accumulates G0/G1 cells. The cell cycle block was accompanied with reduction in cyclin D, cyclin B, CDK4, P-cdc2 (Y15) and P-wee1 (S642). We also observed that bergamottin triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines as evident by TUNEL staining and PARP cleavage. Our data suggest that bergamottin may be used as an adjunctive nutritional supplement to suppress prostate cancer growth and is of relevance to AA patients carrying wild type CYP3A5 often presenting aggressive disease.",

    "abstract": "Spinal neurons are highly heterogeneous in location, transcriptional identity and function. To understand their contributions to sensorimotor circuits, it is essential to map the positions of identified subsets of neurons in relation to others throughout the spinal cord (SC), but we lack tools for whole SC sample preparation, imaging and in toto analysis. To overcome this problem, we have (1) designed scaffolds (SpineRacks) that facilitate efficient and ordered cryo-sectioning of the entire SC in a single block, (2) constructed a 3D reference atlas of adult mouse SC and (3) developed software (SpinalJ) to register images of sections and for standardized analysis of cells and projections in atlas space. We have verified mapping accuracies for known neurons and demonstrated the usefulness of this platform to reveal unknown neuronal distributions. Together, these tools provide high-throughput analyses of whole mouse SC and enable direct comparison of 3D spatial information between animals and studies.",

    "abstract": "The large slow oscillation (SO, 0.5-2Hz) that characterises slow-wave sleep is crucial to memory consolidation and other physiological functions. Manipulating slow oscillations can enhance sleep and memory, as well as benefitting the immune system. Closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) has been demonstrated to increase the SO amplitude and to boost fast sleep spindle activity (11-16Hz). Nevertheless, not all such stimuli are effective in evoking SOs, even if they are precisely phase-locked. Here, we studied whether it is possible to use ongoing activity patterns to determine which oscillations to stimulate in order to effectively enhance SOs or SO-locked spindle activity. To this end, we trained classifiers using the morphological characteristics of the ongoing SO, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), to predict whether stimulation would lead to a benefit in terms of the resulting SO and spindle amplitude. Separate classifiers were trained using trials from spontaneous control and stimulated datasets, and we evaluated their performance by applying them to held-out data both within and across conditions. We were able to predict both when large SOs will occur spontaneously, and whether a phase-locked auditory click will effectively enlarge them with an accuracy of ~70%. We were also able to predict when stimulation would elicit spindle activity with an accuracy of ~60%. Finally, we evaluate the importance of the various SO features used to make these predictions. Our results offer new insight into SO and spindle dynamics and provide a new method for online optimisation of stimulation.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- Random forest classifiers can predict spontaneous and stimulated SOs and spindle amplitudes.\n- Morphological wave features predicted the response of SOs and spindles to CLAS.\n- SO amplitude during the click is the main predictor for post-stimulus SO amplitude.\n- Prediction of spindle activity did not differ in accuracy for stimulated vs spontaneous data.",

    "abstract": "The hypocretins (HCRT), also known as orexin, includes two neuroexcitatory peptides, HCRT-1 and HCRT-2 (orexin A y B, respectively), synthesized by neurons located in the postero-lateral hypothalamus, whose projections and receptors are widely distributed throughout the brain, including the medial preoptic area (mPOA). HCRT have been associated with a wide range of physiological functions including sleep-wake cycle, maternal behavior and body temperature, all regulated by the mPOA. Previously we showed that HCRT in the mPOA facilitates certain active maternal behaviors, while the blockade of HCRT-R1 increased the time spent in nursing. As mother rats mainly sleep while they nurse, we hypothesize that HCRT in the mPOA of lactating rats reduce sleep and nursing, while the intra-mPOA administration of the dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) would generate the opposite effect. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of HCRT within the mPOA, in the regulation and integration of the sleep-wake cycle, maternal behavior and body temperature of lactating rats. To evaluate this idea, we assessed the sleep-wake states, maternal behavior and body temperature of lactating rats following microinjections of HCRT-1 (100 and 200 M) and DORA (5mM) into the mPOA. As expected, our data shows that HCRT-1 in mPOA promoted wakefulness and a slightly increase in body temperature, whereas DORA increased both NREM and REM sleep along with nursing and milk ejection. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the reduction of the endogenous HCRT within the mPOA of lactating rats is important to promote sleep, nursing and milk ejection.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports on the cardioprotective effects of fibronectin inhibition following myocardial injury suggest a largely unexplored role for the extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein in cardiac fibroblast function. We probed the molecular regulation and functional implications of fibronectin gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts exposed to Angiotensin II, a major pro-fibrotic factor in the myocardium. Using gene knockdown and over-expression approaches, western blotting and promoter pull-down assay, we show that collagen type I-activated Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2) mediates Angiotensin II-stimulated transcriptional up-regulation of fibronectin by Yes-activated Protein in cardiac fibroblasts. Further, siRNA-mediated fibronectin knockdown attenuated Angiotensin II-stimulated expression of collagen type I and anti-apoptotic cIAP2, and enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis. Importantly, an obligate role for fibronectin was observed in Angiotensin II-stimulated expression of AT1R, the Angiotensin II receptor, which would link ECM signaling and Angiotensin II signaling in cardiac fibroblasts. Moreover, conditioned medium from DDR2- or fibronectin-silenced cardiac fibroblasts reduced AT1R expression in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. The regulatory role of fibronectin in Angiotensin II-stimulated cIAP2, collagen type I and AT1R expression was mediated by Integrin-{beta}1-integrin-linked kinase signaling. In vivo, we observed modestly reduced basal levels of AT1R in DDR2-null mouse myocardium, associated with the previously reported reduction in myocardial Integrin-{beta}1 levels. The role of fibronectin, downstream of DDR2, could be a critical determinant of cardiac fibroblast-mediated wound healing following myocardial injury. In summary, our findings suggest a complex mechanism of regulation of cardiac fibroblast function involving two major extracellular matrix proteins, collagen type I and fibronectin, and their receptors, DDR2 and Integrin-{beta}1.",

    "abstract": "Increased mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is needed to develop efficacious disease-modifying treatments. Though age-related pathogenic mechanisms are most relevant to the great majority of KOA seen clinically, the bulk of our mechanistic understanding of KOA has been derived using surgically induced post-traumatic OA (PTOA) models. Here, we took an integrated approach of meta-analysis and multi-omics to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms of age-related KOA in murine model. Protein-level data together with transcriptomic profiling revealed inflammation, autophagy, and cellular senescence as primary hallmarks of age-related KOA. Importantly, the molecular profiles of aged cartilage were unique from those in PTOA, with only 1% overlap between the two. At the nexus of aging hallmarks, Advanced Glycation End-Product (AGE)/Receptor for AGE emerged as intrinsically linked to age-related KOA. This pathway was further validated by mass spectrometry. Collectively, these findings implicate dysregulation of AGE-RAGE signaling as a key driver of age-related KOA.",

Technologies such as nanopore sequencing via the ARTIC protocol are used to reliably generate genomes from raw sequencing data as a crucial base for molecular surveillance. However, for many labs that perform SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, bioinformatics is still a major bottleneck, especially if hundreds of samples need to be processed in a recurring fashion. Pipelines developed for short-read data cannot be applied to nanopore data. Therefore, specific long-read tools and parameter settings need to be orchestrated to enable accurate genotyping and robust reference-based genome reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from nanopore data.

Developing a detailed understanding of the link between metabolic shifts and platelet activation state is integral to improving human health. Here, we show the first application of isotopically nonstationary 13C metabolic flux analysis to quantitatively measure carbon fluxes in both resting and thrombin activated platelets. Resting platelets primarily metabolize glucose to lactate via glycolysis, while acetate is oxidized to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Upon activation with thrombin, a potent platelet agonist, platelets increase their uptake of glucose 3-fold. This results in an absolute increase in flux throughout central metabolism, but when compared to resting platelets they redistribute carbon dramatically. Activated platelets decrease relative flux to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle from glucose and increase relative flux to lactate. These results provide the first report of reaction-level carbon fluxes in platelets and allow us to distinguish metabolic fluxes with much higher resolution than previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance has been a growing concern that gradually undermines our tradition treatment regimen. The fact that few antibacterial drugs with new scaffolds or targets have been approved in the past two decades aggravates this crisis. Repurposing previously approved drugs as potent antibiotic adjuvants offers a cost-effective strategy to mitigate the development of resistance and tackle the increasing infections by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Herein, we found that benzydamine, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in clinic, remarkably potentiated broad-spectrum antibiotic-tetracyclines activity against a panel of clinical important resistant pathogens, including MRSA, VRE, MCRPEC and tet(X)-positive Gram-negative bacteria. Further mechanistically experiments showed that benzydamine dissipated membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}) in both Gram-positive and negative bacteria, which in turn upregulated the transmembrane proton gradient ({Delta}pH) and promoted the uptake of tetracyclines. Additionally, benzydamine exacerbated the oxidative stress by triggering the production of ROS and suppressing GAD system-mediated oxidative defensive. This mode of action explains the great bactericidal activity of the doxycycline-benzydamine combination against different metabolic states of bacteria including persister cells. As a proof-of-concept, the in vivo efficacy of this combination therapy was evidenced in multiple animal infection models. These findings revealed that benzydamine is a promising tetracycline antibiotics adjuvant and has the potential to address life-threatening infections by MDR bacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMost of Earths bacteria have yet to be cultivated. The metabolic and functional potentials of these uncultivated microorganisms thus remain mysterious, and the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) approach is the most robust method for uncovering these potentials. However, MAGs discovered by conventional metagenomic assembly and binning methods are usually highly fragmented genomes with heterogeneous sequence contamination, and this affects the accuracy and sensitivity of genomic analyses. Though the maturation of long-read sequencing technologies provides a good opportunity to fix the problem of highly fragmented MAGs as mentioned above, the methods error-prone nature causes severe problems of long-read-alone metagenomics. Hence, methods are urgently needed to retrieve MAGs by a combination of both long- and short-read technologies to advance genome-centric metagenomics.\n\nResultsIn this study, we combined Illumina and Nanopore data to develop a new workflow to reconstruct 233 MAGs--six novel bacterial orders, 20 families, 66 genera, and 154 species--from Lake Shunet, a secluded meromictic lake in Siberia. Those new MAGs were underrepresented or undetectable in other MAGs studies using metagenomes from human or other common organisms or habitats. Using this newly developed workflow and strategy, the average N50 of reconstructed MAGs greatly increased 10-40-fold compared to when the conventional Illumina assembly and binning method were used. More importantly, six complete MAGs were recovered from our datasets, five of which belong to novel species. We used these as examples to demonstrate many novel and intriguing genomic characteristics discovered in these newly complete genomes and proved the importance of high-quality complete MAGs in microbial genomics and metagenomics studies.\n\nConclusionsThe results show that it is feasible to apply our workflow with a few additional long reads to recover numerous complete and high-quality MAGs from short-read metagenomes of high microbial diversity environment samples. The unique features we identified from five complete genomes highlight the robustness of this method in genome-centric metagenomic research. The recovery of 154 novel species MAGs from a rarely explored lake greatly expands the current bacterial genome encyclopedia and broadens our knowledge by adding new genomic characteristics of bacteria. It demonstrates a strong need to recover MAGs from diverse unexplored habitats in the search for microbial dark matter.",

Notably, HBV polymerase (Pol) strongly inhibited L1 retrotransposition in a reverse transcriptase (RT)-independent manner. Indeed, the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain was essential for inhibition of L1 retrotransposition. L1 ORF1p RNA-binding protein predominantly localized into cytoplasmic RNA granule termed P-body. However, HBV Pol sequestered L1 ORF1p from P-body and colocalized with L1 ORF1p in cytoplasm, when both proteins were co-expressed. Altogether, HBV Pol seems to restrict L1 mobility through a sequestration of L1 ORF1p from P-body.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health crisis, which has been fuelled by the sustained use of certain classes of antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones. While the genetic mutations responsible for decreased fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) susceptibility are known, the implications of ciprofloxacin exposure on bacterial growth, survival, and interactions with host cells are not well described. Aiming to understand the influence of inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin in vitro, we subjected three clinical isolates of S. Typhimurium to differing concentrations of ciprofloxacin, dependent on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), and assessed the impact on bacterial growth, morphology, and transcription. We further investigated the differential morphology and transcription that occurred following ciprofloxacin exposure and measured the ability of ciprofloxacin-treated bacteria to invade and replicate in host cells. We found that ciprofloxacin-exposed S. Typhimurium are able to recover from inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin, and that the drug induces specific morphological and transcriptional signatures associated with the bacterial SOS response, DNA repair, and intracellular survival. In addition, ciprofloxacin-treated S. Typhimurium have increased capacity for intracellular replication in comparison to untreated organisms. These data suggest that S. Typhimurium undergoes an adaptive response under ciprofloxacin perturbation that promotes cellular survival, a consequence that may justify more measured use of ciprofloxacin for Salmonella infections. The combination of multiple experimental approaches provides new insights into the collateral effects that ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobials have on invasive bacterial pathogens.\n\nImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is a critical concern in global health. In particular, there is rising resistance to fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, a first-line antimicrobial for many Gram-negative pathogens. We investigated the adaptive response of clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium to ciprofloxacin, finding that the bacteria adapt in short timespans to high concentrations of ciprofloxacin in a way that promotes intracellular survival during early infection. Importantly, by studying three clinically relevant isolates, we were able to show that individual isolates respond differently to ciprofloxacin, and for each isolate, there was a heterogeneous response under ciprofloxacin treatment. The heterogeneity that arises from ciprofloxacin exposure may drive survival and proliferation of Salmonella during treatment and lead to drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Dietary changes are known to alter the composition of the gut microbiome. However, it is less understood how repeatable and reversible these changes are and how diet-switches affect the microbiota in the various segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, a treatment group of conventionally raised laboratory mice is subjected to two periods of western diet (WD) interrupted by a period of standard diet (SD) of the same duration. Beta-diversity analyses show that diet-induced microbiota changes are largely reversible (q = 0.1501; PERMANOVA, weighted-UniFrac comparison of the treatment-SD group to the control-SD group) and repeatable (q = 0.032; PERMANOVA, weighted-UniFrac comparison of both WD treatments). Furthermore, we report that diet switches alter the gut microbiota composition along the length of the intestinal tract in a segment-specific manner, leading to gut segment-specific Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratios. We identified prevalent and distinct Amplicon Sequencing Variants (ASVs), particularly in genera of the recently described Muribaculaceae, along the gut as well as ASVs that are differentially abundant between segments of treatment and control groups. Overall, this study provides insights into the reversibility of diet-induced microbiota changes and highlights the importance to expand sampling efforts beyond the collections of fecal samples to characterize diet-dependent and segment-specific microbiome differences.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation based signalling is a complicated and intertwined series of pathways critical to all domains of life. This interconnectivity, though essential to life, makes understanding and decoding the interactions difficult. Large datasets of phosphorylation interactions through the activity of kinases on their numerous effectors are now being generated, however interpretation of the network environment remains challenging. In humans, many phosphorylation interactions have been identified across published works to form the known phosphorylation interaction network. We overlayed phosphorylation datasets onto this network which provided information to each of the connections. To analyse the datasets now mapped into a network, we designed a pathway analysis that uses random walks to identify chains of phosphorylation events occurring much more or much less frequently than expected. This analysis highlights pathways of phosphorylation that work synergistically, providing a rapid interpretation of the most critical pathways in a given dataset. Here we used datasets of human red blood cells infected with the notable stages of Plasmodium falciparum asexual development. The analysis identified several known signalling interactions, and additional interactions which could form the basis of numerous future studies. The network analysis designed here is widely applicable to any comparative phosphorylation dataset across infection and disease and can provide a rapid and reliable analysis to guide validation studies.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, and toxin-producing anaerobe that can cause nosocomial antibiotic-associated intestinal disease. In C. difficile, the expression of flagellar genes is coupled to toxin gene regulation and bacterial colonization and virulence. The flagellin FliC is responsible for pleiotropic gene regulation during in vivo infection. However, how fliC expression is regulated is unclear. In Bacillus subtilis, flagellin homeostasis and motility are coregulated by flagellar assembly factor FliW, Flagellin Hag (FliC homolog), and CsrA (Carbon storage regulator A), which is referred to as partner-switching mechanism \"FliW-CsrA-Hag\". In this study, we characterized FliW and CsrA functions by deleting or overexpressing fliW, csrA, and fliW-csrA in C. difficile R20291. We showed that both fliW deletion or csrA overexpression in R20291, and csrA complementation in R20291{Delta}WA (fliW-csrA codeletion) dramatically decreased FliC production, however, fliC gene transcription was unaffected. While suppression of fliC translation by csrA overexpression was mostly relieved when fliW was coexpressed, and no significant difference in FliC production was detected when only fliW was complemented in R20291{Delta}WA. Further, loss of fliW led to increased biofilm formation, cell adhesion, toxin production, and pathogenicity in a mouse model of C. difficile infection (CDI), while fliW-csrA codeletion decreased toxin production and mortality in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that CsrA negatively modulates fliC expression and FliW indirectly affects fliC expression through inhibition of CsrA post-transcriptional regulation, which seems similar to the \"FliW-CsrA-Hag\" switch in B. subtilis. Our data also suggest that \"FliW-CsrA-fliC/FliC\" can regulate many facets of C. difficile R20291 pathogenicity.\n\nIMPORTANCEC. difficile flagellin FliC is associated with toxin gene expression, bacterial colonization and virulence, and is also involved in pleiotropic gene regulation during in vivo infection. However, how fliC expression is regulated remains unclear. In light of \"FliW-CsrA-Hag\" switch coregulation mechanism reported in B. subtilis, we showed that fliW and csrA play an important role in flagellin synthesis which affects C. difficile motility directly. Our data also suggest that FliW-CsrA-fliC/FliC\" can regulate many facets of C. difficile R20291 pathogenicity. These findings further aid us in understanding the virulence regulation in C. difficile.",

    "abstract": "High attrition rates in tuberculosis (TB) drug development have been largely attributed to safety, which is likely due to the use of endpoint assays measuring cell viability to detect drug cytotoxicity. In drug development of cancer, metabolic and neurological disorders, and antibiotics, cytotoxicity is increasingly being assessed using extracellular flux (XF) analysis, which measures cellular bioenergetic metabolism in real-time. Here, we adopt the XF platform to investigate the cytotoxicity of drugs currently used in TB treatment on the bioenergetic metabolism of HepG2 cells, THP-1 macrophages, and human monocyte derived macrophages (hMDM). We found that the XF analysis reveals earlier drug-induced effects on the cells bioenergetic metabolism prior to cell death, measured by conventional viability assays. Furthermore, each cell type has a distinct response to drug treatment, suggesting that more than one cell type should be considered to examine cytotoxicity in TB drug development. Interestingly, chemically unrelated drugs with different modes of action on Mycobacterium tuberculosis have similar effects on the bioenergetic parameters of the cells, thus, discouraging the prediction of potential cytotoxicity based on chemical structure and mode of action of new chemical entities. The clustering of the drug-induced effects on the hMDM bioenergetic parameters are reflected in the clustering of the effects of the drugs on cytokine production in hMDMs, demonstrating concurrence between the effects of the drugs on the metabolism and functioning of the macrophages. These findings can be used as a benchmark to establish XF analysis as a new tool to assay cytotoxicity in TB drug development.",

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a key neuronal kinase involved in pain signaling. However, the regulatory roles of Cdk5 in orofacial pain signaling and the possibility of therapeutic intervention at the level of mouse trigeminal ganglion primary neurons remain elusive. In this study, we used optimized intravital imaging to directly compare trigeminal neuronal activities after mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimulation. We then tested whether facial inflammatory pain in mice could be alleviated by the Cdk5 inhibitor peptide TFP5. We demonstrated regulation of total Ca2+ intensities by Cdk5 activity using transgenic and knockout mouse models. In mice with orofacial inflammation, application of TFP5 specifically decreased total Ca2+ intensities in response to noxious stimuli. It also alleviated inflammation-induced allodynia by inhibiting activation of trigeminal peripheral sensory neurons. Cdk5 inhibitors may provide promising non-opioid candidates for pain treatment.",

    "abstract": "Loss of basic utilities, such as drinking water and electricity distribution, were sustained for months in the aftermath of Hurricane Marias (HM) landfall in Puerto Rico (PR) in September 2017. The goal of this study was to assess if there was deterioration in biological quality of drinking water due to these disruptions. This study characterized the microbial composition of drinking water following HM across nine drinking water systems (DWSs) in PR and utilized an extended temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in the drinking water microbiome were indicative of HM associated disturbance followed by recovery. In addition to monitoring water chemistry, the samples were subjected to culture independent targeted and non-targeted microbial analysis including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and genome-resolved metagenomics. The qPCR results showed that residual disinfectant was the major driver of bacterial concentrations in tap water with marked decrease in concentrations from early to late sampling timepoints. While Mycobacterium avium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not detected in any sampling locations and timepoints, genetic material from Leptospira and Legionella pneumophila were transiently detected in a few sampling locations. The majority of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from these samples were not associated with pathogens and were consistent with bacterial community members routinely detected in DWSs. Further, whole metagenome-level comparisons between drinking water samples collected in this study with samples from other full-scale DWS indicated no significant deviation from expected community membership of the drinking water microbiome. Overall, our results suggest that disruptions due to HM did not result in significant and sustained deterioration of biological quality of drinking water at our study sites.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/442998v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100c1e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bae402org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cf41bborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e46105_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In the field, we evaluated the effects of various wheat varieties (modern and ancient) grown with or without chemical inputs (N-fertilizer, fungicide and herbicide together) in a crossed factorial design. We analysed rhizosphere bacteria and fungi by amplicons sequencing and mycorrhizal association by microscopic observations. When considered independently of plant genotype, chemical inputs were responsible for an increase in dominance for bacteria and decrease in evenness for bacteria and fungi. Independently of inputs, modern varieties had richer and more even bacterial communities compared to ancient varieties. Phenotypic plasticity had a significant effect: bacterial and fungal diversity decreased when inputs were applied in ancient varieties but not in modern ones. Mycorrhiza were more abundant in modern than ancient varieties, and less abundant when using chemical inputs. Although neglected, phenotypic plasticity is important to understand the evolution of plant-microbiota associations and a relevant target in breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that infectiousness of hosts carrying parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex, the causative agents of visceral leishmaniasis, is linked to parasite repositories in the host skin. However, a detailed understanding of the dispersal and dispersion of these obligatory-intracellular parasites and their host phagocytes in the skin is lacking. Using endogenously fluorescent parasites as a proxy, we apply image analysis combined with spatial point pattern models borrowed from ecology to characterize dispersion of parasitized myeloid cells (including ManR+ and CD11c+ cells) and predict dispersal mechanisms in a previously described immunodeficient model of L. donovani infection. Our results suggest that after initial seeding of infection in the skin, heavily parasite-infected myeloid cells are found in patches that resemble innate granulomas. Spread of parasites from these initial patches subsequently occurs through infection of recruited myeloid cells, ultimately leading to self-propagating networks of patch clusters. This combination of imaging and ecological pattern analysis to identify mechanisms driving the skin parasite landscape offers new perspectives on myeloid cell behavior following parasitism by L. donovani and may also be applicable to elucidating the behavior of other intracellular tissue-resident pathogens and their host cells.",

    "abstract": "The impact of the host microbiota on arbovirus infections is currently not well understood. Arboviruses are viruses transmitted through the bites of infected arthropods, predominantly mosquitoes or ticks. The first site of arbovirus inoculation is the biting site in the host skin, which is colonized by a complex microbial community that could possibly influence arbovirus infection. We demonstrated that pre-incubation of arboviruses with certain components of the bacterial cell wall, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of some Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids or peptidoglycan of certain Gram-positive bacteria, significantly reduced arbovirus infectivity in vitro. This inhibitory effect was observed for arboviruses of different virus families, including chikungunya virus of the Alphavirus genus and Zika virus of the Flavivirus genus, showing that this is a broad phenomenon. A modest inhibitory effect was observed following incubation with a panel of heat-inactivated bacteria, including bacteria residing on the skin. No viral inhibition was observed after pre-incubation of cells with LPS. Furthermore, a virucidal effect of LPS on viral particles was noticed by electron microscopy. Therefore, the main inhibitory mechanism seems to be due to a direct effect on the virus particles. Together, these results suggest that bacteria are able to decrease the infectivity of alphaviruses and flaviviruses.\n\nImportanceDuring the past decades the world has experienced a vast increase in epidemics of alphavirus and flavivirus infections. These viruses can cause severe diseases such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis and arthritis. Several alpha- and flaviviruses, such as chikungunya virus, Zika virus and dengue virus, are significant global health threats because of their high disease burden, their widespread (re-)emergence and the lack of (good) anti-arboviral strategies. Despite the clear health burden, alphavirus and flavivirus infection and disease are not fully understood. A knowledge gap in the interplay between the host and the arbovirus is the potential interaction with host skin bacteria. Therefore, we studied the effect of (skin) bacteria and bacterial cell wall components on alphavirus and flavivirus infectivity in cell culture. Our results show that certain bacterial cell wall components markedly reduced viral infectivity by directly interacting with the virus particle.",

For example, a TAD boundary deletion near Smad3/Smad6 caused complete embryonic lethality, while a deletion near Tbx5/Lhx5 resulted in a severe lung malformation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of TAD boundary sequences for in vivo genome function and suggest that noncoding deletions affecting TAD boundaries should be carefully considered for potential pathogenicity in clinical genetics screening.",

    "abstract": "Endonucleolytic removal of 5-leader sequences from tRNA precursor transcripts (pre-tRNAs) by RNase P is essential for protein synthesis. Beyond RNA-based RNase P enzymes, protein-only versions of the enzyme exert this function in various Eukarya (there termed PRORPs) and in some bacteria (Aquifex aeolicus and close relatives); both enzyme types belong to distinct subgroups of the PIN domain metallonuclease superfamily. Homologs of Aquifex RNase P (HARPs) are also expressed in some other bacteria and many archaea, where they coexist with RNA-based RNase P and do not represent the main RNase P activity. Here we solved the structure of the bacterial HARP from Halorhodospira halophila by cryo-EM revealing a novel screw-like dodecameric assembly. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that oligomerization is required for RNase P activity of HARPs. We propose that the tRNA substrate binds to an extended spike-helix (SH) domain that protrudes from the screw-like assembly to position the 5-end in close proximity to the active site of the neighboring dimer subunit. The structure suggests that eukaryotic PRORPs and prokaryotic HARPs recognize the same structural elements of pre-tRNAs (tRNA elbow region and cleavage site). Our analysis thus delivers the structural and mechanistic basis for pre-tRNA processing by the prokaryotic HARP system.",

    "abstract": "Nup358, a nuclear pore protein, facilitates a nuclear positioning pathway that is essential for many biological processes, including neuromuscular and brain development. Nup358 binds and activates the auto-inhibited dynein adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BicD2), which in turn recruits and activates the dynein machinery to position the nucleus. However, the molecular details of the Nup358/BicD2 interaction remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a minimal Nup358 domain activates dynein/dynactin/BicD2 for processive motility on microtubules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), a Nup358 helix encompassing residues 2162-2184 was identified, which transitioned from random coil to an -helix upon BicD2-binding and formed the core of the Nup358-BicD2 interface. Mutations in this region of Nup358 decreased the Nup358/BicD2 interaction, resulting in decreased dynein recruitment and impaired motility. BicD2 thus recognizes the cargo adaptor Nup358 though a \"cargo recognition -helix\", a structural feature that may stabilize BicD2 in its activated state and promote processive dynein motility.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen that causes seasonal epidemics with significant mortality. One of the most abundant proteins in IAV particles is the matrix protein 1 (M1), which is essential for the virus structural stability. M1 organizes virion assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (PM), where it interacts with other viral components. The recruitment of M1 to the PM as well as its interaction with the other viral envelope proteins (hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase, matrix protein 2 (M2)) is controversially discussed in previous studies. Therefore, we used fluorescence fluctuation microscopy techniques (i.e., scanning fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and Number and Brightness) to quantify the oligomeric state of M1 and its interactions with other viral proteins in co-transfected as well as infected cells. Our results indicate that M1 is recruited to the PM by M2, as a consequence of the strong interaction between the two proteins. In contrast, only a weak interaction between M1 and HA was observed. M1-HA interaction occurred only in the case that M1 was already bound to the PM. We therefore conclude that M2 initiates the assembly of IAV by recruiting M1 to the PM, possibly allowing its further interaction with other viral proteins.\n\nStatement of SignificanceInfluenza A virus (IAV) is a pathogen responsible for epidemics and occasional pandemics and, therefore, a significant burden on health systems. To develop innovative therapeutic approaches, a deeper understanding of the viral replication cycle is needed. For example, during the formation of new virions in infected cells, several viral components must assemble at the plasma membrane, but the molecular interactions involved in this process are not clearly understood. In this work, we use quantitative fluorescence microscopy methods to monitor the interplay between several viral proteins in live cell models. Our results underline the importance of the interactions between two specific proteins (M1 and M2) and shed light on the first steps in IAV assembly.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes is fundamental to understanding how cells control their identity and behavior. Computational gene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction methods aim to map this control by inferring relationships from transcriptomic data. Unfortunately, existing methods are imprecise, may be computationally burdensome, and do not uncover how networks transition from one topology to another. Here we present Epoch, a computational network reconstruction tool that leverages single cell transcriptomics to infer dynamic network structures. Epoch performs favorably when benchmarked using data derived from in vivo, in vitro, and in silico sources. To illustrate the usefulness of Epoch, we applied it to identify the dynamic networks underpinning directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) guided by multiple primitive streak induction treatments. Our analysis demonstrates that modulating signaling pathways drives topological network changes that shape cell fate potential. We also find that Peg3 is a central contributor to the rewiring of the pluripotency network to favor mesoderm specification. By integrating signaling pathways with GRN structures, we traced how Wnt activation and PI3K suppression govern mesoderm and endoderm specification, respectively. Finally, we compare the networks established in in vitro directed differentiation of ESCs to those in in vivo gastrulation and mesoderm specification. The methods presented here are available in the R package Epoch, and provide a foundation for future work in understanding the biological implications of dynamic regulatory structures.",

    "abstract": "Aging and challenging signal-in-noise conditions are known to engage use of cortical resources to help maintain speech understanding. Extensive corticothalamic projections are thought to provide attentional, mnemonic and cognitive-related inputs in support of sensory inferior colliculus (IC) inputs to the medial geniculate body (MGB). Here we show that a decrease in modulation depth, a temporally less distinct periodic acoustic signal, leads to a jittered ascending temporal code, changing MGB unit responses from adapting responses to responses showing repetition-enhancement, posited to aid identification of important communication and environmental sounds. Young-adult male Fischer Brown Norway rats, injected with the inhibitory opsin archaerhodopsin T (ArchT) into the primary auditory cortex (A1), were subsequently studied using optetrodes to record single-units in MGB. Decreasing the modulation depth of acoustic stimuli significantly increased repetition-enhancement. Repetition-enhancement was blocked by optical inactivation of corticothalamic terminals in MGB. These data support a role for corticothalamic projections in repetition-enhancement, implying that predictive anticipation could be used to improve neural representation of weakly modulated sounds.\n\nKey pointsO_LIAging has been shown to increase temporal jitter in the ascending acoustic code prompting use of cognitive/attentional mechanisms to help better understand communication-like signals.\nC_LIO_LIAuditory thalamus receives extensive projections from cortex that are implicated in delivering higher-order cortical computations to enhance thalamic responses.\nC_LIO_LIThe present study modeled aging in young rats by using temporally less distinct stimuli shown to alter the pattern of MGB unit responses from response adaptation to repetition-enhancement. Enhanced responses to repeating less temporally distinct modulated stimuli were reversed when inputs from cortex to auditory thalamus were blocked. Collectively, these data argue that low salience temporal signals engage cortical processes to enhance coding of weakly modulated signals in auditory thalamus.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reprogrammed to target tumor cells has demonstrated significant potential in various malignancies. However, little is known about the long-term potential and the clonal stability of the infused cells. Here, we studied the longest persisting CD19-redirected chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to date in two chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients who achieved a complete remission in 2010. CAR T-cells were still detectable up to 10+ years post-infusion, with sustained remission in both patients. Surprisingly, a prominent, highly activated CD4+ population developed in both patients during the years post-infusion, dominating the CAR T-cell population at the late time points. This transition was reflected in the stabilization of the clonal make-up of CAR T-cells with a repertoire dominated by few clones. Single cell multi-omics profiling via Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq) with TCR sequencing of CAR T-cells obtained 9.3 years post-infusion demonstrated that these long-persisting CD4+ CAR T-cells exhibited cytotoxic characteristics along with strong evidence of ongoing functional activation and proliferation.

    "abstract": "Membrane-associated mucins protect epithelial cell surfaces against pathogenic threats by serving as non-productive decoys that capture infectious agents and clear them from the cell surface and by erecting a physical barrier that restricts their access to target receptors on host cells. However, the mechanisms through which mucins function are still poorly defined due to a limited repertoire of tools available for tailoring their structure and composition in living cells with molecular precision. Using synthetic glycopolymer mimetics of mucins, we modeled the mucosal glycocalyx on red blood cells (RBC) and evaluated its influence on lectin (SNA) and virus (H1N1) adhesion to endogenous sialic acid receptors. The glycocalyx inhibited the rate of SNA and H1N1 adhesion in a size- and density-dependent manner, consistent with current view of the mucins as providing a protective shield against pathogens. Counterintuitively, increasing density of the mucin mimetics enhanced the retention of bound lectins and viruses. Careful characterization of SNA behavior at the RBC surface using a range of biophysical and imaging techniques revealed lectin-induced crowding and reorganization of the glycocalyx with concomitant enhancement in lectin clustering, presumably through the formation of a more extensive glycan receptor patch at the cell surface. Our findings indicate that glycan-targeting pathogens may exploit the biophysical and biomechanical properties of mucins to overcome the mucosal glycocalyx barrier.\n\nSignificanceLike other animal hosts, humans are constantly challenged by pathogens. This has led to an evolution of physical barriers coating all mucosal tissues, which are most vulnerable to infection. An important part of this defense is a dense brush of large proteins, called mucins, which are heavily decorated with sugars and keep pathogens at bay. Deciphering how pathogens overcome the mucin barrier is necessary to understand early stages of infection and to develop more effective treatments. By artificially installing the mucin-like shield on the surfaces of cells using synthetic sugar-bearing polymers, we have discovered a new physical mechanism by which proteins and viruses can exploit this barrier to more strongly adhere to their targets.",

Although most cells express FASN at low levels, it is upregulated in cancers and during replication of many viruses. The precise role of FASN in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood, and whether de novo fatty acid synthesis contributes to host or viral protein acylation has been traditionally difficult to study. We describe a cell permeable, click-chemistry compatible alkynyl-acetate analog (Alk-4) that functions as a reporter of FASN-dependent protein acylation. In a FASN-dependent manner, Alk-4 selectively labeled the cellular protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) at its palmitoylation sites, and the HIV-1 matrix protein at its myristoylation site. Alk-4 metabolic labeling also enabled biotin-based purification and identification of more than 200 FASN-dependent acylated cellular proteins. Thus, Alk-4 is a useful bioorthogonal tool to selectively probe FASN-mediated protein acylation in normal and diseased states.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila Robo2 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved Roundabout (Robo) family of axon guidance receptors. The canonical role of Robo receptors is to signal midline repulsion in response to their cognate Slit ligands, which bind to the N-terminal Ig1 domain in most Robo family members. In the Drosophila embryonic ventral nerve cord, Robo1 and Robo2 cooperate to signal Slit-dependent midline repulsion, while Robo2 also regulates the medial-lateral position of longitudinal axon pathways and acts non-autonomously to promote midline crossing of commissural axons. Although it is clear that Robo2 signals midline repulsion in response to Slit, it is less clear whether Robo2s other activities are also Slit-dependent. To determine which of Robo2s axon guidance roles depend on its Slit-binding Ig1 domain, we have used a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy replace the endogenous robo2 gene with a robo2 variant from which the Ig1 domain has been deleted (robo2{Delta}Ig1). We compare the expression and localization of Robo2{Delta}Ig1 protein with that of full-length Robo2 in embryonic neurons in vivo, and examine its ability to substitute for Robo2 to mediate midline repulsion and lateral axon pathway formation. We find that removal of the Ig1 domain from Robo2{Delta}Ig1 disrupts both of these axon guidance activities. In addition, we find that the Ig1 domain of Robo2 is required for its proper subcellular localization in embryonic neurons, a role that is not shared by the Ig1 domain of Robo1. Finally, we report that although FasII-positive lateral axons are misguided in embryos expressing Robo2{Delta}Ig1, the axons that normally express Robo2 are correctly guided to the lateral zone, suggesting that Robo2 may guide lateral longitudinal axons through a cell non-autonomous mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Multi-parametric quantitative MRI has shown great potential to improve the sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnosis and to enhance our understanding of complex brain processes, but suffers from long scan time especially at high spatial resolution. To address this long-standing challenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed 3D Echo Planar Time-resolved Imaging (3D-EPTI), which significantly increases the acceleration capacity of MRI sampling, and provides high acquisition efficiency for multi-parametric MRI. This is achieved by exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of MRI data at multiple timescales through new encoding strategies within and between efficient continuous readouts. Specifically, an optimized spatiotemporal CAIPI encoding within the readouts combined with a radial-block sampling strategy across the readouts enables an acceleration rate of 800 folds in the k-t space. A subspace reconstruction was employed to resolve thousands of artifact-free high-quality multi-contrast images spaced at a time interval of ~1 ms. We have demonstrated the ability of 3D-EPTI to provide robust and repeatable whole-brain simultaneous T1, T2, T2*, PD and B1+ mapping at high isotropic resolution within minutes (e.g., 1-mm isotropic resolution in 3 minutes), and to enable submillimeter multi-parametric imaging to study detailed brain structures.\n\nHighlightsO_LIUltra-fast acquisition for 3D multi-parametric quantitative MRI.\nC_LIO_LISimultaneous T1 T2 T2* PD and B1+ mapping.\nC_LIO_LI3-minute scan at 1-mm isotropic resolution with whole-brain coverage.\nC_LIO_LIMulti-parametric mapping at 700-m isotropic resolution in 10 minutes.\nC_LIO_LIRepeatable quantification and cortical-depth analysis.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Identifying crop loss at field parcel scale using satellite images is challenging: first, crop loss is caused by many factors during the growing season; second, reliable reference data about crop loss are lacking; third, there are many ways to define crop loss. This study investigates the feasibility of using satellite images to train machine learning (ML) models to classify agricultural field parcels into those with and without crop loss. The reference data for this study was provided by Finnish Food Authority (FFA) containing crop loss information of approximately 1.4 million field parcels in Finland covering about 3.5 million ha from 2000 to 2015. This reference data was combined with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 7 images, in which more than 80% of the possible data are missing. Despite the hard problem with extremely noisy data, among the four ML models we tested, random forest (with mean imputation and missing value indicators) achieved the average AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.688 {+/-} 0.059 over all 16 years with the range [0.602, 0.795] in identifying new crop-loss fields based on reference fields of the same year. To our knowledge, this is one of the first large scale benchmark study of using machine learning for crop loss classification at field parcel scale. The classification setting and trained models have numerous potential applications, for example, allowing government agencies or insurance companies to verify crop-loss claims by farmers and realise efficient agricultural monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore potential mechanisms of cytotoxicity towards HeLa and HT29 cells displayed by Pediocin PA-1. We did this by carrying out sequence alignments and 3D modelling of related bacteriocins which have been studied in greater detail: Microcin E492, Eneterocin AB heterodimer and Divercin V41. Microcin E492 interacts with Toll-Like Receptor 4 in order to activate an apoptosis reaction, sequence alignment showed a high homology between Pediocin PA-1 and Microcin E492 and 3D modelling showed Pediocin PA-1 interacting with TLR-4 in a way reminiscent of Microcin E492. Furthermore, Pediocin PA-1 had the highest homology with the Enterocin heterodimer, particularly chain A; Enterocin has also shown to cause an apoptotic response in cancer cells. Based on this we are led to strongly believe Pediocin PA-1 interacts with TLRs in order to cause cell death. If this is the case it would explain the difference in cytotoxicity towards HeLa over HT29 cells, due to difference in expression of particular TLRs. Overall, we believe Pediocin PA-1 exhibits a dual effect which is dose dependant, like that of Microcin. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic meant that we were unable to carry out experiments in the lab, and the unavailability of important data meant we were unable to make solid conclusions but rather suggestions. However despite this we have still been able to highlight interesting findings and how these could be translated into future research and therapeutics in order to improve the quality of treatment and life of cancer patients.",

Previous studies have evaluated WM fiber tract specific brain regions in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, DTI might lack an accurate biological interpretation, and the technique suffers from several limitations. Here, we sought to evaluate Fixel-based analysis (FBA) and free water corrected DTI (fwcDTI) metrics between HIV+ and HIV uninfected (HIV-) individuals, and their relationships with blood markers and cognitive scores. We also compared the specificity of both MRI metrics in their ability to distinguish between individuals with and without cognitive impairment using machine learning classifiers. Using 94 age-matched participants, we found that whole brain FBA was significantly reduced (up to 15%) in various fiber bundles. Tract based special statistics (TBSS) of fwcDTI metrics revealed decreased fractional anisotropy FAT (by 1-2%) in HIV+ compared to HIV- individuals in areas consistent with those observed in FBA, but these were not significant. An adaptive boosting classifier reliably distinguished between cognitively normal patients and those with cognitive impairment with 80% precision and 78% recall. Therefore, FBA may serve as a potential in-vivo biomarker for evaluating and monitoring axonal degeneration in HIV+ patients at risk for neurocognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies conducted in small cohorts of children have indicated that broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) may develop earlier after HIV infection compared to adults. To define the frequency and kinetics of bnAb responses in a larger pediatric cohort, we evaluated plasma from 212 ART-naive, children living with HIV aged 1 to 3 years. Neutralization breadth and potency was assessed using a panel of 10 tier-2 viruses and compared to those of adults with chronic HIV. Further, the magnitude, epitope specificity and IgG subclass distribution of Env-specific antibodies were also assessed using a binding antibody multiplex assay. We found that 1-year-old children demonstrated neutralization breadth comparable to that of chronically-infected adults, and breadth continued to increase with age such that the pediatric cohort overall exhibited significantly greater neutralization breadth than adults (p= 0.014). Similarly, binding antibody responses increased with age, and the levels in 2 to 3 year-old children were comparable to those of adults. Overall, there was no significant difference in antibody specificities or IgG subclass distribution between the pediatric and adult cohorts. Interestingly, the neutralization activity was mapped to a single epitope (CD4 binding site, V2 or V3 glycans) in only 5 of 38 pediatric broadly neutralizing samples, suggesting a polyclonal neutralization response may develop in most children. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the early life immune system may present advantages for the development of an effective HIV vaccine.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies during natural HIV infection is critical to provide insights for the development of an effective vaccine. In this study, we used a large cohort (n=212) of HIV infected children aged 1-3 years old to define the frequency and kinetics of broad neutralization in comparison to adults with chronic HIV. We also evaluated the magnitude and epitope specificity of HIV Env-specific antibodies in children and adults. We observed that both the binding and neutralizing antibody responses increased with age. However, by one year of age, children had neutralization breadth comparable to that of chronically infected adults; and overall, 1-3 year-old children demonstrated higher neutralization breadth than adults. Only slight differences in epitope-specificity and IgG subclass distribution were observed between children and adults, suggesting that these factors are not major contributors to the observed age-related difference in neutralization breadth. The epitope specificity of the neutralizing antibodies could not be mapped in the majority of children, suggesting that their response may be polyclonal. Our study contributes to the body of work indicating a potential advantage of the early life immune system for the elicitation of broad neutralization.",

Discerning the nature of HIV-specific local immune responses is crucial for identifying correlates of protection in HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals. The present study involved a comprehensive analysis of soluble immune mediators, secretory immunoglobulins (sIg) and levels of natural killer (NK) cells, CXCR5+ CD8+T cells, T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and T regulatory cells (T regs) in the vaginal mucosa, as well as the nature and composition of the cervicovaginal microbiome in HESN women. We found significantly elevated antiviral cytokines, soluble immunoglobulins, and increased frequencies of activated NK cells, CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells and Tfh cells in HESN females as compared to HIV unexposed healthy (UH) women. Analysis of the genital microbiome of HESN women revealed a greater bacterial diversity and increased abundance of Gardnerella spp in the mucosa of HESN women. The findings suggest the female genital tract of HESN females represents a microenvironment equipped with innate immune factors, antiviral mediators and critical T cells subsets that protect against HIV infection.",

However, how these signals ensure a high-fidelity proteome and safeguard the clonal diversification of the pre- selection TCR repertoire given the considerable translational activity imposed by {beta}-selection is largely unknown. Here, we identify the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery as a critical proteostasis checkpoint during {beta}-selection. Expression of the SEL1L-HRD1 complex, the most conserved branch of ERAD, is directly regulated by the transcriptional activity of the Notch intracellular domain. Deletion of Sel1l impaired DN3 to DN4 thymocyte transition and severely impaired {beta} T cell development. Mechanistically, Sel1l deficiency induced unresolved ER stress that triggered thymocyte apoptosis through the PERK pathway. Accordingly, genetically inactivating PERK rescued T cell development from Sel1l- deficient thymocytes. Our study reveals a critical developmental signal controlled proteostasis mechanism that enforces T cell development to ensure a healthy adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) has been used as a traditional remedy to control immune related diseases. However, there is limited information about its immune stimulating effects on the immunosuppressed model. The main bioactive components such as saponins are known to con-tribute to controlling immune activity. Thus, we developed an aged red PG (PGS) with 2.6 times of platycodin D, one of the saponins. We treated PG and PGS (PG-diets) to immunosuppressed mice via cyclophosphamide (CPA) injection. After 2weeks of the supplement, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to investigate the effects of PG-diets on the gut microbiota and immune system in the immune suppressed model. PG-diets groups showed an increased abundance of microorganism in immune-deficient mice compared to the control NC group, indicating PG-diets have a distinct effect on microbial communities. Detection of specific genera related to the immune related biomarkers in PG-diets groups can support their effects on the immune system. Especially, the Akkermansia showed a significant decrease of abundance in response to the CPA treatment in the NC group at the genus level, but its abundance increased in response to the PG-diets treatment in the PG-diets groups. We also found that the modulation of gut microbiome by PG-diets was correlated with body weight as one of important immune biomarkers, though not much difference was found between PG and PGS effects. The results demonstrate that PG-diets may improve the health benefits of immune suppressed mice by altering the gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) gene pairs are ubiquitous in microbial chromosomal genomes and plasmids, as well as bacteriophages. They act as regulatory switches, with the toxin limiting the growth of bacteria and archaea by compromising diverse essential cellular targets, and the antitoxin counteracting the toxic effect. To uncover previously uncharted TA diversity across microbes and bacteriophages, we analysed the conservation of genomic neighbourhoods using our computational tool FlaGs (for Flanking Genes), which allows high-throughput detection of TA-like operons. Focussing on the widespread but poorly experimentally characterised antitoxin domain DUF4065, our in silico analyses indicated that DUF4065-containing proteins serve as broadly distributed antitoxin components in putative TA-like operons with dozens of different toxic domains with multiple different folds. Given the versatility of DUF4065, we have renamed the domain to Panacea (and proteins containing the domain, PanA) after the Greek goddess of universal remedy. We have experimentally validated nine PanA-neutralised TA pairs. While the majority of validated PanA-neutralised toxins act as translation inhibitors or membrane disruptors, a putative nucleotide cyclase toxin from a Burkholderia prophage compromises replication and translation, as well as inducing RelA-dependent accumulation of the nucleotide alarmone (p)ppGpp. We find that Panacea-containing antitoxins form a complex with their diverse cognate toxins, characteristic of the direct neutralisation mechanisms employed by Type II TA systems. Finally, through directed evolution we have selected PanA variants that can neutralise non-cognate TA toxins, thus experimentally demonstrating the evolutionary plasticity of this hyperpromiscuous antitoxin domain.\n\nSignificanceToxin-antitoxin systems are enigmatic and diverse elements of bacterial and bacteriophage genomes. We have uncovered remarkable versatility of an antitoxin protein domain, that has evolved to neutralise dozens of different toxin domains. We find that antitoxins carrying this domain - Panacea - form complexes with their cognate toxins, indicating a direct neutralisation mechanism, and that Panacea can be evolved to neutralise a non-cognate and non-homologous toxin with just two amino acid substitutions. This raises the possibility that this domain could be an adaptable universal, or semi-universal protein neutraliser with significant biotechnological and medical potential.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite more than a century of research, genetic manipulation of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), the causative agent of syphilis, has not been successful. The lack of genetic engineering tools has severely limited understanding of the mechanisms behind T. pallidum success as a pathogen. A recently described method for in vitro cultivation of T. pallidum, however, has made it possible to experiment with transformation and selection protocols in this pathogen. Here, we describe an approach that successfully replaced the tprA (tp0009) pseudogene in the SS14 T. pallidum strain with a kanamycin resistance (kanR) cassette.\n\nPrincipal findingsA suicide vector was constructed using the pUC57 plasmid backbone. In the vector, the kanR gene was cloned downstream of the tp0574 gene promoter. The tp0574prom-kanR cassette was then placed between two 1-kbp homology arms identical to the sequences upstream and downstream of the tprA pseudogene. To induce homologous recombination and integration of the kanR cassette into the T. pallidum chromosome, in vitro-cultured SS14 strain spirochetes were exposed to the engineered vector in a CaCl2-based transformation buffer and let recover for 24 hours before adding kanamycin-containing selective media. Integration of the kanR cassette was demonstrated by qualitative PCR, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of transformed treponemes propagated in vitro and in vivo. ddPCR analysis of RNA and mass spectrometry confirmed expression of the kanR message and protein in treponemes propagated in vitro. Moreover, tprA knockout (tprAko-SS14) treponemes grew in kanamycin concentrations that were 64 times higher than the MIC for the wild-type SS14 (wt-SS14) strain and in infected rabbits treated with kanamycin.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrated that genetic manipulation of T. pallidum is attainable. This discovery will allow the application of functional genetics techniques to study syphilis pathogenesis and improve syphilis vaccine development.\n\nAuthor SummarySyphilis is still an endemic disease in many low- and middle-income countries, and it has been resurgent in high-income nations for almost two decades. In endemic areas, syphilis causes significant morbidity and mortality, particularly when its causative agent, the spirochete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum) is transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy. A better understanding of T. pallidum biology and syphilis pathogenesis would help devise better control strategies for this infection. One of the limitations associated with working with T. pallidum was our inability to genetically alter this pathogen to evaluate the function of genes encoding virulence factors or create attenuated strains that could be useful for vaccine development. Here, we report a transformation protocol that allowed us to replace a specific region of the T. pallidum genome containing a pseudogene (i.e., a non-functional gene) with a stably integrated kanamycin resistance gene. To our knowledge, this is the first-ever report of a method to achieve a genetically modified T. pallidum strain and, as such, it can revolutionize research in the syphilis field.",

    "abstract": "Sacbrood virus (SBV) infection in Apis cerana has caused tremendous damage in India, Thailand, Vietnam, and China since the 1970s. The disease caused by this virus results in colony collapse disorder in A. cerana and is also a devastating disease affecting A. cerana in South Korean apiaries. It has almost resulted in the elimination of the species. Therefore, control measures for this emerging threat are urgently needed. SBV RNA interference (RNAi) targeting VP1 was prepared to test the safety and efficacy of protection and treatment in artificially infected larvae and in infected colonies in South Korean apiaries. The efficacy of VP1 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was confirmed for the protection and treatment of infected larvae by increasing the survival rate in comparison with that in untreated larvae. Furthermore, an optimal application procedure was established for the large-scale RNAi treatment of SBV in apiaries. The protection of healthy colonies from SBV by RNAi was demonstrated in 100% of apiaries, and the treatment results showed that after five administrations, the SBV in infected colonies was mitigated to a safe level at which no symptoms of the disease were observed. Importantly, the low cost of dsRNA production in this study enables its application as a specific drug in large scale in South Korean apiculture.",

While several studies demonstrate that loss of ATRX sensitizes cells to chemical stabilizers of G4 structures, the molecular function of ATRX at G4 regions during replication remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ATRX associates with the MCM replication complex and that loss of ATRX leads to G4 structure accumulation at newly synthesized DNA. We show that both the helicase domain of ATRX and its H3.3 chaperone function are required to protect cells from G4-induced replicative stress. Furthermore, these activities are upstream of heterochromatin formation mediated by the histone methyltransferase, ESET, which is the critical molecular event that protects cells from G4-mediated stress. In support, tumors carrying mutations in either ATRX or ESET show increased mutation burden at G4-enriched DNA sequences. Overall, our study provides new insights into mechanisms by which ATRX promotes genome stability with important implications for understanding impacts of its loss on human disease.",

    "abstract": "Arterial endothelial cells (ECs) have the ability to respond to mechanical forces exerted by fluid shear stress. This response is of importance, as it is protective against vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. Mechanical forces are transmitted at the sites of adhesion to the basal membrane as well as cell-cell junctions where protein complexes connect to the cellular cytoskeleton to relay force into the cell. Here we present a novel protein complex that connects junctional VE-cadherin and radial actin filaments to the LINC complex in the nuclear membrane. We show that the scaffold protein AmotL2 is essential for the formation of radial actin filaments and the flow-induced alignment of aortic and arterial ECs. The deletion of endothelial AmotL2 alters nuclear shape as well as subcellular positioning. Molecular analysis shows that VE-cadherin is mechanically associated with the nuclear membrane via binding to AmotL2 and Actin. Furthermore, the deletion of AmotL2 in ECs provokes a pro-inflammatory response and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in the aorta of mice on a normal diet. Remarkably, transcriptome analysis of AAA samples from human patients revealed a negative correlation between AmotL2 expression and aneurysm diameters, as well as a positive correlation between AmotL2 and YAP expression. These findings provide a conceptual framework regarding how mechanotransduction in the junctions is coupled with vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "In mammals and flies, only a limited number of cells in a multicellular female germline cyst become oocytes, but how the oocyte is selected is unknown. Here we show that the microtubule minus end-stabilizing protein, Patronin/CAMSAP marks the future Drosophila oocyte and is required for oocyte specification. The spectraplakin, Shot, recruits Patronin to the fusome, a branched structure extending into all cyst cells. Patronin stabilizes more microtubules in the cell with most fusome and this weak asymmetry is amplified by Dynein-dependent transport of Patronin-stabilized microtubules. This forms a polarized microtubule network, along which Dynein transports oocyte determinants into the presumptive oocyte. Thus, Patronin amplifies a weak fusome anisotropy to break cyst symmetry. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism of oocyte selection in the germline cyst.",

While several typologies and classifications have been developed to address individual components of teeth, there is a need for a comprehensive system, that captures internal and external root features across all teeth. Using CT scans, the external and internal root morphologies of a global sample of humans are analysed (n=945). From this analysis a method of classification that captures external and internal root morphology in a way that is intuitive, reproducible, and defines the human phenotypic set is developed. Results provide a robust definition of modern human tooth root phenotypic diversity. Our method is modular in nature, allowing for incorporation of past and future classification systems. Additionally, it provides a basis for analysing hominin root morphology in evolutionary, ecological, genetic, and developmental contexts.",

    "abstract": "Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play important roles in the viral infection cycle and are proven antiviral drug targets. Matrix protein 2 from influenza A (AM2) is the best characterized viroporin, and the current paradigm is that AM2 forms monodisperse tetramers. Here, we used native mass spectrometry and other techniques to characterize the oligomeric state of both the full-length and transmembrane domain (TM) of AM2 in a variety of different pH and detergent conditions. Unexpectedly, we discovered that AM2 formed a range of different oligomeric complexes that were strongly influenced by the local chemical environment. Native mass spectrometry of AM2 in nanodiscs with different lipids showed that lipids also affected the oligomeric states of AM2. Finally, nanodiscs uniquely enabled measurement of amantadine binding stoichiometries to AM2 in the intact lipid bilayer. These unexpected results reveal that AM2 can form a wider range of oligomeric states than previously thought possible, which may provide new potential mechanisms of influenza pathology and pharmacology.\n\nSignificance StatementMany viruses contain small ion channels called viroporins that play diverse roles in viral infections. Influenza A M2 (AM2) is the best characterized viroporin and the target of the antivirals amantadine and rimantadine. Although past structural studies showed AM2 was a monodisperse tetramer, we discovered that AM2 can form polydisperse and dynamic oligomers that are sensitive to their local chemical environment. Our findings provide a new perspective on the structure and mechanisms of AM2 that may extend to other viroporins.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D is an important hormonal molecule, which exerts genomic and non-genomic actions in maintaining brain development and adult brain health. Many epidemiological studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with Alzheimers disease (AD). Nevertheless, the underlying signaling pathway through which this occurs remains to be characterized. We were intrigued to find that although vitamin D levels are significantly low in AD patients, their hippocampal vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels are inversely increased in the cytosol of the brain cells, and colocalized with A{beta}42 plaques, gliosis and autophagosomes, suggesting that a non-genomic form of VDR is implicated in AD. Mechanistically, A{beta}42 induces the conversion of nuclear heterodimer of VDR/RXR heterodimer into a cytoplasmic VDR/p53 heterodimer. The cytosolic VDR/p53 complex mediates the A{beta}42-induced autophagic apoptosis. Reduction of p53 activity in AD mice reverses the VDR/RXR formation and rescues AD brain pathologies and cognitive impairment. In line with the impaired genomic VDR pathway, the transgenic AD mice fed a vitamin D sufficient diet exhibit lower plasma vitamin D levels since early disease phases, raising the possibility that vitamin D deficiency may actually be an early manifestation of AD. Despite the deficiency of vitamin D in AD mice, vitamin D supplementation not only has no benefit but lead to exacerbated A{beta}42 depositions and cognitive impairment. Together, these data indicate that the impaired genomic vitamin D pathway links A{beta}42 to induce autophagic apoptosis, and suggest that VDR/p53 pathway could be targeted for the treatment of AD.\n\nSignificance StatementVitamin D exerts a genomic action for neuroprotection through VDR/RXR transcriptional complex. Thus, insufficient vitamin D has been linked to AD, but the signaling pathway involved remains unclear. Surprisingly, we find that the genomic action of VDR/RXR to be compromised and converted into a non-genomic VDR/p53 complex in promoting AD neurodegeneration. The cytosolic VDR/p53 complex contribute to autophagy-induced neuronal apoptosis. The VDR/RXR pathway can be a new therapeutic target for AD because targeting VDR/p53 ameliorates AD. Importantly, we provide evidence that vitamin D deficiency might be an early AD manifestation, and vitamin D supplementation exacerbates AD. This work uncovers a non-genomic VDR action in promoting AD and suggests a potential aggravating effect of vitamin D supplementation on AD.",

    "abstract": "Intratumoral T cells that might otherwise control tumors are often identified in an  exhausted state, defined by specific epigenetic modifications as well as upregulation of genes such as CD38, CTLA-4 and PD-1. While the term might imply inactivity, there has been little study of this state at the phenotypic level in tumors to understand the extent of their incapacitation. Starting with the observation that T cells move more quickly through mouse tumors as residence time increases and they progress towards exhaustion, we elaborated a non-stimulatory live-biopsy method for real-time study of T cell behaviors within individual patient tumors. Using two-photon microscopy, we studied native CD8 T cells interacting with APCs and with cancer cells in different micro-niches of human tumors, finding that T cell speed was variable by region and by patient, was independent of T cell density and was inversely correlated with local tumor density. Across a range of tumor types, we found a strong relationship between CD8 T cell motility and exhausted T cell state that corresponds to observations made in mouse models where exhausted T cells move faster. While this is a small study, it demonstrates at least two types of T cell dynamic states in individual human tumors and supports the existence of an active program in  exhausted T cells that extends beyond incapacitating them.",

For this to occur the myosin chaperone UNC-45, or UNC-45B, must be present and able to chaperone myosin. Here we use a combination of in vivo C. elegans experiments and in vitro biophysical experiments to analyze the effects of six missense mutations in conserved regions of UNC-45/UNC-45B. We found that the phenotype of paralysis and disorganized thick filaments in 5/6 of the mutant nematode strains can likely be attributed to both reduced steady state UNC-45 protein levels and reduced chaperone activity. Interestingly, the biophysical assays performed on purified proteins show that all of the mutations result in reduced myosin chaperone activity but not overall protein stability. This suggests that these mutations only cause protein instability in the in vivo setting and that these conserved regions may be involved in UNC-45 protein stability/ regulation via post translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, or some other unknown mechanism.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of human stem cell cultures and interest in understanding human embryogenesis, human blastocyst-like structures, or human blastoids, are being developed. Thus far, two different strategies have been taken, generating blastoids from naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC)1-3 or through reprogramming of adult human somatic cells4. All these studies utilize comparative transcriptome analyses to authenticate blastoid cells and identify their counterparts in the human blastocyst5,6. However, the validity of comparative transcriptome analysis is critically hinged on including relevant reference data, not only those from targeted cell types but also from potential alternative cell lineages. Thus, we sought to reevaluate the single-cell transcriptome data from the blastoids based on a more comprehensive cellular reference, which includes data from in vitro cultured human6,7, non-human primate (NHP, Cynomolgus macaque) blastocysts8, a human stem cell-based post-implantation amniotic sac embryoid (PASE) model9, and an in vivo gastrulation-stage human embryo specimen10, using four different analysis strategies. Our analyses unequivocally support that blastoids developed by reprogramming adult human somatic cells largely fail to generate cells with a transcriptome profile consistent with the human blastocyst trophectoderm. Instead, cells identified as trophectoderm-like have a transcriptional profile more similar to the amniotic ectoderm in the gastrulating human and NHP embryos. To facilitate cell lineage identifications in human embryo models, we further identified a set of human amniotic ectoderm and trophectoderm markers that could be utilized to distinguish these two lineages. We further built a neural-network based online prediction tool, which accurately discerns the full cellular composition of blastoids.",

We found that commonly used methods to evaluate selective constraint at the gene level are highly sensitive to genes under heterozygous selection but ubiquitously fail to detect recessively evolving genes. Additionally, more sophisticated likelihood-based methods designed to detect recessivity similarly lack power for a human gene of realistic length from current population sample sizes. However, extensive simulations suggested that recessive genes may be detectable in aggregate. Here, we offer a method informed by population genetics simulations designed to detect recessive purifying selection in gene sets. Applying this to empirical gene sets produced significant enrichments for strong recessive selection in genes previously inferred to be under recessive selection in a consanguineous cohort and in genes involved in autosomal recessive monogenic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional genome structure and dynamics play critical roles in regulating DNA functions. Flexible chromatin structure and movements suggested that the genome is dynamically phase-separated to form A (active) and B (inactive) compartments in interphase nuclei. Here, we examined this hypothesis by developing a polymer model of the whole genome of human cells and assessing the impact of phase separation on genome structure. Upon entry to the G1 phase, the simulated genome expanded according to heterogeneous repulsion among chromatin chains, which moved chromatin heterogeneously, inducing phase separation of chromatin. This repulsion-driven phase separation quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed chromatin domains, A/B compartments, lamina-associated domains, and nucleolus-associated domains, consistently explaining nuclei of different human cells and predicting their dynamic fluctuations. We propose that phase separation induced by heterogeneous repulsive interactions among chromatin chains largely determines dynamic genome organization.\n\nSignificanceDNA functions in living cells are crucially affected by the three-dimensional genome structure and dynamics. We analyzed the whole genome of human cells by developing a polymer model of interphase nuclei. The model revealed the essential importance of the unfolding process of chromosomes from the condensed mitotic state for describing the interphase nuclei; through the unfolding process, heterogeneous repulsive interactions among chromatin chains induced phase separation of chromatin, which quantitatively explains the experimentally observed various genomic data. We can use this model structure as a platform to analyze the relationship among genome structure, dynamics, and functions.",
