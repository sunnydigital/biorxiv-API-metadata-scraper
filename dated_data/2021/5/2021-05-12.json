    "abstract": "Human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as the major cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The viral spike (S) protein is required for attachment to ACE2 and subsequent virus-host cell membrane fusion. Previous work has demonstrated the presence of N-linked glycans in ACE2. N-glycosylation is implicated in many biological activities, including protein folding, protein activity, and cell surface expression of biomolecules. However, the contribution of N-glycosylation to ACE2 function is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of N-glycosylation in the activity and localization of two species with different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, porcine ACE2 (pACE2) and hACE2. The elimination of N-glycosylation by tunicamycin (TM) treatment or mutagenesis, showed that N-glycosylation is critical for the proper cell surface expression of ACE2 but not for its carboxiprotease activity. Furthermore, nonglycosylable ACE2 localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and not at the cell surface. Our data also revealed that binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein to porcine or human ACE2 was not affected by deglycosylation of ACE2 or S proteins, suggesting that N-glycosylation plays no role in the interaction between SARS coronaviruses and the ACE2 receptor. Impairment of hACE2 N-glycosylation decreased cell to cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV S protein but not SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Finally, we found that hACE2 N-glycosylation is required for an efficient viral entry of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses, which could be the result of low cell surface expression of the deglycosylated ACE2 receptor.\n\nImportanceElucidating the role of glycosylation in the virus-receptor interaction is important for the development of approaches that disrupt infection. In this study, we show that deglycosylation of both ACE2 and S had a minimal effect on the Spike-ACE2 interaction. In addition, we found that removal of N-glycans of ACE2 impaired its ability to support an efficient transduction of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses. Our data suggest that the role of deglycosylation of ACE2 on reducing infection is likely due to a reduced expression of the viral receptor on the cell surface. These findings offer insight into the glycan structure and function of ACE2, and potentially suggest that future antiviral therapies against coronaviruses and other coronavirus-related illnesses involving inhibition of ACE2 recruitment to the cell membrane could be developed.",

    "abstract": "Efficient immune-responses require migrating leukocytes to be in the right place at the right time. When crawling through the body amoeboid leukocytes must traverse complex three-dimensional tissue-landscapes obstructed by extracellular matrix and other cells, raising the question how motile cells adapt to mechanical loads to overcome these obstacles. Here we reveal the spatio-temporal configuration of cortical actin-networks rendering amoeboid cells mechanosensitive in three-dimensions, independent of adhesive interactions with the microenvironment. In response to compression, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrom protein (WASp) assembles into dot-like structures acting as nucleation sites for actin spikes that in turn push against the external load. High precision targeting of WASp to objects as delicate as collagen fibers allows the cell to locally and instantaneously deform its viscoelastic surrounding in order to generate space for forward locomotion. Such pushing forces are essential for fast and directed leukocyte migration in fibrous and cell-packed tissues such as skin and lymph nodes.\n\nIn BriefWASp-driven actin spikes counter compressive loads of crowded tissue-landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening with downstream activation of mechanosensitive pathways is strongly implicated in fibrosis. We previously reported that altered collagen nanoarchitecture is a key determinant of pathogenetic ECM structure-function in human fibrosis (Jones et al., 2018). Here, through human tissue, bioinformatic and ex vivo studies we show that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway activation is a critical pathway for this process regardless of oxygen status (pseudohypoxia). Whilst TGF{beta} increased rate of fibrillar collagen synthesis, HIF pathway activation was required to dysregulate post-translational modification of fibrillar collagen, promoting  bone-type cross-linking, altering collagen nanostructure, and increasing tissue stiffness. In vitro, knock down of Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH) or oxidative stress caused pseudohypoxic HIF activation in normal fibroblasts. In contrast, endogenous FIH activity was reduced in fibroblasts from patients with lung fibrosis in association with significantly increased normoxic HIF pathway activation. In human lung fibrosis tissue, HIF mediated signalling was increased at sites of active fibrogenesis whilst subpopulations of IPF lung mesenchymal cells had increases in both HIF and oxidative stress scores. Our data demonstrate that oxidative stress can drive pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation which is a critical regulator of pathogenetic collagen structure-function in fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic cytoskeleton plays essential roles in cell signaling and trafficking, which is broadly associated with immunity and diseases of human and plants. To date, most analyses aiming at defining the temporal and spatial dynamics of the cytoskeleton have relied on qualitative and quantitative analysis of fluorescence images to describe cytoskeletal function. While state-of-the-art, these approaches have limitations: the diverse shape and brightness of the cytoskeleton cause considerable inaccuracy in both human-driven and automated approaches, and the widely adopted image projection process (3D to 2D) leads to bias and information loss. Here, we describe the development and application of Implicit Laplacian of Enhanced Edge (ILEE), an unguided approach that uses a 2D/3D-compatible local thresholding algorithm for the quantitative evaluation of cytoskeletal status and organization at high performance. Using ILEE, we constructed a Python library to enable automated cytoskeletal image analysis, providing numerous biologically-interpretable indices measuring the density, bundling, severing, branching, and directionality of the cytoskeleton. The data presented herein demonstrate that ILEE resolves the defects of classic cytoskeleton analysis approaches, enables the measurement of novel cytoskeletal features, and yields quantitatively descriptive data with superior accuracy, stability, and robustness. We released the ILEE algorithm as an open-source library and further developed a Google Colab interface as a community resource.",

    "abstract": "Morphogen gradients are known to subdivide a naive cell field into distinct zones of gene expression. Here we examine whether morphogens can also induce a graded response within such domains. To this end we explore the role of the Dorsal protein nuclear gradient along the dorso-ventral axis in defining the graded pattern of actomyosin constriction that initiates gastrulation in early Drosophila embryos. Two complementary mechanisms for graded accumulation of mRNAs of critical zygotic target genes were identified. First, activation of target-gene expression expands over time from the ventral-most region of high nuclear Dorsal to lateral regions where the levels are lower, due to a Dorsal-dependent priming probability of transcription sites. Thus, sites that are activated earlier will lead to more mRNA accumulation. Second, once the sites are primed, the rate of Pol II loading is also dependent on Dorsal levels. Morphological restrictions require that translation of the graded mRNA be delayed until completion of embryonic cell formation. Such timing is achieved by large introns, that provide a delay in production of the mature mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) can prioritize trait-associated genes by finding correlations between a trait and the genetically regulated component of gene expression. A basic ingredient of a TWAS is a regression model, typically trained in an external reference data set, used to impute the genetically-regulated expression. We devised a model that improves the accuracy of the imputation by using, as predictors, not the genotypes directly but rather the sequence composition of the proximal gene regulatory region, expressed as its profile of affinities for a set of position weight matrices. When trained on 48 tissues from GTEx, the regression model showed improved performance compared with models regressing expression directly on the genotype. We imputed the expression levels in genotyped individuals from the ADNI data set, and used the imputed expression to perform a TWAS. We also developed a method to perform the TWAS based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies, and applied it to 11 complex traits from the UK Biobank. The greater accuracy in the prediction of gene expression allowed us to report hundreds of new gene-phenotype association candidates.",

    "abstract": "The detection and processing of noxious sensory input depends on the proper growth and function of nociceptor sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. In Drosophila melanogaster, the class IV (cIV) multidendritic dendritic arborization (md-da) neurons detect noxious stimuli through their highly branched dendrites that innervate the epidermis of the larval body wall. Here, we describe requirements of a previously uncharacterized gene named smoke alarm (smal), a discoidin domain receptor, in cIV md-da dendrite morphogenesis and nociception behavior. We find that smal mutant larvae exhibit thermal hyperalgesia that is fully rescued with a BAC transgene containing smal. Consistent with this phenotype, a smal reporter gene was expressed in nociceptors and other peripheral sensory neurons. Smal::GFP protein localized to punctate structures throughout the cIV md-da neurons. We further show that smal loss-of-function results in reduced nociceptor dendrite branching. Interestingly, mammalian homologues of smal act as collagen receptors, and we find that smal mutant dendrites showed an increase in epidermal cell ensheathment relative to animals that are wild type for smal. Based on this phenotype we propose that Smal protein function is required for attachment of dendrites to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the loss of this activity results in thermal hyperalgesia.",

    "abstract": "While mRNA vaccines are proving highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to determine how booster doses and prior infection influence the immune defense they elicit, and whether they protect against variants. Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naive and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naive individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naive vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naive counterparts.",

MAC pores assemble by stepwise binding of C5b, C6, C7, C8 and finally C9, which can polymerize into a transmembrane ring of up to 18 C9 monomers. It is still unclear if the assembly of a polymeric-C9 ring is necessary to sufficiently damage the bacterial cell envelope to kill bacteria, because a robust way to specifically prevent polymerization of C9 has been lacking. In this paper, polymerization of C9 was prevented without affecting the binding of C9 to C5b-8 by locking the first transmembrane helix domain of C9. We show that polymerization of C9 strongly enhanced bacterial cell envelope damage and killing by MAC pores for several Escherichia coli and Klebsiella strains. Moreover, we show that polymerization of C9 is impaired on complement-resistant E. coli strains that survive killing by MAC pores. Altogether, these insights are important to understand how MAC pores kill bacteria and how bacterial pathogens can resist MAC-dependent killing.",

Surprisingly, we also identified 21 autosomal regions that had dramatically delayed replication in haploids, extending beyond the normal S phase and into G2/M. Haploid-delays comprised a unique set of quiescent genomic regions that are also under-replicated in polyploid placental cells.

However, there is also considerable discordance of changes in gene expression between species and across all models, indicating that the relevance of biological mechanisms of interest in each model should be assessed before conducting experiments. Our data will aid selection of appropriate models for translational malaria research, and the approach is generalizable to other disease models.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis is facilitated and regulated by numerous ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs). High-resolution cryo-EM maps have defined the molecular interactions of RBFs during maturation, but many transient and dynamic interactions, particularly during early assembly, remain uncharacterized. Using quantitative proteomics and crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry (XL-MS) data from a extensive set of pre-ribosomal particles, we derived a comprehensive and time-resolved interaction map of RBF engagement during 60S maturation. A novel filter that efficiently eliminates false positive interactions and integration of our MS data with known structural information allowed us to localize 22 unmapped RBFs to specific biogenesis intermediates and to identify 9 proteins that represent potentially new RBFs. Our analysis reveals an extensive interaction network for the casein kinase complex in 60S maturation and elucidates the timing and molecular function of 60S engagement by DEAD-box ATPases. Our data provide a powerful resource for future studies of 60S ribosome biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "East Indian Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is highly valued for its heartwood and its oil. There have been no efforts to comparative study of high and low oil yielding genetically identical sandalwood trees grown in similar climatic condition. Thus we intend to study a genome wide transcriptome analysis to identify the corresponding genes involved in high oil biosynthesis in S. album. In this study, 15 years old S. album (SaSHc and SaSLc) genotypes were targeted for analysis to understand the contribution of genetic background on high oil biosynthesis in S. album. A total of 28,959187 and 25,598869 raw PE reads were generated by the Illumina sequencing. 2.12 million and 1.811 million coding sequences were obtained in respective accessions. Based on the GO terms, functional classification of the CDS 21262, & 18113 were assigned into 26 functional groups of three GO categories; (4,168; 3,641) for biological process (5,758;4,971) cellular component and (5,108;4,441) for molecular functions. Total 41,900 and 36,571 genes were functionally annotated and KEGG pathways of the DEGs resulted 213 metabolic pathways. In this, 14 pathways were involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis pathway in S. album. Among 237 cytochrome families, nine groups of cytochromes were participated in high oil biosynthesis. 16,665 differentially expressed genes were commonly detected in both the accessions (SaHc and SaSLc). The results showed that 784 genes were upregulated and 339 genes were downregulated in SaHc whilst 635 upregulated 299 downregulated in SaSLc S. album. RNA-Seq results were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Maximum Blast hits were found to be against Vitis vinifera. From this study we have identified additional number of cytochrome family in SaHc. The accessibility of a RNA-Seq for high oil yielding sandalwood accessions will have broader associations for the conservation and selection of superior elite samples/populations for further genetic improvement program.",

    "abstract": "One of the most difficult challenges in cancer therapy is the emergence of drug resistance within tumors. Sometimes drug resistance can emerge as the result of mutations and Darwinian selection. However, recently another phenomenon has been discovered, in which tumor cells switch back and forth between drug-sensitive and pre-resistant states. Upon exposure to the drug, sensitive cells die off, and pre-resistant cells become locked in to a state of permanent drug resistance. In this paper, we explore the implications of this transient state switching for therapy scheduling. We propose a model to describe the phenomenon and estimate parameters from experimental melanoma data. We then compare the performance of continuous and alternating drug schedules, and use sensitivity analysis to explore how different conditions affect the efficacy of each schedule. We find that for our estimated parameters, a continuous therapy schedule is optimal. However we also find that an alternating schedule can be optimal for other, hypothetical parameter sets, depending on the difference in growth rate between pre-drug and post-drug cells, the delay between exposure to the drug and emergence of resistance, and the rate at which pre-resistant cells become resistant relative to the rate at which they switch back to the sensitive state.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith a growing amount of (multi-)omics data being available, the extraction of knowledge from these datasets is still a difficult problem. Classical enrichment-style analyses require predefined pathways or gene sets that are tested for significant deregulation to assess whether the pathway is functionally involved in the biological process under study. De novo identification of these pathways can reduce the bias inherent in predefined pathways or gene sets. At the same time, the definition and efficient identification of these pathways de novo from large biological networks is a challenging problem.\n\nResultsWe present a novel algorithm, DeRegNet, for the identification of maximally deregulated subnetworks on directed graphs based on deregulation scores derived from (multi-)omics data. DeRegNet can be interpreted as maximum likelihood estimation given a certain probabilistic model for de-novo subgraph identification. We use fractional integer programming to solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We can show that the approach outperforms related algorithms on simulated data with known ground truths. On a publicly available liver cancer dataset we can show that DeRegNet can identify biologically meaningful subgraphs suitable for patient stratification. DeRegNet is freely available as open-source software.\n\nConclusionThe proposed algorithmic framework and its available implementation can serve as a valuable heuristic hypothesis generation tool contextualizing omics data within biomolecular networks.",

    "abstract": "Hemorrhagic disease (HD) caused by a group of elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses (EEHV) is one of the leading causes of death for young elephants in human care. These viruses are widespread and typically persist latently in adult elephants with no negative effects; however, in juvenile Asian and more recently young African elephants, the onset of disease can be rapid and the mortality rate high. Measuring biomarkers associated with the immune response could be beneficial to understanding underlying disease processes, as well as the management of infection and HD. The goal of this study was to measure acute phase proteins and cytokines in serum collected from elephants infected with EEHV (13 Asian and 1 African) and compare concentrations according to presence, severity and outcome of disease. Serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (HP) were higher in elephants with EEHV viremia than those without; concentrations increased with increasing viral load, and were higher in fatal cases compared to those that survived. In Asian elephants, SAA was also higher during EEHV1 viremia compared to EEHV5. Cytokine concentrations were typically low, and no statistical differences existed between groups, perhaps due to insufficient assay sensitivity in this age group. However, in individuals with detectable levels, longitudinal profiles indicated changes in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) that may reflect an immune response to EEHV infection. These results highlight the potential benefit of measuring circulating biomarker concentrations, such as APPs and cytokines, to improve our understanding of EEHV viremia and HD, assist with monitoring the progression of disease and determining the impact of interventions.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes that can decompose synthetic plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are urgently needed. However, a bottleneck remains due to a lack of techniques for detecting and sorting environmental microorganisms with vast diversity and abundance. Here, we developed a fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) pipeline for high-throughput screening of PET-degrading microorganisms or enzymes (PETases). The pipeline comprises three steps: generation and incubation of droplets encapsulating single cells, picoinjection of fluorescein dibenzoate (FDBz) as the fluorogenic probe, and screening of droplets to obtain PET-degrading cells. We characterized critical factors associated with this method, including specificity and sensitivity for discriminating PETase from other enzymes. We then optimized its performance and compatibility with environmental samples. The system was used to screen a wastewater sample from a PET textile mill. We successfully obtained PET-degrading species from nine different genera. Moreover, two putative PETases from isolates Kineococcus endophyticus Un-5 and Staphylococcus epidermidis Un-C2-8 were genetically derived, heterologously expressed, and preliminarily validated for PET-degrading activities. We speculate that the FADS pipeline can be widely adopted to discover new PET-degrading microorganisms and enzymes in various environments and may be utilized in the directed evolution of PETases using synthetic biology.",

Results showed that Support Vector Machine Regressor slightly outperformed other models. The evaluation with a test dataset and verification with an independent validation dataset for chlorophyll-a concentrations showed a good generalization capacity, evaluated by the root mean squared errors of less than 1 g L-1. Feature selection and engineering are important and improved the models significantly, as measured in performance, improving by a minimum of 48% the adjusted R2. We tested SARIMA in comparison and found that the univariate nature of SARIMA does not allow for better results than the Machine Learning models.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) that occurs on promoter regions is primarily considered to repress gene expression. Previous studies indicated that DNAm could also show positive correlations with gene expression. Both DNAm and gene expression profiles are known to be tissue- and development-specific. This study aims to investigate how DNAm and gene expression are coordinated across different human tissues and developmental stages, as well as the biological significance of such correlations. By analyzing 2,239 samples with both DNAm and gene expression data in the same human subjects obtained from six published datasets, we evaluated the correlations between gene and CpG pairs (GCPs) at cis-regions and compared significantly correlated GCPs (cGCPs) across different tissues and brains at different age groups. A total of 37,363 cGCPs were identified in the six datasets; approximately 38% of the cGCPs were positively correlated. The majority (>90%) of cGCPs were tissue- or development-specific. We also observed that the correlation direction can be opposite in different tissues and ages. Further analysis highlighted the importance of cGCPs for their cellular functions and potential roles in complex traits and human diseases. For instance, early developmental brain possessed a highly unique set of cGCPs that were associated with neurogenesis and psychiatric disorders. By assessing the epigenetic factors involved in cGCPs, we discovered novel regulatory mechanisms of positive cGCPs distinct from negative cGCPs, which were related to multiple factors, such as H3K27me3, CTCF, and JARD2. The catalog of cGCPs compiled can be used to guide functional interpretation of genetic and epigenetic studies.",
