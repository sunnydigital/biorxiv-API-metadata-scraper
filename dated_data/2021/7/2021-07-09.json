    "abstract": "MotivationMetabolomics is an increasingly common part of health research and there is need for pre-analytical data processing. Researchers typically need to characterize the data and to exclude errors within the context of the intended analysis. While some pre-processing steps are common, there is currently a lack of standardization and reporting transparency for these procedures.\n\nResultsHere we introduce metaboprep, a standardized data processing workflow to extract and characterize high quality metabolomics data sets. The package extracts data from pre-formed worksheets, provides summary statistics and enables the user to select samples and metabolites for their analysis based on a set of quality metrics. A report summarizing quality metrics and the influence of available batch variables on the data is generated for the purpose of open disclosure. Where possible, we provide users flexibility in defining their own selection thresholds.\n\nAvailability and implementationmetaboprep is an open-source R package available at https://github.com/MRCIEU/metaboprep\n\nContactd.a.hughes@bristol.ac.uk or laura.corbin@bristol.ac.uk",

In this study, we examine conditions under which one may or may not observe forward entrainment. In part 1, we review and evaluate studies that have observed forward entrainment using a variety of psychophysical methods (detection, discrimination and reaction times), different target stimuli (tones, noise, gaps), different entraining sequences (sinusoidal, rectangular or sawtooth waveforms), a variety of physiological measures (MEG, EEG, ECoG, CSD), in different modalities (auditory and visual), across modalities (audiovisual and auditory-motor), and in different species. In part 2, we review those studies that have failed to observe forward entrainment, with emphasis on evaluating the methodological and stimulus design differences that may clarify the contrasting findings across these two classes of studies. In part 3, we describe those experimental conditions under which we ourselves have failed to observe forward entrainment, and provide new data on use of complex envelope patterns as entraining stimuli, show data on intersubject variability, and provide new findings on psychometric functions that characterize the strength of forward entrainment at different SNRs. In part 4 we theorize on potential mechanisms, describe how neurophysiological and psychophysical studies approach the study of entrainment, and caution against drawing direct causal inferences between the two without compelling evidence beyond correlative measures.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of tau proteins into insoluble filaments and the spread of these filaments across brain regions are the major drivers of neurodegeneration in tauopathies, including in Alzheimers disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a crucial genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, has been shown to exacerbate tau pathology in mouse models. However, the exact mechanisms through which APOE4 induces tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we report that the astrocyte-secreted protein glypican-4 (GPC-4), which we identify as a novel binding partner of APOE4, drives tau pathology. We discovered that GPC-4 preferentially interacts with APOE4 in comparison to APOE2, considered to be a protective allele to AD, and post-mortem APOE4-carrying AD brains highly express GPC-4 in neurotoxic astrocytes. The astrocyte-secreted GPC-4 induced both tau accumulation and propagation in vitro. CRISPR/dCas9 mediated activation of GPC-4 in a tauopathy mouse model robustly induced tau pathology. Using in vitro Tau FRET-biosensor cells, human iPSCs-derived astrocytes and an in vivo mouse model, we found that APOE4-induced tau pathology was greatly diminished in the absence of GPC-4. We further show that APOE4-mediated surface trafficking of APOE receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) through GPC-4 can be a gateway to tau spreading. Together, our data comprehensively demonstrate that APOE4-induced tau pathologies are directly mediated by GPC-4.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed genetic modules typically featuring toxins that can inhibit bacterial growth and antitoxins that can reverse inhibition. Although Escherichia coli encodes 11 toxins with known or putative endoribonuclease activity, the target of most of these toxins remain poorly characterized. Using a new RNA-seq pipeline that enables the mapping and quantification of RNA cleavage with single-nucleotide resolution, we characterize the targets and specificities of 9 endoribonuclease toxins from E. coli. We find that these toxins use low-information cleavage motifs to cut a significant proportion of mRNAs in E. coli, but not tRNAs or the rRNAs from mature ribosomes. However, all the toxins, including those that are ribosome-dependent and cleave only translated RNA, inhibit ribosome biogenesis. This inhibition likely results from the cleavage of ribosomal protein transcripts, which disrupts the stoichiometry and biogenesis of new ribosomes and causes the accumulation of aberrant ribosome precursors. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive, global analysis of endoribonuclease-based toxin-antitoxin systems in E. coli and support the conclusion that, despite their diversity, each disrupts translation and ribosome biogenesis.\n\nImportanceToxin-antitoxin systems are widespread genetic modules found in almost all bacteria that can regulate their growth and may play prominent roles in phage defense. Escherichia coli encodes 11 TA systems in which the toxin is a known or predicted endoribonuclease. The targets and cleavage specificities of these endoribonucleases have remained largely uncharacerized, precluding an understanding of how each impacts cell growth and an assessment of whether they have distinct or overlapping targets. Using a new and broadly applicable RNA-seq pipeline, we present a global analysis of 9 endoribonulease toxins from E. coli. We find that each uses a relatively low-information cleavage motif to cut a large proportion of mRNAs in E. coli, but not tRNAs or mature rRNAs. Notably, although the precise set of targets varies, each toxin efficiently disrupts ribosome biogenesis, primarily by cleaving the mRNAs of ribosomal proteins. In sum, the analyses presented provide new, comprehensive insights into the cleavage specificities and targets of almost all endoribonuclease toxins in E. coli. Despite different specificities, our work reveals a striking commonality in function as each toxin disrupts ribosome biogenesis and translation.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can be difficult to treat and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Bacteriophage therapy is a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, but large numbers of isolated and characterized phages are lacking. We collected 23 genetically and phenotypically diverse P. aeruginosa isolates from people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and clinical infections, and characterized their genetic, phenotypic, and prophage diversity. We then used these isolates to screen and isolate 14 new P. aeruginosa-targeting phages from hospital wastewater. Phages were characterized with genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and lytic activity screening against all 23 bacterial host isolates. For four different phages, we evolved bacterial mutants that were resistant to phage infection. We then used genome sequencing and functional analysis of the resistant mutants to study their mechanisms of phage resistance as well as changes in virulence factor production and antibiotic resistance, which differed from corresponding parent bacterial isolates. Finally, we tested two phages for their ability to kill P. aeruginosa grown in biofilms in vitro, and observed that both phages reduced viable bacteria in biofilms by least one order of magnitude. One of these phages also showed activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms grown on CF airway epithelial cells. Overall, this study demonstrates how systematic genomic and phenotypic characterization can be deployed to develop bacteriophages as precision antibiotics.",

Such phage-based therapeutics typically contain multiple phages, but how the efficacy of phage combinations scales with phage richness, identity and functional traits is unclear. Here, we experimentally tested the efficacy of 827 unique phage combinations ranging in phage richness from 1 to 12 phages. The efficacy of phage combinations increased with phage richness. However, complementarity between functionally diverse phages allowed efficacy to be maximised at lower levels of phage richness in functionally diverse combinations. These findings suggest that phage functional diversity is the key property of effective phage combinations, enabling the design of simple but effective phage therapies that overcome the practical and regulatory hurdles that limit development of more diverse phage therapy cocktails.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a fundamental eukaryotic process that mediates clearance of unwanted molecules and facilitates nutrient release. The bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila establishes an intracellular niche within phagocytes by manipulating host cellular processes, such as autophagy. Effector proteins translocated by L. pneumophilas Dot/Icm type IV secretion system have been shown to suppress autophagy. However evidence suggests that overall inhibition of autophagy may be detrimental to the bacterium. As autophagy contributes to cellular homeostasis and nutrient acquisition, L. pneumophila may translocate effectors that promote autophagy for these benefits. Here, we show that effector protein Lpg2411 binds phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate lipids and preferentially binds autophagosomes. Translocated Lpg2411 accumulates late during infection and co-localizes with the autophagy receptor p62 and ubiquitin. Furthermore, autophagy is inhibited to a greater extent in host cells infected with a mutant strain lacking Lpg2411 compared to those infected with wild-type L. pneumophila, indicating that Lpg2411 stimulates autophagy to support the bacteriums intracellular lifestyle.\n\nSummaryLegionella pneumophila translocates several effector proteins that inhibit autophagic processes. In this study, we find that the effector protein Lpg2411 targets autophagosomes during late stages of infection and promotes autophagy.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of biological nitrogen fixation, uniquely catalyzed by nitrogenase enzymes, has been one of the most consequential biogeochemical innovations over lifes history. Though understanding the early evolution of nitrogen fixation has been a longstanding goal from molecular, biogeochemical, and planetary perspectives, its origins remain enigmatic. In this study, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of nitrogenases, as well as homologous maturase proteins that participate in the assembly of the nitrogenase active-site cofactor but are not able to fix nitrogen. We combined phylogenetic and ancestral sequence inference with an analysis of predicted functionally divergent sites between nitrogenases and maturases to infer the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of their shared ancestors. Our results provide phylogenetic constraints to the emergence of nitrogen fixation and are consistent with a model wherein nitrogenases emerged from maturase-like predecessors. Though the precise functional role of such a predecessor protein remains speculative, our results highlight evolutionary contingency as a significant factor shaping the evolution of a biogeochemically essential enzyme.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe origin of nitrogenase-catalyzed nitrogen fixation was a transformative event in lifes history, garnering long-term study from molecular, biogeochemical, and planetary perspectives. Reconstruction of ancestral nitrogenases suggests that the protein sequence space capable of yielding a nitrogen-fixing enzyme in the past was likely more constrained than previously thought. Specifically, here we show that nitrogenases likely evolved from ancestors that resemble maturases, homologs that today participate in nitrogenase cofactor assembly, contrary to the commonly accepted view that maturases evolved from a nitrogenase ancestor. We further submit that the molecular architecture that may have been required for nitrogenase origins was unlikely to have been shaped by the same environmental drivers often implicated in the evolution of nitrogen fixation. If this decoupling is found to be a recurring pattern in metabolic origins, then the presented results would undercut the common, systems-focused rationale of using ancient environmental conditions to explain the timing of critical and singular biogeochemical innovations in lifes past.",

    "abstract": "Species interactions drive evolution while evolution shapes these interactions. The resulting eco-evolutionary dynamics, their outcomes and their repeatability depend on how adaptive mutations available to community members affect fitness and ecologically relevant traits. However, the diversity of adaptive mutations is not well characterized, and we do not know how this diversity is affected by the ecological milieu. Here we use barcode lineage tracking to address this gap in a competitive mutualism between the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We find that yeast has access to many adaptive mutations with diverse ecological consequences, in particular, those that increase and reduce the yields of both species. The presence of the alga does not change which mutations are adaptive in yeast (i.e., there is no fitness trade-off for yeast between growing alone or with alga), but rather shifts selection to favor yeast mutants that increase the yields of both species and make the mutualism stronger. Thus, in the presence of the alga, adaptations contending for fixation in yeast are more likely to enhance the mutualism, even though cooperativity is not directly favored by natural selection in our system. Our results demonstrate that ecological interactions not only alter the trajectory of evolution but also dictate its repeatability; in particular, weak mutualisms can repeatably evolve to become stronger.",

Deconvolving these effects is a key challenge for preprocessing workflows. Recent work has demonstrated the importance and utility of count models for scRNA-seq analysis, but there is a lack of consensus on which statistical distributions and parameter settings are appropriate. Here, we analyze 58 scRNA-seq datasets that span a wide range of technologies, systems, and sequencing depths in order to evaluate the performance of different error models. We find that while a Poisson error model appears appropriate for sparse datasets, we observe clear evidence of overdispersion for genes with sufficient sequencing depth in all biological systems, necessitating the use of a negative binomial model. Moreover, we find that the degree of overdispersion varies widely across datasets, systems, and gene abundances, and argues for a data-driven approach for parameter estimation. Based on these analyses, we provide a set of recommendations for modeling variation in scRNA-seq data, particularly when using generalized linear models or likelihood-based approaches for preprocessing and downstream analysis.",

We leveraged the advantage of long read sequencing to develop a method \"BIND&MODIFY\" for profiling the histone modification of individual DNA fibers. Our approach is based on the recombinant fused protein A-M.EcoGII, which tethers the methyltransferase M.EcoGII to the protein binding sites and locally labels the neighboring DNA regions through artificial methylations.

Accurate mapping of chromatin accessibility from FFPE specimens is challenging because of the high degree of DNA damage. Here, we first showed that standard ATAC-seq can be applied to purified FFPE nuclei but yields lower library complexity and a smaller proportion of long DNA fragments. We then present FFPE-ATAC, the first highly sensitive method for decoding chromatin accessibility in FFPE tissues that combines Tn5-mediated transposition and T7 in vitro transcription. The FFPE-ATAC generates high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles with 500 nuclei from a single FFPE tissue section, enables the dissection of chromatin profiles from the regions of interest with the aid of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and reveals disease-associated chromatin regulation from the human colorectal cancer FFPE tissue archived for more than 10 years. In summary, the approach allows decoding of the chromatin states that regulate gene expression in archival FFPE tissues, thereby permitting investigators, to better understand epigenetic regulation in cancer and precision medicine.",

We analysed longitudinal human DNA methylation trajectories at 345,895 CpGs from 600 individuals aged between 67 and 80 to understand the factors responsible for age-associated epigenetic changes at individual CpGs in the genome. We show that changes in methylation with age are especially apparent at 8,322 low CpG density loci. Using SNP data from the same individuals we demonstrate that DNA methylation trajectories are affected by local sequence polymorphisms at 1,487 loci with low CpG density. More generally, we find that local CpG density is a strong determinant of a CpGs methylation trajectory and that CpGs located in low CpG density regions are particularly prone to change. Overall, our results demonstrate that local DNA sequence influences age-associated DNA methylation changes in humans in vivo. We suggest that this occurs because interactions between CpGs reinforce maintenance of methylation patterns in CpG dense regions.",

    "abstract": "Nicotine and cannabis are two of the most commonly consumed licit and illicit drugs during pregnancy, often consumed together via e-cigarettes. Vaping is assumed to be a safer alternative than traditional routes of consumption, yet the potential consequences of prenatal e-cigarette exposure are largely unknown, particularly when these two drugs are co-consumed. In a novel co-exposure model, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received nicotine (36 mg/mL), THC (100 mg/mL), the combination, or the vehicle via e-cigarettes daily from gestational days 5-20, mimicking the first and second human trimesters. Maternal blood samples were collected throughout pregnancy to measure drug and metabolite levels, and core body temperatures before and after exposure were also measured. Pregnant dams exposed to combined nicotine and THC had lower plasma nicotine and cotinine levels than those exposed to nicotine alone; similarly, the combined exposure group also had lower plasma THC and THC metabolite (THC-OH and THC-COOH) levels than those exposed to THC alone. Prenatal nicotine exposure gradually decreased basal core body temperatures each day, with chronic exposure, whereas exposure to THC alone decreased temperatures during the individual sessions. Despite these physiological effects, no changes were observed in food or water intake, weight gain, or basic litter outcomes. These data suggest that combined exposure to nicotine and THC elicits both separate and interactive physiological effects of nicotine and THC on pregnant dams. These data and use of this model can help improve education for pregnant mothers about prenatal e-cigarette use and has important implications for public policy.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIRepeated prenatal nicotine exposure via e-cigarettes gradually decreased temperatures\nC_LIO_LIPrenatal THC exposure via e-cigarettes decreased temperatures during intoxication\nC_LIO_LICombined prenatal exposure via e-cigarettes altered plasma drug and metabolite levels\nC_LIO_LIThis co-exposure model elicits separate and interactive effects of nicotine and THC\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThis paper proposes machine learning models for mapping surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to regression of joint angle, joint velocity, joint acceleration, joint torque, and activation torque.\n\nApproachThe regression models, collectively known as MuscleNET, take one of four forms: ANN (Forward Artificial Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and RCNN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network). Inspired by conventional biomechanical muscle models, delayed kinematic signals were used along with sEMG signals as the machine learning models input; specifically, the CNN and RCNN were modeled with novel configurations for these input conditions. The models inputs contain either raw or filtered sEMG signals, which allowed evaluation of the filtering capabilities of the models. The models were trained using human experimental data and evaluated with different individual data.\n\nMain resultsResults were compared in terms of regression error (using the root-mean-square) and model computation delay. The results indicate that the RNN (with filtered sEMG signals) and RCNN (with raw sEMG signals) models, both with delayed kinematic data, can extract underlying motor control information (such as joint activation torque or joint angle) from sEMG signals in pick-and-place tasks. The CNNs and RCNNs were able to filter raw sEMG signals.\n\nSignificanceAll forms of MuscleNET were found to map sEMG signals within 2 ms, fast enough for real-time applications such as the control of exoskeletons or active prostheses. The RNN model with filtered sEMG and delayed kinematic signals is particularly appropriate for applications in musculoskeletal simulation and biomechatronic device control.",

    "abstract": "Understanding brain functions as an outcome of underlying neuro-cognitive network mechanisms in rest and task requires accurate spatiotemporal characterization of the relevant functional brain networks. Recent endeavours of the Neuroimaging community to develop the notion of dynamic functional connectivity is a step in this direction. A key goal is to detect what are the important events in time that delimits how one functional brain network defined by known patterns of correlated brain activity transitions into a \"new\" network. Such characterization can also lead to more accurate conceptual realization of brain states, thereby, defined in terms of time-resolved correlations. Nonetheless, identifying the canonical temporal window over which dynamic functional connectivity is operational is currently based on an ad-hoc selection of sliding windows that can certainly lead to spurious results. Here, we introduce a data-driven unsupervised approach to characterize the high dimensional dynamic functional connectivity into dynamics of lower dimensional patterns. The whole-brain dynamic functional connectivity states bearing functional significance for task or rest can be explored through the temporal correlations, both short and long range. The present study investigates the stability of such short- and long-range temporal correlations to explore the dynamic network mechanisms across resting state, movie viewing and sensorimotor action tasks requiring varied degrees of attention. As an outcome of applying our methods to the fMRI data of a healthy ageing cohort we could quantify whole-brain temporal dynamics which indicates naturalistic movie watching task is closer to resting state than the sensorimotor task. Our analysis also revealed an overall trend of highest short range temporal network stability in the sensorimotor task, followed by naturalistic movie watching task and resting state that remains similar in both young and old adults. However, the stability of neurocognitive networks in the resting state in young adults is higher than their older counterparts. Thus, healthy ageing related differences in quantification of network stability along task and rest provides a blueprint of how our approach can be used for cohort studies of mental health and neurological disorders.",

It has been proposed that the motion/direction-sensitive neurons mainly target the superficial layers in V1, in contrast to the location-sensitive neurons which mainly target the middle layers. Here, by imaging calcium activities of motion/direction-sensitive and location-sensitive axons in V1, we find no evidence for these cell-type specific laminar biases at population level. Furthermore, using a novel approach to reconstruct single-axon structures with identified in vivo response types, we show that, at single-axon level, the motion/direction-sensitive axons have middle layer preferences and project more densely to the middle layers than the location-sensitive axons. Overall, our results demonstrate that Motion/direction-sensitive thalamic neurons project extensively to the middle layers of V1, challenging the current view of the thalamocortical organizations in the mouse visual system.",

    "abstract": "The ability to perform motor actions depends, in part, on the brains initial state, that is, the ensemble firing rate pattern prior to the initiation of action. We hypothesized that the same principle would apply to cognitive functions as well. To test this idea, we examined a unique set of single unit data collected in human dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) cortex. Data were collected in a conflict task that interleaves Simon (motor-type) and Eriksen (flanker-type) conflict trials. In dlPFC, variability in pre-trial firing rate predicted the ability to resolve conflict, as inferred from reaction times. Ensemble patterns that predicted faster Simon reaction times overlapped slightly with those predicting Erikson performance, indicating that the two conflict types are associated with near-orthogonal initial states, and suggesting that there is a weak abstract or amodal conflict preparatory state in this region. These codes became fully orthogonalized in the response state. We interpret these results in light of the initial state hypothesis, arguing that the firing patterns in dlPFC immediately preceding the start of a task predispose it for the efficient implementation of cognitive action.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the human connectome and understanding its relationship to brain function holds tremendous clinical potential. The connectome has two fundamental components: the nodes and the connections between them. While much attention has been given to deriving atlases and measuring the connections between nodes, there have been no studies examining the networks within nodes. Here we demonstrate that each node contains significant connectivity information, that varies systematically across task-induced states and subjects, such that measures based on these variations can be used to classify tasks and identify subjects. The results are not specific for any particular atlas but hold across different atlas resolutions. To date, studies examining changes in connectivity have focused on edge changes and assumed there is no useful information within nodes. Our findings illustrate that for typical atlases, within-node changes can be significant and may account for a substantial fraction of the variance currently attributed to edge changes.",

We find that iHAP1 directly blocks microtubule assembly both in vitro and in vivo and thus acts as a microtubule poison.

Although gene-specific approaches have already shown the deleterious effect of ALAN on the circadian clock, immunity and reproduction, large-scale transcriptomic approaches with ecologically relevant light levels are still lacking to assess the global impact of ALAN on biological processes. Moreover, studies have focused mainly on variations in gene expression during the night in the presence of ALAN but never during the day. In a controlled laboratory experiment, transcriptome sequencing of Bufo bufo tadpoles revealed that ALAN affected gene expression at both night and daytime with a dose-dependent effect and globally induced a downregulation of genes. ALAN effects were detected at very low levels of illuminance (0.1 lux) and affected mainly genes related to the innate immune system and, to a lesser extend to lipid metabolism. These results indicate that a broad range of physiological pathways is impacted at the molecular level by very low levels of ALAN potentially resulting in reduced survival under environmental immune challenges.",

    "abstract": "Demographic histories are largely understood to be a product of their environment, as populations expand or contract in response to major environmental changes. Deep-pelagic fishes inhabit one of the most temporally and spatially stable habitats on the planet, so they may be resistant to the demographic instability commonly reported in other marine habitats, but their demographic histories are poorly understood. We reconstructed the demographic histories of thirteen species of deep-pelagic fishes using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. We uncovered widespread evidence of demographic expansion in our study species, a counterintuitive result bases on the nature of the deep-pelagic. The frequency-based methods detected potential demographic changes in eleven species, while the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots were more conservative and identified population expansion in five species. The dates of expansion largely coincide with periods of warm sea-surface temperature at the northern and southern boundaries for the ranges these species inhabit. We suggest that this is the result of the pelagic larval phase shared by most deep-pelagic fishes, where the larvae inhabit the upper 200 meters. Changes in sea surface conditions likely alter the suitability of the habitat in a given region for the larval phase, affecting the species range and in turn population size. These results are critical to our understanding of how the deep-pelagic fish community will respond to future climatic changes.",

We show here that these dogmas are incorrect and apparently based on false assumptions. We note Chis wide-spread occurrence and activity in distantly related species. We illustrate multiple, highly non-random features of the genomes of coli and coliphage P1 that account for Chis high frequency and genomic position, leading us to propose that P1 selects for Chis enhancement of recombination, whereas E. coli selects for the preferred codons in Chi.

Here, we introduce its implementation with reflective mirror-based afocal telescopes, optimized for imaging light-induced retinal activity (optoretinography) and weak retinal reflections at the cellular scale. A non-planar optical design was followed based on previous recommendations with key differences specific to a line-scan geometry. The three beam paths fundamental to an OCT system - illumination/sample, detection, and reference - were modeled in Zemax optical design software to yield theoretically diffraction-limited performance over a 2.2 deg. field-of-view and 1.5 D vergence range at the eyes pupil. The performance for imaging retinal structure was exemplified by cellular-scale visualization of retinal ganglion cells, macrophages, foveal cones, and rods in human observers. The performance for functional imaging was exemplified by resolving the light-evoked optical changes in foveal cone photoreceptors where the spatial resolution was sufficient for cone spectral classification at an eccentricity 0.3 deg. from the foveal center. This enabled the first in vivo demonstration of reduced S-cone (short-wavelength cone) density in the human foveola, thus far observed only in ex vivo histological preparations. Together, the feasibility for high resolution imaging of retinal structure and function demonstrated here holds significant potential for basic science and translational applications.",

Despite several decades of effort, oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer remains difficult to treat, and our understanding of the positive and negative regulators of RAS signaling is incomplete. To uncover the functional impact of diverse KRAS-interacting proteins on lung cancer growth in vivo, we used multiplexed somatic CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in genetically engineered mouse models with tumor barcoding and high-throughput barcode sequencing. Through a series of CRISPR/Cas9 screens in autochthonous lung tumors, we identified HRAS and NRAS as key suppressors of KRASG12D-driven tumor growth in vivo and confirmed these effects in oncogenic KRAS-driven human lung cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, RAS paralogs interact with oncogenic KRAS, suppress KRAS-KRAS interactions, and reduce downstream ERK signaling. HRAS mutations identified in KRAS-driven human tumors partially abolished this effect. Comparison of the tumor-suppressive effects of HRAS and NRAS in KRAS- and BRAF-driven lung cancer models confirmed that RAS paralogs are specific suppressors of oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer in vivo. Our study outlines a technological avenue to uncover positive and negative regulators of oncogenic KRAS-driven cancer in a multiplexed manner in vivo and highlights the role of RAS paralog imbalance in oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer.",

These cells express the photopigment melanopsin and are known to be involved in reflexive visual functions such as pupil response and photo-entrainment of the circadian rhythm. It is possible that the ipRGCs contribute to conscious visual perception, either by providing an independent signal to the geniculo-striate pathway, or by interacting with and thus modifying signals arising from \"classical\" retinal ganglion cells that combine and contrast cone input. Here, we tested for the existence of an interaction by asking if a 350% change in melanopsin stimulation alters psychophysical sensitivity for the detection of luminance flicker. In Experiment 1, we tested for a change in the threshold for detecting luminance flicker in three participants after they adapted to backgrounds with different degrees of tonic melanopsin stimulation. In Experiments 2 and 3, this test was repeated, but now for luminance flicker presented on a transient pedestal of melanopsin stimulation.

    "abstract": "Sensory events appear reduced in intensity when we actively produce them. Here, we investigated sensory attenuation in a virtual reality setup that allowed us to manipulate the time of tactile feedback when pressing a virtual button. We asked whether tactile motor attention might shift to the tactile location that makes contact with the button. In experiment one, we found that a tactile impulse was perceived as more intense when button pressing. In a second experiment, participants pushed a button and estimated the intensity of sounds. We found sensory attenuation for sounds only when tactile feedback was provided at the time the movement goal was reached. These data indicate that attentional prioritization for the tactile modality during a goal-directed hand movement might lead to a transient reduction in sensitivity in other modalities, resulting in sensory attenuation for sounds.",

    "abstract": "Embodied cognition suggests that our bodily experiences broadly shape our cognitive capabilities. We study how embodied experience affects the abstract physical problem-solving strategies people use in a virtual task where embodiment does not affect action capabilities. We compare how groups with different embodied experience - 25 children and 35 adults with congenital limb differences versus 45 children and 40 adults born with two hands - perform this task, and find that while there is no difference in overall competence, the groups use different cognitive strategies to find solutions. People born with limb differences think more before acting, but take fewer attempts to reach solutions. Conversely, development affects the particular actions children use, as well as their persistence with their current strategy. Our findings suggest that while development alters action choices and persistence, differences in embodied experience drive strategic changes in the acquisition of cognitive strategies for balancing acting with thinking.\n\nStatement of RelevanceTheories of embodied cognition suggest our cognitive and perceptual capabilities are shaped by how our bodies constrain our interactions with the world; however, these tasks often study short-term effects or setups where body differences impact task solutions. Here we compare the performance of children and adults with and without congenital limb differences (missing hands/upper limbs) on a virtual physical problem-solving task, where both groups had equal motor capabilities for interacting with the world. Across ages, participants with limb differences solved these tasks as proficiently as those without limb differences, but took fewer attempts to come to solutions, with more time spent thinking between attempts. This suggests that early life differences in embodied experience cause changes in individuals \"cognitive strategies\" for allocating time between thinking and acting.",

    "abstract": "The histone methyltransferase SETD2 and its associated histone mark H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) are frequently lost in certain cancer types, identifying SETD2 as an important therapeutic target. Here we show that SETD2-deficient cancer cells are profoundly sensitive to the compound RITA, resulting in significant p53 induction and apoptosis. This is further associated with defects in DNA replication, leading to delays in S-phase progression, increased recruitment of replication stress markers, and reduced replication fork progression. RITA sensitivity is linked to the phenol sulphotransferase SULT1A1, which we find to be highly upregulated in cells that lack SETD2. Depletion of SULT1A1 or addition of the phenol sulphotransferase inhibitor DCNP abolishes these phenotypes and suppresses the sensitivity of SETD2-deficient cancer cells, identifying SULT1A1 activity to be critical in mediating the potent cytotoxicity of RITA against SETD2-deficient cells. These findings define a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting the loss of SETD2 in cancer.\n\nSignificance StatementThe histone-modifying enzyme SETD2 has emerged as an important tumour suppressor in a number of different cancer types, identifying it as a promising therapeutic target. The concept of synthetic lethality, a genetic interaction in which the simultaneous loss of two genes or pathways that regulate a common essential process renders the cell nonviable, is a valuable tool for killing cancer cells that have known mutations. In this study, we conducted a synthetic lethality screen for compounds that specifically target SETD2-deficient cancer cells. The top hit, a compound called RITA, reduces cell viability and induces cell death only in the context of SETD2 loss, thereby highlighting a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating SETD2-deficient cancers.",

    "abstract": "Offspring health outcomes are often linked with epigenetic alterations triggered by maternal nutrition and intrauterine environment. Strong experimental data also link paternal preconception nutrition with pathophysiology in the offspring, but the mechanism(s) routing the effects of paternal exposures remain elusive. Animal experimental models have highlighted small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as potential regulators of paternal effects, though less is known about the existence of similar mechanisms in human sperm. Here, we first characterised the baseline sncRNA landscape of human sperm, and then studied the effects of a 6-week diet intervention on their expression profile. Baseline profiling identified 5tRFs, miRNAs and piRNAs to be the most abundant sncRNA subtypes, primarily expressed from regulatory elements like UTRs, CpG-rich regions and promoters. Expression of a subset of these sncRNAs varied with age, BMI and sperm quality of the donor. Diet intervention enriched in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids showed a marked increase of these nutrients in circulation and altered the sperm sncRNA expression. These included 3 tRFs, 15 miRNAs and 112 piRNAs, with gene targets involved in fatty acid metabolism, vitamin D response (LXR/RXR activation, TGF-beta and Wnt signaling), and transposable elements. These findings provide evidence that human sperms are sensitive to alterations in exposures such as diet, and sncRNAs capture the epigenetic imprint of this change. Hence changes to paternal nutrition during preconception may improve sperm quality and offspring health outcomes. To benefit future research, we developed iDad_DB, an open access database of baseline and diet-altered sncRNA in human male germline.",

    "abstract": "Integral membrane glutamate transporters couple the concentrative substrate transport to ion gradients. There is a wealth of structural and mechanistic information about this family. Recent studies revealed transport rate heterogeneity in an archaeal homologue GltPh, inconsistent with simple kinetic models, but its structural and mechanistic determinants remain undefined. In a mutant GltPh, which exclusively populates the outward-facing state, we demonstrate the co-existence of at least two sub-states in slow equilibrium binding the substrate with different apparent affinities. Wild-type GltPh shows similar binding properties, and modulation of the sub-state equilibrium correlates with transport rates. Following binding, the low-affinity sub-state of the mutant is transient. Consistently, cryo-EM on samples frozen within seconds after substrate addition reveals the presence of structural classes with perturbed helical packing of the extracellular half of the transport domain in regions adjacent to the binding site. In contrast, an equilibrated structure does not show such classes. The structure at 2.2 [A] resolution details a pattern of waters in the intracellular half of the domain and resolves classes with subtle differences in the substrate-binding site. We hypothesize that the rigid cytoplasmic half of the domain mediates substrate and ion recognition and coupling, while the extracellular labile half sets the affinity and dynamic properties.",

However tools to non-invasively interrogate the fate of secretory proteins in vivo are scarce. Here we introduce a genetic tagging strategy for in vivo imaging of the secretion and expression dynamics of secretory proteins in living animals. Applying this to a prototypical liver-derived secretory protein, we demonstrate that this approach, combined with optical in-vivo imaging, uncovers extrahepatic prothrombin expression in multiple novel anatomical sites (including testes, placenta, brain, kidney, heart and lymphatic system) and in emerging tumors, resulting in significant amounts of tumor-derived prothrombin in the blood with procoagulant properties. Syngeneic cell lines from this mouse model enable unravelling regulatory mechanisms in high resolution, and in a scalable format ex vivo. Beyond discovering new functions of proteins in a targeted manner, this model allows identifying rheostats in the cross-talk between gene expression and availability of a secretory protein. It is also a valuable resource for uncovering novel (tissue-specific) therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

Yet phylogenetic conservation of developmental outcomes is not reflected in functional preservation of the genes regulating these processes, a phenomenon referred to as developmental system drift (1, 2). Little is known about the evolutionary forces producing change in the molecular details of regulatory genes and their networks while preserving development outcomes. Here we address this void in knowledge by systematically swapping the Drosophila melanogaster coding and noncoding regions of the essential gap gene, giant, a key regulator of embryonic pattern formation, with orthologous sequences drawn from both closely and distantly related species within the genus. Employing sensitized genetic complementation assays, the loss of a transgenes ability to restore viability occurs across phylogeny at every interspecific level of comparison and includes both coding and noncoding changes. Epistasis is present as well -- both between coding and noncoding sequences and, in a dramatic example of change-of-sign epistasis, between the only two coding substitutions separating two very closely related species. A continuous process of functional divergence hidden under conserved phylotypic developmental outcomes requires reconsideration of the prevailing view that the essential genes in conserved regulatory networks are protected from the driving forces of evolutionary change.",

    "abstract": "Brittle Cornea Syndrome (BCS) is a rare recessive condition characterised by extreme thinning of the cornea and sclera. BCS results from loss-of-function mutations in the poorly understood genes ZNF469 or PRDM5. In order to determine the function of ZNF469 and to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms, we used genome editing to recapitulate a human ZNF469 BCS mutation in the orthologous mouse gene, Zfp469. Ophthalmic phenotyping showed that homozygous Zfp469 mutation causes significant central and peripheral corneal thinning arising from reduced stromal thickness. Expression of key components of the corneal stroma in primary keratocytes from Zfp469BCS/BCS mice is affected, including decreased Col1a1 and Col1a2 expression. This alters the type I:type V collagen ratio and results in collagen fibrils with smaller diameter and increased fibril density in homozygous mutant corneas, correlating with decreased biomechanical strength in the cornea. Cell-derived matrices generated by primary keratocytes show reduced deposition of type I collagen offering an in vitro model for stromal dysfunction. Work remains to determine whether modulating ZNF469 activity will have therapeutic benefit in BCS or in conditions such as keratoconus where the cornea thins progressively.\n\nSummary statementA mouse model of Brittle Cornea Syndrome was created to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying pathology of this rare connective tissue disorder in which extremely thin corneas rupture, causing irreversible blindness.",

    "abstract": "Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases related to the aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn). Among these diseases, Parkinsons disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are most prevalent. aSyn can readily form different fibrillar polymorphs, if exposed to an air-water interface or by templating with pre-existing fibrils. We here report the structures of three fibrillar polymorphs that were obtained after seeding monomeric aSyn with PD and MSA patients brain homogenates using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Seeding with a control brain homogenate did not produce fibrils, and seeding with other in vitro generated fibrillar polymorphs as a control faithfully produced polymorphs of a different type. The here determined fibril structures from PD and MSA brain tissue represent new folds, which partly resemble that of previously reported in vitro generated fibrils from Y39 phosphorylated aSyn protein. The relevance of these fibrils for synucleinopathies in humans remains to be further investigated.\n\nImpact StatementNeurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are suspected to be causatively related to the prion-like propagation of aggregates of the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn). The fibril structures reported here were obtained after seeding from diseased human brain homogenate and differ from all previously published aSyn fibril arrangements. In case these fibrils would turn out to be the long sought causative agents of these diseases, their structures might lead to the development of therapeutic strategies to modify these diseases and to a better understanding of the mechanistic processes that lead to neurodegeneration and spreading of the diseases.",

The centriole cartwheel and MTs are thought to grow from opposite ends of these organelles, so it is unclear how they coordinate their assembly. We previously showed that an oscillation of Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) helps to initiate and time the growth of the cartwheel at the proximal end. Here, we show that CP110 and Cep97 form a complex close to the distal-end of the centriole MTs whose levels rise and fall as the new centriole MTs grow, entrained by the core Cdk/Cyclin oscillator that drives the nuclear divisions in these embryos. These CP110/Cep97 dynamics, however, do not appear to time the period of centriole MT growth directly. Instead, we find that changing the levels of CP110/Cep97 alters the Plk4 oscillation and the growth of the cartwheel at the proximal end. These findings reveal an unexpected crosstalk between factors normally concentrated at opposite ends of the growing centrioles, which may help to coordinate centriole growth.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in maintaining me tabolic homeostasis by storing lipids and glucose from circulation as intracellular fat. As peripheral tissues like AT become insulin resistant, decompensation of blood glucose levels occurs causing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, glycocalyx modulating as a pharmacological treatment strategy to improve glucose homeostasis in T2D patients is underexplored. Here, we show a novel role for cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) in establishing glucose uptake capacity and metabolic utilization in differentiated adipocytes. Using a combination of chemical and genetic interventions, we identified that HS modulates this metabolic phenotype by attenuating levels of Wnt signaling during adipogenesis. By engineering the glycocalyx of preadipocytes with exogenous synthetic HS mimetics, we were able to enhance glucose clearance capacity after differentiation through modulation of Wnt ligand availability. These findings establish the cellular glycocalyx as a possible new target for therapeutic intervention in T2D patients by enhancing glucose clearance capacity independent of insulin secretion.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMetabolic disorders associated with the Western-style diet, such as type 2 diabetes, are among the main drivers of mortality in the US and globally, with more than 380 million people currently affected by this disease worldwide. However, treatment options for type 2 diabetes are currently limited to management of caloric uptake and expenditure, with none able to reverse the condition long-term. The ability to reprogram adipose tissues to improve their overall capacity to clear glucose may provide one such opportunity. Here we provide evidence that glycocalyx remodeling in pre-adipocytes with heparan sulfate mimetics will alter their differentiation program by modulating Wnt signaling to produce adipocytes with increased glucose uptake and utilization.",

    "abstract": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics provides a new way to define spatial contexts and understand biological functions in complex diseases. Although some computational frameworks can characterize spatial context via various clustering methods, the detailed spatial architectures and functional zonation often cannot be revealed and localized due to the limited capacities of associating spatial information. We present RESEPT, a deep-learning framework for characterizing and visualizing tissue architecture from spatially resolved transcriptomics. Given inputs as gene expression or RNA velocity, RESEPT learns a three-dimensional embedding with a spatial retained graph neural network from the spatial transcriptomics. The embedding is then visualized by mapping as color channels in an RGB image and segmented with a supervised convolutional neural network model. Based on a benchmark of sixteen 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics datasets on the human cortex, RESEPT infers and visualizes the tissue architecture accurately. It is noteworthy that, for the in-house AD samples, RESEPT can localize cortex layers and cell types based on a pre-defined region-or cell-type-specific genes and furthermore provide critical insights into the identification of amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimers disease. Interestingly, in a glioblastoma sample analysis, RESEPT distinguishes tumor-enriched, non-tumor, and regions of neuropil with infiltrating tumor cells in support of clinical and prognostic cancer applications.",

    "abstract": "Key requirements for the first cells on Earth include the ability to compartmentalize and evolve. Compartmentalization spatially localizes biomolecules from a dilute pool and an evolving cell which grows and divides permits mixing and propagation of information to daughter cells. Complex coacervate microdroplets are excellent candidates as primordial cells with the ability to partition and concentrate molecules into their core and support primitive and complex biochemical reactions. However, the evolution of coacervate protocells by fusion, growth and fission has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, a primordial environment initiated the evolution of coacervate-based protocells. Gas bubbles inside heated rock pores perturb the coacervate protocell distribution and drive the growth, fusion, division and selection of coacervate microdroplets. This setting provides a primordial non-equilibrium environment. Our findings describe how common gas bubbles within heated rock pores induce the early evolution processes of coacervate-based protocells, providing a compelling scenario for the evolution of membrane-free coacervate microdroplets on the early Earth.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLocalized and total body irradiation are used to treat certain cancers and also used prior to transplantation of stem cells or organs. However, the use of radiation also induces collateral damage to the cells of healthy tissue. Although the acute damage of radiation to oocytes is well known, the long-term effects induced by radiation to stromal cells and their relationship with age are still unclear.\n\nMethodsA total of 206 two-month-old female mice were whole-body exposed to gamma rays at doses of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 Gy, respectively. The mice were sacrificed at 3.5, 9, 12, or 18 months of age and pathological changes including cysts and tumors were assessed in the ovary and other organs.\n\nResultsThe overall incidence of visible pathological changes of mice receiving irradiation was 33.7% in the ovary, but much lower in the liver, spleen, lung, thymus, and skin. Among these, the ovarian cyst formation rate was 24.7%, and tumor lesions were 10.2%, respectively, compared to 5% cyst formation and no tumor lesions among control, unirradiated mice. Statistical analysis showed that cyst formation was age, but not dose-dependent, whereas the formation of tumor lesions was dependent on both age and radiation dose. Pathology analysis indicated that most ovarian cysts originated from follicles and both tumor lesions analyzed originated from granulosa cells.\n\nConclusionOvaries are highly susceptible to the effects of radiation. Long-term damage is increased after total body irradiation in mice, manifested by higher incidences of cyst formation and tumor lesions. The ovarian stromal-derived granulosa cells might play an essential role in these changes.",

    "abstract": "Working memory provides flexible storage of information in service of upcoming behavioral goals. Some models propose specific fixed loci and mechanisms for the storage of visual information in working memory, such as sustained spiking in parietal and prefrontal cortex during working memory maintenance. An alternative view is that information can be remembered in a flexible format that best suits current behavioral goals. For example, remembered visual information might be stored in sensory areas for easier comparison to future sensory inputs, or might be re-coded into a more abstract action-oriented format and stored in motor areas. Here, we tested this hypothesis using a visuo-spatial working memory task where the required behavioral response was either known or unknown during the memory delay period. Using fMRI and multivariate decoding, we found that there was less information about remembered spatial position in early visual and parietal regions when the required response was known versus unknown. Further, a representation of the planned motor action emerged in primary somatosensory, primary motor, and premotor cortex during the same task condition where spatial information was reduced in early visual cortex. These results suggest that the neural networks supporting working memory can be strategically reconfigured depending on specific behavioral requirements during a canonical visual working memory paradigm.",

Open-access transcriptomic datasets like the Allen Human Brain Atlas provide an unprecedented ability to examine these mechanisms in vivo; however, a lack of standardization across research groups has given rise to myriad processing pipelines for using these data. Here, we develop the abagen toolbox, an open-access software package for working with transcriptomic data, and use it to examine how methodological variability influences the outcomes of research using the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Applying three prototypical analyses to the outputs of 750,000 unique processing pipelines, we find that choice of pipeline has a large impact on research findings, with parameters commonly varied in the literature influencing correlations between derived gene expression and other imaging phenotypes by as much as{rho} [&ge;] 1.0. Our results further reveal an ordering of parameter importance, with processing steps that influence gene normalization yielding the greatest impact on downstream statistical inferences and conclusions.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an important tool for modeling brain and behaviour. One key area of interest has been to apply these networks to model human similarity judgements. Several previous works have used the embeddings from the penultimate layer of vision DNNs and showed that a reweighting of these features improves the fit between human similarity judgments and DNNs. These studies underline the idea that these embeddings form a good basis set but lack the correct level of salience. Here we re-examined the grounds for this idea and on the contrary, we hypothesized that these embeddings, beyond forming a good basis set, also have the correct level of salience to account for similarity judgments. It is just that the huge dimensional embedding needs to be pruned to select those features relevant for the considered domain for which a similarity space is modeled. In Study 1 we supervised DNN pruning based on a subset of human similarity judgments. We found that pruning: i) improved out-of-sample prediction of human similarity judgments from DNN embeddings, ii) produced better alignment with WordNet hierarchy, and iii) retained much higher classification accuracy than reweighting. Study 2 showed that pruning by neurobiological data is highly effective in improving out-of-sample prediction of brain-derived representational dissimilarity matrices from DNN embeddings, at times fleshing out isomorphisms not otherwise observable. Pruning supervised by human brain/behavior therefore effectively identifies alignable dimensions of semantic knowledge between DNNs and humans and constitutes an effective method for understanding the organization of knowledge in neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish provide an excellent model for in vivo cell biology studies due to their amenability to live imaging. Protein visualization in zebrafish has traditionally relied on overexpression of fluorescently tagged proteins from heterologous promoters, making it difficult to recapitulate endogenous expression patterns and protein function. One way to circumvent this problem is to tag the proteins by modifying their endogenous genomic loci. Such an approach is not widely available to zebrafish researchers due to inefficient homologous recombination and the error-prone nature of targeted integration in zebrafish. Here, we report a simple approach for tagging proteins in zebrafish on their N- or C termini with fluorescent markers by inserting PCR-generated donor amplicons into non-coding regions of the corresponding genes. Using this approach, we generated endogenously tagged alleles for several genes critical for epithelial biology and organ development including the tight junction components ZO-1 and Cldn15la, the trafficking effector Rab11a, and the ECM receptor {beta}1 integrin. Our approach facilitates the generation of knock-in lines in zebrafish, opening the way for accurate quantitative imaging studies.\n\nSummary statementGeneration of endogenously tagged stable zebrafish knock-in lines is simplified by the integration of fluorescent protein cassettes with mRNA splicing elements into non-coding regions of genes.",

Several other minor resistance loci have also been identified on other chromosomes.\n\nHere we report on the re-sequencing of the  Regent and  Red Globe (susceptible) genomes using next generation sequencing. While the genome of  Regent has more SNP variants than  Red Globe, the distribution of these variants across the two genomes is not the same, nor is it uniform. The variation per gene shows that some genes have higher SNP density than others and that the number of SNPs for a given gene is not always the same for the two cultivars. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of studying the variation of non-synonymous to synonymous SNP ratios between resistant and susceptible cultivars in the target QTL regions as a strategy to narrow down the number of likely candidate genes for Rpv3, Ren3 and Ren9.",

    "abstract": "Wakefulness levels modulate estimates of functional connectivity (FC), and, if unaccounted for, can become a substantial confound in resting-state fMRI. Unfortunately, wakefulness is rarely monitored due to the need for additional concurrent recordings (e.g., eye tracking, EEG). Recent work has shown that strong fluctuations around 0.05Hz, hypothesized to be CSF inflow, appear in the fourth ventricle (FV) when subjects fall asleep, and that they correlate significantly with the global signal. The analysis of these fluctuations could provide an easy way to evaluate wakefulness in fMRI-only data and improve our understanding of FC during sleep. Here we evaluate this possibility using the 7T resting-state sample from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our results replicate the observation that fourth ventricle ultra-slow fluctuations ([~]0.05Hz) with inflow-like characteristics (decreasing in intensity for successive slices) are present in scans during which subjects did not comply with instructions to keep their eyes open (i.e., drowsy scans). This is true despite the HCP data not being optimized for the detection of inflow-like effects. In addition, time-locked BOLD fluctuations of the same frequency could be detected in large portions of grey matter with a wide range of temporal delays and contribute in significant ways to our understanding of how FC changes during sleep. First, these ultra-slow fluctuations explain half of the increase in global signal that occurs during descent into sleep. Similarly, global shifts in FC between awake and sleep states are driven by changes in this slow frequency band. Second, they can influence estimates of inter-regional FC. For example, disconnection between frontal and posterior components of the Defulat Mode Network (DMN) typically reported during sleep were only detectable after regression of these ultra-slow fluctuations. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the power spectrum of these ultra-slow FV fluctuations can help us reproduce sample-level sleep patterns (e.g., a substantial number of subjects descending into sleep 3 minutes following scanning onset), partially rank scans according to overall drowsiness levels, and predict individual segments of elevated drowsiness (at 60 seconds resolution) with 71% accuracy.",

Modern accounts assume a single global structure-function relationship that persists over time. Here we show that structure-function coupling is dynamic and regionally heterogeneous. We use a temporal unwrapping procedure to identify moment-to-moment co-fluctuations in neural activity, and reconstruct time-resolved structure-function coupling patterns. We find that patterns of dynamic structure-function coupling are highly organized across the cortex. These patterns reflect cortical hierarchies, with stable coupling in unimodal and transmodal cortex, and dynamic coupling in intermediate regions, particularly in insular cortex (salience network) and frontal eye fields (dorsal attention network). Finally, we show that the variability of structure-function coupling is shaped by the distribution of connection lengths. The time-varying coupling of structural and functional connectivity points towards an informative feature of the brain that may reflect how cognitive functions are flexibly deployed and implemented.",

AMPH regulated the transcription of hundreds of genes in PV+ interneurons, and this program was largely distinct from that regulated in other NAc GABAergic neurons. Chromatin accessibility at enhancers predicted cell-type specific gene regulation, identifying transcriptional mechanisms of differential AMPH responses. Finally, we observed dysregulation of multiple PV-specific, AMPH-regulated genes in an Mecp2 mutant mouse strain that shows heightened behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants, suggesting the functional importance of this transcriptional program. Together these data provide novel insight into the cell-type specific programs of transcriptional plasticity in NAc neurons that underlie addictive-like behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Punishment involves learning the relationship between actions and their adverse consequences. Both the acquisition and expression of punishment learning depend on the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but how BLA supports punishment remains poorly understood. To address this, we measured calcium (Ca2+) transients in BLA principal neurons during punishment. Male rats were trained to press two individually presented levers for food; when one of these levers also yielded aversive footshock, responding on this punished lever decreased relative to the other, unpunished lever. In rats with the Ca2+indicator GCaMP6f targeted to BLA principal neurons, we observed excitatory activity transients to the footshock punisher and inhibitory transients to lever-presses. Critically, as rats learned punishment, activity around the punished response transformed from inhibitory to excitatory and similarity analyses showed that these punished lever-press transients resembled BLA transients to the punisher itself. Systemically administered benzodiazepine (midazolam) selectively alleviated punishment. Moreover, the degree to which midazolam alleviated punishment was associated with how much punished response-related BLA transients reverted to their pre-punishment state. Together, these findings show that punishment learning is supported by aversion-coding of instrumental responses in the BLA and that the anti-punishment effects of benzodiazepines are associated with a reversion of this aversion coding.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognition and memory. Mouse models such as 5xFAD, incorporate mutations found in familial or early-onset (EOAD) AD; these mutations increase the production of the toxic AB species that contributes to plaque formation in the brain. However, not all brain regions in the 5xAD animals accumulate plaques to the same degree. For example, the cerebellum appears to be resistant to AB plaque formation, while other regions such as the cortex and subiculum develop copious plaques. The mechanism(s) underlying this regional specificity remains unclear. Thus, we used a fluorescent antibody to APP/AB to quantify the amount of these proteins in several brain regions of interest, including subiculum, cortex, and cerebellum. We found that the cerebellum had less APP/AB than the other regions quantified, which demonstrates a correlation between the levels of APP/AB and plaque formation. Taken together, this suggests that the regional specificity of AD pathology may be a result of different levels of protein expression.",

    "abstract": "The rise of the Isthmus of Panama ~3.5 mya separated populations of many marine organisms, which then diverged into new geminate sister species currently living in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. However, we know very little about how such evolutionary divergences of host species have shaped their microbiomes. Here, we compared the microbiomes of whole-body and shell-surface samples of geminate species of marine gastropods in the genera Cerithium and Cerithideopsis to those of congeneric outgroups. Our results show that the effects of the Isthmus on microbiome composition varied among host genera and between sample types within the same hosts. In the whole-body samples, microbiome compositions of geminate species pairs in the focal genera tended to be similar, likely due to host filtering, although the strength of this relationship varied among the two groups and across similarity metrics. Shell-surface communities showed contrasting patterns, with co-divergence between the host taxa and a small number of microbial clades evident in Cerithideopsis, but not Cerithium. These results suggest that (i) the rise of the Isthmus of Panama affected microbiomes of geminate hosts in a complex and clade-specific manner and (ii) host-associated microbial taxa respond differently to vicariance events than the hosts themselves.",

    "abstract": "Island radiations present natural laboratories for studying the evolutionary process. The Hawaiian Drosophil-idae are one such radiation, with nearly 600 described species and substantial morphological and ecological diversification. These species are largely divided into a few major clades, but the relationship between these clades remains uncertain. Here we present 12 new assembled transcriptomes from across these clades, and use these transcriptomes to resolve the base of the evolutionary radiation. We recover a new hypothesis for the relationship between clades, and demonstrate its support over previously published hypotheses. We then use the evolutionary radiation to explore dynamics of concordance in phylogenetic support, by analyzing the gene and site concordance factors for every possible topological combination of major groups. We show that high bootstrap values mask low evolutionary concordance, and we demonstrate that the most likely topology is distinct from the topology with the highest support across gene trees and from the topology with highest support across sites. We then combine all previously published genetic data for the group to estimate a time-calibrated tree for over 300 species of drosophilids. Finally, we digitize dozens of published Hawaiian Drosophilidae descriptions, and use this to pinpoint probable evolutionary shifts in reproductive ecology as well as body, wing, and egg size. We show that by examining the entire landscape of tree and trait space, we can gain a more complete understanding of how evolutionary dynamics play out across an island radiation.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the evolution of quantitative traits in nature is still limited by the challenge of including realistic trait distributions in the context of frequency-dependent selection and ecological feedbacks. We extend to class-structured populations a recently introduced \"oligomorphic approximation\" which bridges the gap between adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics approaches and allows for the joint description of the dynamics of ecological variables and of the moments of multimodal trait distributions. Our theoretical framework allows us to analyse the dynamics of populations composed of several morphs and structured into distinct classes (e.g. age, size, habitats, infection status, species...). We also introduce a new approximation to simplify the eco-evolutionary dynamics using reproductive values. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to the important conceptual case of two-habitat migration-selection models. In particular, we show that our approach allows us to predict both the long-term evolutionary endpoints and the short-term transient dynamics of the eco-evolutionary process, including fast evolution regimes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our results and sketch perspectives for future work.",

We exemplify the application of IHPF under different data integration scenarios with varying alignments of batches and cell diversity, and show that IHPF produces latent factors that can be advantageously applied for cell clustering and visualisation.

Lifestyle disorders such as obesity, diabetes and dyslipidaemia predispose to and are associated with the disease progression. Conventional modalities are mainly symptomatic, with no definite solution. Beta glucan-based biological response modifiers are a potential strategy in lieu of their beneficial metabolic effects. Aureobasidium pullulans strains AFO-202 and N-163 beta glucans were evaluated for anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory hepatoprotective potentials in a NASH animal model in this study.\n\nMethodsIn the STAM murine model of NASH, five groups were studied for eight weeks-- (1) vehicle (RO water), (2) AFO-202 beta glucan; (3) N-163 beta glucan, (4) AFO-202+N-163 beta glucan, and (5) telmisartan (standard pharmacological intervention). Evaluation of biochemical parameters in plasma and hepatic histology including Sirius red staining and F4/80 immunostaining were performed.\n\nResultsAFO-202 beta glucan significantly decreased inflammation-associated hepatic cell ballooning and steatosis. N-163 beta glucan decreased fibrosis and inflammation significantly (p value<0.05). The combination of AFO-202 with N-163 significantly decreased the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) compared with other groups.\n\nConclusionThis preclinical study supports the potential of N-163 and AFO-202 beta glucans alone or in combination as potential preventive and therapeutic agent(s), for NASH.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Yet, a causative link between these pathways is unknown. Here, we fluorescently monitored [Ca2+]m transients in hippocampal neurons evoked by caffeine followed by depolarization. [Ca2+]m efflux was apparent in WT but diminished in neurons deficient in the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX. Surprisingly, neuronal depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients alone failed to evoke strong [Ca2+]m efflux in WT neurons. Caffeine is also a PDE inhibitor. Pretreatment with the PDE2 inhibitor Bay 60-7550 rescued [Ca2+]m efflux triggered by neuronal depolarization. Inhibition of PDE2 acted by diminishing the Ca2+ dependent reduction of mitochondrial cAMP, thereby promoting NCLX phosphorylation. Selective PDE2 inhibition also enhanced [Ca2+]m efflux triggered by neuromodulators. We found that protection of neurons against excitotoxic insults, conferred by PDE2 inhibition, was diminished in NCLX KO neurons, thus is NCLX dependent. Finally, administration of Bay 60-7550 enhanced new object recognition learning in WT but not in NCLX KO mice.

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-pulmonary emphysema often develop locomotor muscle dysfunction, which is independently associated with disability and higher mortality in that population. Muscle dysfunction entails reduced muscle mass and force-generation capacity, which are influenced by fibers integrity. Myogenesis, which is muscle turnover driven by progenitor cells such as satellite cells, contributes to the maintenance of muscle integrity in the context of organ development and injury-repair cycles. Injurious events crucially occur in COPD patients skeletal muscles in the setting of exacerbations and infections which lead to acute decompensations for limited periods of time after which, patients typically fail to recover the baseline status they had before the acute event. Autophagy, which is dysregulated in muscles from COPD patients, is a key regulator of satellite cells activation and myogenesis, yet very little research has so far investigated the mechanistic role of autophagy dysregulation in COPD muscles. Using a genetically inducible murine model of COPD-driven muscle dysfunction and confirmed with a second genetic animal model, we found a significant myogenic dysfunction associated with a reduced proliferative capacity of freshly isolated satellite cells. Transplantation experiments followed by lineage tracing suggest that an intrinsic defect in satellite cells, and not in the COPD environment, plays a dominant role in the observed myogenic dysfunction. RNA sequencing analysis of freshly isolated satellite cells suggests dysregulation of transcripts associated with control of cell cycle and autophagy, which is confirmed by a direct observation of COPD mice satellite cells fluorescent-tracked autophagosome formation. Moreover, spermidine-induced autophagy stimulation leads to improved satellite cells autophagosome turnover, replication rate and myogenesis. Our data suggests that pulmonary emphysema causes a disrupted myogenesis, which could be improved with stimulation of autophagy and satellite cells activation, leading to an attenuated muscle dysfunction in this context.",

    "abstract": "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are known neuroendocrine disrupting chemicals with adverse neurodevelopmental effects. PBDEs may act as risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), characterized by abnormal psychosocial functioning, although direct evidence is currently lacking. Using a translational exposure model, we tested the hypothesis that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in female offspring. C57Bl6/N mouse dams (F0) were exposed to DE-71 via oral administration of 0 (VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71) or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d from 3 wk prior to gestation through lactation. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated in utero and lactational transfer of PBDEs (ppb) to F1 female offspring brain tissue at postnatal day (PND) 15 which was reduced by PND 110. Neurobehavioral testing of social novelty preference (SNP) and social recognition memory (SRM) revealed that adult L-DE-71 F1 offspring display altered short- and long-term SRM, in the absence of reduced sociability, and increased repetitive behavior. These effects were concomitant with reduced olfactory discrimination of social odors. Additionally, L-DE-71 exposure also altered short-term novel object recognition memory but not anxiety or depressive-like behavior. Moreover, F1 L-DE-71 displayed downregulated mRNA transcripts for oxytocin (Oxt) in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and supraoptic nucleus, vasopressin (Avp) in the BNST and upregulated Avp1ar in BNST, and Oxtr in the paraventricular nucleus. Our work demonstrates that developmental PBDE exposure produces ASD-relevant neurochemical, olfactory processing and behavioral phenotypes that may result from early neurodevelopmental reprogramming within central social and memory networks.",

The current COVID-19 pandemic makes no exception, and temperature has been suggested to play a role on the viability and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate viral fusion. Studying the effect of temperature on the receptor-Spike interaction, we observed a significant and stepwise increase in RBD-ACE2 affinity at low temperatures, resulting in slower dissociation kinetics. This translated into enhanced interaction of the full Spike to ACE2 receptor and higher viral attachment at low temperatures. Interestingly, the RBD N501Y mutation, present in emerging variants of concern (VOCs) that are fueling the pandemic worldwide, bypassed this requirement. This data suggests that the acquisition of N501Y reflects an adaptation to warmer climates, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antivirals against coronaviruses (CoVs). Here, pheophorbide a (Pba) was identified as a highly active antiviral molecule against HCoV-229E after bioguided fractionation of plant extracts. The antiviral activity of Pba was subsequently shown for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and its mechanism of action was further assessed, showing that Pba is an inhibitor of coronavirus entry by directly targeting the viral particle. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of Pba depends on light exposure, and Pba was shown to inhibit virus-cell fusion by stiffening the viral membrane as demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy. Moreover, Pba was shown to be broadly active against several other enveloped viruses, and reduced SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replication in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Pba is the first described natural antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 with direct photosensitive virucidal activity that holds potential for COVID-19 therapy or disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Whether regeneration is primarily accomplished by re-activating gene regulatory networks used previously during development or by activating novel regeneration-specific transcriptional programs remains a longstanding question. Currently, most genes implicated in regeneration also function during development. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating Drosophila wing discs, we identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema. They are each composed of cells that upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration. In this regenerative secretory zone, the transcription factor Ets21C controls the expression of multiple regenerationpromoting genes. While eliminating Ets21C function has no discernible effect on development, it severely compromises regeneration. This Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network is also activated in blastema-like cells in tumorous discs, suggesting that pro-regenerative mechanisms can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.",

    "abstract": "Whole tissue RNASeq is the standard approach for studying gene expression divergence in evolutionary biology and provides a snapshot of the comprehensive transcriptome for a given tissue. However, whole tissues consist of diverse cell types differing in expression profiles, and the cellular composition of these tissues can evolve across species. Here, we investigate the effects of different cellular composition on whole tissue expression profiles. We compared gene expression from whole testes and enriched spermatogenesis populations in two species of house mice, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus, and their sterile and fertile F1 hybrids, which differ in both cellular composition and regulatory dynamics. We found that cellular composition differences skewed expression profiles and differential gene expression in whole testes samples. Importantly, both approaches were able to detect large-scale patterns such as disrupted X chromosome expression although whole testes sampling resulted in decreased power to detect differentially expressed genes. We encourage researchers to account for histology in RNASeq and consider methods that reduce sample complexity whenever feasible. Ultimately, we show that differences in cellular composition between tissues can modify expression profiles, potentially altering inferred gene ontological processes, insights into gene network evolution, and processes governing gene expression evolution.",

    "abstract": "Time-course gene expression datasets provide insight into the dynamics of complex biological processes, such as immune response and organ development. It is of interest to identify genes with similar temporal expression patterns because such genes are often biologically related. However, this task is challenging due to the high dimensionality of these datasets and the nonlinearity of gene expression time dynamics. We propose an empirical Bayes approach to estimating ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of gene expression, from which we derive a similarity metric between genes called the Bayesian lead-lag R2 (LLR2). Importantly, the calculation of the LLR2 leverages biological databases that document known interactions amongst genes; this information is automatically used to define informative prior distributions on the ODE models parameters. As a result, the LLR2 is a biologically-informed metric that can be used to identify clusters or networks of functionally-related genes with co-moving or time-delayed expression patterns. We then derive data-driven shrinkage parameters from Steins unbiased risk estimate that optimally balance the ODE models fit to both data and external biological information. Using real gene expression data, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to recover interpretable gene clusters and sparse networks. These results reveal new insights about the dynamics of biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Methods for the selective labeling of biogenic functional groups on peptides are being developed and used in the workflow of both current and emerging proteomics technologies, such as single-molecule fluorosequencing. To achieve successful labeling with any one method requires that the peptide fragments contain the functional group for which the labeling chemistry is designed. In practice, only two functional groups are present on every peptide fragment regardless of the protein cleavage site, namely, an N-terminal amine and a C-terminal carboxylic acid. Developing a global-labeling technology, therefore, requires one to specifically target the N- and/or C-terminus of peptides. In this work, we showcase the first successful application of photocatalyzed C-terminal decarboxylative-alkylation for peptide mass-spectrometry and single molecule protein sequencing, that can be broadly applied to any proteome. We demonstrate that peptides in complex mixtures generated from enzymatic digests from bovine serum albumin, as well as protein mixtures from yeast and human cell extracts, can be site-specifically labeled at their C-terminal residue with a Michael acceptor. Using two distinct analytical approaches, we characterize C-terminal labeling efficiencies of greater than 50% across complete proteomes and document the proclivity of various C-terminal amino acid residues for decarboxylative-labeling, showing histidine and tryptophan to be the most disfavored. Finally, we combine C-terminal decarboxylative labeling with an orthogonal carboxylic acid labeling technology in tandem, to establish a new platform for fluorosequencing.",

PET/MRI provides the ability for absolute quantification of PET probes without the need for serial arterial blood sampling using image-derived input functions (IDIFs). Here we introduce caliPER, a modular and scalable software for simplified pharmacokinetic modelling of PET probes with irreversible uptake or binding based on PET/MR IDIFs and Patlak Plot analysis. caliPER generates regional values or parametric maps of net influx rate (Ki) using reconstructed dynamic PET images and anatomical MRI aligned to PET for IDIF vessel delineation. We evaluated the performance of caliPER for blood-free region-based and pixel-wise Patlak analyses of [18F] FDG by comparing caliPER IDIF to serial arterial blood input functions and its application in imaging brain glucose hypometabolism in Frontotemporal dementia. IDIFs corrected for partial volume errors including spill-out and spill-in effects were similar to arterial blood input functions with a general bias of around 6-8%, even for arteries <5 mm. The Ki and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose estimated using caliPER IDIF were similar to estimates using arterial blood sampling (<2%) and within limits of whole brain values reported in literature. Overall, caliPER is a promising tool for irreversible PET tracer quantification and can simplify the ability to perform parametric analysis in clinical settings without the need for blood sampling.\n\nHighlightsO_LIcaliPER is an adaptable image processing software for extracting image-derived input functions and generating parametric maps of irreversible PET tracer uptake.\nC_LIO_LIAnatomical (T1-weighted/T2-weighted/time-of-flight angiography) MRI carefully aligned to PET provides a robust approach for delineation of vessels on PET, eliminating the need for serial blood sampling for input functions.\nC_LIO_LIApplication of caliPER in modelling glucose uptake in patients with Frontotemporal dementia, demonstrates the feasibility of absolute quantification of cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in clinical populations.\nC_LI",

An accurate tumor purity estimation is crucial for accurate pathologic evaluation and for sample selection to minimize normal cell contamination in high throughput genomic analysis. We developed a novel deep multiple instance learning model predicting tumor purity from H&E stained digital histopathology slides. Our model successfully predicted tumor purity from slides of fresh-frozen sections in eight different TCGA cohorts and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections in a local Singapore cohort. The predictions were highly consistent with genomic tumor purity values, which were inferred from genomic data and accepted as the golden standard. Besides, we obtained spatially resolved tumor purity maps and showed that tumor purity varies spatially within a sample. Our analyses on tumor purity maps also suggested that pathologists might have chosen high tumor content regions inside the slides during tumor purity estimation in the TCGA cohorts, which resulted in higher values than genomic tumor purity values. In short, our model can be utilized for high throughput sample selection for genomic analysis, which will help reduce pathologists workload and decrease inter-observer variability. Moreover, spatial tumor purity maps can help better understand the tumor microenvironment as a key determinant in tumor formation and therapeutic response.",

This progression is similar to that of the ventral visual pathway, which is well characterized by artificial neural networks (ANNs) optimized for object recognition. In contrast, there are no image-computable models of the dorsal stream with comparable explanatory power. We hypothesized that the properties of dorsal stream neurons could be explained by a simple learning objective: the need for an organism to orient itself during self-motion. To test this hypothesis, we trained a 3D ResNet to predict an agents self-motion parameters from visual stimuli in a simulated environment. We found that the responses in this network accounted well for the selectivity of neurons in a large database of single-neuron recordings from the dorsal visual stream of non-human primates. In contrast, ANNs trained on an action recognition dataset through supervised or self-supervised learning could not explain responses in the dorsal stream, despite also being trained on naturalistic videos with moving objects. These results demonstrate that an ecologically relevant cost function can account for dorsal stream properties in the primate brain.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), is shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anxiolytic, and antidepressant properties in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, its low bioavailability is a limitation for its potential adoption as a therapeutic agent. The process of micronization can overcome this barrier by reducing the particle size and increasing the dissolution rate, potentially improving the bioavailability of the compounds of interest. In this study, we compared the in vitro antioxidant effects of curcumin (CUR) and micronized curcumin (MC) and studied their effects on behavioral and neurochemical parameters in zebrafish submitted to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). MC (1 g/L) presented higher antioxidant activity in vitro as compared to CUR, as measured by iron-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 1,1-diphenyl-2-2-picyryl-hydrazyl radical removal (DPPH), and deoxyribose tests. UCS increased total distance traveled in the social interaction test (SI), while decreased crossings, time, and entries to the top area in the novel tank test (NTT). No effects of UCS were observed in the open tank test (OTT). The behavioral effects induced by UCS were not blocked by any curcumin preparation. UCS also decreased non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels, while increased glutathione reductase (GR) activity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels on zebrafish brain. MC presented superior antioxidant properties than CUR in vivo, blocking the stress-induced neurochemical effects. Although this study did not measure the concentration of curcumin on the zebrafish brain, our results suggest that micronization increases the bioavailability of curcumin, potentiating its antioxidant activity both in vitro and in vivo. Our study also demonstrates that counteracting the oxidative imbalance induced by UCS is not sufficient to block its behavioral effects.",

While a valuable resource, relatively few technical details relevant to the design of studies in cognitive neuroscience have been described. We present an analysis of two key low-level properties of THINGS images, luminance and luminance contrast. These image statistics are known to influence common physiological and neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes. In general, we found that the distributions of luminance and contrast are in close agreement with the statistics of natural images reported previously. However, we found that image concepts are separable in their luminance and contrast: we show that luminance and contrast alone are sufficient to classify images into their concepts with above chance accuracy. We describe how these factors may confound studies using the THINGS images, and suggest simple controls that can be implemented a priori or post-hoc. We discuss the importance of using such natural images as stimuli in psychological research.",

    "abstract": "Linking brain and behavior is one of the great challenges in cognitive neuroscience. Ultimately, we want to understand how the brain processes information to guide every-day behavior. However, most neuroscientific studies employ very simplistic experimental paradigms whose ecological validity is doubtful. Reading is a case in point, since most neuroscientific studies to date have used unnatural word-by-word stimulus presentation and have often focused on single word processing. Previous research has therefore actively avoided factors that are important for natural reading, such as rapid self-paced voluntary saccadic eye movements. Recent methodological developments have made it possible to deal with associated problems such as eye movement artefacts and the overlap of brain responses to successive stimuli, using a combination of eye-tracking and neuroimaging. A growing number of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are successfully using this methodology. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept that this methodology can be applied to combined EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Our participants naturally read 4-word sentences that could end in a plausible or implausible word while eye-tracking, EEG and MEG were being simultaneously recorded. Eye-movement artefacts were removed using independent-component analysis. Fixation-related potentials and fields for sentence-final words were subjected to minimum-norm source estimation. We detected an N400-type brain response in our EEG data starting around 200 ms after fixation of the sentence-final word. The brain sources of this effect, estimated from combined EEG and MEG data, were mostly located in left temporal lobe areas. We discuss the possible use of this method for future neuroscientific research on language and cognition.",

If inhibitory cell types and cortical laminae targeted by cortical and thalamic afferents differ, then these afferents play different roles in regulating M1 output. We quantified input to two classes of M1 interneurons, parvalbumin+ (PV) fast-spiking cells and somatostatin+ (SOM) low-threshold-spiking cells, using monosynaptic rabies tracing. We then compared anatomical connectivity and functional connectivity based on synaptic strength from sensory cortex and thalamus. Functionally, each input innervated M1 interneurons with a unique laminar profile. Different interneuron types were excited in a distinct, complementary manner, suggesting feedforward inhibition proceeds selectively via distinct circuits. Specifically, somatosensory cortex (S1) inputs primarily targeted PV+ neurons in upper layers (L2/3) but SOM+ neurons in middle layers (L5). Somatosensory thalamus (PO) inputs targeted PV+ neurons in middle layers (L5). In contrast to sensory cortical areas, thalamic input to SOM+ neurons was equivalent to PV+ neurons. Thus, long-range excitatory inputs target inhibitory neurons in an area and cell type-specific manner which contrasts with input to neighboring pyramidal cells. In contrast to feedforward inhibition providing generic inhibitory tone in cortex, circuits are selectively organized to recruit inhibition matched to incoming excitatory circuits.",

However, recent studies call to question this tenet of the field by demonstrating unexpected levels of representational drift in hippocampal place cells with respect to the duration of episodic memories in mice7, 8. In the present study, we examined behaviorally driven long-term organization of the place map, to resolve the relationship between memory and place cells. Leveraging the stability of two-photon calcium imaging, we tracked activity of the same set of CA1 pyramidal neurons during learning and memory recall in an operant, head-fixed, odorcued spatial navigation task. We found that place cells are rapidly recruited into task-dependent spatial maps, resulting in emergence of orthogonal as well as overlapping representations of space. Further, task-selective place cells used a diverse set of remapping strategies to represent changing task demands that accompany learning. We found behavioral performance dependent divergence of spatial maps between trial types occurs during learning. Finally, imaging during remote recall spanning up to 30 days revealed increased stabilization of learnt place cell maps following memory consolidation. Our findings suggest that a subset of place cells is recruited by rule based spatial learning, actively reconfigured to represent task-relevant spatial relationships, and stabilized following successful learning and consolidation.",

Here, we used primary cortical microtissues to study the effects of neuroinflammation on neural microcircuits. We demonstrated the use of a genetically encoded calcium indicator combined with a novel live-imaging platform to record spontaneous calcium transients in microtissues from day 14-34 in vitro. We implemented graph theory analysis of calcium activity to characterize underlying functional connectivity and community structure of microcircuits, which are capable of capturing subtle changes in network dynamics during early diseases states. We found that microtissues cultured for 34 days displayed functional remodeling of microcircuits and that community structure strengthened over time. Lipopolysaccharide, a neuroinflammatory agent, significantly increased functional connectivity and disrupted community structure 5-9 days after exposure. These microcircuit-level changes have broad implications for the role of neuroinflammation in functional dysregulation of neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Generative machine learning (ML) has been postulated to be a major driver in the computational design of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). However, efforts to confirm this hypothesis have been hindered by the infeasibility of testing arbitrarily large numbers of antibody sequences for their most critical design parameters: paratope, epitope, affinity, and developability. To address this challenge, we leveraged a lattice-based antibody-antigen binding simulation framework, which incorporates a wide range of physiological antibody binding parameters. The simulation framework enables both the computation of antibody-antigen 3D-structures as well as functions as an oracle for unrestricted prospective evaluation of the antigen specificity of ML-generated antibody sequences. We found that a deep generative model, trained exclusively on antibody sequence (1D) data can be used to design native-like conformational (3D) epitope-specific antibodies, matching or exceeding the training dataset in affinity and developability variety. Furthermore, we show that transfer learning enables the generation of high-affinity antibody sequences from low-N training data. Finally, we validated that the antibody design insight gained from simulated antibody-antigen binding data is applicable to experimental real-world data.

    "abstract": "We are interested in generating new small molecules which could act as inhibitors of a biological target, when there is limited prior information on target-specific inhibitors. This form of drug-design is assuming increasing importance with the advent of new disease threats for which known chemicals only provide limited information about target inhibition. In this paper, we propose the combined use of deep neural networks and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that allows the use of symbolic domain-knowledge (B) to explore the large space of possible molecules. Assuming molecules and their activities to be instances of random variables X and Y, the problem is to draw instances from the conditional distribution of X, given Y, B (DX|Y,B). We decompose this into the constituent parts of obtaining the distributions DX|B and DY|X,B, and describe the design and implementation of models to approximate the distributions. The design consists of generators (to approximate DX|B and DX|Y,B) and a discriminator (to approximate DY|X,B). We investigate our approach using the well-studied problem of inhibitors for the Janus kinase (JAK) class of proteins. We assume first that if no data on inhibitors are available for a target protein (JAK2), but a small numbers of inhibitors are known for homologous proteins (JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2). We show that the inclusion of relational domain-knowledge results in a potentially more effective generator of inhibitors than simple random sampling from the space of molecules or a generator without access to symbolic relations. The results suggest a way of combining symbolic domain-knowledge and deep generative models to constrain the exploration of the chemical space of molecules, when there is limited information on target-inhibitors. We also show how samples from the conditional generator can be used to identify potentially novel target inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome duplications (WGDs), in which the number of nuclear genome copies is elevated as a result of autopolyploidy or allopolyploidy, are a prominent process of diversification in eukaryotes. The genetic and evolutionary forces that WGD imposes upon cytoplasmic genomes are not well understood, despite the central role that cytonuclear interactions play in eukaryotic function and fitness. Cellular respiration and photosynthesis depend upon successful interaction between the 3000+ nuclear-encoded proteins destined for the mitochondria or plastids and the gene products of cytoplasmic genomes in multi-subunit complexes such as OXPHOS, organellar ribosomes, Photosystems I and II, and Rubisco. Allopolyploids are thus faced with the critical task of coordinating interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes that were inherited from different species. Because cytoplasmic genomes share a more recent history of common descent with the maternal nuclear subgenome than the paternal subgenome, evolutionary \"mismatches\" between the paternal subgenome and the cytoplasmic genomes in allopolyploids might lead to accelerated rates of evolution in the paternal homoeologs of allopolyploids, either through relaxed purifying selection or strong directional selection to rectify these mismatches. We tested this hypothesis in maternal vs. paternal copies of organelle-targeted genes in six allotetraploids: Brachypodium hybridum, Chenopodium quinoa, Coffea arabica, Gossypium hirsutum, Nicotiana tabacum, and Triticum dicoccoides. We report evidence that allopolyploid subgenomes exhibit unequal rates of protein-sequence evolution, but we did not observe global effects of cytonuclear incompatibilities on paternal homoeologs of organelle-targeted genes. Analyses of gene content revealed mixed evidence for whether organelle-targeted genes re-diploidize more rapidly than non-organelle-targeted genes. Together, these global analyses provide insights into the complex evolutionary dynamics of allopolyploids, showing that allopolyploid subgenomes have separate evolutionary trajectories despite sharing the same nucleus, generation time, and ecological context.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARY\n\nWhole genome duplication, in which the size and content of the nuclear genome is instantly doubled, represents one of the most profound forms of mutational change. The consequences of duplication events are equally monumental, especially considering that almost all eukaryotes have undergone whole genome duplications during their evolutionary history. While myriad genetic, cellular, organismal, and ecological effects of whole genome duplications have been extensively documented, relatively little attention has been paid to the diminutive but essential \"other\" genomes present inside the cell, those of chloroplasts and mitochondria. In this study, we compared the evolutionary patterns of >340,000 genes from 23 species to test whether whole genome duplications are associated with genetic mismatches between the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes. We discovered tremendous differences between duplicated copies of nuclear genomes; however, mitochondria-nuclear and chloroplast-nuclear mismatches do not appear to be common following whole genome duplications. Together these genomic data represent the most extensive analysis yet performed on how polyploids maintain the delicate and finely tuned balance between the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes.",

    "abstract": "Speech stands out in the natural world as a biological signal that communicates formally-specifiable complex meanings. However, the acoustic and physical dynamics of speech do not injectively mark the linguistic structure and meaning that we perceive. Linguistic structure must therefore be inferred through the human brains endogenous mechanisms, which remain poorly understood. Using electroencephalography, we investigated the neural response to synthesized spoken phrases and sentences that were closely physically-matched but differed in syntactic structure, under either linguistic or non-linguistic task conditions. Differences in syntactic structure were well-captured in theta band ([~] 2 to 7 Hz) phase coherence, phase connectivity degree at low frequencies (< [~] 2 Hz), and in both intensity and degree of power connectivity of induced neural response in the alpha band ([~] 7.5 to 13.5 Hz). Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was found when participants listened to speech, but it did not discriminate between syntactic structures. Spectral-temporal response function modelling suggested different encoding states in both temporal and spectral dimensions as a function of the amount and type of linguistic structure perceived, over and above the acoustically-driven neural response. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of how the brain separates linguistic structures in the dynamics of neural responses, and imply that phase synchronization and strength of connectivity can be used as readouts for constituent structure, providing a novel basis for future neurophysiological research on linguistic structure in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Successful sentence comprehension requires the binding, or composition, of multiple words into larger structures to establish meaning. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated the neural mechanisms involved in binding at the syntax level, in a task where contributions from semantics were minimized. Participants were auditorily presented with minimal sentences that required binding (pronoun and pseudo-verb with the corresponding morphological inflection; \"she grushes\") and pseudo-verb wordlists that did not require binding (\"cugged grushes\"). Relative to no binding, we found that syntactic binding was associated with a modulation in alpha band (8-12 Hz) activity in left-lateralized language regions. First, we observed a significantly smaller increase in alpha power around the presentation of the target word (\"grushes\") that required binding (-0.05s to 0.1s), which we suggest reflects an expectation of binding to occur. Second, during binding of the target word (0.15s to 0.25s), we observed significantly decreased alpha phase-locking between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left middle/inferior temporal cortex, which we suggest reflects alpha-driven cortical disinhibition serving to strengthen communication within the syntax composition neural network. Together, our findings highlight the critical role of rapid spatial-temporal alpha band activity in controlling the allocation, transfer and coordination of the brains resources during syntax composition.",

    "abstract": "Many studies point toward volume reductions in the amygdala as a potential neurostructural marker for trait aggression. However, most of these findings stem from clinical samples, rendering unclear whether the findings generalize to non-clinical populations. Furthermore, the notion of neural networks suggests that interregional correlations in grey matter volume (i.e., structural covariance) can explain individual differences in aggressive behavior beyond local univariate associations. Here, we tested whether structural covariance between amygdala subregions and the rest of the brain is associated with self-reported aggression in a large sample of healthy young students (n=263; 51% women). Salivary testosterone concentrations were measured for a subset of n=76 participants (45% women), allowing us to investigate the influence of endogenous testosterone on structural covariance. Aggressive individuals showed enhanced covariance between superficial amygdala (SFA) and dorsal anterior insula (dAI), but lower covariance between laterobasal amygdala (LBA) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). These structural patterns overlap with functional networks involved in the genesis and regulation of aggressive behavior, respectively. With increasing endogenous testosterone, we observed stronger structural covariance between centromedial amygdala (CMA) and medial prefrontal cortex in men and between CMA and orbitofrontal cortex in women. These results speak for structural covariance of amygdala subregions as a robust correlate of trait aggression in healthy individuals. Moreover, regions that showed structural covariance with the amygdala modulated by either testosterone or aggression did not overlap, speaking for a more complex role of testosterone in human social behavior rather than the simple assumption that testosterone only increases aggressiveness.",

Here, stable synthetic co-cultures of the anaerobic fungus Caecomyces churrovis and the methanogen Methanobacterium bryantii (not native to the rumen) were formed, demonstrating that microbes from different environments can be paired based on metabolic ties. Transcriptional and metabolic changes induced by methanogen co-culture were evaluated in C. churrovis across a variety of substrates to identify mechanisms that impact biomass breakdown and sugar uptake. A high-quality genome of C. churrovis was obtained and annotated, which is the first sequenced genome of a non-rhizoid forming anaerobic fungus. C. churrovis possess an abundance of CAZymes and carbohydrate binding modules and, in agreement with previous studies of early-diverging fungal lineages, N6-methyldeoxyadenine (6mA) was associated with transcriptionally active genes. Co-culture with the methanogen increased overall transcription of CAZymes, carbohydrate binding modules, and dockerin domains in co-cultures grown on both lignocellulose and cellulose and caused upregulation of genes coding associated enzymatic machinery including carbohydrate binding modules in family 18 and dockerin domains across multiple growth substrates relative to C. churrovis monoculture. Two other fungal strains grown on a reed canary grass substrate in co-culture with the same methanogen also exhibited high log2fold change values for upregulation of genes encoding carbohydrate binding modules in families 1 and 18. Transcriptional upregulation indicated that co-culture of the C. churrovis strain with a methanogen may enhance pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) function for growth on xylan and fructose and production of bottleneck enzymes in sugar utilization pathways, further supporting the hypothesis that co-culture with a methanogen may enhance certain fungal metabolic functions. Upregulation of CBM18 may play a role in fungal-methanogen physical associations and fungal cell wall development and remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Coactivator complexes regulate chromatin accessibility and transcription. SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase) is an evolutionary conserved coactivator complex. The core module scaffolds the entire SAGA complex and adopts a histone octamer-like structure, which consists of six histone fold domain (HFD)-containing proteins forming three histone fold (HF) pairs, to which the double HFD-containing SUPT3H adds an HF pair. Spt3, the yeast ortholog of SUPT3H, interacts genetically and biochemically with the TATA binding protein (TBP) and contributes to global RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. Here we demonstrate that i) SAGA purified from human U2OS or mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) can assemble without SUPT3H; ii) SUPT3H is not essential for mESC survival, iii) SUPT3H is required for mESC growth and self-renewal, and iv) the loss of SUPT3H from mammalian cells affects the transcription of only a specific subset of genes. Accordingly, in the absence of SUPT3H no major change in TBP accumulation at gene promoters was observed. Thus, SUPT3H is not required for the assembly of SAGA, TBP recruitment, or overall Pol II transcription, but plays a role in mESC growth and self-renewal. Our data further suggest that yeast and mammalian SAGA complexes contribute to transcription regulation by distinct mechanisms.",

We investigated the 3D genome organization of developing murine T cells and identified SATB1, a tissue-specific genome organizer, enriched at the anchors of promoter-enhancer chromatin loops. We assessed the function of SATB1 in T cell chromatin organization and compared it to the conventional genome organizer CTCF. SATB1 builds a more refined layer of genome organization upon a CTCF scaffold. To understand the regulatory implications of SATB1 loopscape structure, we generated Satb1fl/flCd4-Cre+ (Satb1 cKO) conditional knockout animals which suffered from autoimmunity. We aimed to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for the deregulation of the immune system in Satb1 cKO animals. H3K27ac HiChIP and Hi-C experiments indicated that SATB1 primarily mediates promoter-enhancer loops affecting master regulator genes (such as Bcl6), the T cell receptor locus and adhesion molecule genes, collectively being critical for cell lineage specification and immune system homeostasis. Our findings unravel the function of a tissue-specific factor that controls transcription programs, via spatial chromatin arrangements complementary to the chromatin structure imposed by ubiquitously expressed genome organizers.",
