    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile PCR ribotype (RT) 017 ranks among the most successful strains of C. difficile in the world. In the past three decades, it has caused outbreaks on four continents, more than other \"epidemic\" strains, however, our understanding of the genomic epidemiology underpinning the spread of C. difficile RT 017 is limited. Here, we performed high-resolution phylogenomic and Bayesian evolutionary analyses on an updated and more representative dataset of 282 non-clonal C. difficile RT 017 isolates collected worldwide between 1981 and 2019. These analyses place an estimated time of global dissemination between 1953 and 1983 and identified the acquisition of the ermB-positive transposon Tn6194 as a key factor behind global emergence. This coincided with the introduction of clindamycin, a key inciter of C. difficile infection, into clinical practice in the 1960s. Based on the genomic data alone, the origin of C. difficile RT 017 could not be determined, however, geographical data and records of population movement suggest that C. difficile RT 017 had been moving between Asia and Europe since the Middle Ages and was later transported to North America around 1860 (95% CI: 1622 - 1954). A focused epidemiological study of 45 clinical C. difficile RT 017 genomes from a cluster in a tertiary hospital in Thailand revealed that the population consisted of two groups of multidrug-resistant (MDR) C. difficile RT 017 and a group of early, non-MDR C. difficile RT 017. The significant genomic diversity within each MDR group suggests that although they were all isolated from hospitalised patients, there was likely a reservoir of C. difficile RT 017 in the community that contributed to the spread of this pathogen.\n\nImpact statementThis study utilises genomic sequence data from 282 non-clonal C. difficile ribotype (RT) 017 isolates collected from around the world to delineate the origin and spread of this epidemic lineage, as well as explore possible factors that have driven its success. It also reports a focused epidemiological investigation of a cluster of C. difficile RT 017 in a tertiary hospital in Thailand to identify possible sources of transmission in this specific setting.\n\nData summaryAll new WGS data generated in this study has been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive under the BioProject PRJEB44406 (sample accession ERS6268756 - ERS6268798). The complete genome of C. difficile MAR286 was submitted to GenBank under BioProject PRJNA679085 (accession CP072118). Details of all genomes included in the final analyses are available in the Supplementary Document, available at 10.6084/m9.figshare.14544792.",

    "abstract": "Many plant-associated bacteria produce plant- mimicking hormones which are involved in modulating host physiology. However, their function in modulating bacterial physiology has not been reported. Here we show that the XopQ protein, a type-III effector of the rice pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is involved in cytokinin biosynthesis. Xoo produces and secretes an active form of cytokinin which enables the bacterium to maintain a planktonic lifestyle and promotes virulence. RNA-seq analysis indicates that the cytokinin produced by Xoo is required for the regulation of several genes which are involved in biofilm formation. We have also identified the Xoo isopentenyl transferase gene, which is involved in the cytokinin biosynthesis pathway and is required for maintaining planktonic behaviour and virulence. Furthermore, mutations in the predicted cytokinin receptor kinase (PcrK) and the downstream response regulator (PcrR) of Xoo phenocopy the cytokinin biosynthetic mutants, but are not complemented by supplementation with exogenous cytokinin. Cytokinin biosynthetic functions are encoded in a number of diverse bacterial genomes suggesting that cytokinin may be a widespread signalling molecule in the bacterial kingdom.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) act through multiple mechanisms with their sequence features to fine-tune gene expression networks. Due to overlapping sequences with linear cognates, identifying internal sequences of circRNAs remains a great challenge, which hinders comprehensive understanding of circRNA functions and mechanisms. Here, based on rolling circular reverse transcription (RCRT) and nanopore sequencing, we developed circFL-seq, a full-length circRNA sequencing method, to profile circRNA at the isoform level. With a customized computational pipeline circfull to directly identify full-length sequences from rolling circular reads, we reconstructed 77,606 high-quality circRNAs from seven human cell lines and two human tissues. Benefiting from rolling circles and long-read sequencing, circFL-seq showed more than tenfold enrichment of circRNA reads and advantages for both detection and quantification at the isoform level compared to short-read RNA sequencing. The concordance of RT-qPCR and circFL-seq results for the identification of differential alternative splicing suggested wide application prospects for functional studies of internal variants in circRNAs. Moreover, the detection of cancer-related fusion circRNAs at the omics scale may further expand the application of circFL-seq. Together, the accurate identification and quantification of full-length circRNAs make circFL-seq a potential tool for large-scale screening of functional circRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Spatial competition in the intertidal zones drives the community structure in marine benthic habitats. Organisms inhabiting these areas not only need to withstand fluctuations of temperature, water level, pH, and salinity, but also need to compete for the best available space. Sponges are key members of the intertidal zones, and their life history processes (e.g. growth, reproduction, and regeneration) are affected by competition. Here we used transcriptomics to investigate the effects of interspecific competition between the tetillid sponge Cinachyrella cf. cavernosa, the zoantharid Zoanthus sansibaricus, and the macroalgae Dictyota ciliolata. The analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that Z. sansibaricus was the most stressful competitor to C. cf. cavernosa, which showed an increased rate of cellular respiration under stress of competition. Similarly, an up-regulation of energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and the heat-shock protein (HSP) 70 was also observed along with an indication of a viral infection and decreased ability to synthesise protein. A down-regulation of purine and pyrimidine metabolism indicated reduction in physiological activities of the competing sponges. Moreover, a putative case of possible kleptocnidism, not previously reported in Cinachyrella cf. cavernosa was also observed. This study opens the door for more detailed investigations of marine organisms competing for spatial resources using transcriptome data.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how organisms adapt to the environment is a major goal of modern biology. Parallel evolution - the independent evolution of similar phenotypes in different populations - provides a powerful framework to investigate the evolutionary potential of populations, the constraints of evolution, its repeatability and therefore its predictability. Here, we quantified the degree of gene expression and functional parallelism across replicated ecotype formation in Heliosperma pusillum (Caryophyllaceae), and gained insights into the architecture of adaptive traits. Population structure analyses and demographic modelling support a previously formulated hypothesis of parallel polytopic divergence of montane and alpine ecotypes. We detect a large proportion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) underlying divergence within each replicate ecotype pair, with a strikingly low amount of shared DEGs across pairs. Functional enrichment of DEGs reveals that the traits affected by significant expression divergence are largely consistent across ecotype pairs, in strong contrast to the non-shared genetic basis. The remarkable redundancy of differential gene expression indicates a polygenic architecture for the diverged adaptive traits. We conclude that polygenic traits appear key to opening multiple routes for adaptation, widening the adaptive potential of organisms.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCo-sexuality has evolved repeatedly from ancestors with separate sexes across a wide range of taxa. The switch to co-sexuality is expected to involve major molecular readjustments at the level of gene expression patterns, as modified males or females will express the opposite sexual function for which their phenotypes have been optimized. However, the molecular changes underpinning this important transition remain unknown, particularly in organisms with haploid sexual systems such as bryophytes, red and brown algae. Here, we explore four independent events of emergence of co-sexuality from uni-sexual (dioicous) ancestors in brown algal clades in order to examine the nature, evolution and degree of convergence of gene expression changes that accompany the breakdown of dioicy. The amount of male versus female phenotypic differences in dioicous species were not correlated with the extent of sex-biased gene expression, in strike contrast to what is observed in animals. Although sex-biased genes exhibited a high turnover rate during brown alga diversification, their predicted functions were remarkably conserved. Transition to co-sexuality consistently involved adaptive gene expression shifts and rapid sequence evolution, particularly of male-biased genes. The gene expression profiles of co-sexual species were more similar to those of females than to males of related dioicous species, suggesting that the former may have arisen from ancestral females. Finally, we identified extensive convergent gene expression changes associated with the transition to co-sexuality, and these changes appear to be driven by selection. Together, our observations provide novel insights on how co-sexual systems arise from ancestral, haploid UV sexual systems.",

Our lead compound can bind adjacent to the active site zinc ions (Zn1 and Zn2) in all highly resistant NDM variants. CID-53986787 possesses ~5-8% higher binding affinity than Captopril, exhibiting molecular interactions with crucial residues that can destabilize the hydrolytic activity of NDM.

Although physical confinement of cell assemblies has been shown to elicit specific patterns of collective movement in various cell types, endothelial migration in vivo often occurs without confinement. Here we show that unconfined endothelial cell monolayers on microgrooved substrates that mimic the anisotropic organization of the extracellular matrix exhibit a new type of collective movement that takes the form of a periodic pattern of anti-parallel cell streams. We further establish that the development of these streams requires intact cell-cell junctions and that stream sizes are particularly sensitive to groove depth. Finally, we show that modeling the endothelial cell sheet as an active fluid with the microgrooves acting as constraints on cell orientation predicts the occurrence of the periodic anti-parallel cell streams as well as their lengths and widths. We posit that in unconfined cell assemblies, physical factors that constrain or bias cellular orientation such as anisotropic extracellular matrix cues or directed flow-derived shear forces dictate the pattern of collective cell movement.",

The anterior insular cortex (aIC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are heavily implicated in salience and novelty processing, and specifically, the processing of taste sensory information. Here, we examined the role of aIC-mPFC reciprocal connectivity in novel taste neophobia and memory formation, in mice. Using pERK and neuronal intrinsic properties as markers for neuronal activation, and retrograde AAV (rAAV) constructs for connectivity, we demonstrate a correlation between aIC-mPFC activity and novel taste experience. Furthermore, by expressing inhibitory chemogenetic receptors in these projections, we show that aIC-to-mPFC activity is necessary for both taste neophobia and its attenuation. However, activity within mPFC-to-aIC projections is essential only for the neophobic reaction but not for the learning process. These results provide an insight into the cortical circuitry needed to detect, react to- and learn salient stimuli, a process critically involved in psychiatric disorders.",

Using a novel computational model to analyse a high-powered naturalistic audiovisual movie-watching dataset, we simultaneously estimate spectral tuning properties and category selectivity to reveal the modes of organisation and computational motifs that characterise human auditory cortex. We find that regions more remote from the auditory core exhibit more compressive, non-linear response properties and finely-tuned, speech-selective receptive fields in low frequency portions of the tonotopic map. These patterns of organisation mirror aspects of the visual cortical hierarchy, wherein tuning properties progress from a stimulus category-agnostic  front end towards more advanced regions increasingly optimised for behaviorally relevant stimulus categories.",

    "abstract": "Identifying species interactions in a microbial community and how this relates to community function is a key challenge. Towards addressing this challenge, we present here an extensive genome-resolved, longitudinal dataset and associated metadata. We collected weekly samples of microbial communities and recorded operating conditions from industrial methane producing anaerobic digestion reactors for a year. This allowed us to recover 2240 dereplicated metagenome assembled genomes (dMAGs), together with their coverage dynamics and functional annotations from which functional traits were inferred. Of these dMAGs, 1910 were novel species, with 22 representing novel orders and classes. Methanogenic communities are expected to be strongly structured by syntrophic and other associations between the methanogens and syntrophs that produce their substrates. We identified 450 potential syntrophic dMAGs by searching for pairs of methanogenic and non-methanogenic dMAGs that had highly correlated time-series. Genomes of potential syntrophs were enriched for oxidoreductases and sugar transport genes and there was a strong taxonomic signal in their associations with methanogens. Of particular note, we found that Bathyarchaeiea associated specifically with methanogens from the Thermoplasmata, and Thermococci classes. Same syntrophic associations were only rarely observed across multiple reactors, suggesting that syntrophies might be facultative, with particular strains within a species forming syntrophic associations only sometimes and not necessarily always with the same methanogenic partner. The presented results show that longitudinal metagenomics is a highly valuable approach for identifying species and their interactions in microbial communities.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLongitudinal study of microbial communities identifies novel species and predicts their interactions and role in community function.",

    "abstract": "A major therapeutic obstacle in diabetes mellitus is the metabolic or hyperglycemic memory: the persistence of impaired organ function despite improvement of blood glucose. Therapies reversing the hyperglycemic memory and thus improving already established organ-dysfunction are lacking, but urgently needed considering the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide. Here we show that glucose-mediated changes in gene expression largely persist in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) despite reversing hyperglycemia. The senescence-associated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Cdkn1a) was the top hit among genes persistently induced by hyperglycemia and was associated with sustained induction of the p53-p21 pathway. Persistent p21 induction was confirmed in various animal models, in several independent human samples and in in vitro models. Tubular p21 expression and urinary p21-levels were associated with DKD severity and remained elevated despite improved blood glucose levels in humans, suggesting that p21 may be a biomarker indicating persistent (\"memorized\") kidney damage. Glucose-mediated p21 induction and tubular senescence were enhanced in mice with reduced levels of the disease resolving protease activated protein C (aPC). Mechanistically, glucose-induced and sustained tubular p21 expression is linked with demethylation of its promoter and reduced DNMT1 expression. aPC reverses already established p21 expression independent of its anticoagulant function through receptor signaling. Accordingly, new pharmacological approaches specifically mimicking aPC signaling (3K3A-aPC, parmodulin-2) enabled the reversal of glucose-mediated sustained tubular p21 expression, tubular senescence, and DKD. Thus, p21-dependent tubular senescence contributes to the hyperglycemic memory but can be therapeutically targeted.\n\nSingle sentence summaryaPC signaling targets persistent p21 expression and tubular senescence and reverses the hyperglycemic memory in diabetic kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Dividing eukaryotic cells package extremely long chromosomal DNA molecules into discrete bodies to enable microtubule-mediated transport of one genome copy to each of the newly forming daughter cells1-3. Assembly of mitotic chromosomes involves DNA looping by condensin4-8 and chromatin compaction by global histone deacetylation9-13. While condensin confers mechanical resistance towards spindle pulling forces14-16, it is not known how histone deacetylation affects material properties and segregation mechanics of mitotic chromosomes. Here, we show how global histone deacetylation at the onset of mitosis induces a chromatin-intrinsic phase transition that endows chromosomes with specific characteristics necessary for their precise movement during cellular division. Deacetylation-mediated compaction of chromatin forms a structure dense in negative charge and allows mitotic chromosomes to resist perforation by microtubules as they are pushed to the metaphase plate. Hyperacetylated mitotic chromosomes lack a defined surface boundary, are frequently perforated by microtubules, and are prone to missegregation. Our study highlights the different contributions of DNA loop formation and chromatin-intrinsic phase separation to genome segregation in dividing cells.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate Delta/Notch signaling involves multiple ligands, receptors and transcription factors. Delta endocytosis - a critical event for Notch activation - is however essentially controlled by the E3 Ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1). Due to its position at a molecular bottleneck of the pathway, Mib1 inactivation is often used to inhibit Notch signaling. However, recent findings indicate that the importance of Mib1 extends beyond the Notch pathway. We report an essential role of Mib1 in Planar Cell Polarity (PCP).\n\nmib1 null mutants or morphants display impaired gastrulation stage Convergence Extension (CE) movements. Comparison of different mib1 mutants and functional rescue experiments indicate that Mib1 controls CE independently of Notch. In contrast, Mib1-dependent CE defects can be rescued using the PCP downstream mediator RhoA. Mib1 regulates CE through the RING Finger domains that have been implicated in substrate ubiquitination, suggesting that Mib1 may control PCP protein trafficking. Accordingly, we show that Mib1 controls the endocytosis of the PCP component Ryk and that Ryk internalization is required for CE.\n\nNumerous morphogenetic processes involve both Notch and PCP signaling. We show that Mib1, a known Notch signaling regulator, is also an essential PCP pathway component. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting Mib1 loss of function phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Embigin (gp70), a transmembrane glycoprotein, has been shown to regulate hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell niche. Still, little is known about its expression and function in other organ systems during development or adulthood. By combining immunofluorescence, RNA sequencing, and in vivo mouse models, we show that embigin is highly expressed during development and in adult lung, kidney, epididymis, skin, and testis. Adult Emb-/- mice have a normal lifespan and fertility without apparent pathologies. In contrast, the Emb-/- embryos are significantly smaller than their WT littermates. Markedly increased mortality of the Emb-/- embryos is seen especially during the neonatal period. Embigin is present in the placenta, but placental morphology and gene expression patterns stay unaltered. At E17.5, Emb-/- mice show defective morphogenesis of the lung, low alkaline phosphatase activity in amniotic fluid, and remarkable activation of genes involved in cell proliferation in the lungs. Thus, lung underdevelopment explains the high neonatal mortality. Our work demonstrates the crucial role of embigin during development, and it paves the way to further characterization of embigin in specific organ systems in development and homeostasis.\n\nSummary statementEmbigin is a basigin-group transmembrane glycoprotein. In vivo mouse model shows that embigin is crucial for embryonic lung development and neonatal survival.",

During endochondral ossification, periosteal vasculatures and stromal progenitors invade the primary avascular cartilaginous anlage; this induces primitive marrow development. We previously determined that bone marrow podoplanin (PDPN)-expressing stromal cells exist in a perivascular microenvironment, and promote megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis. In this study, we aimed to examine the involvement of PDPN-expressing stromal cells in the postnatal bone marrow generation. We found that periosteum-derived PDPN-expressing stromal cells regulate vascularization during postnatal epiphyseal marrow development. Our findings suggest that these cells act as pericytes on the primitive vasculature of the nascent marrow. They invade the cartilaginous epiphysis and regulate marrow development and homeostasis by maintaining vascular integrity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine how PDPN-expressing stromal cells contribute to marrow development and homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Development entails patterned emergence of diverse cell types within the embryo. In mammals, cells positioned inside the embryo gives rise to the inner cell mass (ICM) that eventually forms the embryo proper. Yet the molecular basis of how these cells recognise their  inside position to instruct their fate is unknown. Here we show that cells perceive their position through extracellular matrix (ECM) and integrin-mediated adhesion. Provision of ECM to isolated embryonic cells induces ICM specification and alters subsequent spatial arrangement between epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PrE) cells that emerge within the ICM. Notably, this effect is dependent on integrin {beta}1 activity and involves apical to basal conversion of cell polarity. We demonstrate that ECM-integrin activity is sufficient for  inside positional signalling and it is required for proper sorting of EPI/PrE cells. Our findings thus highlight the significance of ECM-integrin adhesion in enabling position-sensing by cells to achieve tissue patterning.",

    "abstract": "For the effective control of an invasive species, gathering as much information as possible on its ecology, establishment and persistence in the subjected communities is of utmost importance. We aimed to review the current distribution and characteristics of Sporobolus cryptandrus (sand dropseed), an invasive C4 grass species of North American origin recently discovered in Hungary. We aimed to provide information on (i) its current distribution paying special attention to its invasion in Eurasia; (ii) the characteristics of the invaded habitats in Central Europe; (iii) seed bank formation and germination characteristics, crucial factors in early establishment; and (iv) the effects of its increasing cover on vegetation composition. Finally, we aimed to (v) point out further research directions that could enable us to understand the invasion success of this potential invasive species. Field surveys uncovered large stands of the species in Central and Eastern Hungary with most of the locations in the former, especially the Kiskunsag region. The species invaded disturbed stands of dry and open sand grasslands, closed dune slack grasslands and it also penetrates into natural open sand grasslands from neighbouring disturbed habitats. Increasing cover of Sporobolus cryptandrus caused a decline in species richness and abundance of subordinate species both in the vegetation and seed banks, but a low density of Sporobolus cryptandrus can even have a weak positive effect on these characteristics. Viable seeds of Sporobolus were detected from all soil layers (2.5 cm layers measured from the surface to 10 cm in depth), which indicates that the species is able to form a persistent seed bank (1,114 to 3,077 seeds/m2 with increasing scores towards higher abundance of the species in vegetation). Germination of Sporobolus cryptandrus was negatively affected by both litter cover and 1 cm deep soil burial. To sum up, Sporobolus cryptandrus can be considered as a transformer invasive species, whose spread forms a high risk for dry sand and steppe grasslands in Eurasia. We can conclude that for the effective suppression of the species it is necessary: (i) to clarify the origin of the detected populations; (ii) to assess its competitive ability including its potential allelopathic effects; (iii) to assess its seed bank formation potential in habitats with different abiotic conditions; and (iv) to assess the possibility of its suppression by natural enemies and management techniques such as mowing or livestock grazing.",

Although butyrate could promote histone acetylation by inhibiting histone deacetylases, it may also undergo oxidation to acetyl-CoA, a necessary cofactor for histone acetyltransferases. Here, we find that epithelial cells from germ-free mice harbor a loss of histone H4 acetylation across the genome except at promoter regions. Using stable isotope tracing in vivo with 13C-labeled fiber, we demonstrate that the microbiota supplies carbon for histone acetylation. Subsequent metabolomic profiling revealed hundreds of labeled molecules and supported a microbial contribution to host fatty acid metabolism, which declined in response to colitis and correlated with reduced expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. These results illuminate the flow of carbon from the diet to the host via the microbiota, disruptions to which may affect energy homeostasis in the distal gut and contribute to the development of colitis.",

    "abstract": "Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) are a convenient class of enzymes used to synthesize enantiopure alcohols. Several studies describe native or engineered SDRs for converting substrates of interest using cost and time-intensive high-throughput approaches. The classification of SDRs is based on chain length and cofactor binding site. Of these, the shorter  Classical and the longer  Extended enzymes participate in ketoreduction. However, comparative analysis of various modelled SDRs reveals a length independent conserved N-terminal Rossmann fold and a variable C-terminus region for both types. The general hypothesis is that the latter domain influences the enzymes flexibility that may affect the observed promiscuity of the enzyme. We have used a machine learning algorithm on this flexible domain to build a rationale to screen promiscuous candidates. We have built a data set consisting of physicochemical properties derived from the amino-acid composition of enzymes to select closely associated promiscuous mesophilic enzymes. The resulting in vitro studies on pro-pharmaceutical substrates illustrate a direct correlation between the C-terminal lid-loop structure, enzyme melting temperature and the turnover number. We present a walkthrough for exploring promiscuous SDRs for catalyzing enantiopure alcohols of industrial importance.",

Antibody-targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors to reverse T cell exhaustion is a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. However, the therapeutic efficacy of known immune checkpoint inhibitors remains low. To expand the potential effective targets to reverse T cell exhaustion, a meta-analysis was performed to integrate seven exhaustion datasets caused by multiple diseases in both humans and mice. In this study, an overlap of 21 upregulated and 37 downregulated genes was identified in human and mouse exhausted CD8+ T cells. These genes were significantly enriched in exhaustion response-related pathways, such as signal transduction, immune system processes, and regulation of cytokine production. Gene expression network analysis revealed that the well-documented exhaustion genes were defined as hub genes in upregulated genes, such as programmed cell death protein 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4. In addition, a weighted gene co-expression analysis identified 175 overlapping genes that were significantly correlated with the exhaustion trait in both humans and mice. This study found that nine genes, including thymocyte selection associated high mobility group box and CD200 receptor 1, were significantly upregulated and highly related to T cell exhaustion. These genes should be additional robust targets for immunotherapy and T-cell dysfunction studies.",

    "abstract": "SAMHD1 is discussed as a tumour suppressor protein, but its potential role in cancer has only been investigated in very few cancer types. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of the TCGA (adult cancer) and TARGET (paediatric cancer) databases, the results of which did not suggest that SAMHD1 should be regarded as a bona fide tumour suppressor. SAMHD1 mutations that interfere with SAMHD1 function were not associated with poor outcome, which would be expected for a tumour suppressor. High SAMHD1 tumour levels were associated with increased survival in some cancer entities and reduced survival in others. Moreover, the data suggested differences in the role of SAMHD1 between males and females and between different races. Often, there was no significant relationship between SAMHD1 levels and cancer outcome. Taken together, our results indicate that SAMHD1 may exert pro-or anti-tumourigenic effects and that SAMHD1 is involved in the oncogenic process in a minority of cancer cases. These findings seem to be in disaccord with a perception and narrative forming in the field suggesting that SAMHD1 is a tumour suppressor. A systematic literature review confirmed that most of the available scientific articles focus on a potential role of SAMHD1 as a tumour suppressor. The reasons for this remain unclear but may include confirmation bias and publication bias. Our findings emphasise that hypotheses, perceptions, and assumptions need to be continuously challenged by using all available data and evidence.",

    "abstract": "CXCL17 is the most recently described chemokine. It is principally expressed by mucosal tissues, where it facilitates chemotaxis of monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages and has antimicrobial properties. CXCL17 is also implicated in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and progression of several cancers, as well as being highly upregulated during viral infections of the lung. However, the exact role of CXCL17 in health and disease is largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of known molecular targets mediating CXCL17 functional responses. Using a range of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) based assays, here we demonstrate that CXCL17 inhibits CXCR4-mediated signalling and ligand binding. Moreover, CXCL17 interacts with neuropillin-1, a VEGFR2 co-receptor. Additionally, we find CXCL17 only inhibits CXCR4 ligand binding in intact cells and demonstrate that this effect is mimicked by known glycosaminoglycan binders, surfen and protamine sulfate. This indicates that CXCL17 inhibits CXCR4 by a unique mechanism of action that potentially requires the presence of a glycosaminoglycan containing accessory protein. Altogether, our results reveal that CXCL17 is an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4 and represents an important discovery in our understanding of the (patho) physiological functions of CXCL17 and regulation of CXCR4 signalling.",

    "abstract": "Temporal identity factors are sufficient to reprogram developmental competence of neural progenitors, but whether they could also reprogram the identity of fully differentiated cells is unknown. To address this question, we designed a conditional gene expression system combined with genetic lineage tracing that allows rapid screening of potential reprogramming factors in the mouse retina. Using this assay, we report that co-expression of the early temporal identity transcription factor Ikzf1, together with Ikzf4, another Ikaros family member, is sufficient to directly convert adult Muller glial cells into neuron-like cells in vivo, without inducing a proliferative progenitor state. scRNA-seq analysis shows that the reprogrammed cells share some transcriptional signatures with both cone photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Furthermore, we show that co-expression of Ikzf1 and Ikzf4 can reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neurons by remodeling chromatin and promoting a neuronal gene expression program. This work uncovers general neuronal reprogramming properties for temporal identity factors in differentiated cells, opening new opportunities for cell therapy development.",

    "abstract": "Cortical remapping after hand loss in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is thought to be predominantly dictated by cortical proximity, with adjacent body parts remapping into the deprived area. Traditionally, this remapping has been characterised by changes in the lip representation, which is assumed to be the immediate neighbour of the hand based on electrophysiological research in non-human primates. However, the orientation of facial somatotopy in humans is debated, with contrasting work reporting both an inverted and upright topography. We aimed to fill this gap in the S1 homunculus by investigating the topographic organisation of the face. Using both univariate and multivariate approaches we examined the extent of face-to-hand remapping in individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand (hereafter one-handers and amputees, respectively), relative to two-handed controls. Participants were asked to move different facial parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) during fMRI scanning. We first report evidence for an upright facial organisation in all three groups, with the upper face and not the lips bordering the hand area. We further found little evidence for remapping of all tested facial parts in amputees, with no significant relationship to the chronicity of their PLP. In contrast, we found converging evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers across all facial parts, where the location of the cortical neighbour - the forehead - is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently activated by the lips and the tongue. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.",

    "abstract": "The present experiment aimed at investigating the decision-making and the associated event-related potentials (ERPs) of subordinates under hierarchical pressure. Participants (N = 33) acted as UAV operators and had to decide to crash their defective drone either on a civilian site killing all civilians present on the site or on a military site destroying military material but preventing any human losses. While in the no-command condition, participants decided according to their own preferences, in the command condition they were ordered to protect the military material at the expense of civilians for undisclosed strategic reasons. The results revealed that in the no-command condition participants almost always crashed the drone on the military site (96%), whereas in the command condition they chose to obey orders and sacrifice civilians to protect the military material 33% of the time. In the command condition, participants were longer to make their decisions, mobilizing greater attentional and cognitive resources (i.e., greater P300 responses) to resolve the conflict between their internal moral values and the orders they were given (i.e., greater N200 responses) than in the no-command condition, where they automatically applied the \"you shall not kill\" rule. Participants also showed a greater negative affective response (i.e., greater P260 amplitudes) after choosing to disobey than to obey orders. This result suggests that disobeying authority could be perceived as a greater moral violation than obeying and sacrificing civilians, suggesting that individuals may sometimes choose to obey malevolent authority to avoid the negative affective reaction triggered by disobedience.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorder (ALS/FTD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease; up to 10% of cases are familial, usually arising from single dominant mutations in >30 causative genes. Transgenic mouse models that overexpress human ALS/FTD causative genes have been the preferred organism for in vivo modelling. However, while conferring human protein biochemistry, these overexpression models are not ideal for dosage-sensitive proteins such as TDP-43 or FUS.\n\nWe have created three next-generation genomically humanised knock-in mouse models for ALS/FTD research, by replacing the entire mouse coding region of Sod1, Tardbp (TDP-43) and Fus, with their human orthologues to preserve human protein biochemistry, with exons and introns intact to enable future modelling of coding or non-coding mutations and variants and to preserve human splice variants. In generating these mice, we have established a new-standard of quality control: we demonstrate the utility of indirect capture for enrichment of a region of interest followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing for robustly characterising large knock-in alleles. This approach confirmed that targeting occurred at the correct locus and to map homologous recombination events. Furthermore, extensive expression data from the three lines shows that homozygous humanised animals only express human protein, at endogenous levels. Characterisation of humanised FUS animals showed that they are phenotypically normal compared to wildtype littermates throughout their lifespan.\n\nThese humanised mouse strains are critically needed for preclinical assessment of interventions, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), to modulate expression levels in patients, and will serve as templates for the addition of human ALS/FTD mutations to dissect disease pathomechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Hypersensitivity, stereotyped behaviors and attentional problems in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are compatible with inefficient filtering of undesired or irrelevant sensory information at early stages of neural processing. This could stem from delays in the neurotypical development of the functional segregation between cortical and subcortical brain processes, as suggested by previous findings of overconnectivity between primary sensory regions and deep brain nuclei in ASD.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we used dynamic causal modelling to quantify the effect of age on the development of (1) cortical functional segregation from subcortical activity and (2) directional influence of subcortical activity on cortical processing in 166 participants with ASD and 193 typically developing controls (TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE).\n\nWe found that in TD participants age was significantly associated with increased functional segregation of cortical sensory processing from subcortical activity, paralleled by a decreased influence of subcortical activity on cortical processing. Instead these effects were highly reduced and mostly absent in ASD participants, suggesting a delayed or arrested development of the segregation between subcortical and cortical sensory processing in ASD.\n\nThis atypical configuration of subcortico-cortical connectivity in ASD can result in an excessive amount of unprocessed sensory information relayed to the cortex, which is likely to impact cognitive functioning in everyday situations where it is beneficial to limit the influence of basic sensory information on cognitive processing, such as activities requiring focused attention or social interactions.",

    "abstract": "The resistance and resilience provided by functional redundancy, a common feature of microbial communities, is not always advantageous. An example is nitrite oxidation in partial nitritation-anammox (PNA) reactors during wastewater treatment, where suppression of nitrite oxidizers like Nitrospira is sought. In these ecosystems, biofilms provide microhabitats with oxygen gradients, allowing the coexistence aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. We designed a disturbance experiment where PNA biofilms treating water from a high rate activated sludge process removing organic matter (mainstream wastewater), were constantly or intermittently exposed to the effluent of anaerobic sewage sludge digestion dewatering (sidestream wastewater), which has been proposed to inhibit nitrite oxidizers. With increasing sidestream exposure we observed decreased abundance, alpha-diversity, functional versatility, and hence functional redundancy, among Nitrospira in the PNA biofilms, while the opposite patterns were observed for anammox bacteria within Brocadia. At the same time, species turnover was observed for the aerobic ammonia-oxidizing Nitrosomonas populations. The different exposure regimens were associated with metagenomic assembled genomes of Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, and Brocadia, encoding genes related to N-cycling, substrate usage, and osmotic stress response, possibly explaining the three different patterns by niche differentiation. These findings imply that disturbances can be used to manage the functional redundancy of biofilm microbiomes in a desirable direction, which should be considered when designing operational strategies for wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "A light sheet based optical tweezer (LOT) is developed to trap microscopic dielectric particles and live HeLa cells. The technique requires the generation of a tightly focussed diffraction-limited light sheet which is realized by a combination of cylindrical lens and high NA objective lens. The field pattern generated at the geometrical focus is a tightly focussed line (along x-axis) perpendicular to the beam propagation direction (z-axis). Spherical beads undergoing Brownian motion in the solution are trapped by the gradient potential, and the time (to reach trap-center under the influence of gradient potential) is estimated from the fast CMOS camera (operating at 230frames/sec). High-speed imaging of beads at varying laser power shows a steady increase in the stiffness of LOT with a maximum of 0.00118 pN/nm at 52.5 mW. This is an order less than traditional optical point-traps. The trapped beads displayed free movement along the light-sheet axis (x-axis), exhibiting a single degree of freedom. Subsequently, LOT is used to optically trap and pattern dielectric beads and HeLa cells in a line. We could successfully pattern 8 dielectric beads and 3 HeLa cells in a straight line. We anticipate that LOT can be used to study the 1D-physics of microscopic particles and help understand the patterned growth of live cells.",

    "abstract": "Action-stopping in humans involves bursts of beta oscillations in prefrontal-basal ganglia regions. To determine the functional role of these beta bursts we took advantage of the Race Model framework describing action-stopping. We incorporated beta bursts in three race model variants, each implementing a different functional contribution of beta to action-stopping. In these variants, we hypothesized that a transient increase in beta could 1) modulate decision thresholds, 2) change stop accumulation rates, or 3) promote the interaction between the Stop and the Go process. We then tested the model predictions using EEG recordings in humans performing a Stop-signal task. We found that the model variant in which beta increased decision thresholds for a brief period of time best explained the empirical data. The model parameters fitted to the empirical data indicated that beta bursts involve a stronger decision threshold modulation for the Go process than for the Stop process. This suggests that prefrontal beta influences stopping by temporarily holding the response from execution. Our study further suggests that human action-stopping could be multi-staged with the beta acting as a pause, increasing the response threshold for the Stop process to modulate behavior successfully. Our novel approach of introducing transient oscillations into the race model and testing against human neurophysiological data allowed us to discover potential mechanisms of prefrontal beta, possibly generalizing its role in situations requiring executive control over actions.",

    "abstract": "Life emerged and diversified in the absence of molecular oxygen. The prevailing anoxia and unique sulfur chemistry in the Paleo-, Meso- and Neoarchean, and early Proterozoic eons may have supported microbial communities that are drastically different than those currently thriving on the earths surface. Zodletone spring in southwestern Oklahoma represents a unique habitat where spatial sampling could substitute for geological eons: from the anoxic, surficial light exposed sediments simulating a preoxygenated earth, to overlaid water column where air exposure simulates the relentless oxygen intrusion during the Neo Proterozoic. We document a remarkably diverse microbial community in the anoxic spring sediments, with 340/516 (65.89%) of genomes recovered in a metagenomic survey belonging to 200 bacterial and archaeal families that were either previously undescribed or that exhibit an extremely rare distribution on the current earth. Such diversity is underpinned by the widespread occurrence of sulfite-, thiosulfate, tetrathionate-, and sulfur-reduction, and paucity of sulfate-reduction machineries in these taxa; hence greatly expanding lineages mediating reductive sulfur cycling processes in the tree of life. Analysis of the overlaying water community demonstrated that oxygen intrusion lead to the development of a significantly less diverse community dominated by well-characterized lineages and a prevalence of oxidative sulfur cycling processes. Such transition from ancient novelty to modern commonality underscores the profound impact of the great oxygenation event on the earths surficial anoxic community. It also suggests that novel and rare lineages encountered in current anaerobic habitats could represent taxa once thriving in an anoxic earth, but have failed to adapt to earths progressive oxygenation.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are critical to proper heart valve development, directly contributing to the mesenchyme of the cardiac cushions, which progressively transform into mature valves. To date, investigators have lacked useful markers of valve ECs to fully evaluate their contributions during valve morphogenesis. As a result, it has been unclear whether the well-characterized regional differentiation of valves correlates with any endothelial domains in the heart. Furthermore, it has been difficult to ascertain whether endothelial heterogeneity in the heart influences underlying mesenchymal zones in an angiocrine manner. To identify regionally expressed EC genes in the heart valves, we screened publicly available databases and assembled a toolkit of endothelial-enriched genes. We identified Cyp26b1 as one of many endothelial enriched genes found to be expressed in the endocardium of the developing cushions and valves. Here, we show that Cyp26b1 is required for normal heart valve development. Genetic ablation of Cyp26b1 in mouse embryos leads to abnormally thickened aortic valve leaflets, which is due in part to increased endothelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation in the remodeling valves. In addition, Cyp26b1 mutant hearts display ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in a portion of null embryos. We show that loss of Cyp26b1 results in upregulation of retinoic acid (RA) target genes, supporting the observation that Cyp26b1 has RA-dependent roles. Together, this work identifies a novel role for Cyp26b1 in heart valve morphogenesis. Understanding the spatiotemporal expression dynamics of cardiac EC genes will likely prove useful to the investigation of both normal as well as dysfunctional heart valve development.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS{middle dot} A mouse heart valve gene expression atlas can be generated with publicly available online tools, such as Genepaint and other gene expression databases.\n{middle dot} Endothelium of developing mouse heart valves is regionally heterogeneous.\n{middle dot} Cyp26b1 is expressed in the endocardial/endothelial lining of developing heart valves.\n{middle dot} Loss of Cyp26b1 leads to significant enlargement of aortic valves and to ventricular septal defects.\n{middle dot} Cyp26b1 represses cell proliferation in valve mesenchyme.\n{middle dot} Retinoic acid targets are upregulated in Cyp26b1-/- heart valves, indicating dysregulation of RA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Short read sequencing, which has extensively been used to decipher the genome diversity of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains, often falls short to assess co-linearity of non-adjacent polymorphic sites in mixed HCMV populations. In the present study, we established a long amplicon sequencing workflow to identify number and relative quantities of unique HCMV haplotypes in mixtures. Accordingly, long read PacBio sequencing was applied to amplicons spanning over multiple polymorphic sites. Initial validation of this approach was performed with defined HCMV DNA templates derived from cell-free viruses and was further tested for its suitability on patient samples carrying mixed HCMV infections.\n\nOur data show that artificial HCMV DNA mixtures were correctly determined upon long amplicon sequencing down to 1% abundance of the minor DNA source. Total error rate of mapped reads ranged from 0.17 to 0.43 depending on the stringency of quality trimming. PCR products of up to 7.7 kb and a GC content <55% were efficiently generated when DNA was directly isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage samples, yet long range PCR may display a slightly lower sensitivity compared to short amplicons. In a single sample, up to three distinct haplotypes were identified showing varying relative frequencies. Intra-patient haplotype diversity is unevenly distributed across the target site and often interspersed by long identical stretches, thus unable to be linked by short reads. Moreover, diversity at single polymorphic regions as assessed by short amplicon sequencing may markedly underestimate the overall diversity of mixed populations.\n\nQuantitative haplotype determination by long amplicon sequencing provides a novel approach for HCMV strain characterisation in mixed infected samples which can be scaled up to cover the majority of the genome. This will substantially improve our understanding of intra-host HCMV strain diversity and its dynamic behaviour.\n\nImpact statementHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a large enveloped DNA virus, displays the highest inter-host genome variability among all human herpesviruses. Primary infection, reinfection and reactivation are mostly asymptomatic but may cause devastating harm in congenitally infected newborns and in immunosuppressed individuals. Multiple distinct strains circulate in humans, each characterised by a unique assembly of well-defined polymorphic genes, most of which are linked to cell entry, persistence and immune evasion. Mixed HCMV strain infections are common and may pose a high pathogenic potential for patients at risk for symptomatic infections. To better understand the biological behaviour and dynamics of individual viral genomes it is inevitable to assess the co-linearity of polymorphic sites in a genetically heterogeneous population. In this study, we established and successfully applied a long read sequencing technique to long amplicons and identified co-linear genome stretches (haplotypes) in patient samples with mixed HCMV populations. This strategy for haplotype determination allows linkage analysis of multiple non-adjacent polymorphic sites along up to 7.7 kb. This allows a better approximation to the true strain diversity in mixed samples, which short read sequencing approaches failed to do. Thereby, improving our knowledge on mixed HCMV infections important for the clinical outcome, diagnostics, treatment and vaccine development.\n\nData SummarySequence data generated in this study were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers MW560357-MW560373.

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent, stem cell (iPSC)-derived models of airway tissue have successfully modeled the primary defect in regulated chloride conductance caused by the major Cystic Fibrosis causing mutation, F508del. However, it remains unclear if iPSC-derived airway cultures can be used in high-throughput therapy development for F508del and rarer mutations. There is an urgent need for airway tissue models that reflect the variability of patient-specific responses and are scalable for therapy development. In the current work, we describe a robust, high-throughput fluorescence assay of mutant CFTR function in iPSCs differentiated to immature airway epithelium. This assay measures reproducible functional responses to modulators targeting either the major CF mutant F508del or the nonsense mutant: W1282X-CFTR. We show that the ranking of patient-specific responses to interventions in this stem-cell based model recapitulates the ranking observed in primary nasal epithelial cultures obtained from the same individuals. In summary, these proof-of-concept studies show that this novel platform has the potential to support therapy development and precision medicine for Cystic Fibrosis patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe describe a fluorescence-based platform that enables high-throughput Cystic Fibrosis therapy testing using iPSCs differentiated to immature lung.",

Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, whereas the role of pyroptosis in EAC remains largely unknown. Herein, we identified a pyroptosis-related five-gene signature that was significantly correlated with the survival of EAC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort and an independent validation dataset. In addition, a nomogram based on the five-gene signature was constructed with novel prognostic values. Moreover, the genes in the pyroptosis-related signature, CASP1, GSDMB, IL1B, PYCARD, and ZBP1, might be involved in immune response and regulation of the tumor microenvironment. Our findings indicate that the five-gene signature provides insights into the involvement of pyroptosis in EAC progression, and is promising in the risk assessment as well as prognosis for EAC patients in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy of the bile ducts within the liver characterised by high levels of genetic heterogeneity. In the context of such genetic variability, determining which oncogenic mutations drive ICC growth has been difficult and developing modes of patient stratification and targeted therapies remains challenging. As a result, survival rates following a diagnosis with ICC have remained static since the late 1970s, whilst incidence of ICC has increased. Here, we performed the first functional in vivo study into the role that genetic heterogeneity plays in drivinga ICC via modelling of interactions between rare mutations with more common driver genes. By leveraging human ICC sequencing data to stratify and then model genetic heterogeneity in the mouse, we uncovered numerous novel tumour suppressors which, when lost, cooperate with the RAS oncoprotein to drive ICC growth. In this study, we specifically focus on a set of driver mutations that interact with KRAS to initiate aggressive, sarcomatoid-type ICC. We show that tumour growth of this cancer relies on both Wnt and PI3K signalling to drive proliferation and suppress apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological co-inhibition of Wnt and PI3K in vivo substantially impedes the growth of ICC, regardless of mutational profile. As such, Wnt and PI3K activity should be considered as a signature by which patients can be stratified for treatment and inhibitors of these pathways should be levied as a treatment for patients diagnosed with ICC.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate vestibular circuits use sensory signals derived from the inner ear to guide both corrective and volitional movements. A major challenge in the neuroscience of balance is to link the synaptic and cellular substrates that encode body tilts to specific behaviors that stabilize posture and enable efficient locomotion. Here we address this problem by measuring the development, synaptic architecture, and behavioral contributions of vestibulospinal neurons in the larval zebrafish. First, we find that vestibulospinal neurons are born and are functionally mature before larvae swim freely, allowing them to act as a substrate for postural regulation. Next, we map the synaptic inputs to vestibulospinal neurons that allow them to encode posture. Further, we find that this synaptic architecture allows them to respond to linear acceleration in a directionally-tuned and utricle-dependent manner; they are thus poised to guide corrective movements. After loss of vestibulospinal neurons, larvae adopted eccentric postures with disrupted movement timing and weaker corrective kinematics. We used a generative model of swimming to demonstrate that together these disruptions can account for the increased postural variability. Finally, we observed that lesions disrupt vestibular-dependent coordination between the fins and trunk during vertical swimming, linking vestibulospinal neurons to navigation. We conclude that vestibulospinal neurons turn synaptic representations of body tilt into defined corrective behaviors and coordinated movements. As the need for stable locomotion is common and the vestibulospinal circuit is highly conserved our findings reveal general mechanisms for neuronal control of balance.",

    "abstract": "As humans spread throughout the world, they adapted to variation in many environmental factors, including climate, diet, and pathogens. Because many of these adaptations were likely mediated by multiple non-coding variants with small effects on gene regulation, it has been difficult to link genomic signals of selection to specific genes, and to describe the regulatory response to selection. To overcome this challenge, we adapted PrediXcan, a machine learning method for imputing gene regulation from genotype data, to analyze low-coverage ancient human DNA (aDNA). First, we used simulated genomes to benchmark strategies for adapting gene regulatory prediction to increase robustness to incomplete aDNA data. Applying the resulting models to 490 ancient Eurasians, we found that genes with the strongest divergent regulation among ancient populations with hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, and agricultural lifestyles are enriched for metabolic and immune functions. Next, we explored the contribution of divergent gene regulation to two traits with strong evidence of recent adaptation: dietary metabolism and skin pigmentation. We found enrichment for divergent regulation among genes previously proposed to be involved in diet-related local adaptation, and in many cases, the predicted effects on regulation provide explanations for previously observed signals of selection, e.g., at FADS1, GPX1, and LEPR. For skin pigmentation, we applied new models trained in melanocytes to a time series of 2999 ancient Europeans spanning ~38,000 years BP. In contrast to diet, skin pigmentation genes show little regulatory change over time, suggesting that adaptation mainly involved large-effect coding variants. This work demonstrates how aDNA can be combined with present-day genomes to shed light on the biological differences among ancient populations, the role of gene regulation in adaptation, and the relationship between ancient genetic diversity and the present-day distribution of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Songbirds learn their songs culturally, through imitating tutors. The vocal culture of a songbird population changes as new song units (syllables) are introduced through immigration, copying errors, and innovation, while other syllables fall out of use. This leads to a diversification of the syllable pool across the species, much like the diversification and spatial patterns of human language. Vocal cultures have been well studied in male songbirds but have been largely overlooked in females. In particular, few studies compare spatial variation of male and female song cultures. Here we undertake one of the first comparisons of male and female song culture in birds, analysing song data from a metapopulation of New Zealand bellbirds Anthornis melanura, spanning an archipelago of six islands. Having classified 20,700 syllables, we compare population syllable repertoire sizes and overlap between sites and sexes. We show that males and females--both with complex songs--have distinct song cultures, sharing only 6-26% of syllable types within each site. Furthermore, male and female syllable types can be statistically discriminated based on acoustic properties. Despite diverse syllable repertoires within sites, few syllable types were shared between sites (both sexes had highly distinct site-specific dialects). For the few types shared between sites, sharing decreased with distance only for males. Overall, there was no significant difference between sexes in degree of site-site repertoire overlap. These results suggest different cultural processes at play for the two sexes, underlining the inadequacy of male-centric song research and calling for comparisons of male and female song cultures in many more species.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, specifically its receptor binding domain (RBD), has emerged as a promising target for generation of neutralizing antibodies. Although the RBD peptide subunit is easily manufactured and highly stable, RBD-based subunit vaccines have been hampered by its poor inherent immunogenicity. We hypothesize that this limitation can be overcome by sustained co-administration alongside a potent and optimized adjuvant. The innate immune second messenger, cGAMP, holds promise as it activates the potent anti-viral STING pathway, but has exhibited poor performance as a therapeutic due to its nonspecific pharmacodynamic profiles when administered systemically and its poor pharmacokinetics arising from rapid excretion and degradation by its hydrolase ENPP1. To overcome these limitations, we sought to mimic the natural scenario of viral infections by creating an artificial immunological niche that enables slow release of cGAMP and the RBD antigen. Specifically, we co-encapsulated cGAMP and RBD in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel system. This cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel vaccine elicited more potent, durable, and broad antibody responses and improved neutralization than both dose-matched bolus controls and a hydrogel-based vaccine lacking cGAMP. The cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel platform developed is suitable for delivery of other antigens and may provide enhanced immunity against a broad range of pathogens.",

Here, we dissected the dynamics of virus replication and the host cell transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at a systems level by combining time-resolved RNA sequencing with mathematical modeling. We observed an immediate transcriptional activation of inflammatory pathways linked to the anti-viral response followed by increased expression of genes involved in ribosome and mitochondria function, thus hinting at rapid alterations in protein production and cellular energy supply. At later stages, metabolic processes, in particular those depending on cytochrome P450 enzymes, were downregulated. To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying transcriptional dynamics, we developed an ODE model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Iterative model reduction and refinement revealed that a negative feedback from virus proteins on the expression of anti-viral response genes was essential to explain our experimental dataset.

    "abstract": "The massive assessment of immune evasion due to viral mutations that potentially increase COVID-19 susceptibility can be computationally facilitated. The adaptive cytotoxic T response is critical during primary infection and the generation of long-term protection. Potential epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were predicted for 2,915 human alleles of 71 HLA class I families. Allele families showed extreme differences in number of recognized epitopes, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Among them, the B27 supertype showed the lowest number of epitopes. Epitope escape mutations identified in ~118,000 NCBI isolates mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27, which reached up to 33%. In contrast to most supertypes, eight particular allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles. Collectively, these data indicate that independent escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. This study highlights the automated integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially affecting the population as a whole, as well as minority subpopulations.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe cytotoxic T response, a type of immune response dependent upon an individual's genetics that does not require antibodies, is critical for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential bypass of the cytotoxic T response by mutations acquired by the virus after one year of the pandemic is therefore of maximal concern. We have approached the complexity of human variability and more than 100.000 viral genomes in this respect using a computational strategy. We have detected numerous mutations in these genomes that mask some viral regions involved in the cytotoxic response. However, the accumulation of these changes in independent isolates is still too low to threaten the global human population. In contrast, our protocol has identified mutations that may be relevant for specific populations and minorities with cytotoxic genetic backgrounds susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some viral variants co-existed in the same country with these human communities which warrants deeper surveillance in these cases to prevent local outbreaks. Our study support the integration of massive data of different natures in the surveillance of viral pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Brain microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs) display distinct spatial, developmental, and phenotypic features. Although at steady-state, the origins of distinct brain macrophages are well-documented, the dynamics of their replenishment in neurodegenerative disorders remain elusive, particularly for disease-associated microglia (DAMs) and BAMs. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive fate-mapping analysis of murine microglia and BAMs and their turnover kinetics during Alzheimers disease (AD) progression. We used a novel inducible AD mouse model to investigate the contribution of bone marrow cells to the pool of foetal-derived brain macrophages during the development of AD. We demonstrated that microglia and DAMs remain a remarkably stable embryonic-derived population even during the progression of AD pathology, indicating that neither parenchymal macrophage subpopulation originates from, nor are replenished by, monocytes. At the border-associated brain regions, bona fide CD206+ BAMs are minimally replaced by monocytes, and their turnover rates are not accelerated by AD. In contrast, all other myeloid cells are swiftly replenished by bone marrow progenitors. This information further elucidates the turnover kinetics of these cells not only at steady-state, but also in neurodegenerative diseases, which is crucial for identifying potential novel therapeutic targets.\n\nImpact statementInducible fate-mapping analysis demonstrates that neither microglia, disease-associated microglia nor border-associated macrophages are replenished by bone marrow-derived cells in Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "The development of a safe and effective vaccine is a key requirement to overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic. Recombinant proteins represent the most reliable and safe vaccine approach but generally require a suitable adjuvant for robust and durable immunity. We used the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and in silico structural modelling to design a recombinant spike protein vaccine (Covax-19). A synthetic gene encoding the spike extracellular domain (ECD) was inserted into a baculovirus backbone to express the protein in insect cell cultures. The spike ECD was formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant and first tested for immunogenicity in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. The Advax-SM adjuvanted vaccine induced high titers of binding antibody against spike protein that were able to neutralise the original wildtype virus on which the vaccine was based as well as the variant B.1.1.7 lineage virus. The Covax-19 vaccine also induced potent spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cells with a dominant Th1 phenotype, and this was shown to be associated with cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing of spike labelled target cells in vivo. Ferrets immunised with Covax-19 vaccine intramuscularly twice 2 weeks apart made spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and were protected against an intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus 2 weeks after the second immunisation. Notably, ferrets that received two 25 or 50g doses of Covax-19 vaccine had no detectable virus in their lungs or in nasal washes at day 3 post-challenge, suggesting the possibility that Covax-19 vaccine may in addition to protection against lung infection also have the potential to block virus transmission. This data supports advancement of Covax-19 vaccine into human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "As natural bacterial predators, bacteriophages have the potential to be developed to tackle antimicrobial resistance, but our exploitation of them is limited by understanding their vast uncharacterised genetic diversity1,2. Fascinatingly, this genetic diversity reflects many ways that phages can make proteins, performing similar functions that together form the familiar phage particle. Critical to infection are phage receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind bacterial  receptors and initiate bacterial entry3. Here we identified and characterised Gp22, a novel RBP for phage CDHS-1 that infects pathogenic C. difficile, but that had no recognisable RBPs. We showed that Gp22 antibodies neutralised CDHS-1 infection and used immunogold-labelling and transmission electron microscopy to identify their location on the capsid. The Gp22 three-dimensional structure was resolved by X-ray crystallography revealing a new RBP class with an N-terminal L-shaped -helical superhelix domain and a C-terminal Mg2+-binding domain. The findings provide novel insights into C. difficile phage biology and phage-host interactions. This will facilitate optimal phage development and future engineering strategies4,5. Furthermore, the AlphaFold2-predicted Gp22 structure, which was strikingly accurate, paves the way for a structurome based transformation and guidance of future phage studies where many proteins lack sequence homology but have recognisable protein structures.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial homeostasis - influenced by both genetic and environmental factors - is crucial in neurodevelopment. FOXP1 syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests motor dysfunction, intellectual disability, autism and language impairment. In this study, we used a Foxp1+/- mouse model to address whether cognitive and motor deficits in FOXP1 syndrome are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Here we show that genes with a role in mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics (e.g. Foxo1, Pgc-1, Tfam, Opa1, and Drp1) were dysregulated in the striatum of Foxp1+/- mice at different postnatal stages. Furthermore, in the striatum of Foxp1+/- animals, mitochondrial membrane potential was disrupted, and reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and cytochrome c release were significantly elevated. These features can explain the reduced neurite branching, learning and memory, endurance, and motor coordination that we observed in these animals. Taken together, we provide strong evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in Foxp1+/- mice, suggesting that insufficient energy supply and excessive oxidative stress underlies the cognitive and motor impairment in FOXP1 deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Ureter obstruction is a highly prevalent event during embryonic development and is a major cause of pediatric kidney disease. We have reported that ureteric bud-specific ablation of the exocyst Exoc5 subunit in late-murine gestation results in failure of urothelial stratification, cell death, and complete ureter obstruction. However, the mechanistic connection between disrupted exocyst activity, urothelial cell death, and subsequent ureter obstruction was unclear. Here, we report that inhibited urothelial stratification does not drive cell death during ureter development. Instead, we demonstrate that the exocyst plays a critical role in autophagy in urothelial cells, and that disruption of autophagy activates a urothelial NF-{kappa}B stress response. Impaired autophagy first provokes canonical NF-{kappa}B activity which is progressively followed by increasing non-canonical NF-{kappa}B activity and cell death if the stress remains unresolved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ureter obstructions can be completely rescued in Exoc5 conditional knockout mice by administering a single dose of pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK at E16.5 prior to urothelial cell death. Taken together, ablation of Exoc5 disrupts autophagic stress response and activates progressive NF-{kappa}B signaling which promotes obstructive uropathy.",

    "abstract": "The before-outbreak evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 is enigmatic because it shares only [~]96% genomic similarity with RaTG13, the closest relative so far found in wild animals (horseshoe bats). Since mutations on single-stranded viral RNA are heavily shaped by host factors, the viral mutation signatures can in turn inform the host. By comparing publically available viral genomes we here inferred the mutations SARS-CoV-2 accumulated before the outbreak and after the split from RaTG13. We found the mutation spectrum of SARS-CoV-2, which measures the relative rates of 12 mutation types, is 99.9% identical to that of RaTG13. It is also similar to that of two other bat coronaviruses but distinct from that evolved in non-bat hosts. The viral mutation spectrum informed the activities of a variety of mutation-associated host factors, which were found almost identical between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, a pattern difficult to create in laboratory. All the findings are robust after replacing RaTG13 with RshSTT182, another coronavirus found in horseshoe bats with [~]93% similarity to SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest SARS-CoV-2 shared almost the same host environment with RaTG13 and RshSTT182 before the outbreak.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been suggested as a useful mammalian model for a variety of diseases and infections, including infection with respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The MesAur1.0 genome assembly was generated in 2013 using whole-genome shotgun sequencing with short-read sequence data. Current more advanced sequencing technologies and assembly methods now permit the generation of near-complete genome assemblies with higher quality and greater continuity.\n\nFindingsHere, we report an improved assembly of the M. auratus genome (BCM_Maur_2.0) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing to produce a chromosome-scale assembly. The total length of the new assembly is 2.46 Gbp, similar to the 2.50 Gbp length of a previous assembly of this genome, MesAur1.0. BCM_Maur_2.0 exhibits significantly improved continuity with a scaffold N50 that is 6.7 times greater than MesAur1.0. Furthermore, 21,616 protein coding genes and 10,459 noncoding genes are annotated in BCM_Maur_2.0 compared to 20,495 protein coding genes and 4,168 noncoding genes in MesAur1.0. This new assembly also improves the unresolved regions as measured by nucleotide ambiguities, where approximately 17.11% of bases in MesAur1.0 were unresolved compared to BCM_Maur_2.0 in which the number of unresolved bases is reduced to 3.00%.\n\nConclusionsAccess to a more complete reference genome with improved accuracy and continuity will facilitate more detailed, comprehensive, and meaningful research results for a wide variety of future studies using Syrian hamsters as models.",

    "abstract": "Snakes are interesting examples of overcoming energy metabolism challenges as many species can endure long periods without feeding, and their eventual meals are of reasonably large sizes, thus exhibiting dual extreme adaptations. Consequently, metabolic rate increases considerably to attend to the energetic demand of digestion, absorption and, protein synthesis. These animals should be adapted to transition from these two opposite states of energy fairly quickly, and therefore we investigated mitochondrial function plasticity in these states. Herein we compared liver mitochondrial bioenergetics of the boid snake Boa constrictor during fasting and after meal intake. We fasted the snakes for 60 days, then we fed a subgroup with 30% of their body size and evaluated their maximum postprandial response. We measured liver respiration rates from permeabilized tissue and isolated mitochondria, and from isolated mitochondria, we also measured Ca2+ retention capacity, the release of H2O2, and NAD(P) redox state. Mitochondrial respiration rates were maximized after feeding, reaching until 60% increase from fasting levels when energized with complex I-linked substrates. Interestingly, fasting and fed snakes exhibited similar respiratory control ratios and citrate synthase activity. Furthermore, we found no differences in Ca2+ retention capacity, indicating no increase in susceptibility to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), or redox state of NAD(P), although fed animals exhibited increases in the release of H2O2. Thus, we conclude that liver mitochondria from B. constrictor snakes increase the maintenance costs during the postprandial period and quickly improve the mitochondrial bioenergetics capacity without compromising the redox balance.",

The purpose of this study was to determine how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts histone levels, fibrin structure, and endogenous thrombin potential in the presence and absence of endothelial cells.\n\nApproachWe studied individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome at the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation compared to healthy controls. Blood samples were assayed for levels of histone-DNA complexes. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate fibrin structure in clots formed from recalcified plasma samples using fluorescently-labeled fibrinogen. Endogenous thrombin potential was measured by calibrated automated thrombin assays in the presence of tissue factor and phospholipid (PCPS) or cultured human endothelial cells.\n\nResultsCirculating nucleosomes were elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients relative to healthy controls (n=6, each group). COVID-19 patient plasma thrombin generation was also altered. Despite having an increased endogenous thrombin potential, patient plasma samples exhibited prolonged lag times and times to peak thrombin in the presence of added tissue factor and PCPS. Strikingly different results were observed when endothelial cells were used in place of tissue factor and PCPS. Control plasma samples did not generate measurable thrombin (lag time >60 min); in contrast, plasma samples from COVID-19+ patients generated thrombin (mean lag time [~]20 min). Consistent with the observed alterations in thrombin generation, clots from COVID-19 subjects exhibited a denser fibrin network, thinner fibers and lower fibrin resolvability.\n\nConclusionsElevated histones, aberrant fibrin formation, and increased endothelial-dependent thrombin generation in COVID-19 may contribute to coagulopathy.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIHistone-DNA complexes are significantly elevated in the plasma of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LIO_LIMeasures of thrombin generation by calibrated automated thrombography and fibrin clots formed in situ are altered in severe COVID-19.\nC_LIO_LIPlasma from COVID-19 patients promotes thrombin generation on cultured endothelial cells in the absence of added tissue factor or phospholipids.\nC_LIO_LIThe additive effects of histones on thrombin generation and endothelial cell function may play a major role in the thrombotic complications observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LI",

Here, we generated patient-derived CALRins5- or CALRdel52-positive induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to establish a MPN disease model for molecular and mechanistic studies. We demonstrated myeloperoxidase deficiency in CD15+ granulocytic cells derived from homozygous CALR-mutant iPS cells, rescued by repairing the mutation using CRISPR/Cas9. iPS cell-derived megakaryocytes showed characteristics of primary megakaryocytes such as formation of demarcation membrane system and cytoplasmic pro-platelets protrusions. Importantly, CALR mutations led to enhanced megakaryopoiesis and accelerated megakaryocytic development in a thrombopoietin-independent manner. Mechanistically, our study identified differentially regulated pathways in mutated vs. unmutated megakaryocytes, such as hypoxia signaling, which represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
