    "abstract": "In the early visual system, suppression occurs between neurons representing different stimulus properties. This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.",

    "abstract": "Uranium tolerant soil bacterium Chryseobacterium sp. strain PMSZPI moved over solid agar surfaces by gliding motility thereby forming spreading colonies which is a hallmark of members of Bacteroidetes phylum. PMSZPI genome harbored orthologs of all the gld and spr genes considered as core bacteroidetes gliding motility genes of which gldK, gldL, gldM, and gldN were co-transcribed. Here, we present the intriguing interplay between gliding motility and cellular organization in PMSZPI spreading colonies. While nutrient deficiency enhanced colony spreading, high agar concentrations and presence of motility inhibitor like 5-hydroxyindole reduced the spreading. A detailed in situ structural analysis of spreading colonies revealed closely packed cells forming multiple layers at center of colony while the edges showed clusters of cells periodically arranged in hexagonal lattices interconnected with each other. The cell migration within the colony was visualized as branched structures wherein the cells were buried within extracellular matrix giving rise to  fern like patterns. PMSZPI colonies exhibited strong iridescence that showed correlation with gliding motility. Presence of uranium reduced motility and iridescence and induced biofilm formation. This is a first report of gliding motility and iridescence in a bacterium from uranium enriched environment that could be of significant interest from an ecological perspective.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThis work provides the first description of the gliding motility and iridescence or structural coloration in a Bacteroidetes soil bacterium from uranium enriched environment. The periodic arrangement of the cell population in the spreading colonies achieved through gliding motility resulted in bright structural coloration of the colonies when illuminated. The study describes the exogenous factors including nutrition, substrate, presence of uranium influencing the motility and iridescence of the bacterium. The highly organized cell population in the gliding and iridescent bacterium may have conferred survival advantage in metal/uranium enriched ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The germline produces gametes that transmit genetic and epigenetic information to the next generation. Maintenance of germ cells and development of gametes require germ granules--well-conserved membraneless and RNA-rich organelles. The composition of germ granules is elusive owing to their dynamic nature and their exclusive expression in the germline. Using C. elegans germ granule, called P granule, as a model system, we employed a proximity-based labeling method in combination with mass spectrometry to comprehensively define its protein components. This set of experiments identified over 200 proteins, many of which contain intrinsically disordered regions. An RNAi-based screen identified factors that are essential for P granule assembly, notably EGGD-1 and EGGD-2, two previously uncharacterized LOTUS-domain proteins. Loss of eggd-1 and eggd-2 results in separation of P granules from nuclear envelope, germline atrophy and reduced fertility. We show that intrinsically disordered regions of EGGD-1 are required to anchor EGGD-1 to the nuclear periphery while its LOTUS domains are required to promote perinuclear localization of P granules. Together, our work expands the repertoire of P granule constituents and provides new insights into the role of LOTUS-domain proteins in germ granule organization.",

    "abstract": "Marine bacteria rely on phytoplankton exudates as carbon sources (DOCp). Yet, it is unclear to what extent phytoplankton exudates also provide nutrients such as phytoplankton-derived N and P (DONp, DOPp). We address these questions by exudate addition experiments from the ubiquitous pico-cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus to contrasting ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean - a coastal and an open-ocean, oligotrophic station. Nutrient addition did not lower the incorporation of exudate DONp, nor did it reduce alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that bacterial communities are able to exclusively cover their nitrogen and phosphorus demands with organic forms provided by phytoplankton exudates. Approximately half of the cells in each ecosystem took up detectable amounts of Prochlorococcus-derived C and N, yet based on 16S rRNA sequencing different bacterial genera were responsible for the observed exudate utilization patterns. In the coastal community, several phylotypes of Aureimarina, Psychrosphaera and Glaciecola responded positively to the addition of phytoplankton exudates, whereas phylotypes of Pseudoalteromonas increased and dominated the open ocean communities. Together, our results strongly indicate that phytoplankton exudates provide coastal and open-ocean bacterial communities with organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and that phytoplankton exudate serve a full-fledged meal for specific members of the accompanying bacterial community in the nutrient-poor eastern Mediterranean.",

    "abstract": "Accounting for multiple modes of livestock disease dissemination in epidemiological models remains a challenge. We developed and calibrated a mathematical model for transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), tailored to fit nine modes of between-farm transmission pathways including: farm-to-farm proximity (local transmission), contact network of batches of pigs transferred between farms (pig movements), re-break probabilities for farms with previous PRRSV outbreaks, with the addition of four different contact networks of transportation vehicles (vehicles to transport pigs to farms, pigs to markets, feed and crew) and the amount of animal by-products within feed ingredients (e.g. animal fat or meat and bone meal). The model was calibrated on weekly PRRSV outbreaks data. We assessed the role of each transmission pathway considering the dynamics of specific types of production (i.e., sow, nursery). Although our results estimated that the networks formed by transportation vehicles were more densely connected than the network of pigs transported between-farms, pig movements and farm proximity were the main PRRSV transmission routes regardless of farm types. Among the four vehicle networks, vehicles transporting pigs to farms explained a large proportion of infections, sow = 20.9%; nursery = 15%; and finisher = 20.6%. The animal by-products showed a limited association with PRRSV outbreaks through descriptive analysis, and our model results showed that the contribution of animal fat contributed only 2.5% and meat and bone meal only 0.03% of the infected sow farms. Our work demonstrated the contribution of multiple routes of PRRSV dissemination, which has not been deeply explored before. It also provides strong evidence to support the need for cautious, measured PRRSV control strategies for transportation vehicles and further research for feed by-products modeling. Finally, this study provides valuable information and opportunities for the swine industry to focus effort on the most relevant modes of PRRSV between-farm transmission.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating regulatory effects of Alzheimers disease (AD)-associated genetic variants is critical for unraveling their causal pathways and understanding the pathology. However, their cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in the brain remain largely unclear. Here, we conducted an analysis of allele-specific expression quantitative trait loci (aseQTLs) for 33 AD-associated variants in four brain regions and seven cell types using ~3000 bulk RNA-seq samples and >0.25 million single nuclei. We develop a flexible framework using a hierarchical Poisson mixed model unifying samples in both allelic and genotype-level expression data. We identified 24 AD-associated variants (~73%) that are allele-specific eQTLs (aseQTLs) in at least one brain region. Multiple aseQTLs are region-dependent or exon-specific, such as rs2093760 with CR1, rs7982 with CLU, and rs3865444 with CD33. Notably, the APOE {varepsilon}4 variant reduces APOE expression across all regions, even in healthy controls. In pinpointing the cell types responsible for the observed region-level aseQTLs, we found rs2093760 as an aseQTL of CR1 in oligodendrocytes but not in microglia. Many AD-associated variants are aseQTLs in microglia or monocytes of immune-related genes, including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, CD33, FCER1G, MS4A6A, SPI1, and BIN1, highlighting the regulatory role of AD-associated variants in the immune response. These findings provide further insights into potential causal pathways and cell types mediating the effects of the AD-associated variants.",

    "abstract": "East Coast fever, a tick-borne cattle disease caused by the Theileria parva parasite, is among the biggest natural killers of cattle in East Africa, leading to over 1 million deaths annually. Here we report on the genetic analysis of a cohort of Boran cattle demonstrating heritable tolerance to infection by T. parva (h2 = 0.65, s.e. 0.57). Through a linkage analysis we identify a 6 Mb genomic region on Bos taurus chromosome 15 that is significantly associated with survival outcome following T. parva exposure. Testing this locus in an independent cohort of animals replicates this association with survival following T. parva infection. A stop gained polymorphism in this region was found to be highly associated with survival across both related and unrelated animals, with only one of the 20 homozygote carriers (T/T) of this change succumbing to the disease in contrast to 44 out of 97 animals homozygote for the reference allele (C/C). Consequently, we present a genetic locus linked to tolerance of one of Africas most important cattle diseases, raising the promise of marker-assisted selection for cattle that are less susceptible to infection by T. parva.\n\nAuthor SummaryMore than a million cattle die of East Coast fever in Africa each year, the impact of which disproportionately falls onto low-income, smallholder farmers. The lack of a widely accessible vaccine, heavy reliance on chemicals to control the tick vector and inadequate drug treatments means that new approaches for controlling the disease are urgently required. Through a genetic study of an extended pedigree of Boran cattle that are more than three times less likely to succumb to the disease than matched controls, we identify a region on chromosome 15 of the cattle genome associated with a high level of tolerance to the disease. We show that a variant in this region is also associated with survival in an independent cohort, and is linked to rates of cell expansion during infection. This genetic variant can therefore support marker-assisted selection, allowing farmers to breed tolerant cattle and offers a route to introduce this beneficial DNA to non-native breeds, enabling reduced disease incidence and increased productivity, which would be of benefit to millions of rural smallholder farmers across Africa.",

    "abstract": "Retrotransposons are endogenous elements that have the ability to mobilise their DNA and integrate at different locations in the host genome. In budding yeast, the Ty3 retrotransposon integrates with an exquisite specificity in a narrow window upstream of RNA Polymerase III-transcribed genes, such as the genes of transfer RNAs, representing a paradigm for specific targeted integration.\n\nHere we present the cryo-EM reconstruction at 4.0 [A]-resolution of an active Ty3 strand-transfer complex (Ty3 intasome) caught in the act of integrating onto a specific tRNA gene bound to the RNA Polymerase III general transcription factor TFIIIB, which is required for Ty3 specific targeting.\n\nThe structure unravels the molecular mechanisms underlying Ty3 integration specificity at RNA Polymerase III-transcribed genes and sheds light into the architecture of a retrotransposon integration machinery during the process of strand transfer at a genomic locus. The Ty3 intasome establishes contacts with a region of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a subunit of TFIIIB, which is blocked by the ubiquitous transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2) in RNA Pol II-transcribed genes.\n\nA previously unrecognised chromodomain of the Ty3 integrase mediates non- canonical interactions with TFIIIB and the tRNA gene itself, defining with extreme precision the position of the integration site. Surprisingly, Ty3 retrotransposon tethering to TFIIIB topologically resembles LEDGF/p75 transcription factor targeting by HIV retrovirus, highlighting mechanisms of convergent evolution by unrelated mobile elements and host organisms.\n\nThe Ty3 intasome-TFIIIB-tRNA promoter complex presented here represents a detailed molecular snapshot of a general transcription factors co-option by a mobile element, resulting in harmless integration into the host genome.",

    "abstract": "While the development of tools and techniques has broadened our horizons for comprehending the complexities of the human brain, a growing body of research has highlighted the pitfalls of such methodological plurality. In a recent study, we found that the choice of software package used to run the analysis pipeline can have a considerable impact on the final group-level results of a task-fMRI investigation (Bowring et al., 2019, BMN). Here we revisit our work, seeking to identify the stages of the pipeline where the greatest variation between analysis software is induced. We carry out further analyses on the three datasets evaluated in BMN, employing a common processing strategy across parts of the analysis workflow and then utilizing procedures from three software packages (AFNI, FSL and SPM) across the remaining steps of the pipeline. We use quantitative methods to compare the statistical maps and isolate the main stages of the workflow where the three packages diverge. Across all datasets, we find that variation between the packages results is largely attributable to a handful of individual analysis stages, and that these sources of variability were heterogeneous across the datasets (e.g. choice of first-level signal model had the most impact for the ds000001 dataset, while first-level noise model was more influential for ds000109 dataset). We also observe areas of the analysis workflow where changing the software package causes minimal differences in the final results, finding that the group-level results were largely unaffected by which software package is used to model the low-frequency fMRI drifts.",

    "abstract": "The peptidoglycan cell wall is a predominant structure of bacteria, determining cell shape and supporting survival in diverse conditions. Peptidoglycan is dynamic and requires regulated synthesis of new material, remodeling, and turnover - or autolysis - of old material. Despite exploitation of peptidoglycan synthesis as an antibiotic target, we lack a fundamental understanding of how peptidoglycan synthesis and autolysis intersect to maintain the cell wall. Here, we uncover a critical physiological role for a widely misunderstood class of autolytic enzymes, lytic transglycosylases (LTGs). We demonstrate that LTG activity is essential to survival by contributing to periplasmic processes upstream and independent of peptidoglycan recycling. Defects accumulate in Vibrio cholerae LTG mutants due to generally inadequate LTG activity, rather than absence of specific enzymes, and essential LTG activities are likely independent of protein-protein interactions, as heterologous expression of a non-native LTG rescues growth of a conditionally LTG-null mutant. Lastly, we demonstrate that soluble, uncrosslinked, endopeptidase-dependent peptidoglycan chains, also detected in the wild-type, are enriched in LTG mutants, and that LTG mutants are hypersusceptible to the production of diverse periplasmic polymers. Collectively, our results suggest that LTGs prevent toxic crowding of the periplasm with synthesis-derived peptidoglycan polymers and contrary to prevailing models, that this autolytic function can be temporally separate from peptidoglycan synthesis.",

It was observed that HTp at concentrations of 0.1g, 0.2g and 0.3g/kg showed significant analgesic effect at compared to the control. The percentage inhibition observed was 29.60%, 44.80% and 50.72% for the early pain phase and 100% for the late pain phase respectively, indicating HTps NSAID-like property.

HTp did not produce any toxicity up to a dose of 5000 mg/kg weight which is very interesting as the seeds are known for their toxicity due to the cardiac glycoside presence.

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with episodic memory decline and changes in functional brain connectivity. Understanding whether and how biological sex influences age- and memory performance-related functional connectivity has important theoretical and clinical implications for our understanding of brain and cognitive aging. Yet, little is known about the effect of sex on neurocognitive aging. Here, we scanned 161 healthy adults between 19-76 yrs of age in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of face-location spatial context memory. Adults were scanned while performing easy and difficult versions of the task at both encoding and retrieval. We used multivariate whole-brain partial least squares (PLS) connectivity to test the hypothesis that there are sex differences in age- and episodic memory performance-related functional connectivity. We examined how individual differences in age and retrieval accuracy correlated with task-related connectivity. We then repeated this analysis after disaggregating the data by self-reported sex. We found that increased encoding and retrieval-related connectivity within the dorsal attention network (DAN), and between DAN and frontoparietal network (FPN) and visual networks, was positively correlated to retrieval accuracy and negatively correlated with age in both sexes. We also observed sex differences in age- and performance-related functional connectivity: i) greater between-network integration was apparent at both levels of task difficulty in women only, and ii) increased DAN-DMN connectivity with age was observed in men and was correlated with poorer memory performance. Therefore, the neural correlates of age-related episodic memory decline differ in women and men and has important theoretical and clinical implications for the cognitive neuroscience of memory, aging and dementia prevention.",

The SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 protein is important, both for replication and pathogenesis, making it an attractive target for intervention. In recent years nanoparticles have been shown to interact with peptides, ranging in size from single amino acids up to proteins. These nanoparticles can be tailor-made with specific functions and properties including bioavailability. To the best of our knowledge, in this study we show for the first time that a tailored titanium oxide nanoparticle interacts specifically with a unique site of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 protein.

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin (Ub) serves as a signal for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by engaging Ub-binding proteins with the internalization apparatus. Ub is a versatile internalization signal because it can be added to a wide variety of membrane proteins, expanding the capacity of cells to use a variety of regulatory mechanisms to specify the conditions under which a particular protein will be internalized. Several candidate adaptors that can recognize ubiquitinated membrane proteins have been identified that work in endocytic processes that are both clathrin-dependent and independent. These include Epsin and Eps15, which bind and help sort Ub-cargo into internalization sites. Here we identify additional components of the endocytosis apparatus that bind Ub. The N-terminal ANTH domains found in CALM, AP180, HIP1R and yeast Sla2 all bind monoubiquitin with {micro}M affinity. ANTH domains belong to a larger superfamily of domains including ENTH and VHS domains, many of which have Ub-binding regions outside of their VHS/ENTH/ANTH domains that enable them to mediate Ub-dependent sorting events throughout the cell. Solution NMR studies combined with a crystal structure of the CALM ANTH domain in a complex with Ub show that Ub binds to a C-terminal region of the ANTH domain that is not present in ENTH domains. Combined loss of Ub-binding by ANTH-domain proteins and other Ub-binding domains within the internalization apparatus of yeast caused defects in the Ub-dependent internalization of the GPCR Ste2 but had no effect on internalization of Ste2 via other internalization signals. These studies define new components of the internalization machinery that work collectively with Epsin and Eps15 to specify recognition of Ub as an internalization signal.",

To persist over time both partners must reproduce and ensure symbiont transmission prior cessation of sulfide, fueling the symbionts carbon fixation and host nourishment. We experimentally investigated the response of this mutualism to waning of sulfide. We found that colonies followed the r-strategy and released initially present but also newly produced macrozooids until death. A fraction of middle-sized longer-lived colonies were particularly proficient in producing and releasing swarmers. The symbionts on the colonies proliferated less and became larger and more rod-shaped under oxic conditions compared to symbionts from freshly collected colonies exposed to sulfide and oxygen. The symbiont monolayer was highly disturbed with epigrowth of other microbes and loss of symbionts that were subsequently found in the experimental seawater. We conclude that both partners response to cessation of sulfide emission was remarkably fast. The colony experienced death within two days but host reproduction through swarmers carrying the symbiont ensured the continuation of the association.",

    "abstract": "Substitution rate variation among branches can lead to inaccurate reconstructions of evolutionary relationships and obscure the true phylogeny of affected clades. Body mass is often assumed to have a major influence on substitution rate, though other factors such as population size, life history traits, and flight demands are also thought to have an influence. Birds of the order Procellariiformes--which encompasses petrels, storm-petrels and albatrosses--show a striking 900-fold difference in body mass between the smallest and largest members, divergent life history traits, and substantial heterogeneity in mitochondrial substitution rates. Here, we used genome-scale nuclear DNA sequence data from 4365 ultraconserved element loci (UCEs) in 51 procellariiform species to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction using genome-wide datasets is robust to the presence of rate heterogeneity, and to identify predictors of substitution rate variation. Our results provide a backbone phylogeny for procellariiform seabirds and resolve several controversies about the evolutionary history of the order, demonstrating that albatrosses are basal, storm-petrels are paraphyletic and diving petrels nestled within the Procellariidae. We find evidence of rate variation; however, all phylogenetic analyses using both concatenation and multispecies coalescent approaches recovered the same branching topology, including analyses implementing different clock models, and analyses of the most and least clock-like loci. Overall, we find that rate heterogeneity is little impacted by body mass, population size, age at first breeding, and longevity but moderately correlated with hand-wing index, a proxy for wing shape and flight efficiency. Given our results and the context of the broader literature perhaps it is time that we begin to question the prevailing paradigm that one or a few traits largely explain rate variation and accept instead that substitution rate may be the product of weak interactions among many, potentially taxon-specific, variables.",

Despite decades of research, a comprehensive investigation into the consequences of TCA cycle dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we targeted two TCA cycle enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and combined metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses to fully appraise the consequences of TCA cycle inhibition (TCAi) in kidney epithelial cells. Our comparative approach shows that TCAi elicits a convergent rewiring of redox and amino acid metabolism dependent on the activation of ATF4 and the integrated stress response (ISR). Furthermore, we also uncover a divergent metabolic response, whereby acute FHi, but not SDHi, can maintain asparagine levels via reductive carboxylation and maintenance of cytosolic aspartate synthesis.

    "abstract": "Protein acetylation is a central event in orchestrating diverse cellular processes. However, current strategies to investigate protein acetylation in cells are often non-specific or lack temporal and magnitude control. Here, we developed an acetylation tagging system, AceTAG, to induce acetylation of targeted proteins. The AceTAG system utilizes bifunctional molecules to direct the lysine acetyltransferase p300/CBP to proteins fused with the small protein tag FKBP12F36V, resulting in their induced acetylation. Using AceTAG, we induced targeted acetylation of a diverse array of proteins in cells, specifically histone H3.3, the NF-{kappa}B subunit p65/RelA, and the tumor suppressor p53. We demonstrate that targeted acetylation with the AceTAG system is rapid, selective, reversible, and can be controlled in a dose-dependent fashion. AceTAG represents a useful strategy to modulate protein acetylation and will enable the exploration of targeted acetylation in basic biological and therapeutic contexts.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=67 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/454011v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7eeddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f2fbf1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a9d23org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e2a5b4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Segmenting bone from background is required to quantify bone architecture in computed tomography (CT) image data. A deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a promising alternative method for automatic segmentation. The study objectives were to evaluate the performance of CNNs in automatic segmentation of human vertebral body (micro-CT) and femoral neck (nano-CT) data and to investigate the performance of CNNs to segment data across scanners.\n\nScans of human L1 vertebral bodies (microCT [North Star Imaging], n=28, 53m3) and femoral necks (nano-CT [GE], n=28, 27m3) were used for evaluation. Six slices were selected for each scan and then manually segmented to create ground truth masks (Dragonfly 4.0, ORS). Two-dimensional U-Net CNNs were trained in Dragonfly 4.0 with images of the [FN] femoral necks only, [VB] vertebral bodies only, and [F+V] combined CT data. Global (i.e., Otsu and Yen) and local (i.e., Otsu r = 100) thresholding methods were applied to each dataset. Segmentation performance was evaluated using the Dice coefficient, a similarity metric of overlap. Kruskal-Wallis and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests were used to test for significant differences in the accuracy of segmentation methods.\n\nThe FN U-Net had significantly higher Dice coefficients (i.e., better performance) than the global (Otsu: p=0.001; Yen: p=0.001) and local (Otsu [r=100]: p=0.001) thresholding methods and the VB U-Net (p=0.001) but there was no significant difference in model performance compared to the FN + VB U-net (p=0.783) on femoral neck image data. The VB U-net had significantly higher Dice coefficients than the global and local Otsu (p=0.001 for both) and FN U-Net (p=0.001) but not compared to the Yen (p=0.462) threshold or FN + VB U-net (p=0.783) on vertebral body image data.\n\nThe results demonstrate that the U-net architecture outperforms common thresholding methods. Further, a network trained with bone data from a different system (i.e., different image acquisition parameters and voxel size) and a different anatomical site can perform well on unseen data. Finally, a network trained with combined datasets performed well on both datasets, indicating that a network can feasibly be trained with multiple datasets and perform well on varied image data.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi complex is a membranous organelle located in the heart of the eukaryotic secretory pathway. A subfamily of the Golgi matrix proteins, called GRASPs, are key players in the stress-induced unconventional secretion, the Golgi dynamics during mitosis/apoptosis, and Golgi ribbon formation. The Golgi ribbon is vertebrate-specific and correlates with the appearance of two GRASP paralogs (GRASP55/GRASP65) and two coiled-coil Golgins (GM130/Golgin45), which interact with each other in vivo. Although essential for the Golgi ribbon formation and the increase in Golgi structural complexity, the molecular details leading to their appearance only in this subphylum are still unknown. Moreover, despite the new functionalities supported by the GRASP paralogy, little is known about the structural and evolutionary differences between these paralogues. In this context, we used ancestor sequence reconstruction and several biophysical/biochemical approaches to assess the evolution of the GRASP structure, flexibility, and how they started anchoring their Golgin partners. Our data showed that the Golgins appeared in evolution and were anchored by the single GRASP ancestor before gorasp gene duplication and divergence in Metazoans. After the gorasp divergence, variations inside the GRASP binding pocket determined which paralogue would recruit each Golgin partner (GRASP55 with Golgin45 and GRASP65 with GM130). These interactions are responsible for the proteins specific Golgi locations and the appearance of the Golgi ribbon. We also suggest that the capacity of GRASPs to form supramolecular structures is a long-standing feature, which likely affects GRASPs participation as a trigger of the stress-induced secretory pathway.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac injury is associated with critical COVID-19, yet its etiology remains debated. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, we conducted a single-center prospective cohort study of 69 COVID-19 decedents. Of six cardiac histopathologic features, microthrombi was the most commonly detected (n=48, 70%). We tested associations of cardiac microthrombi with biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and fibrinolysis and with in-hospital antiplatelet therapy, therapeutic anticoagulation, and corticosteroid treatment, while adjusting for multiple clinical factors, including COVID-19 therapies. Higher peak ESR and CRP during hospitalization were independently associated with higher odds of microthrombi. Using single nuclei RNA-sequence analysis, we discovered an enrichment of pro-thrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune-potentiating signaling amongst cardiac fibroblasts in microthrombi-positive COVID-19 hearts relative to microthrombi-negative COVID-19. Non-COVID-19 non-failing hearts were used as reference controls. Our cumulative findings identify the specific transcriptomic changes in cardiac fibroblasts as salient features of COVID-19-associated cardiac microthrombi.",

    "abstract": "AimThis study was conducted to explore the mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 ameliorates hepatic insulin resistance in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes.\n\nMethodsSprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal, control, and 1,25(OH)2D3 administered at 0.075, 0.15, and 0.3 g/kg/d. Tissue and blood samples were obtained from all five groups after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Morphological changes in the livers were observed with HE staining. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, and lipids were determined using an automatic biochemistry analyzer. The levels of hepatic glycogen, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were analyzed by spectrophotometry. Protein expression of AKT and GLUT2 was examined by western blotting.\n\nResults1,25(OH)2D3 treatment reduced the FBG content as well as hepatic MDA, AST, and ALT levels, improved the activity of SOD, and enhanced the expression of GLUT2 and AKT in diabetic rats. These findings suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3, exerts antioxidant effects and ameliorates insulin resistance in the liver.\n\nConclusion1,25(OH)2D3 is a potential agent that could be used in the treatment of insulin resistance in the liver.",

We hypothesized that chronic maternal DBP exposure could induce abnormal metabolism of glucolipid.\n\nMaterials and methodsSprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with different doses of DBP, estradiol, and corn oil from gestational day 7 until the end of lactation. The weights, visceral fat percentage, serum lipid, insulin and glucose, protein levels of PI3K signal pathway in muscle were detected in F1 female offspring.\n\nResultsAlthough the birth weight of F1 female offspring was not different among groups, the weights were heavier in DBP groups from postnatal day 7 to adult (P<0.001). The visceral adipose percentage in adult female offspring was increased by perinatal exposure to DBP (P<0.001). Decreased serum levels of triglyceride (P<0.0001), fasting glucose (P=0.004), prolactin (P=0.006), HOMA-IR (P=0.014) were found in female offspring exposed to DBP, but no difference for fasting insulin, total cholesterol, adiponectin. Increased protein levels of p-AKT, but decreased PTEN and GPR30 were observed in muscle of female offspring in DBP group, but without significant difference. None difference was observed for the protein levels of PI3K, AKT, GLUT4, InsR and IRS-1.\n\nConclusionMaternal perinatal exposure to DBP induced obesity and accumulation of visceral adipose tissue for the adult female offspring. Serum glucolipid and local signal transduction of PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in muscle were not adversely affected by perinatal exposure to DBP for adult female offspring.",

    "abstract": "In the context of climate change it is important to keep biodiversity databases up-to-date. This priority generates the need for a metric to assess the concept of up-to-dateness. The objective of this paper is to devise a measure of up-to-dateness for atlas-type biodiversity data. The data input into the algorithm consists of the species, date and grid cell allocation of all available records for a taxon in a region. First, for each grid cell in a region, the median of the date of the most recent record of each species is calculated. Secondly, the median of the median dates for each grid cell yields an overall measure of up-to-dateness. The performance of this algorithm is investigated in relation to databases for six taxa in southern Africa. In June 2021, the up-to-dateness of the databases varied from 41 years for the reptile database to two years for the bird database. The quality of a biodiversity database is a multidimensional concept; up-to-dateness is only one of several dimensions. The paper identifies a need to quantify the rate at which the \"value\" of a record decays as evidence that a species still occurs at a locality, and suggests an experimental process for doing this. The use of the up-to-dateness index to motivate citizen scientists is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to effectively choose between dissimilar options implies that information regarding the options values must be available, either explicitly or implicitly, in the brain. Explicit realizations of value involve single neurons whose responses depend on value and not on the specific features that determine it. Implicit realizations, by contrast, come from the coordinated action of neurons that encode specific features. One signature of implicit value coding is that population responses to offers with the same value but different features should occupy semi- or fully orthogonal neural subspaces that are nonetheless linked. Here, we examined responses of neurons in six core value-coding areas in a choice task with risky and safe options. Using stricter criteria than some past studies have used, we find, surprisingly, no evidence for abstract value neurons (i.e., neurons with the response to equally valued risky and safe options) in any of these regions. Moreover, population codes for value resided in orthogonal subspaces; these subspaces were linked through a linear transform of each of their constituent subspaces. These results suggest that in all six regions, populations of neurons embed value implicitly in a distributed population.",

    "abstract": "In order to continuously respond to a changing environment and support self-generating cognition and behaviour, neural communication must be highly flexible and dynamic at the same time than hierarchically organized. While whole-brain fMRI measures have revealed robust yet changing patterns of statistical dependencies between regions, it is not clear whether these statistical patterns --referred to as functional connectivity-- can reflect dynamic large-scale communication in a way that is relevant to human cognition. For functional connectivity to reflect cognition, and therefore actual communication, we propose three necessary conditions: it must span sufficient temporal complexity to support the needs of cognition while still being highly organized so that the system behaves reliably; it must be able to adapt to the current behavioural context; it must exhibit fluctuations at timescales that are compatible with the timescales of cognition. To obtain reliable estimations of time-varying functional connectivity, we developed principal components of connectivity analysis (PCCA), an approach based on applying principal component analysis on multiple runs of a time-varying functional connectivity model. We use PCCA to show that functional connectivity follows low-yet multi-dimensional trajectories that can be reliably measured, and that these trajectories meet the aforementioned criteria. These analyses suggest that these trajectories might index certain aspects of communication between neural populations and support moment-to-moment cognition.\n\nSignificance StatementfMRI functional connectivity is one of the most widely used metrics in neuroimaging research in both theoretical research and clinical applications. However, this work suffers from a lack of context because we still do not fully understand what fMRI functional connectivity can or cannot reflect biologically and behaviourally. In particular, can it reflect between-region neuronal communication? We develop methods to reliably quantify temporal trajectories of functional connectivity and investigate the nature of these trajectories across different experimental conditions. Using these methods, we demonstrate that functional connectivity exhibits reliable changes that are context-dependent, reflect cognitive complexity, and bear a relationship with cognitive abilities. These conditions show that fMRI functional connectivity could reflect changes in between-region communication above and beyond non-neural factors.",

    "abstract": "In bioinformatics, alignment is an essential technique for finding similarities between biological sequences. Usually, the alignment is performed with the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm, a well-known sequence alignment technique of high-level precision based on dynamic programming. However, given the massive data volume in biological databases and their continuous exponential increase, high-speed data processing is necessary. Therefore, this work proposes a parallel hardware design for the SW algorithm with a systolic array structure to accelerate the Forward and Backtracking steps. For this purpose, the architecture calculates and stores the paths in the Forward stage for pre-organizing the alignment, which reduces the complexity of the Backtracking stage. The backtracking starts from the maximum score position in the matrix and generates the optimal SW sequence alignment path. The architecture was validated on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and synthesis analyses have shown that the proposed design reaches up to 79.5 Giga Cell Updates per Second (GCPUS).",

    "abstract": "The main factors influencing speed in athletes are stride length (SL) and stride rate (SR). However, conflict remains whether SL or SR is the key determinant of higher speeds. Quarter Horses (QH) generally reach higher speeds in their races than do Thoroughbreds (TB). However, the influence of SL and SR on this greater speed is unclear. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to compare SL and SR in QH and TB raced in short (sprint) and long (classic) distances. We hypothesized that QH have a higher SR in comparison to TB, and SR decreases as distance increases. Two race distances were analyzed for each breed: QH races of 100.6 and 402.3 m, and TB races of 1,207.0 m and 2,011.7 m. Data from twenty horses were obtained, consisting of five horses from each race distance (10 QH and 10 TB). Five individuals watched recordings of each race three times counting the number of strides taken by each winning horse. The SR was calculated using the average number of strides over a given race duration, and SL was determined by calculating the total number of strides over the distance covered. Speed was calculated dividing the distance by the time of the winning horse. The PROC Mixed Procedure was used to identify statistical differences between breeds, and between distances within the same breed. Results showed that although the SL of the TB was longer in comparison with the QH (P<0.001), the average SR in QH was higher than in TB (2.88 vs 2.34 + 0.03 strides/s; P<0.001). Further, QH classic distance demonstrated a faster speed than TB at either distance (P<0.001). In conclusion, QH achieve a higher SR in comparison to TB (between 14-20% more than TB), confirming the importance of SR in achieving high racing speeds.",

The recent finding of the genetic interaction of WRKY53, a key senescence-related gene with REVOLUTA, a master regulator of early leaf patterning, raises the question of how early and late developmental events are connected. Here, we investigated the developmental and metabolic consequences of an alteration of the REVOLUTA and WRKY53 gene expression, from seedling to fruiting. Our results show that REVOLUTA critically controls late developmental phases and reproduction while inversely WRKY53 determines vegetative growth at early developmental stages. We further show that these regulators of distinct developmental phases frequently, but not continuously, interact throughout ontogeny and demonstrated that their genetic interaction is mediated by the salicylic acid (SA). Moreover, we showed that REVOLUTA and WRKY53 are keys regulatory nodes of development and plant immunity thought their role in SA metabolic pathways, which also highlights the role of REV in pathogen defence. Together, our findings demonstrate how late and early developmental events are tightly intertwined by molecular hubs. These hubs interact with each other throughout ontogeny, and participate to the interplay between plant development and immunity.",

Using our executable model, we performed in silico screening of 9870 pairs of 140 potential targets and have identified 12 new drug combinations.

    "abstract": "Barcode fusion genetics (BFG) utilizes deep sequencing to improve the throughput of protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening in pools. BFG has been implemented in Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens (BFG-Y2H). While Y2H requires test protein pairs to localize in the nucleus for reporter reconstruction, Dihydrofolate Reductase Protein-Fragment Complementation Assay (DHFR-PCA) allows proteins to localize in broader subcellular contexts and proves to be largely orthogonal to Y2H. Here, we implemented BFG to DHFR-PCA (BFG-PCA). This plasmid-based system can leverage ORF collections across model organisms to perform comparative analysis, unlike the original DHFR-PCA that requires yeast genomic integration. The scalability and quality of BFG-PCA were demonstrated by screening human and yeast interactions for >11,000 protein pairs. BFG-PCA showed high-sensitivity and high-specificity for capturing known interactions for both species. BFG-Y2H and BFG-PCA capture distinct sets of PPIs, which can partially be explained based on the domain orientation of the reporter tags. BFG-PCA is a high-throughput protein interaction technology to interrogate binary PPIs that exploits clone collections from any species of interest, expanding the scope of PPI assays.",

    "abstract": "The egg parasitoid Trichogramma spp. is an important biological control agent used against multiple species of Lepidopteran pest in forestry and agriculture. Due to the importance of Trichogramma spp. in biocontrol programs, its biological characteristics have been studied in detail, and current investigations should focus on the molecular biology of these tiny parasitoids. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is considered as the standard method for quantifying the gene expression of organisms. Surprisingly, the appropriate reference genes to ensure robust qPCR have not been documented at all for the Trichogramma genus. This study aimed to identify suitable reference genes for use in qPCR procedure of Trichogramma dendrolimi. Nine candidate housekeeping genes, namely glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), forkhead box O (FOXO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), beta-actin (ACTIN), ribosomal protein L10a (RPL10a), L18 (RPL18), L28 (RPL28), S13 (RPS13), and S15 (RPS15), were tested for their suitability as reference genes for developmental stage (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th day after parasitization), tissue (head, thorax, and abdomen of adults), sex of adults (male and female), and temperature (17 {degrees}C, 25 {degrees}C, and 32 {degrees}C). According to the GeNorm analysis, robust analysis should involve using an appropriate combination of reference genes, namely, at least three genes for different development stages, two genes for different tissues, two genes for different sex, and two genes for different temperature, respectively. According to the RelFinder method and by assessing the integrated values from using the {Delta}Ct method, GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, we identified the developmental stage-specific reference genes SOD, GAPDH, and ACTIN; tissue-specific reference genes RPL18 and RPS15; sex-specific reference genes SOD and RPL18; and temperature-specific reference genes RPL18 and RPL10. When testing the use of stable vs. unstable reference genes, the substantial differences were observed in the estimation expression of a hypothetical target gene, HSP90, in response to temperature. The present study provides a robust method for the measurement of gene expression in T. dendrolimi and will be helpful for future biological control programs using Trichogramma wasps.",

    "abstract": "Consumer demands and increased regulations on the use of antimicrobials in farm animals accentuated the need to develop strategies to replace antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) in food-producing animals. The present study evaluates the productive and gut health outcomes during the implementation of AGPs free programs based on the inclusion of a tannin blend compared with AGPs based program under commercial conditions. In the first trial, 6 farms were randomly assigned to AGP or tannin-based programs. In a second trial, both programs were applied simultaneously in one farm and the results were studied over 1 year. Although productive results from both trials were similar among treatments, evaluations of gut health indicators show improvements in the tannins treated flocks. Frequency and severity of intestinal gross lesions were reduced in jejunum (42% vs 23%; p<0.05 - 1.37 vs. 0.73; p<0.01, respectively) and ileum (25% vs. 10%; p<0.0.5 - 1.05 vs. 0.58; p<0.01) in tannins treated birds. Results from 16S studies, show that cecal microbiota diversity was not differentially affected by AGPs or tannins, but changes in the relative abundance of certain taxa were described, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium groups. Additional evaluations using an in vivo model for C. perfringens necrotic enteritis showed that tannins treated birds had reduced incidence of gross lesions in jejunum (43.75 vs. 74.19%; p<0.01) and ileum (18.75% vs. 45.16%; p<0.05) compared with control. These results suggest that AGPs can be replaced by tannins feed additives, and contribute in the implementation of antimicrobial-free programs in broilers without affecting health or performance.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleases are crucial enzymes in RNA metabolism and post-transcriptional regulatory processes in bacteria. Cyanobacteria encode the two essential ribonucleases RNase E and RNase J. Cyanobacterial RNase E is shorter than homologues in other groups of bacteria and lacks both the chloroplast-specific N-terminal extension as well as the C-terminal domain typical for RNase E of enterobacteria. In order to investigate the function of RNase E in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we engineered a temperature-sensitive RNase E mutant by introducing two site-specific mutations, I65F and spontaneously occurring V94A. This enabled us to perform RNA-seq after the transient inactivation of RNase E by a temperature shift (TIER-seq) and to map 1,472 RNase-E-dependent cleavage sites. We inferred a dominating cleavage signature consisting of an adenine at the -3 and a uridine at the +2 position within a single-stranded segment of the RNA. The data identified putative RNase-E-dependent instances of operon discoordination, mRNAs likely regulated jointly by RNase E and an sRNA, potential 3 end-derived sRNAs and a dual-acting mechanism for the glutamine riboswitch. Our findings substantiate the pivotal role of RNase E in post-transcriptional regulation and suggest the redundant or concerted action of RNase E and RNase J in cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is a major endocrine organ capable of releasing inflammatory adipokines. Inflammatory adipokine release is linked to the changes occurring in adipose tissue in the overfed state, where tissue remodeling results in hypertrophic adipocytes that recruit monocytes to infiltrate the tissue and take on an inflammatory phenotype. As the proportion of inflammatory macrophages increases there is a concurrent increase in release of macrophage-specific inflammatory mediators, further contributing to the inflamed state and setting an inflammatory loop between the macrophages and adipocytes. Although most inflammatory adipokines are released by macrophages, adipocytes can also release immunomodulatory adipokines, such as leptin. The objective of this research was to determine if co-incubation of activated macrophages with mature adipocytes, using Transwell inserts, affected leptin release by mature adipocytes. We also examined if there were differences in the amount of cell-secreted products quantified in cell-conditioned media collected from macrophage-containing (Transwell insert) and adipocyte-containing (well) compartments. Mature adipocytes (differentiated 3T3-L1 murine fibroblasts) were co-incubated with control and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated (0.01 g/ml) murine macrophages (RAW264.7), and nitric oxide, interleukin-6, and leptin levels were quantified in the cell-conditioned media from the two compartments. Activation status of the macrophages did not affect leptin release by the adipocytes. We observed higher amounts of leptin in wells compared to Transwells. Nitric oxide and interleukin-6 levels were similar between Transwells and wells, suggesting that these adipokines are traveling through the Transwell inserts and reaching equilibrium between the two compartments. There was a weak negative relationship between nitric oxide release by macrophages and leptin release by adipocytes. Our results suggest that co-incubating activated macrophages and adipocytes using Transwell inserts can result in distinct microenvironments in the different cellular compartments and that separate sampling of these compartments is required to detect the subtle signaling dynamics that exist between these cells.",

    "abstract": "The development of high-throughput genomic technologies associated with recent genetic perturbation techniques such as short hairpin RNA (shRNA), gene trapping, or gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9) has made it possible to obtain large perturbation data sets. These data sets are invaluable sources of information regarding the function of genes, and they offer unique opportunities to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks in specific cell types. Modular response analysis (MRA) is a well-accepted mathematical modeling method that is precisely aimed at such network inference tasks, but its use has been limited to rather small biological systems so far. In this study, we show that MRA can be employed on large systems with almost 1,000 network components. In particular, we show that MRA performance surpasses general-purpose mutual information-based algorithms. Part of these competitive results was obtained by the application of a novel heuristic that pruned MRA-inferred interactions a posteriori. We also exploited a block structure in MRA linear algebra to parallelize large system resolutions.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe knowledge of gene and protein regulatory networks in specific cell types, including pathologic cells, is an important endeavor in the post-genomic era. A particular type of data obtained through the systematic perturbation of the actors of such networks enables the reconstruction of the latter and is becoming available at a large scale (networks comprised of almost 1,000 genes). In this work, we benchmark the performance of a classical methodology for such data called modular response analysis, which has been so far applied to networks of modest sizes. We also propose improvements to increase performance and to accelerate computations on large problems.",
