    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial interactions are fundamental for Earths ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling. Nevertheless, they are challenging to identify and remain barely known. Omics-based censuses are helpful in predicting microbial interactions through the statistical inference of single (static) association networks. Yet, microbial interactions are dynamic and we have limited knowledge of how they change over time. Here we investigate the dynamics of microbial associations in a 10-year marine time series in the Mediterranean Sea using an approach inferring a time-resolved (temporal) network from a single static network.\n\nResultsA single static network including microbial eukaryotes and bacteria was built using metabarcoding data derived from 120 monthly samples. For the decade, we aimed to identify persistent, seasonal, and temporary microbial associations by determining a temporal network that captures the interactome of each individual sample. We found that the temporal network appears to follow an annual cycle, collapsing and reassembling when transiting between colder and warmer waters. We observed higher association repeatability in colder than in warmer months. Only 16 associations could be validated using observations reported in literature, underlining our knowledge gap in marine microbial ecological interactions.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that marine microbial associations follow recurrent temporal dynamics in temperate zones, which need to be accounted for to better understand the functioning of the ocean microbiome. The constructed marine temporal network may serve as a resource for testing season-specific microbial interaction hypotheses. The applied approach can be transferred to microbiome studies in other ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Protein thermostability is important for fitness but difficult to measure across the proteome. Fortunately, protein thermostability is correlated with prokaryote optimal growth temperatures (OGTs), which can be predicted from genome features. Models that can predict temperature sensitivity across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide would help inform how eukaryotes adapt to elevated temperatures, such as those predicted by climate change models. In this study we test whether prediction models can cross the prokaryote-eukaryote divide to predict protein stability in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We compare models built using a) the whole proteome, b) Pfam domains, and c) individual amino acid residues. Proteome-wide models accurately predict prokaryote optimal growth temperatures (r2 up to 0.93), while site-specific models demonstrate that nearly half of the proteome is associated with optimal growth temperature in both Archaea and Bacteria. Comparisons with the small number of eukaryotes with temperature sensitivity data suggest that site-specific models are the most transferable across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide. Using the site-specific models, we evaluated temperature sensitivity for 323,850 amino acid residues in 2,088 Pfam domain clusters in Archaea and Bacteria species separately. 59.0% of tested residues are significantly associated with OGT in Archaea and 75.2% of tested residues are significantly associated with OGT in Bacteria species at a 5% false discovery rate. These models make it possible to identify which Pfam domains and amino acid residues are involved in temperature adaptation and facilitate future research questions about how species will fare in the face of increasing environmental temperatures.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity DNA polymerases select the correct nucleotide over the structurally similar incorrect nucleotides with extremely high specificity while maintaining fast rates of incorporation. Previous analysis revealed the conformational dynamics and complete kinetic pathway governing correct nucleotide incorporation using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase variant containing a fluorescent unnatural amino acid. Here we extend this analysis to investigate the kinetics of nucleotide misincorporation and mismatch extension. We report the specificity constants for all possible misincorporations and characterize the conformational dynamics of the enzyme during misincorporation and mismatch extension. We present free energy profiles based on the kinetic measurements and discuss the effect of different steps on specificity. During mismatch incorporation and subsequent extension (with the correct nucleotide), the rates of the conformational change and chemistry are both greatly reduced. The nucleotide dissociation rate, however, increases to greatly exceed the rate of chemistry. To investigate the structural basis for discrimination against mismatched nucleotides, we performed all atom molecular dynamics simulations on complexes with either the correct or mismatched nucleotide bound at the polymerase active site. We show that the closed form of the enzyme with a mismatch bound is greatly destabilized due to weaker interactions with active site residues, non-ideal base pairing, and a large increase in the distance from the 3-OH group of the primer strand to the -phosphate of the incoming nucleotide, explaining the reduced rates of misincorporation. The observed kinetic and structural mechanisms governing nucleotide misincorporation reveal the general principles likely applicable to other high fidelity DNA polymerases.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy induces a metabolic shift, leading to a preferential consumption of glucose (over fatty acids) to support the high energetic demand. Typically, health cardiac tissue utilizes more fat than any other organ. Calorie restriction is a dietary procedure that induces health benefits and lifespan extension in many organisms. Given the beneficial effects of calorie restriction and the metabolic dysregulation seen during cardiac hypertrophy, we hypothesized that calorie restriction prevents cardiac hypertrophy, lipid, mitochondrial, and redox dysregulations. Strikingly, calorie restriction reversed isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, lowered succinate driven mitochondrial H2O2 production, improved mitochondrial function (indicated as a higher Respiratory Control Ratio - RCR) and avoided mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) repression. To gain insight into how calorie restriction could interfere with the metabolic changes induced by cardiac hypertrophy, we performed lipidomic profiling. Calorie restriction protected against the consumption of several triglycerides (TG) linked to unsaturated fatty acids, and the accumulation of TGs containing saturated fatty acids observed in hypertrophic samples. Cardiac hypertrophy induced an increase in ceramides, phosphoethanolamines and acylcarnitines (12:0, 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0) that were also reversed by calorie restriction. Altogether, our data demonstrate that hypertrophy changes the cardiac lipidome, causes mitochondrial disturbances and oxidative stress. All these changes are prevented by calorie restriction intervention in vivo. This study uncovers calorie restriction as a resource protect cardiac tissue and prevent cardiac hypertrophy-induced lipidomic remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Kv3 ion-channels constitute a class of functionally distinct voltage gated ion channels characterized by their ability to fire at a high frequency. Several disease relevant mutants, together with biological data, suggest the importance of this class of ion channels as drug targets for CNS disorders, and several drug discovery efforts have been reported. Despite the increasing interest for this class of ion channels, no structure of a Kv3 channel has been reported yet. We have determined the cryo-EM structure of Kv3.1 at 2.6 [A] resolution using full length wild type protein. When compared to known structures for potassium channels from other classes, a novel domain organization is observed with the cytoplasmic T1 domain, containing a well resolved Zinc site and displaying a rotation by 35{degrees}. This suggests a distinct cytoplasmic regulation mechanism for the Kv3.1 channel. A high resolution structure was obtained for Kv3.1 in complex with a novel positive modulator Lu AG00563. The structure reveals a novel ligand binding site for the Kv class of ion channels located between the voltage sensory domain and the channel pore, a region which constitutes a hotspot for disease causing mutations. The discovery of a novel binding site for a positive modulator of a voltage gated potassium channel could shed light on the mechanism of action for these small molecule potentiators. This finding could enable structure-based drug design on these targets with high therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple CNS disorders.",

    "abstract": "Localized stimulation of the inner retinal neurons for high-acuity prosthetic vision requires small pixels and minimal cross-talk from neighboring electrodes. Local return electrodes within each pixel limit crosstalk, but can over-constrain the electric field, thus precluding efficient stimulation with subretinal pixels smaller than 50 m. Here we demonstrate high-resolution prosthetic vision based on a novel design of a photovoltaic array, where field confinement is achieved dynamically, leveraging the adjustable conductivity of the diodes under forward bias to turn the designated pixels into transient returns. We validated computational modeling of the field confinement in such an optically-controlled circuit by ex-vivo and in-vivo measurements. Most importantly, using this strategy, we demonstrated that the grating acuity with 40 m pixels matches the pixel pitch, while with 20 m pixels, it reaches the 28 m limit of the natural visual resolution in rats. This method enables customized field shaping based on individual retinal thickness and distance from the implant, paving the way to prosthetic vision with acuity as high as 20/80 in atrophic macular degeneration.",

    "abstract": "The possibility of contamination of human skin by infectious virions plays an important role in indirect transmission of respiratory viruses but little is known about the fundamental physico-chemical aspects of the virus-skin interactions. In the case of coronaviruses, the interaction with surfaces (including the skin surface) is mediated by their large glycoprotein spikes that protrude from (and cover) the viral envelope. Here, we perform all atomic simulations between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models. We consider an \"oily\" skin covered by sebum and a \"clean\" skin exposing the stratum corneum. The simulations show that the spike tries to maximize the contacts with stratum corneum lipids, particularly ceramides, with substantial hydrogen bonding. In the case of \"oily\" skin, the spike is able to retain its structure, orientation and hydration over sebum with little interaction with sebum components. Comparison of these results with our previous simulations of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike with hydrophilic and hydrophobic solid surfaces, suggests that the\"soft\" or \"hard\" nature of the surface plays an essential role in the interaction of the spike protein with materials.",

    "abstract": "Dyslexia is a frequent developmental disorder in which reading acquisition is delayed and that is usually associated with difficulties understanding speech in noise. At the neuronal level, children with dyslexia were reported to display abnormal cortical tracking of speech (CTS) at phrasal rate. Here, we aimed to determine if abnormal tracking is a cause or a consequence of dyslexia and if it is modulated by the severity of dyslexia or the presence of acoustic noise.\n\nWe included 26 school-age children with dyslexia, 26 age-matched controls and 26 reading-level matched controls. All were native French speakers. Childrens brain activity was recorded with magnetoencephalography while they listened to continuous speech in noiseless and multiple noise conditions. CTS values were compared between groups, conditions and hemispheres, and also within groups, between children with best and worse reading performance.\n\nSyllabic CTS was significantly reduced in the right superior temporal gyrus in children with dyslexia compared with controls matched for age but not for reading level. Among children with dyslexia, phrasal CTS tended to lateralize to the left hemisphere in severe dyslexia and lateralized to the right hemisphere in children with mild dyslexia and in all control groups. Finally, phrasal CTS was lower in children with dyslexia compared with age-matched controls, but only in informational noise conditions. No such effect was seen in comparison with reading-level matched controls.\n\nOverall, our results confirmed the finding of altered neuronal basis of speech perception in noiseless and babble noise conditions in dyslexia compared with age-matched peers. However, the absence of alteration in comparison with reading-level matched controls suggests that such alterations are a consequence of reduced reading experience rather than a cause of dyslexia.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe cortical tracking of speech (CTS) was assessed in dyslexia and proper controls\nC_LIO_LIPhrasal CTS and its resistance to noise were altered in dyslexia\nC_LIO_LISuch alterations were not found in comparison with controls matched for reading level\nC_LIO_LIThe severity of dyslexia modulated the hemispheric lateralization of phrasal CTS\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While traditional theories of sensorimotor processing have often assumed a serial decision-making pipeline, more recent approaches have suggested that multiple actions may be planned concurrently and vie for execution. Evidence for the latter almost exclusively stems from electrophysiological studies in posterior parietal and premotor cortex of monkeys. Here we study concurrent prospective motor planning in humans by recording functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a delayed response task engaging movement sequences towards multiple potential targets. We find that also in human posterior parietal and premotor cortex delay activity modulates both with sequence complexity and the number of potential targets. We tested the hypothesis that this modulation is best explained by concurrent prospective planning as opposed to the mere maintenance of potential targets in memory. We devise a bounded rationality model with information constraints that optimally assigns information resources for planning and memory for this task and determine predicted information profiles according to the two hypotheses. When regressing delay activity on these model predictions, we find that the concurrent prospective planning strategy provides a significantly better explanation of the fMRI-signal modulations. Moreover, we find that concurrent prospective planning is more costly and thus limited for most subjects, as expressed by the best fitting information capacities. We conclude that bounded rational decision-making models allow relating both behavior and neural representations to utilitarian task descriptions based on bounded optimal information-processing assumptions.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen the future is uncertain, it can be beneficial to concurrently plan several action possibilities in advance. Electrophysiological research found evidence in monkeys that brain regions in posterior parietal and promotor cortex are indeed capable of planning several actions in parallel. We now used fMRI to study brain activity in these brain regions in humans. For our analyses we applied bounded rationality models that optimally assign information resources to fMRI activity in a complex motor planning task. We find that theoretical information costs of concurrent prospective planning explained fMRI activity profiles significantly better than assuming alternative memory-based strategies. Moreover, exploiting the model allowed us to quantify the individual capacity limit for concurrent planning and to relate these individual limits to both subjects behavior and to their neural representations of planning.",

    "abstract": "Burkholderia cenocepacia (Bc) is a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), a group of bacteria with members responsible for causing lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The most severe outcome of Bcc infection in CF patients is cepacia syndrome, a disease characterized by necrotizing pneumonia with bacteremia and sepsis. Bc is strongly associated with cepacia syndrome making it one of the most virulent members of the Bcc. Mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Bc in lung infections and cepacia syndrome remain to be uncovered. Bc is primarily an intracellular pathogen, and encodes the type VI secretion system (T6SS) anti-host effector TecA, which is translocated into host cells. TecA is a deamidase that inactivates multiple Rho GTPases, including RhoA. Inactivation of RhoA by TecA triggers assembly of the pyrin inflammasome, leading to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1{beta} from macrophages. Previous work with the Bc clinical isolate J2315 showed that TecA increases immunopathology during acute lung infection in C57BL/6 mice and suggested that this effector acts as a virulence factor by triggering assembly of the pyrin inflammasome. Here, we extend these results using a second Bc clinical isolate, AU1054, to demonstrate that TecA exacerbates weight loss and lethality during lung infection in C57BL/6 mice and CF mice. Unexpectedly, pyrin was dispensable for TecA virulence activity in both mouse infection models. Our findings establish that TecA is a Bc virulence factor that exacerbates lung inflammation, weight loss, and lethality in a mouse lung infection model.\n\nImportanceBc is often considered the most virulent species in the Bcc because of its close association with cepacia syndrome in addition to its capacity to cause chronic lung infections in CF patients (Loutet and Valvano 2010). Prior to this study virulence factors of Bc important for causing lethal disease had not been identified in a CF animal model of lung infection. Results of this study describe a CF mouse model and its use in demonstrating that the T6SS effector TecA of Bc exacerbates inflammatory cell recruitment and weight loss and is required for lethality and thus acts as a key virulence factor during lung infection. This model will be important in further studies to better understand TecAs role as a virulence factor and in investigating ways to prevent or treat Bc infections in CF patients. Additionally, TecA may be the founding member of a family of virulence factors in opportunistic pathogens.",

The vector pSelAct-KO is a recombination based, markerless knockout system that uses dual selection to engineer seamless deletions of a region of interest, providing opportunities for repeated higher-order genetic knockouts. The efficacy of pSelAct-KO was demonstrated in C. michiganensis and confirmed using whole genome sequencing. We developed permissR, an R package to identify permissive sites for chromosomal integration, which can be used in conjunction with pSelAct-Express, a non-replicating integrative plasmid that enables recombination into a permissive genomic location. Expression of eGFP by pSelAct-Express was verified in two candidate permissive regions predicted by permissR in C. michiganensis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBilophila wadsworthia, a strictly anaerobic, sulfite-reducing bacterium and common member of the human gut microbiota, has been associated with diseases such as appendicitis and colitis. It is specialized on organosulfonate respiration for energy conservation, i.e., utilization of dietary and host-derived organosulfonates, such as taurine (2-aminoethansulfonate), as sulfite donors for sulfite respiration, producing hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an important intestinal metabolite that may have beneficial as well as detrimental effects on the colonic environment. Its taurine desulfonation pathway involves a glycyl radical enzyme (GRE), isethionate sulfite-lyase (IslAB), which cleaves isethionate (2-hydroxyethane sulfonate) into acetaldehyde and sulfite.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that taurine metabolism in B. wadsworthia 3.1.6 involves bacterial microcompartments (BMCs). First, we confirmed taurine-inducible production of BMCs by proteomic, transcriptomic and ultra-thin sectioning and electron-microscopical analyses. Then, we isolated BMCs from taurine-grown cells by density-gradient ultracentrifugation and analyzed their composition by proteomics as well as by enzyme assays, which suggested that the GRE IslAB and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase are located inside of the BMCs. Finally, we are discussing the recycling of cofactors in the IslAB-BMCs and a potential shuttling of electrons across the BMC shell by a potential ironsulfur (FeS) cluster-containing shell protein identified by sequence analysis.\n\nConclusionsWe characterized a novel subclass of BMCs and broadened the spectrum of reactions known to take place enclosed in BMCs, which is of biotechnological interest. We also provided more details on the energy metabolism of the opportunistic pathobiont B. wadsworthia and on microbial H2S production in the human gut.",

    "abstract": "Low CFTR mRNA expression due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a major hurdle in developing a therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by the W1282X mutation in the CFTR gene. CFTR-W1282X truncated protein retains partial function, so increasing its levels by inhibiting NMD of its mRNA will likely be beneficial. Because NMD regulates the normal expression of many genes, gene-specific stabilization of CFTR-W1282X mRNA expression is more desirable than general NMD inhibition. Synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to prevent binding of exon junction complexes (EJC) downstream of premature termination codons (PTCs) attenuate NMD in a gene-specific manner. We developed a cocktail of three ASOs that specifically increases the expression of CFTR W1282X mRNA and CFTR protein in ASO-transfected human bronchial epithelial cells. This treatment increased the CFTR-mediated chloride current. These results set the stage for clinical development of an allele-specific therapy for CF caused by the W1282X mutation.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are key sensory organelles whose dysfunction leads to ciliopathy disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Retinal degeneration is common in ciliopathies, since the outer segments (OSs) of photoreceptors are highly specialized primary cilia. BBS1, encoded by the most commonly mutated BBS-associated gene, is part of the BBSome protein complex. Using a new bbs1 zebrafish mutant, we show that retinal development and photoreceptor differentiation are unaffected by Bbs1-loss, supported by an initially unaffected transcriptome. Quantitative proteomics and lipidomics on isolated OSs show that Bbs1 is required for BBSome-entry into OSs and that Bbs1-loss leads to accumulation of membrane-associated proteins in OSs, with enrichment in proteins involved in lipid homeostasis. Disruption of the tightly regulated OS lipid composition with increased OS cholesterol content are paralleled by early functional visual deficits, which precede progressive OS morphological anomalies. Our findings identify a new role for Bbs1/BBSome in OS lipid homeostasis and suggest a new pathomechanism underlying retinal degeneration in BBS.",

    "abstract": "Symbiont specificity, both at the phylotype and strain level, can have profound consequences for host ecology and evolution. However, except for insights from a few model symbiosis systems, the degree of partner fidelity and the influence of host versus environmental factors on symbiont composition are still poorly understood. Nutritional symbioses between invertebrate animals and chemosynthetic bacteria at deep-sea hydrothermal vents are examples of relatively selective associations, where hosts affiliate only with particular, environmentally acquired phylotypes of gammaproteobacterial or campylobacterial symbionts. In hydrothermal vent snails of the sister genera Alviniconcha and Ifremeria this phylotype specificity has been shown to play a role in habitat distribution and partitioning among different holobiont species. However, it is currently unknown if fidelity goes beyond species level associations that might influence genetic structuring, connectivity and habitat adaptation of holobiont populations. We used metagenomic analyses to assess sequence variation in hosts and symbionts and identify correlations with geographic and environmental factors. Our analyses indicate that host populations are not differentiated across a ~800 km gradient, while symbiont populations are clearly structured between vent locations due to a combination of neutral and selective processes. Overall, these results suggest that host individuals flexibly associate with locally adapted strains of their specific symbiont phylotypes, which supports a long-standing but untested paradigm of the benefits of horizontal transmission. Strain flexibility in these snails likely enables host populations to exploit a range of habitat conditions, which might favor wide-spread genetic connectivity and ecological resilience unless physical dispersal barriers are present.\n\nSignificance StatementSymbiont composition in horizontally transmitted symbioses is influenced by a combination of host genetics, environmental conditions and geographic barriers. Yet the relative importance of these factors and the effects of adaptive versus neutral evolutionary forces on symbiont population structure remain unknown in the majority of marine symbioses. To address these questions, we applied population genomic approaches in four species of deep-sea hydrothermal vent snails that live in obligate association with chemosynthetic bacteria. Our analyses show that host genetics plays a minor role compared to environment for symbiont strain composition despite specificity to symbiont species and corroborate a long-standing hypothesis that vent invertebrates affiliate with locally adapted symbiont strains to cope with the variable habitat conditions characterizing hydrothermal vents.",

Here, we examined structural motifs contained in nucleoporins for their potential to facilitate co-translational assembly. We experimentally tested candidate structural motifs and identified several previously unknown co-translational interactions. We demonstrate by selective ribosome profiling that domain invasion motifs of beta-propellers, coiled-coils, and short linear motifs act as co-translational assembly domains. Such motifs are often contained in proteins that are members of multiple complexes (moonlighters) and engage with closely related paralogs. Surprisingly, moonlighters and paralogs assembled co-translationally in only one but not all of the relevant assembly pathways. Our results highlight the regulatory complexity of assembly pathways.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle cells are multinucleated syncytial cells arising from cell fusion, yet despite sharing a common cytoplasm individual myonuclei express distinct transcriptional programs. Whether individual myonuclei acquire heterogenous transcriptional states via differences in their progenitors, during differentiation, or once their anatomical position is acquired, is not known. We performed transcriptome and pseudotime analysis of single myogenic nuclei from uninjured and post-injury murine skeletal muscle to assess when myonuclear heterogeneity is acquired. Two distinct progenitors contribute to myonuclei, one a non-myogenic fibroblast subtype, and skeletal muscle stem cells the other. Both progenitors enter a single pseudotime trajectory that bifurcates as myonuclei mature into two branches segregated by myosin isoform expression and metabolic profiles, suggesting transcriptional heterogeneity is acquired as myonuclei mature. In aged skeletal muscle myogenic progenitor expansion is perturbed and nuclei from aged muscle display distinct pseudotemporal kinetics compared to nuclei from young mice. In aged mice, the inferred myogenic differentiation trajectory is delayed, altering the distribution of myogenic nuclei in pseudotime, suggesting that altered transcriptional dynamics in nuclei in aged mice may drive age-associated muscle deficits and bias myonuclei towards acquiring oxidative metabolic profiles.",

Inhibition of plexin-A2 expression in U87MG glioblastoma cells resulted in strong inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor forming ability. Knock-out of the plexin-A2 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 also inhibited cell proliferation which was rescued following re-expression of the plexin-A2 cDNA or expression of a truncated plexin-A2 lacking the extracellular domain. Inhibition of plexin-A2 expression resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage, and was accompanied by changes in cytoskeletal organization, cell flattening, and by the expression of senescence associated {beta}-galactosidase. It was also associated with reduced AKT phosphorylation and enhanced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. We find that the pro-proliferative effects of plexin-A2 are mediated by FARP2 and FYN since mutations in the FARP2 binding domain of plexin-A2 or in the FYN phosphorylation sites of plexin-A2 compromised the rescue of the proliferative activity by the plexin-A2 intracellular domain.

    "abstract": "Conditional gene expression allows for genes to be manipulated and lineages to be marked during development. In the established \"lox-stop-lox\" approach, Cre-mediated tissue-specific gene expression is achieved by excising the stop cassette, a lox-flanked translational stop that is inserted into the 5' untranslated region of a gene to halt its expression. Although lox-stop-lox has been successfully used in many experimental systems, the design of traditional stop cassettes also has common issues and limitations. Here, we describe the Floxed exon (Flexon), a stop cassette within an artificial exon that can be inserted flexibly into the coding region of any gene to cause premature termination of translation and nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. We demonstrate its efficacy in C. elegans by showing that, when promoters that cause weak and/or transient cell-specific expression are used to drive Cre in combination with a gfp(flexon) transgene, strong and sustained expression is obtained in specific lineages. We also describe several potential additional applications for using Flexon for developmental studies, including more precise control of gene expression using intersectional methods, tissue-specific protein degradation or RNAi, and generation of genetic mosaics. The Flexon approach should be feasible in any system where any site-specific recombination-based method may be applied.\n\nSummary statementThe Floxed exon (Flexon), a stop cassette that can be inserted flexibly into the coding region of any gene, facilitates Cre-mediated conditional gene expression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe widespread application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has yielded numerous findings in biomedical research in recent years, making it an invaluable tool for gene knockout and for high-throughput screening studies. In (low-throughput) gene knockout studies, editing efficiency is not a major concern because only a few edited clones are necessary for a successful assay. However, in large scale pooled screening studies, editing efficiency is a major concern because each sgRNA has to knockout its target gene in a large cell population in a short period of time. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the role that key factors play in determining CRISPR knockout efficiency is essential to improve the performance of pooled CRISPR screening.\n\nMethodsIn this study, cell lines with different expression levels of CAS9 were generated and used to determine gene-editing efficiency. Collections of sgRNAs targeting essential genes were used to study their depletion in the different cell line models.\n\nResultsUsing cell lines with variable expression of Cas9, we confirmed that editing efficiency and speed are mostly dependent on the sgRNA sequence and Cas9 expression, respectively. Importantly, we show that the strategy employed for delivering sgRNAs and Cas9 to cells impacts the performance of high-throughput screens, which is improved in conditions with higher Cas9 expression.\n\nConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of optimizing Cas9 expression levels when performing gene editing experiments and provide guidance on the necessary decisions for implementing optimal pooled CRISPR screening strategies.",

Despite their ubiquity, little consideration is given to metabolic effects and fitness costs of plasmid copy numbers on engineered genetic systems. Here, we introduce two systems that allow for the finely-tuned control of plasmid copy number: a plasmid with an anhydrotetracycline-controlled copy number, and a massively parallel assay that is used to generate a continuous spectrum of ColE1-based copy number variants. Using these systems, we investigate the effects of plasmid copy number on cellular growth rates, gene expression, biosynthesis, and genetic circuit performance. We perform single-cell timelapse measurements to characterize plasmid loss, runaway plasmid replication, and quantify the impact of plasmid copy number on the variability of gene expression. Using our massively parallel assay, we find that each plasmid imposes a 0.063% linear metabolic burden on their hosts, hinting at a simple relationship between metabolic burdens and plasmid DNA synthesis. Our plasmid system with tunable copy number should allow for a precise control of gene expression and highlight the importance of tuning plasmid copy number as tool for the optimization of synthetic biological systems.",

However, the mechanism underlying the broad spectrum of neurological phenotypes is poorly understood. Here we show that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons mediate distinct disease features with few overlaps. Glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons-specific Stxbp1 haploinsufficient mice exhibit different subsets of the cognitive and seizure phenotypes observed in the constitutive Stxbp1 haploinsufficient mice. Developmental delay and most of the motor and psychiatric phenotypes are only recapitulated by GABAergic Stxbp1 haploinsufficiency.

The biases, which result from incorporating prior knowledge in the perceptual process, can vary considerably between individuals. The variations are commonly attributed to differences in sensory precision and reliance on priors. However, another factor not considered so far is the implicit belief about how successive sensory stimuli are generated: independently from each other or with certain temporal continuity. The main types of explanatory models proposed so far - static or iterative - mirror this distinction but cannot adequately explain individual biases. Here we propose a new unifying model that explains individual variation as combination of sensory precision and beliefs about temporal continuity and predicts the experimentally found changes in biases when altering temporal continuity. Thus, according to the model, individual differences in perception depend on beliefs about how stimuli are generated in the world.",

    "abstract": "Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungal pathogen, is the most common cause of fungal respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts. Histoplasma is endemic in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys in the United States and also distributed worldwide. Previous studies revealed at least eight clades, each specific to a geographic location: North American classes 1 and 2 (NAm 1 and NAm 2), Latin American groups A and B (LAm A and LAm B), Eurasian, Netherlands, Australian and African, and an additional distinct lineage (H81) comprised of Panamanian isolates. Previously assembled Histoplasma genomes are highly fragmented, with the highly repetitive G217B (NAm 2) strain, which has been used for most whole genome-scale transcriptome studies, assembled into over 250 contigs. In this study, we set out to fully assemble the repeat regions and characterize the large-scale genome architecture of Histoplasma species. We re-sequenced five Histoplasma strains (WU24 (NAm 1), G217B (NAm 2), H88 (African), G186AR (Panama), and G184AR (Panama)) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing technology. Here we report chromosomal-level assemblies for all five strains, which exhibit extensive synteny among the geographically distant Histoplasma isolates. The new assemblies revealed that RYP2, a major regulator of morphology and virulence, is duplicated in G186AR. In addition, we mapped previously generated transcriptome datasets onto the newly assembled chromosomes. Our analyses revealed that the expression of transposons and transposon-embedded genes are upregulated in yeast phase compared to mycelial phase in G217B and H88 strains. This study provides an important resource for fungal researchers and further highlights the importance of chromosomal-level assemblies in analyzing high-throughput datasets.\n\nImportanceHistoplasma species are dimorphic fungi causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. These fungi grow as mold in the soil and as budding yeast within the human host. Histoplasma can be isolated from soil in diverse regions, including North America, South America, Africa and Europe. Phylogenetically distinct species of Histoplasma have been isolated and sequenced. However, for the commonly used strains, genome assemblies have been fragmented, leading to underutilization of genome-scale data. This study provides chromosome-level assemblies of the commonly used Histoplasma strains using long-read sequencing technology. Comparative analysis of these genomes shows largely conserved gene order within the chromosomes. Mapping existing transcriptome data on these new assemblies reveals clustering of transcriptionally co-regulated genes. Results of this study highlight the importance of obtaining chromosome-level assemblies in understanding the biology of human fungal pathogens.",

We first investigate the effect of life-history traits on the neutral genetic diversity of a single population using a deterministic mathematical model. When the population is stable, we show that semelparous species with precocious maturation and iteroparous species with delayed maturation exhibit higher diversity because their life history traits tend to balance the lifetimes of non reproductive individuals (juveniles) and adults which reproduce. Then, we extend our model to a metapopulation to investigate the additional effect of dispersal on diversity. We show that dispersal may truly modify the local effect of life history on diversity. As a result, the diversity at the global scale of the metapopulation differ from the local diversity which is only described through local life history traits of the populations. In particular, dispersal usually promotes diversity at the global metapopulation scale.",

    "abstract": "Whether the spatial arrangement of a population influences adaptive evolution has puzzled evolutionary biologists. Theoretical models make contrasting predictions about the probability a beneficial mutation will become fixed in a population for certain topologies like stars, where leaf populations are connected through a hub. To date, these predictions have not been evaluated under realistic conditions. Here, we test the prediction that topology can change the fixation probability both in vitro and in silico by tracking the dynamics of a beneficial mutant under positive selection as it spreads through networks of different topologies. Our results provide empirical support that metapopulation topology can increase the likelihood that a beneficial mutation spreads, broadens the conditions under which this phenomenon is thought to occur, and points the way towards using network topology to amplify the effects of weakly favored mutations under directed evolution in industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Extensive sequencing of modern and ancient human genomes has revealed that contemporary populations can be explained as the result of recent mixing of a few distinct ancestral genetic lineages1. But the small number of aDNA samples that predate the Last Glacial Maximum means that the origins of these lineages are not well understood. Here, we circumvent the limited sampling by modelling explicitly the effect of climatic changes and terrain on population demography and migrations through time and space, and show that these factors are sufficient to explain the divergence among ancestral lineages. Our reconstructions show that the sharp separation between African and Eurasian lineages is a consequence of only a few limited periods of connectivity through the arid Arabian peninsula, which acted as the gate out of the Arican continent. The subsequent spread across Eurasia was then mostly shaped by mountain ranges, and to a lesser extent deserts, leading to the split of European and Asians, and the further diversification of these two groups. A high tolerance to cold climates allowed the persistence at high latitudes even during the Last Glacial Maximum, maintaining a pocket in Beringia that led to the later, rapid colonisation of the Americas. The advent of food production was associated with an increase in movement2, but mountains and climate have been shown to still play a major role even in this latter period3,4, affecting the mixing of the ancestral lineages that we have shown to be shaped by those two factors in the first place.",

Deamination of cytidine in HIV-1 (-)DNA forms uracil that causes inactivating mutations when uracil is used as a template for (+)DNA synthesis. For APOBEC3C (A3C), the chimpanzee and gorilla orthologues are more active than human A3C, and the Old World Monkey A3C from rhesus macaque (rh) is not active against HIV-1. Multiple integrated analyses determined why rhA3C was not active against HIV-1 and how to increase this activity. Biochemical, virological, and coevolutionary analyses combined with molecular dynamics simulations showed that the key amino acids needed to promote rhA3C antiviral activity also promoted dimerization. Although rhA3C shares a similar dimer interface with hominid A3C, the key amino acid contacts were different. Overall, our results determine the basis for why rhA3C is less active than human A3C, establish the amino acid network for dimerization and increased activity, and track the loss and gain of A3C antiviral activity in primates. The coevolutionary analysis of the A3C dimerization interface provides a basis from which to analyze dimerization interfaces of other A3 family members.",

LbpB consists of N- and C-lobes with the N-lobe interacting extensively with the C-lobe of lactoferrin.

Often minor results and details are lost in a systematic screen, which is becoming even more frequent with the rapidly rising numbers of daily published scientific articles.

Specific features of the literature analysis comprise the adaptability of analysis parameters including the use of regular expressions, machine learning-powered detection of abbreviations of search words in articles, and the export of document meta-data. We exemplify how the PDE R package can be utilized as a pre-screening tool allowing automated categorization of full-text articles by relevance, thereby reducing the literature to be evaluated (in our example by 35% with a sensitivity of 100% at standard parameters).

    "abstract": "The functional interactions between regions of the human brain can be viewed as a network, empowering neuroscientists to leverage tools such as graph theory to obtain insight about brain function. However, obtaining a brain network from functional neuroimaging data inevitably involves multiple steps of data manipulation, which can affect the organisation (topology) of the resulting network and its properties. Test-retest reliability is a gold standard for both basic research and clinical use: a suitable data-processing pipeline for brain networks should recover the same network topology across repeated scan sessions of the same individual. Analyzing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) recordings from two test-retest studies across short (45 minutes), medium (2-4 weeks) and long term delays (5-16 months), we investigated the reliability of network topologies constructed by applying 576 unique pipelines to the same fMRI data, obtained from considering combinations of atlas type and size, edge definition and thresholding, and use of global signal regression. We adopted the portrait divergence, an information-theoretic criterion to measure differences in network topology across all scales, enabling us to quantify the influence of different pipelines on the overall organisation of the resulting network. Remarkably, our findings reveal that the choice of pipeline plays a fundamental role in determining how reproducible an individuals brain network topology will be across different scans: there is large and systematic variability across pipelines, such that an inappropriate choice of pipeline can distort the resulting network more than an interval of several months between scans. Across datasets and time-spans, we also identify specific combinations of data-processing steps that consistently yield networks with reproducible topology, enabling us to make recommendations about best practices to ensure high-quality brain networks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEcological interactions among microorganisms are fundamental for ecosystem function, yet they are mostly unknown or poorly understood. High-throughput-omics can indicate microbial interactions through associations across time and space, which can be represented as association networks. Associations could result from either ecological interactions between microorganisms, or from environmental selection, where the associations are environmentally-driven. Therefore, before downstream analysis and interpretation, we need to distinguish the nature of the association, particularly if it is due to environmental selection or not.\n\nResultsWe present EnDED (Environmentally-Driven Edge Detection), an implementation of four approaches as well as their combination to predict which links between microorganisms in an association network are environmentally-driven. The four approaches are Sign Pattern, Overlap, Interaction Information, and Data Processing Inequality. We tested EnDED on networks from simulated data of 50 microorganisms. The networks contained on average 50 nodes and 1087 edges, of which 60 were true interactions but 1026 false associations (i.e. environmentally-driven or due to chance). Applying each method individually, we detected a moderate to high number of environmentally-driven edges--87% Sign Pattern and Overlap, 67% Interaction Information, and 44% Data Processing Inequality. Combining these methods in an intersection approach resulted in retaining more interactions, both true and false (32% of environmentally-driven associations). After validation with the simulated datasets, we applied EnDED on a marine microbial network inferred from 10 years of monthly observations of microbial-plankton abundance. The intersection combination predicted that 8.3% of the associations were environmentally-driven, while individual methods predicted 24.8% (Data Processing Inequality), 25.7% (Interaction Information), and up to 84.6% (Sign Pattern as well as Overlap). The fraction of environmentally-driven edges among negative microbial associations in the real network increased rapidly with the number of environmental factors.\n\nConclusionsTo reach accurate hypotheses about ecological interactions, it is important to determine, quantify, and remove environmentally-driven associations in marine microbial association networks. For that, EnDED offers up to four individual methods as well as their combination. However, especially for the intersection combination, we suggest using EnDED with other strategies to reduce the number of false associations and consequently the number of potential interaction hypotheses.",

We investigated the characteristics of NF-{kappa}B-mediated SE activity using fluorescence live-cell imaging of RelA, single-cell transcriptome, and chromatin accessibility analyses in anti-IgM-stimulated B cells. Cell stimulation induced nuclear foci formation of RelA and gene expression in a switch-like manner. The gained SEs induced a higher fold-change expression and enhanced cell-to-cell variability in transcriptional response. These properties were correlated with the number of gained cis-regulatory interactions, while switch-like gene induction was associated with the number of NF-{kappa}B binding sites in SE. Our study suggests that NF-{kappa}B SEs have unique roles for quantitative control of gene expression through direct binding to accessible DNA and enhanced DNA contacts.",

We used electron microscopy to study FACT and FACT:nucleosome complexes, and found that both adopt broad ranges of configurations, indicating high flexibility. We found unexpectedly that the DNA binding protein Nhp6 also binds to the C-terminal tails of FACT subunits, inducing more open geometries of FACT even in the absence of nucleosomes. Nhp6 therefore supports nucleosome unfolding by altering both FACT structure and nucleosome properties. Complexes formed with FACT, Nhp6, and nucleosomes also produced a broad range of structures, revealing a large number of potential intermediates along a proposed unfolding pathway. The data suggest that Nhp6 has multiple roles before and during nucleosome unfolding by FACT, and that the process proceeds through a series of energetically similar intermediate structures, ultimately leading to an extensively unfolded form.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryElectron microscopy reveals the pathway of ATP-Independent nucleosome unfolding by histone chaperone FACT.",

    "abstract": "How covariance patterns of phenotypes change during development is fundamental for a broader understanding of evolution. There is compelling evidence that mammalian skull covariance patterns change during ontogeny. However, it is unclear to what extent variation in covariance patterns during ontogeny can impact the response to selection. To tackle this question we explored: i) the extent to which covariance patterns change during postnatal ontogeny; ii) in which ontogenetic stages covariance patterns differ the most, and iii) the extent to which the phenotypic covariance pattern at different ontogenetic stages can be explained by the same processes determining additive genetic covariance. We sampled postnatal ontogenetic series for both marsupials, and placentals. Within each ontogenetic series, we compared covariance matrices (P-matrices) at different ontogenetic stages. Furthermore, we compared these P-matrices to two target matrices [adult P-matrix and an additive genetic covariance matrix (G-matrix)]. Our results show that for all ontogenetic series, covariance patterns from weaning onward are conserved and probably shaped by the same processes determining the G-matrix. We conclude that irrespective of eventual differences in how selection operates during most of postnatal ontogeny, the net response to such pressures will probably not be affected by ontogenetic differences in the covariance pattern.",

    "abstract": "Protein expression with genetically encoded noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) benefits a broad range of applications, from the discovery of biological therapeutics to fundamental biological studies. A major factor limiting the use of ncAAs is the lack of orthogonal translation systems (OTSs) that support efficient genetic code expansion at repurposed stop codons. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have been extensively evolved in E. coli but are not always orthogonal in eukaryotes. In this work, we use a yeast display-based ncAA incorporation reporter platform with fluorescence-activated cell sorting to screen libraries of aaRSs in high throughput for 1) incorporation of ncAAs not previously encoded in yeast; 2) improvement of the performance of an existing aaRS; 3) highly selective OTSs capable of discriminating between closely related ncAA analogs; and 4) OTSs exhibiting enhanced polyspecificity to support translation with structurally diverse sets of ncAAs. The number of previously undiscovered aaRS variants we report in this work more than doubles the total number of translationally active aaRSs available for genetic code manipulation in yeast. The success of myriad screening strategies has important implications related to the fundamental properties and evolvability of aaRSs. Furthermore, access to OTSs with diverse activities and specific or polyspecific properties is invaluable for a range of applications within chemical biology, synthetic biology, and protein engineering.\n\nSynopsisA range of flow cytometry-based screens yielded diverse translational machinery for genetic code expansion in yeast, facilitating access to new chemistries and tunable specificity profiles.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",
