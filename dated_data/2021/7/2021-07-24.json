    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing studies applied to large populations or biobanks with extensive phenotyping raise new analytic challenges. The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant, one phenotype association study. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model comparison approach that we refer to as MRP (Multiple Rare-variants and Phenotypes) for rare-variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and direction of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. The approach requires only summary statistic data. To demonstrate the efficacy of MRP, we apply our method to exome sequencing data (N = 184,698) across 2,019 traits from the UK Biobank, aggregating signals in genes. MRP demonstrates an ability to recover previously-verified signals such as associations between PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels. We additionally find MRP effective in conducting meta-analyses in exome data. Notable non-biomarker findings include associations between MC1R and red hair color and skin color, IL17RA and monocyte count, IQGAP2 and mean platelet volume, and JAK2 and platelet count and crit (mass). Finally, we apply MRP in a multi-phenotype setting; after clustering the 35 biomarker phenotypes based on genetic correlation estimates into four clusters, we find that joint analysis of these phenotypes results in substantial power gains for gene-trait associations, such as in TNFRSF13B in one of the clusters containing diabetes and lipid-related traits. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Selection and integration of information based on current goals is fundamental for goal-directed behavior. Reward motivation has been shown to improve behavioral performance, yet the neural mechanisms that link motivation and control processes, and in particular its effect on context-dependent information processing, remain unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 24 human volunteers (13 females) to test whether reward motivation enhances the coding of task-relevant information across the frontoparietal cortex, as would be predicted based on previous experimental evidence and theoretical accounts. In a cued target detection task, participants detected whether an object from a cued visual category was present in a subsequent display. The combination of the cue and the object visual category determined the behavioral status of the objects. To manipulate reward motivation, half of all trials offered the possibility of a monetary reward. We observed an increase with reward in overall univariate activity across the frontoparietal control network when the cue and subsequent object were presented. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) showed that behavioral status information for the objects was conveyed across the network. However, in contrast to our prediction, reward did not increase the discrimination between behavioral status conditions in the stimulus epoch of a trial when object information was processed depending on a current context. In the high-level general-object visual region, the lateral occipital complex, the representation of behavioral status was driven by visual differences and was not modulated by reward. Our study provides useful evidence for the limited effects of reward motivation on task-related neural representations and highlights the necessity to unravel the diverse forms and extent of these effects.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is thought to support episodic memory, or memory for specific events, but recent work also suggests that it may be involved in extracting structure from the world to guide future decisions and predictions. Recent evidence in rodents suggests that the hippocampus supports decision-making in cooperation with orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), possibly based on representation of task structure. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test how the human hippocampus and OFC represents decision-relevant information extracted from previous experiences. Participants performed a task in which they learned values of different foods in grocery store contexts. The task was structured such that we could examine the degree to which neural representations could reflect generalized information about different task structures. Specifically, we manipulated whether a foods desirability varied with store context or not. Some foods were desirable in some store contexts and not in others; some foods were always desirable or undesirable. Participants needed to extract these two task sub-structures (i.e., context-determined vs. context-invariant) from the task structure. We examined hippocampal and OFC activity patterns during a decision-making task after participants were trained with the task structure. Our results showed that both hippocampus and OFC carried task structure information that was relevant to the decision outcomes. Hippocampal and lateral OFC representations differentiated between context-determined (deterministic) and context-invariant (probabilistic) task structures. The degree of this differentiation, an index of task structure representation, was highly correlated between hippocampus and lateral OFC. These results add to a mounting evidence suggesting that the hippocampus and OFC support decision-making by representing task relevant information to the decision outcomes after the task structure is learned.",

    "abstract": "Replicability, the ability to replicate scientific findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis. A key to replicability is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) under fixed experimental constraints are relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics that quantify the relative contributions of accidental deviations--such as measurement error--as compared to systematic deviations--such as individual differences--are critical. We demonstrate that existing replicability statistics, such as intra-class correlation coefficient and fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate between accidental and systematic deviations in very simple settings. We therefore propose a novel statistic, discriminability, which quantifies the degree to which an individuals samples are relatively similar to one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing discriminability improves performance bounds in subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data discriminability improves performance on all subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and more generally, mitigating accidental measurement error.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn recent decades, the size and complexity of data has grown exponentially. Unfortunately, the increased scale of modern datasets brings many new challenges. At present, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis, in which scientific discoveries fail to replicate to new datasets. Difficulties in the measurement procedure and measurement processing pipelines coupled with the influx of complex high-resolution measurements, we believe, are at the core of the replicability crisis. If measurements themselves are not replicable, what hope can we have that we will be able to use the measurements for replicable scientific findings? We introduce the \"discriminability\" statistic, which quantifies how discriminable measurements are from one another, without limitations on the structure of the underlying measurements. We prove that discriminable strategies tend to be strategies which provide better accuracy on downstream scientific questions. We demonstrate the utility of discriminability over competing approaches in this context on two disparate datasets from both neuroimaging and genomics. Together, we believe these results suggest the value of designing experimental protocols and analysis procedures which optimize the discriminability.",

Here we demonstrate that a high-sucrose diet during adolescence induces psychosis-related behavioral endophenotypes, including hyperactivity, poor working memory, impaired sensory gating, and disrupted interneuron function in mice deficient for glyoxalase-1 (Glo1), an enzyme involved in detoxification of sucrose metabolites. Further, the high-sucrose diet induced microcapillary impairments and reduced brain glucose uptake in brains of Glo1 deficient mice. Aspirin protected against this angiopathy, enhancing brain glucose uptake, and preventing abnormal behavioral phenotypes. Similar vascular damage to our model mice was found in the brains of randomly collected schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, suggesting that psychiatric disorders are associated with angiopathy in the brain caused by various environmental stresses, including metabolic stress.",

Here we show that temperature-dependent infection risk, r(T), for 80 fungal and oomycete crop pathogens will track projected yield changes in 12 crops over the 21st Century. For most crops, both yields and r(T) are likely to increase at high latitudes. In contrast, while the tropics will see little or no productivity gains, r(T) is also likely to decline. In addition, the USA, Europe and China may experience major changes in pathogen assemblages. The benefits of yield gains may therefore be tempered by the increased burden of crop protection due to increased and unfamiliar pathogens.",

Assessing how long the past context has an effect on the current status provides crucial information to understand the mechanism for complex sequential behaviors. Birdsongs serve as a representative model for studying the context dependency in sequential signals produced by non-human animals, while previous reports were upper-bounded by methodological limitations. Here, we newly estimated the context dependency in birdsongs in a more scalable way using a modern neural-network-based language model whose accessible context length is sufficiently long. The detected context dependency was beyond the order of traditional Markovian models of birdsong, but was consistent with previous experimental investigations. We also studied the relation between the assumed/auto-detected vocabulary size of birdsong (i.e., fine-vs. coarse-grained syllable classifications) and the context dependency. It turned out that the larger vocabulary (or the more fine-grained classification) is assumed, the shorter context dependency is detected.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI is a powerful tool for imaging brain structure, but it is challenging to discern the biological underpinnings of plasticity inferred from these and other non-invasive MR measurements. Biophysical modeling of the diffusion signal aims to render a more biologically rich image of tissue microstructure, but the application of these models comes with important caveats. A separate approach for gaining biological specificity has been to seek converging evidence from multi-modal datasets. Here we use metrics derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and the white matter tract integrity (WMTI) model along with quantitative MRI measurements of T1 relaxation to characterize changes throughout the white matter during an 8-week, intensive reading intervention (160 total hours of instruction). Behavioral measures, multi-shell diffusion MRI data, and quantitative T1 data were collected at regular intervals during the intervention in a group of 33 children with reading difficulties (7-12 years old), and over the same period in an age-matched non-intervention control group. Throughout the white matter, mean  extra-axonal diffusivity was inversely related to intervention time. In contrast, model estimated axonal water fraction (AWF), overall diffusion kurtosis, and T1 relaxation time showed no significant change over the intervention period. Both diffusion and quantitative T1 based metrics were correlated with pre-intervention reading performance, albeit with distinct anatomical distributions. These results are consistent with the view that rapid changes in diffusion properties reflect phenomena other than widespread changes in myelin density. We discuss this result in light of recent work highlighting non-axonal factors in experience-dependent plasticity and learning.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDiffusion MRI measurements in white matter show changes linked to an educational intervention.\nC_LIO_LITissue modeling results point to changes within the extra-axonal space.\nC_LIO_LIComplementary MRI measurements fail to suggest a widespread change in white matter in myelination over the intervention period.\nC_LIO_LIBoth diffusion and quantitative T1 measures correlate with pre-intervention reading skill.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Animal tracking data are being collected more frequently, in greater detail, and on smaller taxa than ever before. These data hold the promise to increase the relevance of animal movement for understanding ecological processes, but this potential will only be fully realized if their accompanying location error is properly addressed. Historically, coarsely-sampled movement data have proved invaluable for understanding large scale processes (e.g., home range, habitat selection, etc.), but modern fine-scale data promise to unlock far more ecological information. While GPS location error can often be ignored in coarsely sampled data, fine-scale data require more care, and tools to do this have not kept pace. Current approaches to dealing with location error largely fall into two categories--either discarding the least accurate location estimates prior to analysis or simultaneously fitting movement and error parameters in a hidden-state model. In some cases these approaches can provide a level of correction, but they have known limitations, and in some cases they can be worse than doing nothing. Here, we provide a general framework to account for location error in the analysis of triangulated and trilatcralizcd animal tracking data, which includes GPS, Argos Doppler-shift, triangulated VHF, trilatcralized acoustic and cellular location data. We apply our error-modelselection framework to 190 GPS, cellular, and acoustic devices representing 27 models from 14 manufacturers. Collectively, these devices were used to track a wide range of taxa comprising birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals of different sizes and with different behaviors, in urban, suburban, and wild settings. In almost half of the tested device models, error-model selection was necessary to obtain the best performing error model, and in almost a quarter of tested device models, the reported DOP values were actually misinformative. Then, using empirical tracking data from multiple species, we provide an overview of modern, error-informed movement analyses, including continuous-time path reconstruction, home-range distribution, home-range overlap, speed, and distance estimation. Adding to these techniques, we introduce new error-informed estimators for outlier detection and autocorrelation visualization. Because error-induced biases depend on many factors--sampling schedule, movement characteristics, tracking device, habitat, etc.--differential bias can easily confound biological inference and lead researchers to draw false conclusions. We demonstrate how error-informed analyses on calibrated tracking data can provide more accurate estimates are that are insensitive to location error, and allow researchers to use all of their data.",

    "abstract": "Hox genes are expressed during embryogenesis and determine the regional identity of animal bodies along the antero-posterior axis. However, they also function post-embryonically to sculpt fine-scale morphology. To better understand how Hox genes are integrated into post-embryonic gene regulatory networks, we further analysed the role and regulation of Ultrabithorax (Ubx) during leg development in Drosophila melanogaster. Ubx regulates several aspects of bristle and trichome patterning on the femurs of the second (T2) and third (T3) leg pairs. We found that repression of trichomes in the proximal posterior region of the T2 femur by Ubx is likely mediated by activation of the expression of microRNA-92a by this Hox protein. Furthermore, we identified a novel enhancer of Ubx that recapitulates the temporal and regional activity of this gene in T2 and T3 legs. We then used transcription factor binding motif analysis in regions of accessible chromatin in T2 leg cells to predict and functionally test transcription factors that may regulate the Ubx leg enhancer. We also tested the role of the Ubx co-factors Homothorax (Hth) and Extradenticle (Exd) in T2 and T3 femurs. We found several transcription factors that may act upstream or in concert with Ubx to modulate trichome patterning along the proximo-distal axis of developing femurs and that the repression of trichomes also requires Hth and Exd. Taken together our results provide insights into how Ubx is integrated into a postembryonic gene regulatory network to determine fine-scale leg morphology.",

    "abstract": "Proprioception, the sense of limb and body position, generates a map of the body that is essential for proper motor control, yet we know little about precisely how neurons in proprioceptive pathways are wired. Defining the anatomy of secondary neurons in the spinal cord that integrate and relay proprioceptive and potentially cutaneous information from the periphery to the cerebellum is fundamental to understanding how proprioceptive circuits function. Here, we use genetic tools in both male and female mice to define the unique anatomical trajectories of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local intersegmental spinal circuits. We find that Clarkes column (CC) neurons, a major contributor to the direct spinocerebellar pathway, has mossy fiber terminals that diversify extensively in the cerebellar cortex with axons terminating bilaterally, but with no significant axon collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. By contrast, we find that two of the indirect pathways, the spino-lateral reticular nucleus (spino-LRt) and spino-olivary pathways, are in part, derived from cervical Atoh1-lineage neurons, while thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons project mostly locally within the spinal cord. Notably, while cervical and thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons connect locally with motor neurons, no CC to motor neuron connections were detected. Silencing of caudal Atoh1- lineage neurons results in a subtle motor impairment consistent with a defect in local proprioceptive circuitry. Altogether, we define anatomical differences between long-range direct, indirect, and local proprioceptive subcircuits that likely mediate different components of proprioceptive-motor behaviors.\n\nSignificance StatementWe define the anatomy of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local spinal proprioceptive circuits. We observe that mossy fiber axon terminals of Clarkes column (CC) neurons diversify proprioceptive information across granule cells in multiple lobules on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides sending no significant collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. Strikingly, we find that cervical spinal cord Atoh1-lineage neurons form mainly the indirect spino- lateral reticular nucleus and spino-olivary tracts and thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons project locally within the spinal cord while only a few Atoh1-lineage neurons form a direct spinocerebellar tract. Altogether, we define the development, anatomical projections, and some behavioral consequences of silencing spinal proprioceptive pathways.",

Although proteomics is well suited for analysis of individual microbes, metaproteomics of faecal samples is challenging due to the physical structure of the sample, presence of contaminating host proteins and coexistence of hundreds of microorganisms. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus regarding preparation of faecal samples, as well as downstream bioinformatic analyses following metaproteomics data acquisition. Here we assess sample preparation and data analysis strategies applied to mouse faeces in a typical mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic experiment. We show that subtle changes in sample preparation protocols may influence interpretation of biological findings. Two-step database search strategies led to significant underestimation of false positive protein identifications. Unipept software provided the highest sensitivity and specificity in taxonomic annotation of the identified peptides of unknown origin. Comparison of matching metaproteome and metagenome data revealed a positive correlation between protein and gene abundances. Notably, nearly all functional categories of detected protein groups were differentially abundant in the metaproteome compared to what would be expected from the metagenome, highlighting the need to perform metaproteomics when studying complex microbiome samples.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic variation modulates gene expression and can be heritable. However, knowledge of the contribution of epigenetic divergence to adaptive diversification in nature remains limited. The massive evolutionary radiation of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes displaying extensive phenotypic diversity despite extremely low sequence divergence is an excellent system to study the epigenomic contribution to adaptation. Here, we present a comparative genome-wide methylome and transcriptome study, focussing on liver and muscle tissues in phenotypically divergent cichlid species. In both tissues we find substantial methylome divergence among species. Differentially methylated regions (DMR), enriched in evolutionary young transposons, are associated with transcription changes of ecologically-relevant genes related to energy expenditure and lipid metabolism, pointing to a link between dietary ecology and methylome divergence. Unexpectedly, half of all species-specific DMRs are shared across tissues and are enriched in developmental genes, likely reflecting distinct epigenetic developmental programmes. Our study reveals substantial methylome divergence in closely-related cichlid fishes and represents a resource to study the role of epigenetics in species diversification.",

Here, we utilise a unique, longitudinal dataset of a semi-captive population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), a species with marked male-biased intrasexual competition, with males being larger and living shorter, and test the hypothesis that males show earlier and/or faster body mass ageing than females. We show sex-specific body mass ageing trajectories: adult males gained weight up to the age of 48 years old, followed by a decrease in body mass until natural death. In contrast, adult females gained body mass with age until a body mass decline in the last year of life. Our study shows that sex-specific life-histories shape ageing patterns, consistent with the predictions of the classical theory of ageing.",

However, kinetochore fibers are also subjected to forces driving their poleward flux. Here we introduce a flux-driven centering model that relies on flux generated by forces within the overlaps of bridging and kinetochore fibers. This centering mechanism works so that the longer kinetochore fiber fluxes faster than the shorter one, moving the kinetochores towards the center. We developed speckle microscopy in human spindles and confirmed the key prediction that kinetochore fiber flux is length-dependent. Kinetochores are better centered when overlaps are shorter and the kinetochore fiber flux markedly slower than the bridging fiber flux. We identify Kif18A and Kif4A as overlap and flux regulators and NuMA as a fiber coupler. Thus, length-dependent sliding forces exerted by the bridging fiber onto kinetochore fibers promote chromosome alignment.",

    "abstract": "Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can infect a variety of cell types by using virions of varying glycoprotein compositions. It is still unclear how this diversity is generated, but spatio-temporally separated envelopment and egress pathways might play a role. So far, one egress pathway has been described in which HCMV particles are individually enveloped into small vesicles and are subsequently exocytosed continuously. However, some studies have also found enveloped virus particles inside multivesicular structures but could not link them to productive egress or degradation pathways.\n\nWe used a novel 3D-CLEM workflow allowing us to investigate these structures in HCMV morphogenesis and egress at high spatio-temporal resolution. We found that multiple envelopment events occurred at individual vesicles leading to multiviral bodies (MViBs), which subsequently traversed the cytoplasm to release virions as intermittent bulk pulses at the plasma membrane to form extracellular virus accumulations (EVAs). Our data support the existence of a novel bona fide HCMV egress pathway, which opens the gate to evaluate divergent egress pathways in generating virion diversity.",

    "abstract": "Here, we study the dynamical expression of endogenously labelled Hes1, a transcriptional repressor implicated in controlling cell proliferation, to understand how cell-cycle length heterogeneity is generated in ER+ breast cancer cells. We find that Hes1 shows oscillatory expression with approximately 25h periodicity and during each cell-cycle has a variable peak in G1, a trough around G1-S transition and a less variable second peak in G2/M. Compared to other subpopulations, the cell-cycle in CD44HighCD24Low cancer stem cells is longest and most variable. Most cells divide around the peak of the Hes1 expression wave but preceding mitoses in slow dividing CD44HighCD24Low cells appear phase-shifted, resulting in a late-onset Hes1 peak in G1. The position, duration and shape of this peak, rather than the Hes1 expression levels, are good predictors of cell-cycle length. Diminishing Hes1 oscillations by enforcing sustained expression slows down the cell-cycle, impairs proliferation, abolishes the dynamic expression of p21, and increases the percentage of CD44HighCD24Low cells. Reciprocally, blocking the cell-cycle causes an elongation of Hes1 periodicity, suggesting a bidirectional interaction of the Hes1 oscillator and the cell-cycle. We propose that Hes1 oscillations are functionally important for the efficient progression of the cell-cycle and that the position of mitosis in relation to the Hes1 wave underlies cell-cycle length heterogeneity in cancer cell subpopulations.\n\nSignificance statementTumours exhibit heterogeneities that are not due to mutations, including Cancer Stem Cells with different potencies. We show that the cancer stem cell state predisposed to dormancy in vivo has a highly variable and long cell-cycle. Using single-cell live-imaging for the transcriptional repressor Hes1 (a key molecule in cancer), we show a new type of circadian-like oscillatory expression of Hes1 in all cells in the population. The most potent cancer stem cells tend to divide around the trough of the Hes1 oscillatory wave, a feature predictive of a long cell-cycle. A novel concept proposed here is that the position of cell division with respect to the Hes1 wave is predictive of its prospective cell-cycle length and cancer cellular sub-state.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA barcodes are a useful tool for discovering, understanding, and monitoring biodiversity which are critical tasks at a time of rapid biodiversity loss. However, widespread adoption of barcodes requires cost-effective and simple barcoding methods. We here present a workflow that satisfies these conditions. It was developed via \"innovation through subtraction\" and thus requires minimal lab equipment, can be learned within days, reduces the barcode sequencing cost to <10 cents, and allows fast turnaround from specimen to sequence by using the portable, real-time sequencer MinION.\n\nResultsWe describe cost-effective and rapid procedures for barcoding individual specimens with MinION sequencing. We illustrate how tagged amplicons can be obtained and sequenced with the portable, real-time MinION sequencer in many settings (field stations, biodiversity labs, citizen science labs, schools). We also provide amplicon coverage recommendations that are based on several runs of the latest generation of MinION flow cells (\"R10.3\") which suggest that each run can generate barcodes for >10,000 specimens. Next, we present a novel software, ONTbarcoder, which overcomes the bioinformatics challenges posed by MinION reads. The software is compatible with Windows 10, Macintosh, and Linux, has a graphical user interface (GUI), and can generate thousands of barcodes on a standard laptop within hours based on only two input files (FASTQ, demultiplexing file). We document that MinION barcodes are virtually identical to Sanger and Illumina barcodes for the same specimens (>99.99%) and provide evidence that MinION flow cells and reads have improved rapidly since 2018.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that barcoding with MinION is the way forward for government agencies, universities, museums, and schools because it combines low consumable and capital cost with scalability. Small projects can use the flow cell dongle (\"Flongle\") while large projects can rely on MinION flow cells that can be stopped and re-used after collecting sufficient data for a given project.",

Here, we applied normative modeling to UK Biobank data (N=18,634) and estimated the individual-level interplay of large-scale brain networks over time (i.e., dynamic brain state) as a function of general cognitive ability. Abnormality in such brain states was linked to individual variation in mental health. Specifically, brain state measures including fractional occupancy that indicates the brain state probability over time were estimated using a Hidden Markov Model, followed by a Gaussian process regression to estimate the normative range of these brain state measures from general cognitive ability. Abnormality scores per participant were quantified to represent the degree of deviations relative to the estimated population norm. We found significant associations between the abnormality scores of several brain states and individuals overall mental health. Our findings suggest potential impact of mental health on dynamic brain states that subserve cognitive functions and shed light on the relevant brain mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in mental illness.",

    "abstract": "Specific recognition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA by RNA-binding proteins containing a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain is important in eukaryotic gene regulation. The Arabidopsis YTH-domain protein ECT2 is thought to bind to mRNA at URU(m6A)Y sites, yet RR(m6A)CH is the canonical m6A consensus site in all eukaryotes and ECT2 functions require m6A binding activity. Here, we apply iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) and HyperTRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to define high-quality target sets of ECT2, and analyze the patterns of enriched sequence motifs around ECT2 crosslink sites. Our analyses show that ECT2 does in fact bind to RR(m6A)CH. Pyrimidine-rich motifs are enriched around, but not at m6A-sites, reflecting a preference for N6-adenosine methylation of RRACH/GGAU islands in pyrimidine-rich regions. Such motifs, particularly oligo-U and UNUNU upstream of m6A sites, are also implicated in ECT2 binding via its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Finally, URUAY-type motifs are enriched at ECT2 crosslink sites, but their distinct properties suggest function as sites of competition between binding of ECT2 and as yet unidentified RNA-binding proteins. Our study provides coherence between genetic and molecular studies of m6A-YTH function in plants, and reveals new insight into the mode of RNA recognition by YTH-domain-containing proteins.",

    "abstract": "Halting biodiversity decline is one of the most critical challenges for humanity, but monitoring biodiversity is hampered by taxonomic impediments. One impediment is the large number of undescribed species (here called \"dark taxon impediment\") while another is caused by the large number of superficial species descriptions which can only be resolved by consulting type specimens (\"superficial description impediment\"). Recently, Sharkey et al. (2021) proposed to address the dark taxon impediment for Costa Rican braconid wasps by describing 403 species based on barcode clusters (\"BINs\") computed by BOLD Systems. More than 99% of the BINs (387 of 390) are converted into species by assigning binominal names (e.g., BIN \"BOLD:ACM9419\" becomes Bracon federicomatarritai) and adding a minimal diagnosis (usually consisting only of a consensus barcode). We here show that many of Sharkey et al.s species are unstable when the underlying data are analyzed using different species delimitation algorithms. Add the insufficiently informative diagnoses, and many of these species will become the next \"superficial description impediment\" for braconid taxonomy because they will have to be tested and redescribed after obtaining sufficient evidence for confidently delimiting species. We furthermore show that Sharkey et al.s approach of using consensus barcodes as diagnoses is not functional because it cannot be consistently applied. Lastly, we reiterate that COI alone is not suitable for delimiting and describing species and voice concerns over Sharkey et al.s uncritical use of BINs because they are calculated by a proprietary algorithm (RESL) that uses a mixture of public and private data. We urge authors, reviewers, and editors to maintain high standards in taxonomy by only publishing new species that are rigorously delimited with open-access tools and supported by publicly available evidence.",

Transgenic mice lacking cortical expression of Nr2f1 and exhibiting areal organization defects were used as model systems to investigate the arrangement of corticopontine projections. Combining three-dimensional digital brain atlas tools, Cre-dependent mouse lines, and axonal tracing, we show that Nr2f1 expression in postmitotic neurons spatially and temporally controls somatosensory topographic projections, whereas expression in progenitor cells influences the ratio between corticopontine and corticospinal fibres passing the pontine nuclei.

Plasma treatment is a prerequisite for negative stain and quantifoil grids, which are coated with hydrophobic carbon on the grid surface. Here we introduce a non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet system as an alternative new tool for surface treatment. Unlike the conventional glow discharger, we found that the plasma jet system successfully cleans the grid surface and introduces hydrophilicity on grids in the ambient environment without introducing a vacuum. Therefore, we anticipate the plasma jet system will be beneficial in many aspects, such as cost-effective, convenient, versatile, and potential applications in surface modification for both negative stain and cryo-EM grid treatment.",

    "abstract": "Productive transmission of malaria parasites hinges upon the execution of key transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory events. While much is now known about how specific transcription factors activate or repress sexual commitment programs, far less is known about the production of a preferred mRNA homeostasis following commitment and through the host-to-vector transmission event. Here we show that Plasmodium parasites have taken the unique approach to duplicate the NOT1 scaffold protein of the CAF1/CCR4/Not complex in order to dedicate one paralogue for essential transmission functions. Moreover, this NOT1-G paralogue is central to the sex-specific functions previously associated with its interacting partners, as deletion of not1-g in Plasmodium yoelii leads to a comparable or complete arrest phenotype for both male and female parasites. We show that, consistent with its role in other eukaryotes, PyNOT1-G localizes to cytosolic puncta throughout much of the Plasmodium life cycle. PyNOT1-G is essential to both the complete maturation of male gametes and to the continued development of the fertilized zygote originating from female parasites. Comparative transcriptomics of wild-type and pynot1-g- parasites shows that loss of PyNOT1-G leads to transcript dysregulation preceding and during gametocytogenesis, and shows that PyNOT1-G acts to preserve mRNAs that are critical to sexual and early mosquito stage development. Finally, we demonstrate that the tristetraprolin-binding domain, which acts as the typical organization platform for RNA decay (TTP) and RNA preservation (ELAV/HuR) factors is dispensable for PyNOT1-Gs essential blood stage functions but impacts host-to-vector transmission. Together, we conclude that Plasmodium has created and adapted a NOT1-G paralogue to fulfill the complex transmission requirements of both male and female parasites.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a human pathogenic bacterium, binds to sialylated oligosaccharides and glides on host cell surfaces via a unique mechanism. Gliding motility is essential for initiating the infectious process. In the present study, we measured the stall force of an M. pneumoniae cell carrying a bead that was manipulated using optical tweezers on two strains. The stall forces of M129 and FH strains were averaged to be 23.7 and 19.7 pN, respectively, much weaker than those of other bacterial surface motilities. The binding activity and gliding speed of the M129 strain on sialylated oligosaccharides were eight and two times higher than those of the FH strain, respectively, showing that binding activity is not linked to gliding force. Gliding speed decreased when cell binding was reduced by addition of free sialylated oligosaccharides, indicating the existence of a drag force during gliding. We detected stepwise movements, likely caused by a single leg under 0.2-0.3 mM free sialylated oligosaccharides. A step size of 14-19 nm showed that 25-35 propulsion steps per second are required to achieve the usual gliding speed. The step size was reduced to less than half with the load applied using optical tweezers, showing that a 2.5 pN force from a cell is exerted on a leg. The work performed in this step was 16%-30% of the free energy of the hydrolysis of ATP molecules, suggesting that this step is linked to the elementary process of M. pneumoniae gliding.\n\nIMPORTANCEHuman mycoplasma pneumonia is caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This tiny bacterium, shaped like a missile, binds to human epithelial surfaces and spreads using a unique gliding mechanism to establish infection. Here, we analyzed the movements and force of this motility using a special setup: optical tweezers. We then obtained detailed mechanical data to understand this mechanism. Furthermore, we succeeded in detecting small steps of nanometers in its gliding, which is likely linked to the elementary process of the core reaction: chemical to mechanical energy conversion. These data provide critical information to both control this human pathogen and explore new ideas for artificial molecular machines.",

However, hPSC-CMs in culture have not recapitulated the structural or functional properties of adult CMs in vivo thus far. To gain global insight into hPSC-CM biology, we established a multi-omics method for analyzing the hPSC-CM metabolome and proteome from the same cell culture, creating multi-dimensional profiles of hPSC-CMs. Specifically, we developed a sequential extraction to capture metabolites and proteins from the same hPSC-CM monolayer cultures, and analyzed these extracts using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). Using this method, we annotated 205 metabolites/lipids and 4,008 proteins from 106 cells with high reproducibility. We further integrated the proteome and metabolome measurements to create network profiles of molecular phenotypes for hPSC-CMs. Out of 310 pathways identified using metabolomics and proteomics, 40 pathways were considered significantly overrepresented (FDR-corrected p [&le;] 0.05). Highly populated pathways included those involved in protein synthesis (ribosome, spliceosome), ATP generation (oxidative phosphorylation), and cardiac muscle contraction. This multi-omics method achieves deep coverage of metabolites and proteins, creating a multidimensional view of the hPSC-CM phenotype, which provides a strong technological foundation to advance the understanding of hPSC-CM biology.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome (GM) is shaped through infancy and plays a major role in determining susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases later in life. Bacteriophages (phages) are known to modulate bacterial populations in numerous ecosystems, including the gut. However, virome data is difficult to analyse because it mostly consists of unknown viruses, i.e. viral dark matter. Here, we manually resolved the viral dark matter in the largest human virome study published to date. Fecal viromes from a cohort of 647 infants at 1 year of age were deeply sequenced and analysed through successive rounds of clustering and curation. We uncovered more than ten thousand viral species distributed over 248 viral families falling within 17 viral order-level clades. Most of the defined viral families and orders were novel and belonged to the Caudoviricetes viral class. Bacterial hosts were predicted for 79% of the viral species using CRISPR spacers, including those in metagenomes from the same fecal samples. While Bacteroides-infecting Crassphages were present, novel viral families were more predominant, including phages infecting Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Phage lifestyles were determined for more than three thousand caudoviral species. Lifestyles were homogeneous at the family level for 149 Caudoviricetes families, including 32 families that were found to be virulent, while 117 were temperate. Virulent phage families were more abundant but temperate ones were more diverse and widespread. Together, the viral families found in this study represent a major expansion of existing bacteriophage taxonomy.",

    "abstract": "Autophagosomes are double-membrane intracellular vesicles that degrade protein aggregates, intracellular organelles, and other cellular components. During the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, many somatic and germ cells undergo apoptosis. These cells are engulfed and degraded by their neighboring cells. We discovered a novel role of autophagosomes in facilitating the degradation of apoptotic cells using a real-time imaging technique. Specifically, the double-membrane autophagosomes in engulfing cells are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells and subsequently fuse to phagosomes, allowing the inner vesicle to enter the phagosomal lumen. Mutants defective in the production of autophagosomes display significant defects in the degradation of apoptotic cells, demonstrating the importance of autophagosomes to this process. The signaling pathway led by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1) promotes the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Moreover, the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with phagosomes requires the functions of the small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPS complex components. Further observations suggest that autophagosomes provide apoptotic cell-degradation activities in addition to and in parallel of lysosomes. Our findings reveal that, unlike the single-membrane, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) vesicles reported for mammalian phagocytes, the canonical double-membrane autophagosomes facilitate the clearance of C. elegans apoptotic cells. These findings add autophagosomes to the collection of intracellular organelles that contribute to phagosome maturation, identify novel crosstalk between the autophagy and phagosome maturation pathways, and discover the upstream signaling molecules that initiate this crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Reduced cortical inhibition by somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons has been strongly associated with treatment-resistant depression. However, whether the effects of reduced SST interneuron inhibition on microcircuit activity have signatures detectible in electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains unknown. We simulated resting-state activity and EEG using detailed models of human cortical microcircuits with normal (healthy) or reduced SST interneuron inhibition (depression). Healthy microcircuit models showed emergent key features of resting-state EEG, and depression microcircuits exhibited increased theta, alpha and low beta power (4 - 15 Hz). The changes in depression involved a combination of an aperiodic broadband, and periodic theta components. We then demonstrated the specificity of the EEG signatures of reduced SST interneuron inhibition by showing they were distinct from those corresponding to reduced parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneuron inhibition. Our study thus links SST interneuron inhibition level to distinct features in EEG simulated from detailed human microcircuits, which can serve to better identify mechanistic subtypes of depression using EEG, and non-invasively monitor modulation of cortical inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Gmxapi provides an integrated, native Python API for both standard and advanced molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS. The Python interface permits multiple levels of integration with the core GROMACS libraries, and legacy support is provided via an interface that mimics the command-line syntax, so that all GROMACS commands are fully available. Gmxapi has been officially supported since the GROMACS 2019 release and is enabled by default in current versions of the software. Here we describe gmxapi 0.3 and later. Beyond simply wrapping GROMACS library operations, the API permits several advanced operations that are not feasible using the prior command-line interface. First, the API allows custom user plugin code within the molecular dynamics force calculations, so users can execute custom algorithms without modifying the GROMACS source. Second, the Python interface allows tasks to be dynamically defined, so high-level algorithms for molecular dynamics simulation and analysis can be coordinated with loop and conditional operations. Gmxapi makes GROMACS more accessible to custom Python scripting while also providing support for high-level data-flow simulation algorithms that were previously feasible only in external packages.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe gmxapi software provides a Python interface for molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS. In addition to simply wrapping GROMACS commands, it supports custom user plugin code, ensemble simulation, and data-flow chaining of commands. As such, gmxapi enables the writing and execution of high-level simulation algorithms. The software ships with GROMACS and is freely available under an LGPL2 license.",

    "abstract": "Echinoids are key components of modern marine ecosystems. Despite a remarkable fossil record, the emergence of their crown group is documented by few specimens of unclear affinities, rendering much of their early history uncertain. The origin of sand dollars, one of its most distinctive clades, is also unclear due to an unstable phylogenetic context and discrepancies between molecular divergence times and fossil evidence. We employ seventeen novel genomes and transcriptomes to build a phylogenomic dataset with a near-complete sampling of major lineages. With it, we revise the phylogeny and divergence times of echinoids, and place their history within the broader context of echinoderm evolution. We also introduce the concept of a chronospace--a multidimensional representation of node ages--and use it to explore the effects of using alternative gene samples, models of molecular evolution, and clock priors. We find the choice of clock model to have the strongest impact on divergence times, while the use of site-heterogeneous models shows little effects. The choice of loci shows an intermediate impact, affecting mostly deep Paleozoic nodes, for which clock-like genes recover dates more congruent with fossil evidence. Our results reveal that crown group echinoids originated in the Permian and diversified rapidly in the Triassic, despite the relative lack of fossil evidence for this early diversification. We also clarify the relationships among sand dollars and their close relatives, showing that the genus Apatopygus represents a relict lineage with a deep Jurassic origin. Surprisingly, the origin of sand dollars is confidently dated to the Cretaceous, implying ghost ranges spanning approximately 50 million years, a remarkable discrepancy with their rich fossil record.",

    "abstract": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome, caused by mutations in the Lysosome Trafficking Regulator (Lyst) gene, is a recessive hypopigmentation disorder characterized by albinism, neuropathies, neurodegeneration, and defective immune responses, with enlargement of lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. Although recent studies have suggested that Lyst mutations impair the regulation of sizes of lysosome and lysosome-related organelle, the underlying pathogenic mechanism of Chediak-Higashi syndrome is still unclear. Here we show striking evidence that deficiency in LYST protein function leads to accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment phagosomes in retinal pigment epithelial cells, and reduces adhesion between photoreceptor outer segment and retinal pigment epithelial cells in a mouse model of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. In addition, we observe elevated levels of cathepsins, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) 3 and oxidative stress markers in the retinal pigment epithelium of Lyst mutants. Previous reports showed that impaired degradation of photoreceptor outer segment phagosomes causes elevated oxidative stress, which could consequently lead to increases of cysteine cathepsins and MMPs in the extracellular matrix. Taken together, we conclude that the loss of LYST function causes accumulation of phagosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium and elevation of several extracellular matrix-remodeling proteases through oxidative stress, which may, in turn, reduce retinal adhesion. Our work reveals previously unreported pathogenic events in the retinal pigment epithelium caused by Lyst deficiency, which may place Chediak-Higashi syndrome patients at increased risk for retinal detachment. The same pathogenic events may be conserved in other professional phagocytic cells, such as macrophages in the immune system, contributing to overall Chediak-Higashi syndrome pathology.",

    "abstract": "Diseases caused by Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses cause significant mortality and illness globally. Due to the high sequence similarity of the viral proteins and the purported cross-reactive immune responses against the viruses, we envisioned a common multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against both viruses by adopting a novel approach of identifying \"immunogenic hotspots\". These stretches of the structural and non-structural proteins are enriched with MHC class I and class II supertype-restricted T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes, in addition to being highly conserved between different DENV serotypes and ZIKV. Such an approach ensures inclusion of multiple overlapping T and B cell epitopes common to both viruses, and also warrants high population coverage. Importantly, epitopes known to cause antibody-dependent-enhancement of infection have been excluded. These immunogenic hotspots have then been stitched together with linkers in-silico along with an adjuvant, CTxB to develop the MEV candidate. Four structural models of the MEV were selected on the basis of conformational preservation of CTxB, and their biophysical parameters, which also conserved the immunogenicity of the multiple epitopes. Importantly, each of the MEV candidates were found to interact with TLR4-MD2 complex by molecular docking studies, indicative of their ability to induce TLR-mediated immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing shapes the transcriptome and contributes to each cells unique identity, but single-cell RNA sequencing has struggled to capture the impact of alternative splicing. We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing (1). Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of co-regulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors, and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell-type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them. Our new method will enable scRNA-seq analysis to go beyond transcription to understand the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in determining cell identity.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading hospital acquired infection in North America. While the standard treatment for CDI remains antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has gained attention as an effective therapy to prevent relapse. Previous work has focused on colonization resistance mounted against C. difficile by FMT-delivered commensals, but the effects of FMT on the gut mucosal immune response are poorly understood. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms driven by FMT would allow for more targeted therapy against CDI. To address this important gap in knowledge, microbial community structure and host gene expression were assessed after FMT in a mouse model of antibiotic use. Administration of FMT led to a significant increase in microbial diversity and partial restoration of community structure within 48 hours of treatment. RNA sequencing of cecal tissue identified large changes in gene expression between FMT recipient and vehicle control groups. Strikingly, genes upregulated after FMT treatment were enriched in immune activation pathways, many of which were associated with pro-inflammatory immune responses. FMT also upregulated several genes associated with type 2 immunity while repressing several associated with type 3 immunity, trends that are associated with improved response to CDI. These results highlight the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and host transcriptome and identify pathways of interest for exploring the role of FMT on treatment of recurring CDI.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses one of the most complex bacterial regulatory networks, which largely contributes to its success as a human opportunistic pathogen. However, most of its transcription factors (TFs) are still uncharacterized and the potential intra-species variability in regulatory networks has been mostly ignored so far. Here, to provide a first global view of the two-component systems (TCSs) regulatory network in P. aeruginosa, we produced and purified all DNA-binding TCS response regulators (RRs) and used DAP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of these 55 TFs across the three major P. aeruginosa lineages. The resulting networks encompass about 40% of all genes in each strain and contain numerous new important regulatory interactions across most major physiological processes, including virulence and antibiotic resistance. Strikingly, the comparison between the three representative strains shows that about half of the detected targets are specific to only one or two of the tested strains, revealing a previously unknown large functional diversity of TFs within a single species. Three main mechanisms were found to drive this diversity, including differences in accessory genome content, as exemplified by the strain-specific plasmid in the IHMA87 outlier strain which harbors numerous binding sites of chromosomally-encoded RRs. Additionally, most RRs display potential auto-regulation or RR-RR cross-regulation, bringing to light the vast complexity of this network. Overall, we provide the first complete delineation of the TCS regulatory network in P. aeruginosa that will represent an important resource for future studies on this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis relies upon a number of cell wall-associated proteins for virulence. One virulence factor is the sortase-assembled endocarditis and biofilm associated pilus (Ebp), an important factor for biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo. The current paradigm for sortase-assembled pilus biogenesis in Gram-positive bacteria is that the pilus sortase covalently links pilus monomers prior to recognition, while the housekeeping sortase cleaves at the LPXTG motif within the terminal pilin subunit, and subsequently attaches assembled pilus fiber to the growing cell wall at sites of new cell wall synthesis. While the cell wall anchoring mechanism and polymerization of Ebp is well characterized, less is known about the spatial and temporal deposition of this protein on the cell surface. We followed the distribution of Ebp and peptidoglycan (PG) throughout the E. faecalis cell cycle via immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAA) staining. Surprisingly, cell surface Ebp did not co-localize with newly synthesized PG. Instead, surface-anchored Ebp was localized to the cell hemisphere but never at the septum where new cell wall is deposited. In addition, the older hemisphere of the E. faecalis diplococcus were completely saturated with Ebp, while Ebp appeared as two foci directly adjacent to the nascent septum in the newer hemisphere. A similar localization pattern was observed for another cell wall anchored substrate by sortase A, aggregation substance (AS), suggesting that this may be a general rule for all SrtA substrates in E. faecalis. When cell wall synthesis was inhibited by ramoplanin, an antibiotic that binds and sequesters lipid II cell wall precursors, new Ebp deposition at the cell surface was not disrupted. These data suggest an alternative paradigm for sortase substrate deposition in E. faecalis, in which Ebp are anchored directly onto un-crosslinked cell wall, independent of new PG synthesis.",

    "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in microbiome research in environmental and medical samples is to better understand functional properties of microbial community members at a single cell level. Single cell isotope probing has become a key tool for this purpose, but the currently applied detection methods for measuring isotope incorporation into single cells do not allow high-throughput analyses. Here, we report on the development of an imaging-based approach termed stimulated Raman scattering - two-photon fluorescence in situ hybridization (SRS-FISH) for high-throughput structure-function analyses of microbial communities with single cell resolution. SRS-FISH has an imaging speed of 10 to 100 milliseconds per cell, which is two to three orders of magnitude faster than spontaneous Raman-FISH. Using this technique, we delineated metabolic responses of thirty thousand individual cells to various mucosal sugars in the human gut microbiome via incorporation of deuterium from heavy water as an activity marker. Application of SRS-FISH to investigate the utilization of host-derived nutrients by two major human gut microbiome taxa revealed that response to mucosal sugars tends to be dominated by Bacteroidales, with an unexpected finding that Clostridia can outperform Bacteroidales at foraging fucose.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage (\"phage\") are both predators and evolutionary drivers for bacteria, notably contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes by generalised transduction. Our current understanding of the dual nature of this relationship is limited. We used an interdisciplinary approach to quantify how these interacting dynamics can lead to the evolution of multi-drug resistant bacteria. We co-cultured two strains of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, each harbouring a different antibiotic resistance gene, with 80 generalized transducing phage. After a growth phase of 8h, bacteria and phage surprisingly coexisted at a stable equilibrium in our culture, the level of which was dependent on the starting concentration of phage. We detected double-resistant bacteria as early as 7h, indicating that transduction of AMR genes had occurred. We developed multiple mathematical models of the bacteria and phage relationship, and found that phage-bacteria dynamics were best captured by a model in which the phage burst size decreases as the bacteria population reaches stationary phase, and where phage predation is frequency-dependent. We estimated that one in every 108 new phage generated was a transducing phage carrying an AMR gene, and that double-resistant bacteria were always predominantly generated by transduction rather than by growth. Our results suggest a shift in how we understand and model phage-bacteria dynamics. Although rates of generalised transduction could be interpreted as too rare to be significant, they are sufficient to consistently lead to the evolution of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Currently, the potential of phage to contribute to the growing burden of AMR is likely underestimated.",

    "abstract": "Human Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) is a receptor for mammalian orthoreoviruses (reoviruses), but the mechanism of virus-receptor engagement is unknown. NgR1 binds a variety of structurally dissimilar ligands in the adult central nervous system (CNS) to inhibit axon outgrowth. Disruption of ligand binding to NgR1 and subsequent signaling can improve neuron regrowth, making NgR1 an important therapeutic target for diverse conditions such as spinal crush injuries and Alzheimer disease. To elucidate how NgR1 mediates cell binding and entry of reovirus, we defined the affinity of interaction between virus and receptor, determined the structure of the virus-receptor complex, and identified residues in the receptor required for virus binding and infection. These studies revealed that NgR1 sequences in a central concave region of the molecule establish a bridge between two copies of the viral capsid protein, {sigma}3. This unusual binding interface produces high-avidity interactions between virus and receptor and likely primes early entry steps. NgR1 sequences engaged by reovirus also are required for NgR1 binding to ligands expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes. These studies redefine models of reovirus cell-attachment and highlight the evolution of viruses to engage multiple receptors using distinct capsid components.",

Sporozoite numbers in salivary glands are also reduced in mosquitoes infected with QC-null or QC catalytically-dead mutants. This phenotype can be rescued by genetic complementation or by disrupting mosquito hemocytes or melanization immune responses. Mutation of a single QC-target glutamine of the major sporozoite surface protein (CSP) also results in immune recognition of sporozoites.

    "abstract": "We developed a sensitive, homogeneous fluorescence assay for the detection of DNA mismatches and DNA damage based on the mismatch repair (MMR) protein MutS. The assay is based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between SYBR Green I (SG), non-covalently bound to DNA, and Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) conjugated to MutS. In contrast to previous assays using only the mismatch binding activity of MutS, we exploited the ATP-dependent loading of multiple MutS sliding clamps provoked by mismatch/damage to the DNA, which increases the overall sensitivity of the assay. The assay was validated using a well-characterized 3 kb circular DNA containing a single G/T mismatch. We also demonstrate that treatment of long (multiple kb) DNA with various chemical or physical agents including non-denaturing bisulfite conversion of cytosine to uracil, cisplatin modification or ultraviolet light (UVC) results in changes in the DNA that can be detected by the FRET-based MutS biosensor.",

ABCs are reduced in ZEB2 haploinsufficient individuals and in mice lacking Zeb2 in B-cells. In mice with TLR7-driven lupus, Zeb2 is essential for ABC formation and autoimmune pathology. Zeb2 binds to the +20kb intronic enhancer of Mef2b, repressing Mef2b-mediated germinal center B-cell differentiation and promoting ABC formation. Zeb2 also targets genes important for ABC specification and function including Itgax. Zeb2-driven ABC differentiation requires Jak-Stat signaling, and treatment with the Jak1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib reduces ABC accumulation in autoimmune mice and patients.

    "abstract": "Signaling initiated by type I interferon (IFN) results in the induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The type I IFN response is important for antiviral restriction, but aberrant activation of this response can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. Regulation of this response is incompletely understood. We previously reported that the mRNA modification m6A and its deposition enzymes, METTL3 and METTL14 (METTL3/14), promote the type I IFN response by directly modifying the mRNA of a subset of ISGs to enhance their translation. Here, we determined the role of the RNA demethylase FTO in the type I IFN response. FTO, which can remove either m6A or the cap-adjacent m6Am RNA modifications, has previously been associated with obesity and body mass index, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation. We found that FTO suppresses the transcription of a distinct set of ISGs, including many known pro-inflammatory genes, and that this regulation is not through the actions of FTO on m6Am. Further, we found that depletion of FTO led to activation of STAT3, a transcription factor that mediates responses to various cytokines, but whose role in the type I IFN response is not well understood. This activation of STAT3 increased the expression of a subset of ISGs. Importantly, this increased ISG induction resulting from FTO depletion was partially ablated by depletion of STAT3. Together, these results reveal that FTO negatively regulates STAT3-mediated signaling that induces proinflammatory ISGs during the IFN response, highlighting an important role for FTO in suppression of inflammatory genes.",

    "abstract": "Microbial bioreporters provide direct insight into cellular processes by producing a quantifiable signal dictated by reporter gene expression. The core of a bioreporter is a genetic circuit in which a reporter gene (or operon) is fused to promoter and regulatory sequences that govern its expression. In this study, we develop a system for constructing novel Escherichia coli bioreporters based on Golden Gate assembly, a synthetic biology approach for the rapid and seamless fusion of DNA fragments. Gene circuits are generated by fusing promoter and reporter sequences encoding yellow fluorescent protein, mCherry, bacterial luciferase, and an anaerobically active flavin-based fluorescent protein. We address a barrier to the implementation of Golden Gate assembly by designing a series of compatible destination vectors that can accommodate the assemblies. We validate the approach by measuring the activity of constitutive bioreporters and mercury and arsenic biosensors in quantitative exposure assays. We also demonstrate anaerobic quantification of mercury and arsenic in biosensors that produce flavin-based fluorescent protein, highlighting the expanding range of redox conditions that can be examined by microbial bioreporters.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial bioreporters are versatile genetic tools with wide-ranging applications, particularly in the field of environmental toxicology. For example, biosensors that produce a signal output in the presence of a specific analyte offer less costly alternatives to analytical methods for the detection of environmental toxins such as mercury and arsenic. Biosensors of specific toxins can also be used to test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of uptake, toxicity, and biotransformation. In this study, we develop an assembly platform that uses a synthetic biology technique to streamline construction of novel Escherichia coli bioreporters that produce fluorescent or luminescent signals. We validate the approach by synthesizing and testing an array of bioreporters, including arsenic and mercury biosensors, that produce signal outputs in environments ranging from aerobic to highly reduced anaerobic growth conditions.",

Despite extensive focus on aggresomes in immortalized cell lines, it remains unclear if the aggresome is conserved in all primary cells and all cell-states. Here we examined the aggresome in primary adult mouse dermal fibroblasts shifted into four distinct cell-states. We found that in response to proteasome inhibition, quiescent and immortalized fibroblasts formed aggresomes whereas proliferating and senescent fibroblasts did not. Using this model, we generated a resource to better understand the aggresome, providing a characterization of the proteostasis networks in which the aggresome is used and transcriptomic features associated with the presence or absence of aggresome formation. Using this resource, we validate a previously reported role for p38 MAPK signaling in aggresome formation and identify TAK1 as a novel driver of aggresome formation upstream of p38 MAPKs. Together, our data demonstrate that the aggresome is a non-universal protein degradation system which can be used cell-state specifically and provide a resource for better understanding aggresome formation and function.",

    "abstract": "Nascent vascular networks adapt to the increasing metabolic demands of growing tissues by expanding via angiogenesis. As vascular networks expand, blood vessels remodel, progressively refining vascular connectivity to generate a more haemodynamically efficient network. This process is driven by interplay between endothelial cell (EC) signalling and blood flow. While much is known about angiogenesis, considerably less is understood of the mechanisms underlying vessel remodelling by blood flow. Here we employ the zebrafish sub-intestinal venous plexus (SIVP) to characterise the mechanisms underlying blood flow-dependent remodelling. Using live imaging to track ECs we show that blood flow controls SIVP remodelling by coordinating collective migration of ECs within the developing plexus. Blood flow opposes continuous ventral EC migration within the SIVP and is required for regression of angiogenic sprouts to support plexus growth. Sprout regression occurs by coordinated polarisation and migration of ECs from non-perfused leading sprouts, which migrate in opposition to blood flow and incorporate into the SIV. Sprout regression is compatible with low blood flow and is dependent upon vegfr3/flt4 function under these conditions. Blood flow limits expansive venous remodelling promoted by vegfr3/flt4. Collectively, these studies reveal how blood flow sculpts a developing vascular plexus by coordinating EC migration and balancing vascular remodelling via vegfr3/flt4.",

    "abstract": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disease characterized by progressive and catastrophic heterotopic ossification (HO) of skeletal muscle and associated soft tissues. FOP is caused by dominantly acting mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, ACVR1 (also known as ALK2), the most prevalent of which is an arginine to histidine substitution [ACVR1(R206H)] in the glycine-serine rich intracellular domain of the receptor. A fundamental pathological consequence of FOP-causing ACVR1 receptor mutations is to enable activin A to initiate canonical BMP signaling in responsive progenitors, which drives skeletogenic commitment and HO. With the clear targets of activin A and ACVR1 identified, development of antibody therapeutics to prevent ligand-receptor interactions is an interventional approach currently being explored. Here, we developed a monoclonal blocking antibody (JAB0505) to the extracellular domain of ACVR1 and tested its ability to inhibit HO in established FOP mouse models. JAB0505 inhibited BMP-dependent gene expression in wild-type and ACVR1(R206H)-overexpressing cell lines. Strikingly, however, JAB0505 treatment markedly exacerbated injury-induced HO in two independent FOP mouse models in which ACVR1(R206H) was either broadly expressed, or more selectively expressed in fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). JAB0505 drove HO even under conditions of activin A inhibition, indicating that JAB0505 has receptor agonist activity. JAB0505-treated mice exhibited multiple, distinct foci of heterotopic lesions, suggesting an atypically broad anatomical domain of FAP recruitment to endochondral ossification. In addition, skeletogenic differentiation was both delayed and prolonged, and this was accompanied by dysregulation of FAP population growth. Collectively, alterations in the growth and differentiative properties of FAPs and FAP-derived skeletal cells are implicated in the aggravated HO phenotype. These data raise serious safety and efficacy concerns for the use of anti-ACVR1 antibodies to treat FOP patients.",

    "abstract": "The tumour microenvironment and genetic alterations collectively influence drug efficacy in cancer, but current evidence is limited to small scale studies and systematic analyses are lacking. We chose Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), the most common leukaemia in adults, as a model disease to study this complex interplay systematically. We performed a combinatorial assay using 12 drugs individually co-applied with each of 17 microenvironmental stimuli in 192 primary CLL samples, generating a comprehensive map of drug-microenvironment interactions in CLL. This data was combined with whole-exome sequencing, DNA-methylation, RNA-sequencing and copy number variant annotation. Our assay identified four distinct CLL subgroups that differed in their responses to the panel of microenvironmental stimuli. These subgroups were characterized by distinct clinical outcomes independently of known prognostic markers. We investigated the effect of CLL- specific recurrent genetic alterations on microenvironmental responses and identified trisomy 12 as an amplifier of multiple microenvironmental stimuli. We further quantified the impact of microenvironmental stimuli on drug response, confirmed known interactions such as Interleukin (IL) 4 mediated resistance to B cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors, and identified new interactions such as Interferon-{gamma} induced resistance to BCR inhibitors. Finally, we identified interactions which were limited to genetic subgroups. Resistance to chemotherapeutics, such as Fludarabine, induced by Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) agonists could be observed in IGHV unmutated patient samples and IGHV mutated samples with trisomy 12. In-vivo relevance was investigated in CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes, which showed increased IL4 and TLR signalling activity compared to healthy samples (p<0.001). High IL4 activity in lymph nodes correlated with faster disease progression (p=0.038).\n\nWe provide a publicly available resource (www.dietrichlab.de/CLL_Microenvironment/) which uncovers tumour cell extrinsic influences on drug response and disease progression in CLL, and how these interactions are modulated by cell intrinsic molecular features.",

SA is a key signaling component in the immune response of many plant species. However, the mechanism underlying SA-mediated immunity is obscure in rice (Oryza sativa). Prior analysis revealed a correlation between basal SA level and blast resistance in a range of rice varieties. This suggested that resistance might be improved by increasing basal SA level. Here, we identified a novel UDP-glucosyltransferase gene, UGT74J1, which is expressed ubiquitously throughout plant development. Mutants of UGT74J1 generated by genome editing accumulated high levels of SA under non-stressed conditions, indicating that UGT74J1 is a key enzyme for SA homeostasis in rice. Microarray analysis revealed that the ugt74j1 mutants constitutively overexpressed a set of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. An inoculation assay demonstrated that these mutants had increased resistance against rice blast, but they also exhibited stunted growth phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a rice mutant displaying SA overaccumulation.",

We developed a BioBricks(R) genetic toolbox of genetic parts for substrate precursor engineering in S. coelicolor M1146::cos16F4iE. We cloned a series of integrating vectors based on the VWB, TG1, and SV1 integrase systems to interrogate gene expression in the chromosome.

    "abstract": "Interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is an important viral restriction factor in viral pathogenesis that also exhibits poorly understood immune regulatory functions. Here, using human and mouse models, we demonstrate that IFITM3 regulates MyD88-dependent TLR-mediated cytokine production following dendritic cell exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV), and this process limits viral pathogenesis in vivo. IFITM3 also restricted pro-inflammatory (IL-6) cytokine production in response to influenza. IFITM3 bound to and promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the reticulon 4 isoform Nogo-B. We reveal that Nogo-B mediates TLR-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promotes viral pathogenesis in vivo, and this process involved alteration of TLR dynamics. The anti-inflammatory function of IFITM3 was intrinsically linked to its ability to regulate Nogo-B. Thus, we uncover Nogo-B as an unappreciated driver of viral pathogenesis and highlight a novel immune regulatory pathway where IFITM3 fine-tunes TLR responsiveness of myeloid cells to viral stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Faithful genome duplication requires appropriately controlled replication origin firing. The metazoan Treslin/TICRR origin firing factor and its yeast orthologue Sld3 are regulation hubs of origin firing. They share the Sld3-Treslin domain (STD) and the adjacent TopBP1/Dpb11 interaction domain (TDIN). We report a revised domain architecture model of Treslin/TICRR. Complementary protein sequence analyses uncovered Ku70-homologous {beta}-barrel folds in the Treslin/TICRR middle domain (M domain) and in Sld3. Thus, the Sld3-homologous Treslin/TICRR core comprises its three central domains, M domain, STD and TDIN. This Sld3-core is flanked by non-conserved terminal domains, the CIT (conserved in Treslins) and the C-terminus. We also identified Ku70-like {beta}-barrels in MTBP and Sld7. Our binding experiments showed that the Treslin {beta}-barrel mediates interaction with the MTBP {beta}-barrel, reminiscent of the homotypic Ku70-Ku80 dimerization. This binding mode is conserved in the Sld3-Sld7 dimer. We used Treslin/TICRR domain mutants to show that all Sld3-core domains and the non-conserved terminal domains fulfil important functions during origin firing in human cells. Thus, metazoa-specific and widely conserved molecular processes cooperate during origin firing in metazoa.",

    "abstract": "Radial glial (RG) cells are the neural stem cells of the developing neocortex. Apical RG (aRG) cells can delaminate to generate basal RG (bRG) cells, a cell type associated with human brain expansion. Here, we report that this delamination is regulated by the post-Golgi secretory pathway. Using in situ subcellular live imaging, we show that post-Golgi transport of RAB6+ vesicles occurs toward the minus ends of microtubules and depends on dynein. We demonstrate that the apical determinant Crumbs3 (CRB3) is also transported by dynein. Double knockout of RAB6A/A and RAB6B impairs apical localization of CRB3, and induces a retraction of aRG cell apical process, leading to delamination and ectopic division. These defects are phenocopied by knock-out of the dynein activator LIS1. Overall, our results identify a RAB6-dynein-LIS1 complex for Golgi to apical surface transport in aRG cells, and highlights the role of this pathway in the maintenance of neuroepithelial integrity.",

    "abstract": "We report genomic traits that have been associated with the life history of prokaryotes and highlight conflicting findings concerning earlier observed trait correlations and tradeoffs. In order to address possible explanations for these contradictions we examined trait-trait variations of 11 genomic traits from ~ 18,000 sequenced genomes. The studied trait-trait variations suggested: (i) the predominance of two resistance and resilience-related orthogonal axes and (ii) at least in free living species with large effective population sizes whose evolution is little affected by genetic drift an overlap between a resilience axis and an axis of resource usage efficiency. These findings imply that resistance associated traits of prokaryotes are globally decoupled from resilience related traits and in the case of free-living communities also from resource use efficiencies associated traits. However, further inspection of pairwise scatterplots showed that resistance and resilience traits tended to be positively related for genomes up to roughly five million base pairs and negatively for larger genomes. This in turn may preclude a globally consistent assignment of prokaryote genomic traits to the competitor - stress-tolerator - ruderal (CSR) schema that sorts species depending on their location along disturbance and productivity gradients into three ecological strategies and may serve as an explanation for conflicting findings from earlier studies. All reviewed genomic traits featured significant phylogenetic signals and we propose that our trait table can be applied to extrapolate genomic traits from taxonomic marker genes. This will enable to empirically evaluate the assembly of these genomic traits in prokaryotic communities from different habitats and under different productivity and disturbance scenarios as predicted via the resistance-resilience framework formulated here.",

    "abstract": "An emerging element in psychiatry is the gut-brain-axis, the bi-directional communication pathways between the gut microbiome and the brain. A prominent hypothesis, mostly based on preclinical studies, is that individual differences in the gut microbiome composition and drug-induced dysbiosis may be associated with vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including substance use disorder. However, most studies used small sample size, ignored individual differences, or used animal models with limited relevance to addiction. Here, we test the hypothesis that pre-existing microbiome composition and drug-induced changes in microbiome composition can predict addiction-like behaviors using an advanced animal model of extended access to cocaine self-administration in a large cohort of heterogenous stock (HS) rats. Adult male and female HS rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine under short (2h/day) and long access (6h/day) for ~7 weeks under various schedule of reinforcement to identify individuals that are resistant or vulnerable to addiction-like behaviors and fecal samples were collected before the first session and after the last session to assess differences in the microbiome composition. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) identified sex-dependent and sex-independent differences at the phylum, order, and species level that are differentially abundant in resistant vs. vulnerable individuals, including high level of actinobacteria both before the first exposure to cocaine and after 7 weeks of cocaine self-administration in resistant animals. Predictions of functional gene content using PICRUSt revealed differential regulation of short-chain fatty acid processing in the vulnerable group after self-administration. These results identify microbiome constituents as well as metabolic pathways that are associated with resistance or vulnerability to addiction-like behaviors in rats. Identification of microbes and tangential metabolic pathways involved in cocaine resilience/vulnerability may represent an innovative strategy for the development of novel biomarkers and medication for the treatment of cocaine use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Desminopathies comprise hereditary myopathies and cardiomyopathies caused by mutations in the intermediate filament protein desmin that lead to severe and often lethal degeneration of striated muscle tissue. Animal and single cell studies hinted that this degeneration process is associated with massive ultrastructural defects correlating with increased susceptibility of the muscle to acute mechanical stress. The underlying mechanism of mechanical susceptibility, and how muscle degeneration develops over time, however, has remained elusive. Here, we investigated the effect of a desmin mutation on the formation, differentiation, and contractile function of in vitro-engineered three-dimensional micro-tissues grown from muscle stem cells (satellite cells) isolated from heterozygous R349P desmin knock-in mice. Micro-tissues grown from desmin-mutated cells exhibited spontaneous unsynchronized contractions, higher contractile forces in response to electrical stimulation, and faster force recovery compared to tissues grown from wild-type cells. Within one week of culture, the majority of R349P desmin-mutated tissues disintegrated, whereas wild-type tissues remained intact over at least three weeks. Moreover, under tetanic stimulation lasting less than five seconds, desmin-mutated tissues partially or completely ruptured, whereas wild-type tissues did not display signs of damage. Our results demonstrate that the progressive degeneration of desmin-mutated micro-tissues is closely linked to extracellular matrix fiber breakage associated with increased contractile forces and unevenly distributed tensile stress. This suggests that the age-related degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscle in patients suffering from desminopathies may be similarly exacerbated by mechanical damage from high-intensity muscle contractions. We conclude that micro-tissues may provide a valuable tool for studying the organization of myocytes and the pathogenic mechanisms of myopathies.",

    "abstract": "Animals that ingest toxins can become unpalatable and even toxic to predators and parasites through toxin sequestration. Because most animals rapidly eliminate toxins to survive their ingestion, it is unclear how populations transition from susceptibility and toxin elimination to tolerance and accumulation as chemical defense emerges. Studies of chemical defense have generally focused on species with active toxin sequestration and target-site insensitivity mutations or toxin-binding proteins that permit survival without necessitating toxin elimination. Here, we investigate whether animals that presumably rely on toxin elimination for survival can utilize ingested toxins for defense. We use the A4 and A3 Drosophila melanogaster fly strains from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), which respectively possess elevated and reduced metabolic nicotine resistance amongst DSPR fly lines. We find that ingesting nicotine increased A4 but not A3 fly survival against Leptopilina heterotoma wasp parasitism.Further, we find that despite possessing genetic variants that enhance toxin elimination, A4 flies accrued more nicotine than A3 individuals likely by consuming more media. Our results suggest that enhanced toxin metabolism can allow for greater toxin intake by offsetting the cost of toxin ingestion. Passive toxin accumulation that accompanies increased toxin intake may underlie the early origins of chemical defense.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical force controls fundamental cellular processes in health and disease, and increasing evidence shows that the nucleus both experiences and senses applied forces. Here we show that nuclear forces differentially control passive and facilitated nucleocytoplasmic transport, setting the rules for the mechanosensitivity of shuttling proteins. We demonstrate that nuclear force increases permeability across nuclear pore complexes, with a dependence on molecular weight that is stronger for passive than facilitated diffusion. Due to this differential effect, force leads to the translocation into or out of the nucleus of cargoes within a given range of molecular weight and affinity for nuclear transport receptors. Further, we show that the mechanosensitivity of several transcriptional regulators can be both explained by this mechanism, and engineered exogenously by introducing appropriate nuclear localization signals. Our work sets a novel framework to understand mechanically induced signalling, with potential general applicability across signalling pathways and pathophysiological scenarios.\n\nOne sentence summaryForce application to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of proteins by differentially affecting passive versus facilitated nucleocytoplasmic transport.",
