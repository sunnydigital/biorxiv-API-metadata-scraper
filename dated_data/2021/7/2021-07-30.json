    "abstract": "Endocytosis involves plasma membrane-derived vesicles for the recycling of intra- and extracellular components. Increasing evidence suggests that endocytosis is related to maintaining intracellular homeostasis and defense against disease. Consequently, investigation of the endocytic pathway attracts considerable scientific interest. This study reports live-cell imaging of endocytosis using the newly-developed fluorescent probe ECGreen. We demonstrate that ECGreen is not membrane permeable and its fluorescence signal increases in acidic conditions. Because of these characteristics, ECGreen remains on the plasma membrane, and then shows increased fluorescence when it is internalized into the acidic vesicles formed in the endocytic process. ECGreen allows direct observation of the internalized vesicle; it is a valuable new probe for endocytic imaging.",

    "abstract": "We developed an open channel droplet microfluidic system that autonomously generates droplets at low Ca (~10-4-10-3) by leveraging competing hydrostatic and capillary pressure. With only our open channel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) device, pipettes, and commercially available carrier fluid, we produce hundreds of microliter droplets; tubing, electronics, or pumps are not required, making droplet technology feasible for research labs without external flow generators. Furthermore, we demonstrated conceptual applications that showcase the process of droplet generation, splitting, transport, incubation, mixing, and sorting in our system. Unlike conventional droplet microfluidics, the open nature of the device enables the use of physical tools such as tweezers and styli to directly access the system; with this, we developed a new method of droplet sorting and transfer that capitalizes on the Cheerios effect, the aggregation of buoyant objects along a liquid interface. Our platform offers enhanced usability, direct access to the droplet contents, easy manufacturability, compact footprint, and high customizability. This design is a first step in exploring the space of power-free open droplet microfluidic systems and provide design rules for similar channel designs.",

    "abstract": "Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are critical in development, homeostasis, and diseases, including cancer. However, our understanding of miRNA function at cellular resolution is thwarted by the inability of the standard single cell RNA-seq protocols to capture miRNAs. Here we introduce a machine learning tool -- miRSCAPE -- to infer miRNA expression in a sample from its RNA-seq profile. We establish miRSCAPEs accuracy separately in 10 tissues comprising ~10,000 tumor and normal bulk samples and demonstrate that miRSCAPE accurately infers cell type-specific miRNA activities (predicted vs observed fold-difference correlation ~ 0.81) in two independent datasets where miRNA profiles of specific cell types are available (HEK-GBM, Kidney-Breast-Skin). When trained on human hematopoietic cancers, miRSCAPE can identify active miRNAs in 8 hematopoietic cell lines in mouse with a reasonable accuracy (auROC = 0.67). Finally, we apply miRSCAPE to infer miRNA activities in scRNA clusters in Pancreatic and Lung cancers, as well as in 56 cell types in the Human Cell Landscape (HCL). Across the board, miRSCAPE recapitulates and provides a refined view of known miRNA biology. miRSCAPE is freely available and promises to substantially expand our understanding of gene regulatory networks at cellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Surface electrode EMG is an established method for studying biomechanical activity. It has not been well studied in detecting laryngeal biomechanical activity of pre-phonatory onset. Our aims were to compare the sensitivity of surface EMG in identifying pre-phonatory laryngeal activity to needle electrode laryngeal EMG and to compare the pre-phonatory period in patients with adductor laryngeal dystonia (ADLD) with that in controls. ADLD patients (n = 10) undergoing needle LEMG prior to Botox(R) injection and participants with normal voices (n = 6) were recruited. Surface EMG electrodes were placed over the cricoid ring and thyrohyoid membrane. Needle EMG electrodes were inserted into the thyroarytenoid muscle. EMG and auditory output samples were collected during phonation onset. Tracings were de-identified and evaluated. Measurements of time from onset in change of the amplitude and motor unit frequency on the interference pattern to onset of phonation were calculated by two blinded raters. 42 of 71 patient and 40 of 50 control tracings were available for analysis. Correlation for pre-phonatory time between electrode configuration was 0.70 for patients, 0.64 for controls and 0.79 for all the data combined. Interrater correlation was 0.97 for needle and 0.96 for surface electrodes. ADLD patients had a longer pre-phonatory time than control subjects by 169.48ms with surface electrode and 140.23ms with needle electrode (p < 0.001). Surface EMG demonstrates equal reliability as Needle EMG in detecting pre-phonatory activity in controls and subjects. Patients with ADLD have a significantly prolonged pre-phonatory period when compared with controls.",

    "abstract": "GM3 Synthase Deficiency (GM3SD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from pathogenic variants in the ST3GAL5 gene, which encodes GM3 synthase, a glycosphingolipid (GSL)-specific sialyltransferase. This enzyme adds a single 3-linked sialic acid to the terminal galactose of lactosylceramide (LacCer) to produce the monosialylated ganglioside GM3. In turn, GM3 is extended by other glycosyltransferases to generate nearly all the complex gangliosides enriched in neural tissue. Pathogenic mechanisms that account for neural phenotypes associated with GM3SD are not known. To explore how loss of GM3 impacts neural-specific glycolipid glycosylation and cell signaling, GM3SD patient fibroblasts bearing one of two different ST3GAL5 variants were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated to neural crest cells (NCCs). GM3 and GM3-derived gangliosides were undetectable in iPSCs and NCCs from both variants, while LacCer precursor levels were elevated compared to wildtype (WT). NCCs of both variants synthesized elevated levels of neutral lacto- and globo-series, as well as minor alternatively sialylated, GSLs compared to WT. Shifts in ceramide profiles associated with iPSC and NCC GSLs were also detected in GM3SD variants. Altered GSL profiles in the GM3SD cells were accompanied by dynamic changes in the cell surface proteome, protein O-GlcNAcylation, and receptor tyrosine kinase abundance. GM3SD cells also exhibited increased apoptosis and sensitivity to erlotnib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of O-GlcNAcase increased protein O-GlcNAcylation and significantly rescued baseline and erlotnib-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings indicate broad effects on cell signaling during differentiation of GM3SD patient-derived iPSCs to NCCs. Thus, human GM3SD cells provide a novel platform to investigate structure/function relationships that connect GSL diversity to cell signaling, cell survival, and neural differentiation.",

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous membranes were fabricated to effectively capture and inactivate coronavirus aerosols. With an ultrafine fiber diameter ([~] 200 nm) and a small pore size ([~] 1.5 {micro}m), the optimized membranes caught 99.2% of the aerosols of the murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59), a coronavirus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, rose bengal was used as the photosensitizer for the membranes because of its excellent reactivity in generating virucidal singlet oxygen, and the membranes rapidly inactivated 98.9% of MHV-A59 in virus-laden droplets only after 15 min irradiation of simulated reading light. Singlet oxygen damaged the virus genome and impaired virus binding to host cells, which elucidated the mechanism of disinfection at a molecular level. Membrane robustness was also evaluated, and no efficiency reduction for filtering MHV-A59 aerosols was observed after the membranes being exposed to both indoor light and sunlight for days. Nevertheless, sunlight exposure photobleached the membranes, reduced singlet oxygen production, and compromised the performance of disinfecting MHV-A59 in droplets. In contrast, the membranes after simulated indoor light exposure maintained their excellent disinfection performance. In summary, photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been developed to capture and kill airborne environmental pathogens under ambient conditions, and they hold promise for broad applications as personal protective equipment and indoor air filters.\n\nSynopsisPhotosensitized electrospun nanofibrous filters with excellent capture-and-kill performance against coronaviruses were designed and implemented to prevent the airborne transmission of COVID-19.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/454404v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@171d6corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18caad5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23b902org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14746e4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has threatened human health and the global economy. Development of additional vaccines and therapeutics is urgently required, but such development with live virus must be conducted with biosafety level 3 confinement. Pseudotyped viruses have been widely adopted for studies of virus entry and pharmaceutical development to overcome this restriction. Here we describe a modified protocol to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in high yield. We found that pseudovirions produced with the conventional transient expression system lacked coronavirus Spike protein at their surface as a result of inhibition of parental VSV infection by overexpression of this protein. Establishment of stable cell lines with an optimal expression level of coronavirus Spike protein allowed the efficient production of progeny pseudoviruses decorated with Spike protein. This improved VSV pseudovirus production method should facilitate studies of coronavirus entry and development of antiviral agents.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic and associated supply-chain disruptions emphasise the requirement for antimicrobial materials for on-demand manufacturing. Besides aerosol transmission, SARS-CoV-2 is also propagated through contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. As such, the development of effective biofunctional materials that can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are critical for pandemic preparedness. Such materials will enable the rational development of antiviral devices with prolonged serviceability reducing the environmental burden of disposable alternatives. This research reveals the novel use of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) to 3D print porous Cobalt-Chromium-Molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) superalloy with potent antiviral activity (100% viral inactivation in 30 mins). The porous material was rationally conceived using a multi-objective surrogate model featuring track thickness (tt) and pore diameter ({phi}d) as responses. The regression analysis found the most significant parameters for Co-Cr-Mo track formation to be the interaction effects of scanning rate (Vs) and laser power (Pl) in the order PlVs > Vs > Pl. Contrastively, the pore diameter was found to be primarily driven by the hatch spacing (Sh). The study is the first to demonstrate the superior antiviral properties of 3D printed Co-Cr-Mo superalloy against an enveloped virus used as biosafe viral model of SARS-CoV-2. The material significantly outperforms the viral inactivation time of other broadly used antiviral metals such as copper and silver from 5 hours to 30 minutes. As such the study goes beyond the current state-of-the-art in antiviral alloys to provide extra-protection to combat the SARS-COV-2 viral spread. The evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic brings new and unpredictable challenges where on-demand 3D printing of antiviral materials can achieve rapid solutions while reducing the environmental impact of disposable devices.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=148 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/454385v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@992f2forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8dbe5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bcb8adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100a345_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 has mutated rapidly which enabled them to adapt and evade the immune system of the host. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with crucial mutations pose a global challenge in context of therapeutic drugs and vaccines being developed globally. There are currently no specific therapeutics or vaccines available to combat SARS-CoV-2 devastation. In view of this, the current study aimed to identify and characterize the mutations found in the Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian isolates. Non-structural protein, Nsp13 protein sequences from Indian isolates were analyzed by comparing with the first reported Severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence from Wuhan, China. Out of 825 Nsp13 protein sequences, a total of 38 mutations were observed among Indian isolates. Our data show that mutations in Nsp13 at various positions (H164Y, A237T, T214I, C309Y, S236I, P419S, V305E, G54S, H290Y, P53S, A308Y, and A308Y) have a significant impact on the proteins stability and flexibility. Also, the impact of Nsp13 mutations on the protein function were predicted based on PROVEAN score that includes 15 mutants as neutral and 23 mutants as deleterious effect. Furthermore, B-cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13 were identified using various predictive immunoinformatic tools. Immunological Parameters of Nsp13 such as antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity were evaluated to predict the potential B-cell epitopes. The predicted peptide sequences were correlated with the observed mutants. Our predicted data showed that there are seven high rank linear epitopes as well as 18 discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on immunoinformatic tools. Moreover, it was observed that out of total 38 identified mutations among Indian SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 protein, four mutant residues at position 142 (E142), 245 (H245), 247 (V247) and 419 (P419) are localised in the predicted B cell epitopic region. Altogether, the results of the present in-silico study might help to understand the impact of the identified mutations in Nsp13 protein on its stability, flexibility and function.",

Previous studies showed that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) decreased alcohol and sweet preference in mice. In this study, FGF21-transgenic (FGF21-Tg) mice, expressing high FGF21 serum levels, and wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J littermates were treated with morphine and saline to determine if differences exist in their physiological and behavioral responses to opioids. FGF21-Tg mice displayed reduced preference for morphine in the conditioned place preference assay compared to WT littermates. Similarly, FGF21-Tg mice had an attenuation of the magnitude and rate of acute morphine antinociceptive tolerance development, and acute and chronic morphine physical dependence, but exhibited no change in chronic morphine antinociceptive tolerance. The ED50 values for morphine-induced antinociception in the 55{degrees}C hot plate and the 55{degrees}C warm-water tail withdrawal assays were similar in both strains of mice. Likewise, FGF21-Tg and WT littermates had comparable responses to morphine-induced respiratory depression. Overall, FGF21-Tg mice had a decrease in the development of acute analgesic tolerance, and the development of physical dependence, and morphine preference. FGF21 and its receptor have therapeutic potential for reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms and craving, and augmenting opioid therapeutics for acute pain patients to minimize tolerance development.",

    "abstract": "Glucose homeostasis, regulated by glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon (GCG) is critical to human health. Several multi-targeting agonists at GIPR, GLP-1R or GCGR, developed to maximize metabolic benefits with reduced side-effects, are in clinical trials to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which tirzepatide, a GIPR/GLP-1R dualagonist, and peptide 20, a GIPR/GLP-1R/GCGR triagonist, manifest their superior efficacies over monoagonist such as semaglutide, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of tirzepatide-bound GIPR and GLP-1R as well as peptide 20-bound GIPR, GLP-1R and GCGR The structures reveal both common and unique features for the dual and triple agonism by illustrating key interactions of clinical relevance at the atomic level. Retention of glucagon function is required to achieve such an advantage over GLP-1 monotherapy. Our findings provide valuable insights into the structural basis of functional versatility and therapeutic supremacy of tirzepatide and peptide 20.",

This study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, including the first case of each Regional Health Coordination and cases from three epidemic peaks.\n\nMethodsNinety SARS-CoV-2 genomes from RS were sequenced and analyzed against SARS-CoV-2 datasets available in GISAID for phylogenetic inference and mutation analysis.\n\nResultsSARS-CoV-2 lineages among the first cases in RS were B.1 (33.3%), B.1.1.28 (26.7%), B.1.1 (13.3%), B.1.1.33 (10.0%), and A (6.7%), evidencing SARS-CoV-2 introduction by both international origin and community-driven transmission. We found predominance of B.1.1.33 (50.0%) and B.1.1.28 (35.0%) during the first epidemic peak (July-August, 2020), emergence of P.2 (55.6%) in the second peak (November-December, 2020), and massive spread of P.1 and related sequences (78.4%), such as P.1-like-II, P.1.1 and P.1.2 in the third peak (February-April, 2021). Eighteen novel mutation combinations were found among P.1 genomes, and 22 different spike mutations and/or deletions among P.1 and related sequences.\n\nConclusionsThis study shows the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Southern Brazil, and describes SARS-CoV-2 diversity during three epidemic peaks, highlighting the spread of P.1 and the high genetic diversity of currently circulating lineages. Genomic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to guide health authorities decisions to control COVID-19 in Brazil.\n\nSummaryNinety SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, were sequenced, including the first cases from 15 State Health Coordination regions and samples from three epidemic peaks. Phylogenomic inferences showed SARS-CoV-2 lineages spread, revealing its genomic diversity.",

Here, we report a database for COVID-19-specific IgG/IgM immune responses and clinical parameters (COVID-ONE humoral immune). COVID-ONE humoral immunity is based on a dataset that contains the IgG/IgM responses to 21 of 28 known SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 197 spike protein peptides against 2,360 COVID-19 samples collected from 783 patients. In addition, 96 clinical parameters for the 2,360 samples and information for the 783 patients are integrated into the database. Furthermore, COVID-ONE humoral immune provides a dashboard for defining samples and a one-click analysis pipeline for a single group or paired groups. A set of samples of interest is easily defined by adjusting the scale bars of a variety of parameters.

    "abstract": "{beta}-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and their metabolites are deeply involved in the development of Alzheimers disease (AD). Upon the upregulation of {beta}-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), its product, the {beta}-carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP ({beta}CTF), is accumulated in the early stage of sporadic AD brains. {beta}CTF accumulation is currently considered the trigger for endosomal anomalies to form enlarged endosomes, one of the earliest pathologies in AD. However, the details of the underlying mechanism remain largely unclear. In this study, using BACE1 stably-overexpressing cells, we describe that lipid flippase subcomponent TMEM30A interacts with accumulated {beta}CTF. Among the lipid flippases in endosomes, those composed of TMEM30A and active subcomponent ATP8A1 transports phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), to the cytosolic side of the endosomes. The lipid flippase activity and cytosolic PS distribution are critical for membrane fission and vesicle transport. Intriguingly, accumulated {beta}CTF in model cells impaired lipid flippase physiological formation and activity, along with endosome enlargement. Moreover, in the brains of AD model mice before the amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition, the TMEM30A/{beta}CTF complex formation occurred, followed by lipid flippase dysfunction. Importantly, our novel A{beta}/{beta}CTF interacting TMEM30A-derived peptide \"T-RAP\" improved endosome enlargement and reduced {beta}CTF levels. These T-RAP effects could result from the recovery of lipid flippase activity. Therefore, we propose lipid flippase dysfunction as a key pathogenic event and a novel therapeutic target for AD.",

However, its role in metastasis is not understood. Here we found in the MMTV-HER2 mouse model that quiescent HER2+ disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) displayed unresolved ER stress as revealed by high expression of the PERK-inducible GADD34 gene. Single cell gene expression profiling and imaging confirmed that a significant proportion of DCCs in lungs were dormant and displayed an active UPR. In human breast cancer metastasis biopsies, GADD34 expression and quiescence were also positively correlated. Importantly, PERK inhibition with a specific inhibitor (HC4) blunted metastasis development by selectively killing UPRhigh quiescent but not proliferative DCCs. We also show that PERK inhibition altered optimal HER2 activity in primary tumors as a result of sub-optimal HER2 trafficking and phosphorylation in response to EGF. Our data identify PERK as a unique \"Achilles heel\" in dormant DTCs, supporting a requisite role for PERK in DTCs. Taken together, these data identify novel strategies to eliminate quiescent DCCs in patients with disseminated cancer disease.",

    "abstract": "RationaleHepcidin (HAMP) is a hormone produced primarily in the liver. It controls systemic iron homeostasis by inhibiting the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) in the gut and spleen, respective sites of iron absorption and recycling. HAMP and FPN are also found ectopically in tissues not involved in systemic iron homeostasis. The physiological functions of ectopic HAMP and FPN are only just beginning to be uncovered. We observed that HAMP expression is markedly increased in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), both in patients and in an experimental mouse model of AAA.\n\nObjectiveTo understand the role of SMC-derived HAMP in the pathophysiology of AAA.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe generated mice harbouring an inducible, SMC-specific deletion of the hamp gene. We then applied the experimental model of AAA and simultaneously induced deletion of hamp in SMCs. We found that these mice developed large aneurysms and had greater incidences of rupture and of fatal dissection than mice with intact hamp in SMCs. A similar phenotype was observed in mice harbouring an inducible SMC-specific knock-in of HAMP-resistant FPNC326Y. Additionally, we observed that expression of Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), a protein known to promote AAA, was suppressed in AAA tissue from patients and from mice with intact hamp in SMCs, but not in mice lacking hamp in SMCs. Treatment of these mice with a LCN2-neutralising antibody protected them from the otherwise detrimental effects of loss of hamp in SMCs.\n\nConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that the rise in SMC-derived HAMP within the aneurysm tissue is protective in the setting of AAA, and that such protection involves the cell-autonomous action of HAMP, and suppression of local LCN2. These findings are the first example of a protective role for ectopic HAMP in disease. They expand understanding of the multifaceted functions of HAMP outside the liver.",

Despite considerable effort no treatments are available to slow or stop the progression of these dementias. Here we investigate the possibility that activation of the M1-muscarinic receptor (M1-receptor), which is highly expressed in the brain and that shows pro-cognitive properties, might present a novel disease modifying target. We demonstrate that the progression of murine prion disease, which we show here displays many of the pathological, behavioural and biochemical hallmarks of human neurodegenerative disease, is slowed and normal behaviour maintained by the activation of the M1-receptor with a highly tolerated positive allosteric modulator (VU846). This correlates with a reduction in both neuroinflammation and indicators of mitochondrial dysregulation, as well as a normalisation in the expression of markers associated with neurodegeneration and Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, VU846 preserves expression of synaptic proteins and post-synaptic signalling components that are altered in disease. We conclude that allosteric regulation of M1-receptors has the potential to reduce the severity of neurodegenerative diseases caused by the prion-like propagation of misfolded protein in a manner that extends life span and maintains normal behaviour.",

However, reconstitution of complete, sustained, and functional B lymphopoiesis from PSCs has not yet been developed. Here, we successfully achieved regenerative B lymphopoiesis in B-cell deficient animals transplanted with PSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors (iHPCs) guided by synergistic expression of Runx1, Hoxa9, and Lhx2. Upon transplantation, the iHPCs immediately gave rise to pro/pre-B cells in recipients bone marrow, which were able to further differentiate into the entire B cell lineages, including innate B-1a, B-1b, MZ B cells, as well as adaptive FO B cells. In responding to antigen stimuli, the regenerative B cells produced adaptive humoral immune responses, sustained a prolonged antigen-specific antibody production, and formed immune-memory. Particularly, the regenerative B cells in spleen showed developing patterns of immunoglobulin chain-switch and hyper-mutation via a cross-talk with the host T follicular helper cells, which eventually formed T cell-dependent humoral responses.

    "abstract": "CD8 T cell memory offers critical antiviral protection, even in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. The paradigm is that CD8 T cell memory within the lung tissue consists of a mix of circulating TEM cells and non-circulating TRM cells. However, based on our analysis, the heterogeneity within the tissue is much higher, identifying TCM, TEM, TRM, and a multitude of populations which do not perfectly fit these classifications. Further interrogation of the populations shows that TRM cells that express CD49a, both with and without CD103, have increased and diverse effector potential compared with CD49a negative populations. These populations function as a one-man band, displaying antiviral activity, chemokine production, release of GM-CSF, and the ability to kill specific targets in vitro with delayed kinetics compared with effector CD8 T cells. Together, this study establishes that CD49a defines multiple polyfunctional CD8 memory subsets after clearance of influenza infection, which act to eliminate virus in the absence of direct killing, recruit and mature innate immune cells, and destroy infected cells if the virus persists.\n\nContribution to the fieldProtection from previously seen infections requires specialized immune memory cells properly positioned throughout the body to combat the newly invading pathogen. In the case of re-exposure to influenza virus, CD8 T cells resident within the respiratory tract (TRM) are critical for eliminating the virus. Previously, TRM were viewed as mostly homogenous, with a limited range of immune functions. In this study, lung TRM were compared with circulating memory CD8 T cells transiently present within the lung, to define the breadth of their effector capabilities. Using TRM defining surface proteins CD49a and CD103 to identify different memory CD8 T cell subsets, gene and protein expression were evaluated. In addition to demonstrating higher levels of diversity than previously reported, multiple polyfunctional subsets were identified. This polyfunctionality was primarily associated with cell populations expressing CD49a, and these cells produced multiple antiviral factors, chemokines to recruit other immune cells, a growth factor associated with improved antigen presenting cell function, and cytolytic granules. Functional assays further demonstrated killing of target cells by TRM. This study paints a more holistic, complete picture of the phenotype and functions of lung CD8 T cells after viral infection, revealing CD49a as a marker of cells with high effector capacity.",

Their known toxicity on aquatic biota and their longevity in the environment has encouraged research on biodegradable alternatives such as rhamnolipids. While previous research has investigated the effects of biological surfactants on single species biofilms, there remains a lack of information regarding the effects of synthetic and biological surfactants in freshwater ecosystems. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test how the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the biological surfactant rhamnolipid altered community composition and metabolic activity of freshwater biofilms. Biofilms were cultured in the flumes using lake water from Lake Lunz in Austria, under high (300 ppm) and low (150 ppm) concentrations of either surfactant over a four-week period. Our results show that both surfactants significantly affected microbial diversity. Up to 36% of microbial operational taxonomic units were lost after surfactant exposure.

    "abstract": "Biological processes in all living cells are powered by ATP, a nearly universal molecule of energy transfer. ATP synthases produce ATP utilizing proton gradients that are usually generated by either respiration or photosynthesis. However, cyanobacteria are unique in combining photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains in the same membrane system, the thylakoids. How cyanobacteria prevent the futile reverse operation of ATP synthase under unfavorable conditions pumping protons while hydrolyzing ATP is mostly unclear. Here, we provide evidence that the small protein Atp{Theta}, which is widely conserved in cyanobacteria, is mainly fulfilling this task. The expression of Atp{Theta} becomes induced under conditions such as darkness or heat shock, which can lead to a weakening of the proton gradient. Translational fusions of Atp{Theta} to the green fluorescent protein revealed targeting to the thylakoid membrane. Immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry and far Western blots identified subunits of ATP synthase as interacting partners of Atp{Theta}. ATP hydrolysis assays with isolated membrane fractions as well as purified ATP synthase complexes demonstrated that Atp{Theta} inhibits ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner similar to the F0F1-ATP synthase inhibitor N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodimide. The results show that, even in a well-investigated process, crucial new players can be discovered if small proteins are taken into consideration and indicate that ATP synthase activity can be controlled in surprisingly different ways.",

    "abstract": "Persistent neutrophilic inflammation associated with chronic pulmonary infection causes progressive lung injury and eventually death in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease caused by bi-allelic mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.\n\nWe therefore examined whether Roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that (in other conditions) reduces inflammation while promoting host defence, might provide a beneficial effect in the context of CF.\n\nHerein, using CFTR-depleted zebrafish larvae as an innovative vertebrate model of CF immuno-pathophysiology, combined with murine and human approaches, we sought to determine the effects of Roscovitine on innate immune responses to tissue injury and pathogens in CF condition.\n\nWe show that Roscovitine exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution effects in neutrophilic inflammation induced by infection or tail amputation in zebrafish. Roscovitine reduces overactive epithelial ROS-mediated neutrophil trafficking, by reducing DUOX2/NADPH-oxidase activity, and accelerates inflammation resolution by inducing neutrophil apoptosis and reverse migration. Importantly, while Roscovitine efficiently enhances intracellular bacterial killing of Mycobacterium abscessus in human CF macrophages ex vivo, we found that treatment with Roscovitine results in worse infection in mouse and zebrafish models. By interfering with DUOX2/NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, Roscovitine reduces the number of neutrophils at infection sites, and consequently compromises granuloma formation and maintenance, favouring extracellular multiplication of M. abscessus and more severe infection.\n\nOur findings bring important new understanding of the immune-targeted action of Roscovitine and have significant therapeutic implications for safety targeting inflammation in CF.",

ATP is an essential component of viral replication, and we have evaluated the effect of tizoxanide (TIZ), the active circulating metabolite of NTZ, on ATP in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses.\n\nResultsTIZ decreased cellular ATP in a dose-dependent manner in MDCK cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses. Maximum inhibition of ATP in influenza infected or uninfected MDCK cells reached up to 45% after 6 and 24 hours of exposure to 100{micro}M TIZ. The decrease in cellular ATP did not affect cell viability and was reversible after eliminating TIZ from the culture.\n\nConclusionThe concentrations of TIZ required to decrease cellular ATP levels were similar to those reported to inhibit replication of influenza A and B viruses in our laboratory. A decrease in ATP triggers activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is known to suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of TIZ on mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "Transcription is orchestrated by thousands of transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins, but how these are causally connected to transcriptional activation or repression is poorly understood. Here, we conduct an unbiased proteome-scale screen to systematically uncover human proteins that activate transcription in a natural chromatin context. We also identify potent transactivation domains among the hits. By combining interaction proteomics and chemical inhibitors, we delineate the preference of both known and novel transcriptional activators for specific co-activators, highlighting how even closely related TFs can function via distinct co-factors. Finally, we show that many novel activators are partners in fusion events in tumors and functionally characterize a myofibroma-associated fusion between SRF and C3orf62, a potent activator. SRF-C3orf62 activates transcription in a CBP/p300-dependent manner and promotes proliferative and myogenic transcriptional programs.

    "abstract": "Transcriptional profiling is a powerful tool to investigate and detect human diseases. In this study, we used bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the transcriptomes in skin lesions of leprosy patients or controls affected by other dermal conditions such as granuloma annulare, a confounder for paucibacillary leprosy. We identified five genes capable of accurately distinguishing multibacillary and paucibacillary leprosy from other skin conditions. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression alone was highly discriminatory, followed by TLR10, BLK, CD38, and SLAMF7, whereas the HS3ST2 and CD40LG mRNA separated multi- and paucibacillary leprosy. Finally, from the main differentially expressed genes (DEG) and enriched pathways, we conclude that paucibacillary disease is characterized by epithelioid transformation and granuloma formation, with an exacerbated cellular immune response, while multibacillary leprosy features epithelial-mesenchymal transition with phagocytic and lipid biogenesis patterns in the skin. These findings will help catalyze the development of better diagnostic tools and potential host-based therapeutic interventions. Finally, our data may help elucidate host-pathogen interplay driving disease clinical manifestations.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite effective treatment, leprosy is still a significant public health issue in more than 120 countries, with more than 200 000 new cases yearly. The disease is caused mainly by Mycobacterium leprae, a slow-growing bacillus still uncultivable in axenic media. This limitation has hampered basic research into host-pathogen interaction and the development of new diagnostic assays. Currently, leprosy is diagnosed clinically, with no standalone diagnostic assay accurate enough for all clinical forms. Here, we use RNA-seq transcriptome profiling in leprosy lesions and granuloma annulare to identify mRNA biomarkers with potential diagnostic applications. Also, we explored new pathways that can be useful in further understanding the host-pathogen interaction and how the bacteria bypass host immune defenses. We found that IDO1, a gene involved with tryptophan catabolism, is an excellent candidate for distinguishing leprosy lesions from other dermatoses. Additionally, we observed that a previous signature of keratinocyte development and cornification negatively correlates with epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes in the skin, suggesting new ways in which the pathogen may subvert its host to survive and spread throughout the body. Our study identifies new mRNA biomarkers that can improve leprosy diagnostics and describe new insights about host-pathogen interactions in human skin.",

We utilized Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging coupled with fluorescent microscopy of 64Cu-labeled photoactivatable-GFP-HIV (PA-GFP-BaL) to determine how HIV virions distribute and localize in neonatal rhesus macaques two and four hours after oral viral challenge. Our results show that by four hours after oral viral exposure, HIV virions localize to and penetrate the rectal mucosa. We also used a dual viral challenge with a non-replicative viral vector and a replication competent SHIV-1157ipd3N4 to examine viral transduction and dissemination at 96 hours. Our data show that while SHIV-1157ipd3N4 infection can be found in the oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the small and large intestine contained the largest number of infected cells. Moreover, we found that T cells were the biggest population of infected immune cells. Thus, thanks to these novel technologies, we are able to visualize and delineate of viral distribution and infection throughout the entire neonatal GI tract during acute viral infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryApproximately 1.8 million children are currently living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While mother-to-child HIV transmission can occur in utero and during delivery, it most commonly occurs through breastfeeding, creating the need to understand how the virus moves throughout the body and infects the infant once breast milk is consumed. Here, we used multiple imaging techniques and PCR to determine how HIV distributes throughout the gastrointestinal tract after oral viral exposure and in which tissues and cell types become acutely infected. We found that HIV rapidly spreads throughout and penetrates the entire gastrointestinal tract as early as four hours after exposure. We also found that the intestine contained the largest number of infected cells at 96 hours and that most cells infected were T cells. Our study shows that these imaging technologies allow for the examination of viral distribution and infection in a rhesus macaque model.",

It plays important roles in many cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In the present study we demonstrate that extracellular concentration of reduced glutathione markedly increases cell volume within few hours, in a dose-response manner. Pre-incubation of cells with BSO, the inhibitor of {gamma}-glutamylcysteine synthetase, responsible for the first step in intracellular glutathione synthesis did not change the effect of reduced glutathione on cell volume suggesting a mechanism limited to the interaction of extracellular reduced glutathione on cell membrane. Similarly, inhibition of {gamma}-glutamylcyclotransferase involved in intracellular glutamate production had no effect on the action of reduced glutathione. Oxidized glutathione exerted no effect on cell volume. Results show that reduced GSH decreases cell adhesion resulting in an increased cell volume. Since many cell types are able to export GSH, the present results suggest that this could be a fundamental self-regulation of cell volume, giving the cells a self-control on their adhesion proteins.",

    "abstract": "The geographical location and shape of Apulia, a narrow land stretching out in the sea at the South of Italy, made this region a Mediterranean crossroads connecting Western Europe and the Balkans. Such movements culminated at the beginning of the Iron Age with the Iapygian civilization which consisted of three cultures: Peucetians, Messapians and Daunians. Among them, the Daunians left a peculiar cultural heritage, with one-of-a-kind stelae and pottery, but, despite the extensive archaeological literature, their origin has been lost to time. In order to shed light on this and to provide a genetic picture of Iron Age Southern Italy, we collected and sequenced human remains from three archaeological sites geographically located in Northern Apulia (the area historically inhabited by Daunians) and radiocarbon dated between 1157 and 275 calBCE. We find that Iron Age Apulian samples are still distant from the genetic variability of modern-day Apulians, they show a remarkable genetic heterogeneity, even though a few kilometers and centuries separate them, and they are well inserted into the Iron Age Pan-Mediterranean genetic landscape. Our study provides for the first time a window on the genetic make-up of pre-imperial Southern Italy, whose increasing connectivity within the Mediterranean landscape, would have contributed to laying the foundation for modern genetic variability. In this light, the genetic profile of Daunians may be compatible with an autochthonous origin, with plausible contributions from the Balkan peninsula.",

Molecular epidemiology, and carbapenem resistance were studied by Whole Genome Sequencing.\n\nResultsA total of 105 different Sequence Types (STs) were identified including 48 reported STs and 57 Novel STs. 99 isolates were classified into Clonal Complex 451 (CC451) among which ST848 and ST1956 were the common STs. Carbapenemase resistance was confirmed in all the isolates with the presence of intrinsic blaOXA-51-like genes, and the acquired blaOXA-23 and blaNDM-1 genes.\n\nConclusionMost of the isolates were grouped under clonal complex 451. ST1053 caused an outbreak in Northern India during 2018 and 2019. Novel MLST alleles and STs were also detected, underlining an evolutionary divergence in India. The carbapenem-resistance was dominated by OXA-type carbapenemases and further surveillance of these carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and antimicrobial stewardship should be strengthened.",

While synthetic chemical methods for site-specific incorporation of fluorine in complex molecules have improved in recent years, approaches for the direct biosynthetic fluorination of natural compounds are still rare. Herein, we present a broadly applicable approach for site-specific, biocatalytic derivatization of polyketides with fluorine. Specifically, we exchanged the native acyltransferase domain (AT) of a polyketide synthase (PKS), which acts as the gatekeeper for selection of extender units, with an evolutionarily related but substrate tolerant domain from metazoan type I fatty acid synthase (FAS). The resulting PKS/FAS hybrid can utilize fluoromalonyl coenzyme A and fluoromethylmalonyl coenzyme A for polyketide chain extension, introducing fluorine or fluoro-methyl disubstitutions in polyketide scaffolds. Addition of a fluorine atom is often a decisive factor toward developing superior properties in next-generation antibiotics, including the macrolide solithromycin. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in the semisynthesis of a fluorinated derivative of the macrolide antibiotic YC-17.",

For these reasons, new biological treatment options are currently being explored. Inorganic polyphosphates are naturally occurring biological molecules that have an anabolic effect on chondrocytes grown in vitro in the presence of Ca2+. We hypothesized that when examining significant changes in protein phosphorylation, key candidates would emerge that could help to elucidate the anabolic effects of polyphosphate on chondrocytes. Therefore, we conducted a large-scale quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic study of bovine primary articular chondrocytes after 30-minute treatment with inorganic polyphosphate and Ca2+. Mass spectrometry identified more than 6000 phosphorylation sites on [~]1600 chondrocyte phosphoproteins while proteomic analysis detected approximately 4100 proteins. Analysis of the data revealed a swift and dynamic response to polyphosphate after 30 minutes. What emerged from the list of proteins most affected by the treatment were proteins with key roles in chondrogenesis including TNC, IGFBP-5, and CTGF, indicating that polyphosphate plays an important role in chondrocyte metabolism. This phosphoproteome serves as a meaningful resource to help elucidate the molecular events that contribute to extracellular matrix production in cartilage.",

    "abstract": "Procedures were devised for the reversible decondensation and recondensation of purified mitotic chromosomes. Computational methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of chromosome morphology in high throughput, enabling the recording of condensation behavior of thousands of individual chromosomes. Established physico-chemical theory for ionic hydrogels was modified for application to chromosomal material and shown to accurately predict the observed condensation behavior. The theory predicts a change of state (a \"volume phase transition\") in the course of condensation, and such a transition was shown to occur. These findings, together with classical cytology showing loops of chromatin, lead to the description of mitotic chromosome structure in terms of two simple principles: contraction of length of chromatin fibers by the formation of loops, radiating from a central axis; and condensation of the chromosomal material against the central axis through a volume phase transition.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe mitotic chromosome is an axially scaffolded ionic hydrogel, undergoing a volume phase transition to achieve a condensed state.",

    "abstract": "- As the central carbon uptake pathway in photosynthetic cells, the Calvin-Benson cycle is among the most important biochemical cycles for life on Earth. A carbon flux of anaplerotic origin (i.e., through the chloroplast-localised oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway) into the Calvin-Benson cycle was proposed recently.\n- Here, we measured intramolecular deuterium abundances in leaf starch of Helianthus annuus grown at varying ambient CO2 concentrations, Ca. Additionally, we modelled deuterium fractionations expected for the anaplerotic pathway and compared modelled with measured fractionations.\n- We report deuterium fractionation signals at H1 and H2 of starch glucose. Below a Ca change point, these signals increase with decreasing Ca consistent with modelled fractionations by anaplerotic flux. Under standard conditions (Ca=450 ppm corresponding to intercellular CO2 concentrations, Ci, of 328 ppm), we estimate negligible anaplerotic flux. At Ca=180 ppm (Ci=140 ppm), more than 10% of the glucose 6-phosphate entering the starch biosynthesis pathway is diverted into the anaplerotic pathway.\n- In conclusion, we report evidence consistent with anaplerotic carbon flux into the Calvin-Benson cycle in vivo. We propose the flux may help to (i) maintain high levels of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate under source-limited growth conditions to facilitate photorespiratory nitrogen assimilation required to build-up source strength and (ii) counteract oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has created the need of compounds able to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. Doxycycline, with its pleiotropic effects, including anti-viral activity, has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and about twenty clinical trials have started since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nTo gain information on the activity of doxycycline against SARS-CoV-2 infection and clarify some of the conflicting clinical data published, we designed in vitro binding tests and infection studies with a pseudotyped virus expressing the spike protein, as well as a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. Doxycycline inhibited the transduction of the pseudotyped virus in Vero E6 and HEK-293 T cells stably expressing human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAlthough this conclusion is apparently disappointing, it is paradigmatic of an experimental approach aimed at developing an integrated multidisciplinary platform. To avoid wasting precious time and resources we believe very stringent experimental criteria are needed in the preclinical phase, including infectious studies with SARS-CoV-2 in the platform before moving on to [failed] clinical trials.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a completely unusual situation in rapidly searching for compounds able to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. This new scenario has substantially changed the timing of drug development which has also resulted in the generation of controversial results, proving that the transition from computational screening to the clinical application requires great caution and careful studies. It is therefore necessary to establish new paradigms for evaluating the efficacy of a potential active molecule.\n\nWe set up a preclinical platform aimed at identifying molecules active against SARS-CoV-2 infection developing a multidisciplinary approach based on very stringent experimental criteria, comprising in-silico studies, in vitro binding tests and infection studies with pseudovirus expressing the spike protein as well as clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains. We focused our attention on doxycycline which has been suggested as potential therapeutic candidate for treating COVID-19 and is currently employed in about twenty clinical trials. Doxycycline resulted effective in inhibiting the transduction of pseudovirus but it did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The results obtained underline the need to define more stringent and controlled pharmacological approaches before wasting precious time and resources with clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between pathogens, host microbiota and the immune system influence many physiological and pathological processes. In the 20th century, widespread dermal vaccination with vaccinia virus (VACV) led to the eradication of smallpox but how VACV interacts with the microbiota and whether this influences the efficacy of vaccination are largely unknown. Here we report that intradermal vaccination with VACV induces a large increase in the number of commensal bacteria in infected tissue, which enhance recruitment of inflammatory cells, promote tissue damage and increase immunity. Treatment of vaccinated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice with antibiotic, or infection of genetically-matched germ-free (GF) animals caused smaller lesions without alteration in virus titre. Tissue damage correlated with enhanced neutrophil and T cell infiltration and levels of pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines and chemokines. One month after vaccination, GF mice had reduced VACV-neutralising antibodies compared to SPF mice; while numbers of VACV-specific CD8+ T cells were equal in all groups of animals. Thus, skin microbiota may provide an adjuvant-like stimulus during vaccination with VACV. This observation has implications for dermal vaccination with live vaccines.\n\nAuthor SummarySmallpox was caused by variola virus and was eradicated by widespread dermal vaccination with vaccinia virus (VACV), a related orthopoxvirus of unknown origin. Eradication was declared in 1980 without an understanding of the immunological correlates of protection, or knowledge of the effect of smallpox vaccination on the local microbiota. Here we demonstrate that intradermal infection of mice with VACV induces a [~]1000-fold expansion of commensal skin bacteria that influence the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the infected tissue and enhance the size of the vaccination lesion. Antibiotic treatment reduced lesion size without changing virus titres. The bacterial expansion also contributes to the level of neutralizing antibodies at one month post vaccination, because genetically matched germ-free mice developed lower neutralizing antibodies than specific pathogen free controls. Thus, dermal infection by VACV enhanced bacterial growth and these bacteria promote pathology and enhance the antibody response. This finding has implication for dermal vaccination with live vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Maternal anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibodies acquired by the fetus through the placenta protect neonates from RSV disease through the first weeks of life. In the cotton rat model of RSV infections, we previously reported that immunization of dams during pregnancy with virus-like particles assembled with mutation stabilized pre-fusion F protein as well as the wild type G protein resulted in robust protection of their offspring from RSV challenge (Blanco, et al Journal of Virology 93: e00914-19, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00914-19). Here we describe the durability of those protective responses in dams, the durability of protection in offspring, and the transfer of that protection to offspring of two consecutive pregnancies without a second boost immunization. We report that four weeks after birth, offspring of the first pregnancy were significantly protected from RSV replication in both lungs and nasal tissues after RSV challenge, but protection was reduced in pups at 6 weeks after birth. However, the overall protection of offspring of the second pregnancy was considerably reduced, even at four weeks of age. This drop in protection occurred even though the levels of total anti-pre-F IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in dams remained at similar, high levels before and after the second pregnancy. The results are consistent with an evolution of antibody properties in dams to populations less efficiently transferred to offspring or the less efficient transfer of antibodies in elderly dams.\n\nAuthor SummaryRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection of infants. Because there is no licensed vaccine for RSV as well as potential safety issues with any new vaccine, protection of infants from RSV is problematic. A possible safe approach for infant protection is the transfer of maternal anti-RSV antibodies, induced by immunization, across the placenta to the fetus serving to protect the newborn for months after birth. In a cotton rat model, we have previously shown that maternal immunization with virus-like particles assembled with the RSV F and G proteins protects offspring from RSV infection. Here we describe protection of offspring, following a single immunization, through two pregnancies showing that offspring of the first were well protected from RSV challenge. However, offspring of the second pregnancy were very weakly protected although the levels of total anti-pre-F antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers in the dams remained at constant and high levels before and after the second pregnancy. This result is consistent with an evolution of antibody properties in the dams to those less efficiently transferred to offspring and highlights the importance of appropriate strategies for maternal immunization, such as immunization during each pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Severe cardiovascular complications can occur in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to a bystander effect: the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) that beat spontaneously. These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin I converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a subset of the proteases that mediate spike protein cleavage in the lungs, but not transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection was productive: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CM, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with typical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread in hiPSC-CM we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm signal from cell to cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that inactivates the furin cleavage site was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in hiPSC-CM and furin activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform provides an opportunity for target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19.\n\nAuthor SummaryIt is unclear whether the cardiac complications frequently observed in COVID-19 patients are due exclusively to systemic inflammation and thrombosis. Viral replication has occasionally been confirmed in cardiac tissue, but rigorous analyses are restricted to rare autopsy materials. Moreover, there are few animal models to study cardiovascular complications of coronavirus infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 spread in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. In these cells, infection is highly productive: viral transcription levels exceed those documented in permissive transformed cell lines. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread we expressed a fluorescent version of its spike protein that allowed to characterize a fusion-based cytopathic effect. A mutant of the spike protein with a single amino acid mutation in the furin cleavage site lost cytopathic function. The spike protein of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus drove cardiomyocyte fusion with slow kinetics, whereas the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and the respiratory coronavirus 229E were inactive. These fusion activities correlated with the level of cardiovascular complications observed in infections with the respective viruses. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to cause cardiac damage by fusing cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "The rhizosphere, the region of soil surrounding roots of plants, is colonized by a unique population of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR). By enhancing nutrient uptake from the soil and through modulation of plant phytohormone status and metabolism, PGPR can increase the stress tolerance, growth and yield of crop plants. Many important PGPR as well as plant pathogens belong to the genus Pseudomonas. There is, however, uncertainty on the divide between phytobeneficial and phytopathogenic strains as previously thought to be signifying genomic features have limited power to separate these strains. Here the Genome properties (GP) common biological pathways annotation system was applied to establish the relationship between the genome wide GP composition and the plant-associated phenotype of 91 Pseudomonas strains representing both phenotypes. GP enrichment analysis, Random Forest model fitting and feature selection revealed 28 discriminating features. A validation dataset of 67 new strains confirmed the importance of the selected features for classification. A number of unexpected discriminating features were found, suggesting involvement of novel molecular mechanisms. The results suggest that GP annotations provide a promising computational tool to better classify the plant-associated phenotype.\n\nAuthor summaryWith a growing population the need to double the agricultural food production is specified. Simultaneously, there is an urgent need to implement sustainable and climate change resilient agricultural practices that preserve natural ecosystems. Cooperative microbiomes play important positive roles in plant growth development and fitness. Properly tuned, these microbiomes can significantly reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and can replace chemicals in crop pest control. To select beneficial candidates, their traits need to be described and likewise, potential detrimental traits should be avoided. Here we applied GP-based comparative functional genomics, enrichment analysis and Random Forest model fitting to compare known phytobeneficial and phytopathogenic Pseudomonas strains. A number of unexpected discriminating features were found suggesting the involvement of novel molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) as well as Phosphorus (P) are key nutrients determining crop productivity. Legumes have developed strategies to overcome nutrient limitation by e.g., forming a symbiotic relationship with N-fixing rhizobia and the release of P-mobilizing exudates and are thus able to grow without supply of N or P fertilizers. The legume-rhizobial symbiosis starts with root release of isoflavonoids, that act as signaling molecules perceived by compatible bacteria. Subsequently, bacteria release nod factors, which induce signaling cascades allowing the formation of functional N-fixing nodules.\n\nWe report here the identification and functional characterization of a plasma membrane-localized MATE-type transporter (LaMATE2) involved in the release of genistein from white lupin roots.\n\nThe LaMATE2 expression in the root is upregulated under N deficiency as well as low phosphate availability, two nutritional deficiencies that induce the release of this isoflavonoid. LaMATE2 silencing reduced genistein efflux and even more the formation of symbiotic nodules, supporting the crucial role of LaMATE2 in isoflavonoid release and nodulation. Furthermore, silencing of LaMATE2 limited the P-solubilization activity of lupin root exudates. Transport assays in yeast vesicles demonstrated that LaMATE2 acts as a proton-driven isoflavonoid transporter.",
