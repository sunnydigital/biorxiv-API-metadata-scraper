    "abstract": "Plant-derived cellulose biomaterials have recently been utilized in several tissue engineering applications. These naturally-derived cellulose scaffolds have been shown to be highly biocompatible in vivo, possess structural features of relevance to several tissues, and support mammalian cell invasion and proliferation. Recent work utilizing decellularized apple hypanthium tissue has shown that it possesses a pore size similar to trabecular bone and can successfully host osteogenic differentiation. In the present study, we further examined the potential of apple-derived cellulose scaffolds for bone tissue engineering (BTE) and analyzed their mechanical properties in vitro and in vivo. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were seeded in cellulose scaffolds. Following chemically-induced osteogenic differentiation, scaffolds were evaluated for mineralization and for their mechanical properties. Alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin Red staining confirmed the osteogenic potential of the scaffolds. Histological analysis of the constructs revealed cell invasion and mineralization throughout the constructs. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of mineral aggregates on the scaffolds after culture in differentiation medium, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the presence of phosphate and calcium. However, although the Youngs modulus significantly increased after cell differentiation, it remained lower than that of healthy bone tissue. Interestingly, mechanical assessment of acellular scaffolds implanted in rat calvaria defects for 8 weeks revealed that the force required to push out the scaffolds from the surrounding bone was similar to that of native calvarial bone. In addition, cell infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition were visible within the implanted scaffolds. Overall, our results confirm that plant-derived cellulose is a promising candidate for BTE applications. However, the discrepancy in mechanical properties between the mineralized scaffolds and healthy bone tissue may limit their use to low load-bearing applications. Further structural re-engineering and optimization to improve the mechanical properties may be required for load-bearing applications.",

    "abstract": "In most arthropods, adult females are larger than males, and male competition is a race to quickly locate and mate with scattered females (scramble competition polygyny). In this context, smaller males may be favored due to more efficient locomotion leading to higher mobility during mate searching while larger males may benefit from increased speed and higher survivorship. Understanding how body size affects different aspects of the locomotor performance of males is therefore essential to shed light on the evolution of this widespread mating system. Using a combination of empirical measures of flight performance and substrate adhesion, and modelling of body aerodynamics, we show that large body size impairs both flight and landing (attachment) performance in male leaf insects (Phyllium philippinicum), a species where relatively small and skinny males fly through the canopy in search of large sedentary females. Smaller males were more agile in the air, ascended more rapidly during flight, and had a lower risk of detaching from the substrates on which they walk and land. Our models revealed variation in body shape affected body lift and drag, but tradeoffs with weight meant that effects were negligible, suggesting that flight costs do not explain the evolution of strong sexual dimorphism in body shape in this species.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/451325v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193d0adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1693bccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d50b53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1da8572_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Lianas, climbing woody plants, influence the structure and function of tropical forests. Climbing traits have evolved multiple times, including ancestral groups such as gymnosperms and pteridophytes, but the genetic basis of the liana strategy is largely unknown. Here, we use a comparative transcriptomic approach for 47 tropical plant species, including ten lianas of diverse taxonomic origins, to identify genes that are consistently expressed or downregulated only in lianas. Our comparative analysis of full-length transcripts enabled the identification of a core interactomic network common to lianas. Sets of transcripts identified from our analysis reveal features related to functional traits pertinent to leaf economics spectrum in lianas, include upregulation of genes controlling epidermal cuticular properties, cell wall remodeling, carbon concentrating mechanism, cell cycle progression, DNA repair and a large suit of downregulated transcription factors and enzymes involved in ABA-mediated stress response as well as lignin and suberin synthesis. All together, these genes are known to be significant in shaping plant morphologies through responses such as gravitropism, phyllotaxy and shade avoidance.",

    "abstract": "Escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge, we developed multivalent protein-based minibinders as potential prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Homotrimers of single minibinders and fusions of three distinct minibinders were designed to geometrically match the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer architecture and were optimized by cell-free expression and found to exhibit virtually no measurable dissociation upon binding. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) showed that these trivalent minibinders engage all three receptor binding domains on a single S trimer. The top candidates neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with IC50 values in the low pM range, resist viral escape, and provide protection in highly vulnerable human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice, both prophylactically and therapeutically. Our integrated workflow promises to accelerate the design of mutationally resilient therapeutics for pandemic preparedness.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe designed, developed, and characterized potent, trivalent miniprotein binders that provide prophylactic and therapeutic protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine addiction remains a major public health concern in the United States that has paralleled the opioid epidemic. Psychostimulant use disorders have a heritable genetic component that remains unexplained. Methamphetamine targets membrane and vesicular transporters to increase synaptic dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. We previously identified Hnrnph1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying methamphetamine behavioral sensitivity. Hnrnph1 encodes the RNA-binding protein hnRNP H1 that is ubiquitously expressed in neurons throughout the brain. Gene-edited mice with a heterozygous frameshift deletion in the first coding exon of Hnrnph1 showed reduced methamphetamine-induced dopamine release and behaviors. To inform the mechanism linking hnRNP H dysfunction with reduced methamphetamine neurobehavioral effects, we surveyed the mRNA targetome of hnRNP H via cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA-sequencing in striatal tissue at baseline and at 30 min post-methamphetamine. Methamphetamine induced opposite changes in RNA-binding targets of hnRNP H in Hnrnph1 mutants versus wild-types, including 3UTR targets in mRNAs enriched for synaptic proteins involved in dopamine release and excitatory synaptic plasticity. Targetome, transcriptome, and spliceome analyses triangulated on a methamphetamine-induced upregulation of the calcium channel subunit transcript Cacna2d2 and decreased its 3UTR usage in hyposensitive Hnrnph1 mutants. Pretreatment with pregabalin, an inhibitor of 2{delta}2 and 2{delta}1 voltage-gated calcium channel subunits attenuated methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity in wild-type females but not in Hnrnph1 mutants, supporting Cacna2d2 as a hnRNP H target. Our study identifies a dynamic hnRNP H RNA targetome that can rapidly and adaptively respond to methamphetamine to regulate gene expression and likely synaptic plasticity and behavior.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe genetic risks mediating psychostimulant addiction are unknown and there are no FDA-approved treatments. We identified Hnrnph1 in modulating methamphetamine behavioral sensitivity in mice. Hnrnph1 codes for hnRNP H1, an RNA-binding protein. Here, we asked whether an Hnrnph1 mutation and methamphetamine treatment would change the hnRNP H RNA targets and whether these targets could tell us how Hnrnph1 is linked to behavior. We identified a calcium channel subunit that is a primary target of the FDA-approved drug pregabalin (a.k.a. Lyrica(R)). Like the Hnrnph1 mutation, pregabalin reduced methamphetamine behaviors in wild-type mice. We propose hnRNP H regulates calcium channels in response to methamphetamine-induced perturbations in neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, pregabalin could represent a novel treatment to restore synaptic function following methamphetamine administration.",

    "abstract": "Placental malaria (PM) is a deadly syndrome most frequent and severe in first pregnancies. PM results from accumulation of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-infected erythrocytes (IE) that express the surface antigen VAR2CSA and bind to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta. Women become PM-resistant over successive pregnancies as they develop anti-adhesion and anti-VAR2CSA antibodies, supporting VAR2CSA as the leading PM-vaccine candidate. However, the first VAR2CSA subunit vaccines failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibody and it is still unclear whether naturally acquired protective antibodies target variant or conserved epitopes. This is crucial to determine whether effective vaccines will require incorporation of many or only a single VAR2CSA allele.\n\nHere, IgG from multigravidae was sequentially purified on five full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain variants, thereby depleting IgG reactivity to each. The five VAR2CSA variants purified [~]0.7% of total IgG and yielded both strain-transcending and strain-specific reactivity to VAR2CSA and IE-surface antigen. IgG purified on the first VAR2CSA antigen displayed broad cross-reactivity to both recombinant and native VAR2CSA variants, and inhibited binding of all isolates to CSA. IgG remaining after depletion on all variants showed significantly reduced binding-inhibition activity compared to initial total IgG.\n\nThese findings demonstrate that a single VAR2CSA ectodomain variant displays neutralizing epitopes shared by multiple parasites, including maternal isolates, and suggest that a broadly effective PM-vaccine can be achieved with a limited number of VAR2CSA variants.",

    "abstract": "Host innate immune response follows severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and it is the driver of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) amongst other inflammatory end-organ morbidities. Such life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is heralded by virus-induced activation of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs; monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells). MPs play substantial roles in aberrant immune secretory activities affecting profound systemic inflammation and end organ malfunctions. All follow an abortive viral infection. To elucidate SARS-CoV-2-MP interactions we investigated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages. While expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, paralleled monocyte-macrophage differentiation it failed to affect productive viral infection. In contrast, simple macrophage viral exposure led to robust pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression but attenuated type I interferon (IFN) activity. Both paralleled dysregulation of innate immune signaling pathways specifically those linked to IFN. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2-infected host mounts a robust innate immune response characterized by a pro-inflammatory storm heralding consequent end-organ tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "Porphyromonas asaccahrolytica and Porphyromonas uenonis are frequently isolated from the human vagina and are linked to bacterial vaginosis and preterm labour. However, little is known about the pathogenesis mechanisms of these bacteria. The related oral opportunistic pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis, is comparatively well-studied and known to secrete numerous extracellular matrix-targeting proteases. Among these are the gingipain family of cysteine proteases that drive periodontal disease progression and hematogenic transmission to the placenta. Given their phylogenetic relatedness, we hypothesized that vaginal Porphyromonas species possess gingipain-like protease activity targeting host extracellular matrix in the female reproductive tract. In this study, we demonstrate that vaginal Porphyromonas species degrade type I collagen (cervix), type IV collagen (chorioamnion/placenta), and fibrinogen, but not through the activity of gingipain orthologs. Bioinformatic queries identified 5 candidate collagenases in each species, including serine, cysteine and metalloproteases, with signal peptides directing them to the extracellular environment. Inhibition assays revealed both species secrete metalloproteases that degrade collagen and casein, while P. asaccharolytica also secretes a metalloprotease that degrades fibrinogen. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted collagen-degrading metalloprotease revealed an orthologous relationship with the P. gingivalis endopeptidase PepO. Cloning and expression of P. asaccharolytica PepO confirmed this proteins collagenase and caseinase activities, which have not previously been attributed to PepO homologs in other bacteria. Altogether, this description of the first known virulence factor in Porphyromonas species colonizing the human vagina sheds light on their potential to alter the structural integrity and homeostasis of reproductive tissues.\n\nImportancePorphyromonas species are common inhabitants of the vaginal microbiome, but their presence has been liked to adverse health outcomes for women, including bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth. We determined that P. asaccharolytica and P. uenonis secrete broad-acting proteases capable of freely diffusing within the cervicovaginal niche and degrading important components of host tissues, namely the extracellular matrix. We show that secreted Porphyromonas proteases degrade collagens that are enriched within the cervix (type I) and chorioamniotic membranes (type IV). Furthermore, these Porphyromonas proteases can also degrade fibrinogen and inhibit clot formation. These activities can be partially attributed to a metalloprotease that exhibits broad-acting protease activity and is distantly related to the P. gingivalis endopeptidase PepO. This initial characterization of virulence activities in vaginal Porphyromonas species highlights their potential to harm human pregnancy through clotting disruption, fetal membrane weakening, and premature cervical remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease is a slowly progressive disease, and its increasing incidence has garnered increased research interests. Cavitary MAC lung disease is associated with a higher mortality rate. Though genetic studies have unraveled the human risk factors, the role of microbial factors on pathogenesis behind the disease remains elusive. In this study, M. avium isolates were collected from sputum specimens of 109 distinct Japanese patients with or without a cavity (60 with a cavity and 49 without cavity) in a hospital located in Osaka prefecture. M. avium genomes were sequenced and searched for DNA motifs associated with cavity formation using a bacterial GWAS. Excluding known macrolide resistance mutations; cavity formation was found to be primarily associated with variants of cytochrome P450 of the CYP139 family, type I polyketide synthase Pks13, and the promoter region of an operon encoding membrane-anchored protease FtsH and folate synthesis pathway enzymes. Cavity risk variants at these three loci were frequent in the MahEastAsia2 lineage among the six lineages detected in M. avium global populations. Furthermore, the study demonstrated a correlation between the cavity risk promoter variant and increased sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistance. Together, these findings suggest that natural variation in the biosynthesis and maintenance processes of M. avium membrane components influences the disease type of MAC lung disease. Although further validation is needed, the bacterial genetic markers listed in the present study could contribute to prognosis prediction based on bacterial genotyping and help develop treatment strategies in the future.\n\nIMPORTANCENontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease is of great concern in countries with an increasingly aging population. The disease types can largely be classified into non-cavitary nodular bronchiectasis and cavitary diseases (fibrocavitary, nodular bronchiectasis with cavity) that require different treatment strategies depending on the causal agents. Several studies have reported human risk factors for the disease; however, little efforts were made to investigate the risk factors in nontuberculous mycobacteria. Moreover, molecular genetics experiments have been difficult to search for virulence factors in M. avium, which the population genomics approaches could overcome. Here, the GWAS results suggested variants in three chromosomal loci associated with mycobacterial membrane components as risk factors for cavitary MAC lung disease. These findings could help develop treatment strategies for MAC lung disease in the future.",

    "abstract": "We conducted preclinical studies in mice using a yeast-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine candidate formulated with aluminum hydroxide (alum) and CpG deoxynucleotides. This formulation is equivalent to the Corbevax vaccine that recently received emergency use authorization by the Drugs Controller General of India. We compared the immune response of mice vaccinated with RBD/alum to mice vaccinated with RBD/alum+CpG. We also evaluated mice immunized with RBD/alum+CpG and boosted with RBD/alum. Mice were immunized twice intramuscularly at a 21-day interval. Compared to two doses of the /alum formulation, the RBD/alum+CpG vaccine induced a stronger and more balanced Th1/Th2 cellular immune response, with high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the original Wuhan isolate of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B. 1.351 (Beta), B. 1.617.2 and (Delta) variants. Neutralizing antibody titers against the B.1.1.529 (BA.1, Omicron) variant exceeded those in human convalescent plasma after Wuhan infection but were lower than against the other variants. Interestingly, the second dose did not benefit from the addition of CpG, possibly allowing dose-sparing of the adjuvant in the future. The data reported here reinforces that the RBD/alum+CpG vaccine formulation is suitable for inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern.",

    "abstract": "Microchromosomes, once considered unimportant shreds of the chicken genome, are gene rich elements with a high GC content and few transposable elements. Their origin has been debated for decades. We used cytological and whole genome sequence comparisons, and chromosome conformation capture, to trace their origin and fate in genomes of reptiles, birds and mammals. We find that microchromosomes as well as macrochromosomes are highly conserved across birds, and share synteny with single small chromosomes of the chordate amphioxus, attesting to their origin as elements of an ancient animal genome. Turtles and squamates (snakes and lizards) share different subsets of ancestral microchromosomes, having independently lost microchromosomes by fusion with other microchromosomes or macrochromosomes. Patterns of fusions were quite different in different lineages.\n\nCytological observations show that microchromosomes in all lineages are spatially separated into a central compartment at interphase and during mitosis and meiosis. This reflects higher interaction between microchromosomes than with macrochromosomes, as observed by chromosome conformation capture, and suggests some functional coherence. In highly rearranged genomes fused microchromosomes retain most ancestral characteristics, but these may erode over evolutionary time; surprisingly de novo microchromosomes have rapidly adopted high interaction.\n\nSome chromosomes of early branching monotreme mammals align to several bird microchromosomes, suggesting multiple microchromosome fusions in a mammalian ancestor. Subsequently multiple rearrangements fueled the extraordinary karyotypic diversity of therian mammals.\n\nThus microchromosomes, far from being aberrant genetic elements, represent fundamental building blocks of amniote chromosomes, and it is mammals, rather than reptiles, that are atypical.\n\nSignificance StatementGenomes of birds and reptiles, but not mammals, consist of a few large chromosomes and many tiny microchromosomes. Once considered unimportant shreds of the genome, microchromosomes are gene rich and highly conserved among bird and reptiles, and share homology with one or more of the tiny chromosomes of an invertebrate that diverged from the vertebrate lineage 684 million years ago. Microchromosomes interact strongly and crowd together at the centre of cells, suggesting functional coherence. Many microchromosomes have been lost independently in turtles, snakes and lizards as they have fused with each other, or with larger chromosomes. In mammals they have completely disappeared, yet some chromosomes of the basal platypus line up with several microchromosomes, suggesting that they are the building blocks of the atypically variable chromosomes of mammals.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) is essential for liver structure and function. However, the current understanding of liver NPCs, especially in different liver diseases, remains incompletely elucidated. Here, a single-cell transcriptome atlas of 171,814 NPCs from healthy and 5 typical liver disease mouse models, including alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), drug-induced liver injury, cholestatic, and ischemia-reperfusion liver injury is constructed. The inter- and intra-group heterogeneity of 12 types (and numerous subtypes) of NPCs involving endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), neutrophils, T cells, and mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) are summarized. A protective subtype of neutrophils characterized by Chil3high is validated and found significantly increasing only in drug-induced and cholestatic liver injury models. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis reveals disease-specific transcriptional reprogramming. Metabolic activity analysis indicates that fibrosis is accompanied by increases in glycolysis and retinol metabolism in activated HSCs and MPs. Moreover, we found that cell-cell interactions between cholangiocytes and immune cells contribute more to cholestatic liver fibrosis compared with NASH, while HSCs are more important for NASH fibrosis. Our atlas, together with an interactive website provides a systematic view of highly heterogeneous NPCs and a valuable resource to better understand pathological mechanisms underlying liver diseases.",

Through single-molecule visualization of DNA replication by the Escherichia coli replisome, we demonstrate that the DnaB helicase does not rely on hydrolysis of ATP (or any ribo-NTPs) in the context of the elongating replisome.

We show that our approach has better reproducibility, higher dynamic range, and lower background than previous single-molecule pull-down assays. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by monitoring cellular protein complexes over time after cell lysis, we can measure the dissociation rate constant of a cellular protein complex, providing information about binding affinity and kinetics.

As the list of PARP1/2:HPF1 substrates continues to expand, there is a need for technologies to prepare mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins for biochemical interrogation. Here we investigate the unique peptide ADPr activities catalyzed by PARP1 in the absence and presence of HPF1. We then exploit these activities to develop a method that facilitates installation of ADP-ribose polymers onto full-length proteins with precise control over chain length and modification site. A series of semi-synthetic ADP-ribosylated histone proteins are prepared which demonstrate that ADPr at H2BS6 or H3S10 converts nucleosomes into robust substrates for the chromatin remodeler ALC1. Importantly, we found ALC1 selectively remodels  activated substrates within heterogeneous nucleosome populations and that nucleosome serine ADPr is sufficient to stimulate ALC1 activity in nuclear extracts. Our study identifies a biochemical function for nucleosome serine ADPr and describes a method that is broadly applicable to explore the impact that site-specific serine mono- and poly-ADPr have on protein function.",

    "abstract": "Implanted bioelectronic devices have the potential to treat disorders that are resistant to traditional pharmacological therapies; however, reaching many therapeutic nerve targets requires invasive surgeries and implantation of centimeter-sized devices. Here we show that it is possible to stimulate peripheral nerves from within blood vessels using a millimeter-sized wireless implant. By directing the stimulating leads through the blood vessels we can target specific nerves that are difficult to reach with traditional surgeries. Furthermore, we demonstrate this endovascular nerve stimulation (EVNS) with a millimeter sized wireless stimulator that can be delivered minimally invasively through a percutaneous catheter which would significantly lower the barrier to entry for neuromodulatory treatment approaches because of the reduced risk. This miniaturization is achieved by using magnetoelectric materials to efficiently deliver data and power through tissue to a digitally-programmable 0.8 mm2 CMOS system-on-a-chip. As a proof-of-principle we show wireless stimulation of peripheral nerve targets both directly and from within the blood vessels in rodent and porcine models. The wireless EVNS concept described here provides a path toward minimally invasive bioelectronics where mm-sized implants combined with endovascular stimulation enable access to a number of nerve targets without open surgery or implantation of battery-powered pulse generators.",

    "abstract": "Since December 2019, the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been widely spread all over the world. It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects a series of human tissues, including lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, etc. ACE2 has been identified as the primary receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. The relatively low expression level of this known receptor in the lungs, which is the predominantly infected organ in COVID-19, indicates that there may be some other co-receptors or alternative receptors of SARS-CoV-2 to work in coordination with ACE2. Here, we identified twenty-one candidate receptors of SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2-interactor proteins and SARS-CoV receptors. Then we investigated the protein expression levels of these twenty-one candidate receptors in different human tissues and found that five of which CAT, MME, L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, and AGTR2 were specifically expressed in SARS-CoV-2 affected tissues. Next, we performed molecular simulations of the above five candidate receptors with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and found that the binding affinities of CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN to S protein were even higher than ACE2. Interestingly, we also observed that CAT and AGTR2 bound to S protein in different regions with ACE2 conformationally, suggesting that these two proteins are likely capable of the co-receptors of ACE2. Conclusively, we considered that CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were the potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, AGTR2 and DC-SIGN tend to be highly expressed in the lungs of smokers, which is consistent with clinical phenomena of COVID-19, and further confirmed our conclusion. Besides, we also predicted the binding hot spots for these putative protein-protein interactions, which would help develop drugs against SARS-CoV-2.",

Peptide transporter 2 (PepT2) allows in addition renal drug reabsorption from ultrafiltration and brain-to-blood efflux of neurotoxic compounds. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human PepT1 in an outward open state and of human PepT2 in an inward facing partially occluded state with a bound substrate. The structures reveal the architecture of human peptide transporters and provide mechanistic insights into substrate recognition and conformational transitions during transport.

The current study revealed that the expression of ALKBH5 were increased in NSCLC and increased expression of ALKBH5 worsened the prognosis of patients with NSCLC. In vitro study revealed that ALKBH5 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation ability of PC9 and A549 cells as well as promoted G1 arrest and increased the number of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, ALKBH5 overexpression increased the cell proliferation ability of the immortalized cell lines. Microarray analysis and western blotting revealed that the expression of CDKN1A or TIMP3 were increased by ALKBH5 knockdown. These alterations were offset by a double knockdown of both ALKBH5 and one of the IGF2BPs. The decline of mRNAs was, at least partly, owing to the destabilization of these mRNAs by one of the IGF2BPs. In conclusions, the ALKBH5-IGF2BPs axis promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, which in turn causes the unfavorable prognosis of NSCLC.",

This complex microenvironment harboring infiltrating glioma and non-neoplastic brain cells is the origin of tumor recurrence. Thus, understanding the cellular and molecular features of the glioma microenvironment is therapeutically and prognostically important. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to determine the cellular composition and transcriptional states in primary and recurrent glioma and identified three compositional  tissue-states defined by the observed patterns of cohabitation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic brain cells. These comprise states enriched in A) neurons and non-neoplastic glia, B) reactive astrocytes and inflammatory cells, and C) proliferating tumor cells. The tissue states also showed distinct associations with the different transcriptional states of GBM cells. Spatial transcriptomics revealed that the cell-types/transcriptional-states associated with each tissue state colocalize in space. Tissue states are clinically significant because they correlate with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features. Importantly, we found that our compositionally-defined tissue states are enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. One such pathway is fatty acid biosynthesis, which was enriched in tissue state B - a state enriched in recurrent glioblastoma and associated with shorter overall survival- and composed of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes, and monocyte-like myeloid cells. We showed that treating acute slices of GBM with a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor is sufficient to deplete the transcriptional signature of tissue state B. Our findings define a novel compositional approach to analyze glioma-infiltrated tissue which allows us to discover prognostic and targetable features, paving the way to new mechanistic and therapeutic discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Current animal-free methods to assess teratogenicity of drugs under development still deliver high numbers of false negatives, and more sensitive approaches of toxicity prediction are required. To address this issue, we characterized the TeraTox test, a newly developed multi-lineage differentiation assay for human teratogenicity prediction using 3D human induced pluripotent stem cells. TeraTox produces as primary output concentration-dependent data sets for each test compound on cytotoxicity and altered gene expression. These data are then fed into a prediction model based on an interpretable machine-learning approach. The final information obtained relates to the concentration-dependent human teratogenicity potential of drug candidates. We applied TeraTox to profile 33 approved pharmaceuticals and 12 proprietary drug candidates with known in vivo data. This way, it was possible to relate the test predictions to known human or animal toxicity. The TeraTox had an accuracy of 69% (specificity: 53%, sensitivity: 79%). It clearly performed better than two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and it had a higher sensitivity than the murine embryonic stem cell test (mEST) run in the same laboratory. By combining TeraTox and mEST data, the overall prediction accuracy was further improved. The knowledge on the pattern of altered gene expression may provide additional value in grouping toxicologically similar compounds and possibly deducing common modes of action. The assay will thus be a helpful additional tool in drug discovery, and the dataset provided here will be a valuable resource for the field of stem cell-based drug profiling.",

Many 4CL homologs have broad substrate permissiveness in vitro and have no clear cut function. However, it has been demonstrated unequivocally that a peroxisomal 4CL-like homolog from Arabidopsis efficiently uses p-coumarate for ubiquinone biosynthesis. Another homolog has been shown to act as a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and yet another as OPDA-CoA ligase. Hence, despite this knowledge, most homologs remain annotated as \"4CL-like\" whereas other researches study the ACS protein family.\n\nResultsWe set out identify the specific functions of 4CL/ ACS homologs, specifically in order to study the 4CL family in Solanum tuberosum. An in depth phylogenetic analysis was done. Using clustering techniques, functional annotation and taxonomic signals, three major clades were depicted. Clade 1 is composed of class I from monocotyledons, class I from dicotyledons and class II canonical 4CL enzymes subclades. Specificity determining positions and 3D structure analysis shows that clade 2 cytosolic 4CL-like enzymes show a rather different binding cleft and presumably use medium- to long-chain fatty acids. Clade 3 is composed of five subclades, four of which have a broad taxonomic contribution and a similar binding cleft as 4CLs whereas a fifth, specific for dicotyledons shows a significantly different binding pocket. The potato 4CL family comprises four class I (St4CL-I(A-D)) and one class II (St4CL-II) members. Transcript levels of St4CLs and of marker genes of the flavonoid (chalcone synthase, CHS) and suberin (feruloyl-CoA transferase, FHT) pathways were determined by qRT-PCR in flesh and skin from Andean varieties. St4CL-IA was barely detected in the skin of some varieties whereas St4CL-IB did not show a clear pattern. St4CL-IC and St4CL-ID could not be detected. St4CL-II expression pattern was similar to CHS. St4CL-IA and St4CL-IB were induced by wounding as did FHT whereas St4CL-II and CHS expression was repressed. Constitutive and wound-induced expression suggests that St4CL-IA and St4CL-IB isoforms are likely involved in soluble and/ or suberin-bound phenolic compounds while St4CL-II appears to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis.",

Intra-Hox transcription factor binding and distal enhancer elements have emerged as the major regulatory modes controlling Hox gene expression. However, quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive. Here, we introduce  synthetic regulatory reconstitution, a novel conceptual framework for studying gene regulation and apply it to the HoxA cluster. We synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130-170 kilobases each) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We find that a HoxA cluster lacking distal enhancers recapitulates correct patterns of chromatin remodeling and transcription in response to patterning signals, while distal enhancers are required for full transcriptional output. Synthetic regulatory reconstitution is a generalizable strategy to decipher the regulatory logic of gene expression in complex genomes.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryReconstitution of gene regulation using large DNA constructs unravels the regulatory logic of a developmental gene locus.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic debilitating disease of the CNS. The relapsing remitting form of the disease is driven by CNS directed inflammation. However, in the progressive forms of the disease, inflammation has abated and the underlying pathology is less well understood. In this paper, we show that chronic lesions in progressive MS are associated with fibrotic changes, a type of pathology that has previously not thought to occur in the CNS. In an animal model of chronic MS, late stage disease contains no inflammatory infiltrates and is instead characterized by collagen deposition that is histologically similar to fibrosis. In human MS samples, chronic, but not acute lesions, are devoid of inflammatory infiltrates and instead contain significant collagen deposition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both mouse and human astrocytes are the cellular source of collagen. These results suggest that anti-fibrotic therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of progressive MS.",

    "abstract": "The medial habenula (mHb) is an understudied small brain nucleus linking forebrain and midbrain structures controlling anxiety and fear behaviors. The mechanisms that maintain the structural and functional integrity of mHb neurons and their synapses remain unknown. Using spatio-temporally controlled Cre-mediated recombination in adult mice, we found that the GDNF receptor alpha 1 (GFR1) is required in adult mHb neurons for synaptic stability and function. mHb neurons express some of the highest levels of GFR1 in the mouse brain, and acute ablation of GFR1 results in loss of septo-habenular and habenulo-interpeduncular glutamatergic synapses, with the remaining synapses displaying reduced numbers of presynaptic vesicles. Chemo- and opto-genetic studies in mice lacking GFR1 revealed impaired circuit connectivity, reduced AMPA receptor postsynaptic currents, and abnormally low rectification index of AMPARs, suggesting reduced Ca2+-permeability. Further biochemical and proximity ligation assay studies defined the presence of GluA1/GluA2 (Ca2+-impermeable) as well as GluA1/GluA4 (Ca2+-permeable) AMPAR complexes in mHb neurons, as well as clear differences in the levels and association of AMPAR subunits in mHb neurons lacking GFR1. Finally, acute loss of GFR1 in adult mHb neurons reduced anxiety-like behavior and potentiated context-based fear responses, phenocopying the effects of lesions to septal projections to the mHb. These results uncover an unexpected function for GFR1 in the maintenance and function of adult glutamatergic synapses, and reveal a potential new mechanism for regulating synaptic plasticity in the septo-habenulo-interpeduncular pathway and attuning of anxiety and fear behaviors.",

Gain of function mutations in the MEFV gene encoding Pyrin cause auto-inflammatory disorders, such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and Pyrin associated auto-inflammation with Neutrophilic Dermatosis (PAAND). To precisely define the role of Pyrin in detecting pathogen virulence factors in relevant human immune cells, we investigated how the Pyrin inflammasome response was initiated and regulated in monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) compared to human monocytes. Unlike monocytes and murine macrophages, we determined that hMDM failed to activate Pyrin in response to known Pyrin activators Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) toxins A or B (TcdA or TcdB). In contrast, TcdB activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in hMDM. Notably, we ascertained that the Pyrin inflammasome response could be re-enabled in hMDM by prolonged priming with either LPS or type I or II interferons, and required an increase in Pyrin expression. These data demonstrate an unexpected redundancy in detecting these toxins by inflammasome sensors.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of chromatin accessibility determines the transcription activities of genes, which endow the host with function-specific gene expression patterns. It remains unclear how chromatin accessibility is specifically directed, particularly, during host defense against viral infection. We previously reported that the nuclear matrix protein SAFA surveils viral RNA and regulates antiviral immune genes expression. However, how SAFA regulates the expression and what determines the specificity of antiviral immune genes remains unknown. Here, we identified that the depletion of SAFA specifically decreased the chromatin accessibility, activation and expression of virus induced genes in a genome-wide scale after VSV infection. SAFA exclusively bound with antiviral related RNAs, which mediated the specific opening of the according chromatin and robust transcription of these genes. Knockdown of these associated RNAs dampened the accessibility of corresponding genes in an extranuclear signaling pathway dependent manner. Moreover, VSV infection cleaved SAFA protein at the C-terminus which deprived its RNA binding ability for immune evasion. Thus, our results demonstrated that SAFA and the interacting RNA products during viral infection collaborate and remodel chromatin accessibility to facilitate antiviral innate immune response.",

While UPF3B has been demonstrated to support NMD, contradicting reports describe UPF3A either as an NMD activator or inhibitor. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of UPF3A and UPF3B in human cells using combinatory experimental approaches. Overexpression or knockout of UPF3A as well as knockout of UPF3B did not detectably change global NMD activity. In contrast, the co-depletion of UPF3A and UPF3B resulted in a marked NMD inhibition and a transcriptome-wide upregulation of NMD substrates, demonstrating a functional redundancy between both NMD factors. Although current models assume that UPF3 bridges NMD-activating exon-junction complexes (EJC) to the NMD factor UPF2, UPF3B exhibited only slightly impaired NMD activity in rescue experiments when UPF2 or EJC binding was impaired. Further rescue experiments revealed partially redundant functions of UPF3B domains in supporting NMD, involving both UPF2 and EJC interaction sites and the central region of UPF3. Collectively, UPF3A and UPF3B serve as fault-tolerant NMD activators in human cells.",

They excise from a precursor protein, generating a functional protein via covalent bonding of flanking exteins. We report the kinetic study of splicing and cleavage reaction in [Fe-S] cluster assembly protein SufB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although it follows a canonical intein splicing pathway, distinct features are added by extein residues present in the active site. Sequence analysis identified two conserved histidines in the N-extein region; His-5 and His-38. Kinetic analyses of His-5Ala and His-38Ala SufB mutants exhibited significant reductions in splicing and cleavage rates relative to the SufB wild-type precursor protein. Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Mtu SufB displays a unique mechanism where two remote histidines work concurrently to facilitate N-terminal cleavage reaction. His-38 is stabilized by the solvent-exposed His-5, and can impact N-S acyl shift by direct interaction with the catalytic Cys1. Development of inteins as biotechnological tools or as pathogen specific novel antimicrobial targets requires a more complete understanding of such unexpected roles of conserved extein residues in protein splicing.",

Rates of karyotype evolution were estimated using the diploid number and the number of chromosome arms (fundamental number) from published karyotypes of Orthoptera. Rates of speciation were quantified considering the number of species examined karyotypically in each family, the most recent common ancestor of each family and the information about extinction rate. The rate of speciation was strongly correlated with rate of karyotype evolution and the average rates of speciation was nearly ~177 times higher than the background rate estimated for Orthoptera based on acoustic communication using phylogenomic data, as well as 8.4 and 35.6 times higher than the estimated speciation rate in vertebrates and bivalve mollusks respectively, indicating that Orthoptera has evolved very fast at chromosomal level. The findings supported the hypothesis of a high speciation rate in lineages with high rate of chromosomal evolution but there were not evidences that younger groups tended to have higher rate of karyotypic diversity. Furthermore, rates of karyotype evolution most closely fitted the punctuational evolutionary model indicating the existence of long periods of stasis of karyotype change with most karyotype change occurring quickly over short evolutionary times. I discussed genetic drift, divergent selection and meiotic drive as potential biological mechanisms to explain karyotype evolution allowing or impeding for the fixation of chromosomal rearrangements and in turn speciation in orthopterans lineages.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas that display complex molecular and genetic alterations. Powerful tumor suppressors CDKN2A and TP53 are commonly disrupted in these lesions along with NF1, a gene that encodes a negative regulator of Ras. Many additional factors have been implicated in MPNST pathogenesis. A greater understanding of critical drivers of the disease is needed to guide more informed targeted therapies for patients. RABL6A is a newly identified driver of MPNST cell survival and proliferation whose in vivo role in the disease is unknown.\n\nMethodsUsing CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of Nf1+Cdkn2a or Nf1+Tp53 in the sciatic nerve to form de novo MPNSTs, we investigated the biological significance of RABL6A in MPNST development. Molecular evaluation of terminal tumors (western blot, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry) yielded several insights.\n\nResultsMice lacking Rabl6 displayed slower tumor growth and extended survival relative to wildtype animals in both genetic contexts. YAP oncogenic activity was selectively downregulated in RABL6A-null, Nf1+Cdkn2a lesions but not in RABL6A-null, Nf1+Tp53 tumors. Regardless of genetic context, loss of RABL6A caused upregulation of the CDK inhibitor, p27 in tumors. Paradoxically, both models displayed elevated Myc protein expression and Ki67 staining in terminal tumors lacking RABL6A.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate RABL6A is required for optimal tumor progression of NF1 mutant MPNSTs in vivo in both Cdkn2a and p53 inactivated settings. However, sustained RABL6A loss may provide selective pressure for molecular alterations, such as Myc upregulation, that ultimately promote an unwanted, hyper-proliferative tumor phenotype akin to drug resistant lesions.\n\nImportance of the StudyMPNSTs are aggressive, deadly, and challenging to treat tumors due to location around nerves and high mutational burden. Many factors implicated in MPNST genesis have yet to be fully tested for biological significance in disease formation. We establish a critical physiological role for a new oncoprotein, RABL6A, in promoting NF1-associated MPNST progression. We identify novel RABL6A-regulated pathways that likely contribute to tumor growth, specifically YAP and Myc signaling, and found that sustained RABL6A loss eventually yields more proliferative tumors. We liken RABL6A deficient tumors to those being treated with therapies targeting RABL6A effectors, such as CDKs. Therefore, those lesions should provide a powerful platform to uncover key mediators of drug resistance. Our data suggest oncogenic YAP and Myc could be such mediators of resistance. This study provides a novel system to examine one of the most pressing clinical challenges, drug resistant tumor growth and relapse, in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer death in children with an urgent need for innovative therapies. Here we show that the cell surface oncoprotein glypican 2 (GPC2) is highly expressed on multiple lethal pediatric brain tumors, including medulloblastomas, embryonal tumors with multi-layered rosettes, other CNS embryonal tumors, as well as definable subsets of highly malignant gliomas. To target GPC2 on these pediatric brain tumors with adoptive cellular therapies and mitigate potential inflammatory neurotoxicity, we developed four mRNA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell constructs using the highly GPC2-specific fully human D3 single chain variable fragment. First, we validated and prioritized these CARs using in vitro cytotoxicity and T cell degranulation assays with GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma cells. Next, we expanded the testing of the two most potent GPC2-directed CAR constructs prioritized from these studies to GPC2-expressing medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma cell lines, showing significant GPC2-specific cell death in multiple models. Finally, locoregional delivery bi-weekly of two to four million GPC2-directed mRNA CAR T cells induced significant and sustained tumor regression in two orthotopic medulloblastoma models, and significantly prolonged survival in an aggressive orthotopic thalamic diffuse midline glioma model. No GPC2-directed CAR T cell related neurologic or systemic toxicity was observed. Taken together, these data show that GPC2 is a highly differentially expressed cell surface protein on multiple malignant pediatric brain tumors that can be targeted safely with local delivery of mRNA CAR T cells.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryGlypican 2 is expressed on the surface of multiple pediatric brain tumors and can be successfully targeted with mRNA chimeric antigen receptor T cells.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two devastating and fatal neurodegenerative conditions. While distinct, they share many clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics1, and both show selective vulnerability of layer 5b extratelencephalic-projecting cortical populations, including Betz cells in ALS2,3 and von Economo neurons (VENs) in FTLD4,5. Here, we report the first high resolution single-cell atlas of the human primary motor cortex (MCX) and its transcriptional alterations in ALS and FTLD across ~380,000 nuclei from 64 individuals, including 17 control samples and 47 sporadic and C9orf72-associated ALS and FTLD patient samples. We identify 46 transcriptionally distinct cellular subtypes including two Betz-cell subtypes, and we observe a previously unappreciated molecular similarity between Betz cells and VENs of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and frontal insula. Many of the dysregulated genes and pathways are shared across excitatory neurons, including stress response, ribosome function, oxidative phosphorylation, synaptic vesicle cycle, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and autophagy. Betz cells and SCN4B+ long-range projecting L3/L5 cells are the most transcriptionally affected in both ALS and FTLD. Lastly, we find that the VEN/Betz cell-enriched transcription factor, POU3F1, has altered subcellular localization, co-localizes with TDP-43 aggregates, and may represent a cell type-specific vulnerability factor in the Betz cells of ALS and FTLD patient tissues.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) infectious cycle starts with the viral adsorption and entry into the host cell. The virus is internalized via clathrin/dynamin mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. As several other viruses, ASF virion is then internalized and incorporated into the endocytic pathway. Endosomal maturation entails luminal acidification and the lowering of pH acting on the multi-layered virion structure dissolves the outer capsid. Upon decapsidation, the inner viral membrane is exposed to interact with the limiting membrane of the late endosome for fusion. Egress from endosome is related to cholesterol efflux, but it remains an intriguing process albeit essential for infection, specifically for the viral nucleic acid exit to the cytoplasm for replication. ASFV proteins E248R and E199L, with structural homology to the VACV proteins of the fusion complex, seem to have similar functions in ASFV. A direct interaction between these ASFV proteins with the cholesterol transporter protein NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C type 1) was observed, which was also shared by the E248R homologous protein L1R of VACV. Binding occurs between the transmembrane domain of E248R with the loop C of NPC1 at the same domain than EBOV binding site. These interactions suggest that these ASFV proteins are crucial for membrane fusion. CRISPR NPC1 KO Vero cells lacking NPC1 protein that were resistant to EBOV, reduced ASFV infection levels significantly. Reductions on ASFV infectivity and replication in NPC1 KO cells were accompanied by lesser viral factories of smaller size and lacking the typical cohesive morphology between endosomes and viral proteins. We observed a compensatory effect in NPC1 KO cells, elevating NPC2 levels while silencing NPC2 in Vero cells with shRNA, also reduced ASFV infection. Our findings pave the way to understand the role of these proteins at the membrane viral fusion step for several viruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryAfrican swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a deadly disease of pigs and wild boars that was endemic in Africa but have extended over the last years to Europe, Asia and Oceania with high socioeconomic impact. ASFV enters the cell by endocytosis and has adapted to the endosomal conditions to acquire infectivity. Viral infectivity is dependent on cholesterol traffic at the endosomes, especially at the fusion step. Fusion of the internal viral membrane with the endosomal membrane is required for the exit of the viral DNA to the cytoplasm to start replication. ASF virion internal membrane proteins E248R and E199L were found to bind the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) receptor at the endosome. These proteins are highly conserved among ASFV isolates and resemble proteins of the VACV entry/fusion complex. The function of NPC1 is to regulate the efflux of dietary cholesterol efflux from the endosome to the endoplasmic reticulum, which appears to be necessary for viral fusion. NPC1 knockout cells by CRISPR reduced infection affecting infectivity and early replication. Also, removing the associated endosomal protein NPC2, further declined infectivity. These results show the relevance of NPC1 receptor in the viral infection actually shared by unrelated important viral families.",
