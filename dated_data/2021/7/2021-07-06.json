    "abstract": "Calcium dynamics into astrocytes influence the activity of nearby neuronal structures. However, because previous reports show that astrocytic calcium signals largely mirror neighboring neuronal activity, current information coding models neglect astrocytes. Using simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual environment, we demonstrate that astrocytic calcium signals actively encode spatial information. Calcium events carrying spatial information occurred in topographically organized astrocytic subregions. Importantly, astrocytes encoded spatial information that was complementary and synergistic to that carried by neurons, improving spatial position decoding when astrocytic signals were considered alongside neuronal ones. These results suggest that the complementary place-dependence of localized astrocytic calcium signals regulates clusters of nearby synapses, enabling dynamic, context-dependent, variations in population coding within brain circuits.",

    "abstract": "Multidimensional MRI is an emerging approach that simultaneously encodes water relaxation (T1 and T2) and mobility (diffusion) and replaces voxel-averaged values with subvoxel distributions of those MR properties. While conventional (i.e., voxel-averaged) MRI methods cannot adequately quantify the microscopic heterogeneity of biological tissue, using subvoxel information allows to selectively map a specific T1-T2-diffusion spectral range that corresponds to a group of tissue elements. The major obstacle to the adoption of rich, multidimensional MRI protocols for diagnostic or monitoring purposes is the prolonged scan time. Our main goal in the present study is to evaluate the performance of a nonlocal estimation of multispectral magnitudes (NESMA) filter on reduced datasets to limit the total acquisition time required for reliable multidimensional MRI characterization of the brain. Here we focused and reprocessed results from a recent study that identified potential imaging biomarkers of axonal injury pathology from the joint analysis of multidimensional MRI, in particular voxelwise T1-T2 and diffusion-T2 spectra in human Corpus Callosum, and histopathological data. We tested the performance of NESMA and its effect on the accuracy of the injury biomarker maps, relative to the co-registered histological reference. Noise reduction improved the accuracy of the resulting injury biomarker maps, while permitting data reduction of 35.7% and 59.6% from the full dataset for T1-T2 and diffusion-T2 cases, respectively. As successful clinical proof-of-concept applications of multidimensional MRI are continuously being introduced, reliable and robust noise removal and consequent acquisition acceleration would advance the field towards clinically-feasible diagnostic multidimensional MRI protocols.",

    "abstract": "The skin-associated microbiome plays an important role in general well-being and in a variety of treatable conditions. In this regard, endogenous antimicrobial peptides have a role in controlling the microbial population. We demonstrate here that certain small molecular species can amplify the potency of naturally-occurring antimicrobial peptides. For example, Niacinamide is a vitamin B3 analogue naturally found in foods and widely used in topical skin care products, and here we have investigated its cooperativity with the human antimicrobial peptide LL37 on the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. We have also studied two other structurally related B3 analogs. We observed a clear synergistic effect of niacinamide and, to some extent, methyl niacinamide, whereas isonicotinamide showed no significant cooperativity with LL37. Adaptively-biased molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the analogs partition into the head group region of an anionic bilayer used to mimic the bacterial membrane. The observed effects on the physical properties of the membrane are well correlated with experimental activity. In contrast, the analogs have little effect on zwitterionic bilayers which mimic a mammalian membrane. We conclude that these vitamin B3 analogues can potentiate the activity of host peptides by modulating the physical properties of the bacterial membrane, and to a lesser extent through direct interactions with the peptide. The level of cooperativity is strongly dependent on the detailed chemistry of the additive, suggesting an opportunity to fine-tune the behaviour of host peptides.",

However, DNA-based methods are seldom used to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of species range shifts. This is important when managing range-shifting species such as non-native species (NNS), which can have negative impacts on biotic communities. Here we investigated the range-shifting NNS Ciona robusta, Clavelina lepadiformis, Microcosmus squamiger and Styela plicata using a combined methodological approach. We first conducted non-molecular biodiversity surveys for these NSS along the South African coastline, and compared the results with historical surveys. We detected no consistent change in range size across species, with some displaying range stability and others showing range shifts. We then sequenced a section of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) from tissue samples and found genetic differences along the coastline but no change over recent times. Finally, we found that environmental DNA metabarcoding data showed broad congruence with both the non-molecular biodiversity and the COI datasets, but failed to capture complete incidence of all NSS. Overall, we demonstrated how a combined methodological approach can effectively detect spatial and temporal variation in genetic composition and range size, which is key for managing biodiversity changes of both threatened and NSS.",

We investigated the genetic architecture of cumulative flowering, a fitness component, in second-generation hybrids between Silene dioica and S. latifolia transplanted into the natural habitat of each species.\nC_LIO_LIWe used reduced-representation sequencing and Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models (BSLMMs) to analyze the genetic control of cumulative flowering in each habitat.\nC_LIO_LIOur results point to a polygenic architecture of cumulative flowering. Allelic effects were mostly beneficial or deleterious in one habitat and neutral in the other. The direction of allelic effects was associated with allele frequency differences between the species: positive-effect alleles were often derived from the native species, whereas negative-effect alleles, at other loci, tended to originate from the non-native species.\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that ecological differentiation is governed and maintained by many loci with small, conditionally neutral effects. Conditional neutrality may result from differences in selection targets in the two habitats and provides hidden variation upon which selection can act. Polygenic architectures of adaptive differentiation are expected to be transient during lineage divergence and may therefore be unrelated to high genetic differentiation at the underlying loci.\nC_LI",

Mammals have two CCAR family members, CCAR1 and CCAR2/DBC1, that evolved from the founding family member CCAR-1 that is expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mammalian CCAR2, the most well-studied family member, has been shown to regulate genes involved in metabolism in cultured cells. However, the regulation of gene expression by CCAR family members at an organismal level is unknown. Here, we use whole transcriptome RNA sequencing to examine the effects of CCAR-1 on gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that CCAR-1 regulates germline transcription, reproduction, lifespan, and DNA-damage induced apoptosis. This study shows the role of CCAR-1 in vital physiological functions in the C. elegans germline that have not been investigated before.",

    "abstract": "Biological wastewater treatment and an increased focus on resource recovery is fundamental for environmental protection, human health, and sustainable development. Microbial communities are responsible for these processes, but our knowledge of their diversity and function is still poor, partly due to the lack of good reference databases and comprehensive global studies. Here, we sequenced more than 5 million high-quality, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences from 740 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across the world and used the sequences to construct MiDAS 4, a full-length amplicon sequence variant resolved 16S rRNA gene reference database with a comprehensive taxonomy from the domain to species-level for all references. Using a study-independent amplicon dataset from the Global Water Microbiome Consortium project (269 WWTPs), we showed that the MiDAS 4 database provides much better coverage for bacteria in WWTPs worldwide compared to commonly applied universal references databases, and greatly improved the rate of genus and species-level classification. Hence, MiDAS 4 provides a unifying taxonomy for the majority of prokaryotic diversity in WWTPs globally, which can be used for linking microbial identities with their functions across studies. Taking advantage of MiDAS 4, we carried out an amplicon-based, global-scale microbial community profiling of activated sludge plants using two common sets of primers targeting the V1-V3 and V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that the V1-V3 primers were generally best suited for this ecosystem, and revealed how environmental conditions and biogeography shape the activated sludge microbiota. We also identified process-critical taxa (core and conditionally rare or abundant taxa), encompassing 966 genera and 1530 species. These represented approximately 80% and 50% of the accumulated read abundance, respectively, and represent targets for further investigations. Finally, we showed that for well-studied functional guilds, such as nitrifiers or polyphosphate accumulating organisms, the same genera were prevalent worldwide, with only a few abundant species in each genus.",

    "abstract": "A biofilm inhibiting mechanism operates in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. Here, we demonstrate that the glycosyltransferase homolog, Ogt, participates in the inhibitory process - inactivation of ogt results in robust biofilm formation. Furthermore, a mutational approach shows requirement of the glycosyltransferase activity for biofilm inhibition. This enzyme is necessary for glycosylation of the pilus subunit and for adequate pilus formation. In contrast to wild-type culture in which most cells exhibit several pili, only 25% of the mutant cells are piliated, half of which possess a single pilus. In spite of this poor piliation, natural DNA competence was similar to that of wild-type, therefore, we propose that the unglycosylated pili facilitate DNA transformation. Additionally, conditioned medium from wild-type culture, which contains a biofilm inhibiting substance(s), only partially blocks biofilm development by the ogt-mutant. Thus, we suggest that inactivation of ogt affects multiple processes including production or secretion of the inhibitor as well as the ability to sense or respond to it.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThe molecular mechanisms that underlie biofilm development in cyanobacteria are just emerging. Using the cyanobacterium S. elongatus as a model, we demonstrate that glycosylation of the pilus subunit is crucial for the biofilm self-suppression mechanism, however, it is dispensable for DNA competence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcetate is the major intermediate of anaerobic digestion of organic waste to CH4. In anaerobic methanogenic systems, acetate degradation is carried out by either acetoclastic methanogenesis or a syntrophic degradation by a syntrophy of acetate oxidizers and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Due to challenges in isolation of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB), the diversity and metabolism of SAOB, as well as the mechanisms of their interactions with methanogenic partners remain poorly understood.\n\nResultsIn this study, we successfully enriched previously unknown SAOB by operating continuous thermophilic anaerobic chemostats fed with acetate, propionate, butyrate, or isovalerate as the sole carbon and energy source. They represent novel clades belonging to Clostridia, Thermoanaerobacteraceae, Anaerolineae, and Gemmatimonadetes. In these SAOB, acetate is degraded through reverse Wood-Ljungdahl pathway or an alternative pathway mediated by the glycine cleavage system, while the SAOB possessing the latter pathway dominated the bacterial community. Moreover, H2 is the major product of the acetate degradation by these SAOB, which is mediated by [FeFe]-type electron-confurcating hydrogenases, formate dehydrogenases, and NADPH reoxidation complexes. We also identified the methanogen partner of these SAOB in acetate-fed chemostat, Methanosarcina thermophila, which highly expressed genes for CO2-reducing methanogenesis and hydrogenases to supportively consuming H2 at transcriptional level. Finally, our bioinformatical analyses further suggested that these previously unknown syntrophic lineages were prevalent and might play critical roles in thermophilic methanogenic reactors.\n\nConclusionThis study expands our understanding on the phylogenetic diversity and in situ biological functions of uncultured syntrophic acetate degraders, and presents novel insights on how they interact with their methanogens partner. These knowledges strengthen our awareness on the important role of SAO in thermophilic methanogenesis and may be applied to manage microbial community to improve the performance and efficiency of anaerobic digestion.",

Here we describe a workflow for measurement of absolute translational efficiency of mRNAs resolved by their transcription start sites (TSSs). Its application to kidney cancer cells revealed a remarkable extent of translational reprogramming by mTOR, strongly affecting many metabolic enzymes and pathways. By contrast, global effects of HIF on translation were limited, and we did not observe reported translational activation by HIF2A. In contrast, HIF-dependent alterations in TSS usage were associated with robust changes in translational efficiency in a subset of genes. Analyses of the interplay of HIF and mTOR revealed that specific classes of HIF1A and HIF2A transcriptional target gene manifest markedly different sensitivity to mTOR, in a manner that supports combined use of HIF2A and mTOR inhibitors in treatment of kidney cancer.",

In eukaryotic cells, TFIID is thought to nucleate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex formation on all protein coding gene promoters and thus, be crucial for Pol II transcription. TFIID is composed of three lobes, named A, B and C. Structural studies showed that TAF8 forms a histone fold pair with TAF10 in lobe B and participates in connecting lobe B to lobe C. In the present study, we have investigated the requirement of the different regions of TAF8 for in vitro TFIID assembly, and the importance of certain TAF8 regions for mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) viability. We have identified a TAF8 region, different from the histone fold domain of TAF8, important for assembling with the 5TAF core complex in lobe B, and four regions of TAF8 each individually required for interacting with TAF2 in lobe C. Moreover, we show that the 5TAF coreinteracting TAF8 domain, and the proline rich domain of TAF8 that interacts with TAF2, are both required for mouse embryonic stem cell survival. Thus, our study demonstrates that distinct TAF8 regions involved in connecting lobe B to lobe C are crucial for TFIID function and consequent ESC survival.",

Some protein and RNA cargoes are significantly enriched in exosomes. How cells efficiently and selectively sort them into exosomes remains incompletely explored. Previously we reported that YBX1 is required in sorting of miR-223 into exosomes. Here we show that YBX1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and in cells. YBX1 condensates selectively recruit miR-223 in vitro and into exosomes secreted by cultured cells. Point mutations that inhibit YBX1 phase separation impair the incorporation of YBX1 protein into biomolecular condensates formed in cells, and perturb miR-233 sorting into exosomes. We propose that phase separation-mediated local enrichment of cytosolic RNA binding proteins and their cognate RNAs enables their targeting and packaging by vesicles that bud into multivesicular bodies. This provides a possible mechanism for efficient and selective engulfment of cytosolic proteins and RNAs into intraluminal vesicles which are then secreted as exosomes from cells.",

The exposure of PFNA, but not PFOA and PFOS, is positively correlated with miscarriage and increased time to pregnancy. Toxicological studies indicated that PFNA exposure is associated with immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, developmental toxicity, and reproductive toxicity in animals. However, there is little information regarding the toxic effects of PFNA on oocyte maturation. In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of PFNA exposure on mouse oocyte maturation in vitro. Our results showed that 600 M PFNA significantly inhibited germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and polar body extrusion (PBE) in mouse oocytes. Our further study revealed that PFNA induced abnormal metaphase I (MI) spindle assembly, evidenced by malformed spindles and mislocalization of p-ERK1/2 in PFNA-treated oocytes. We also found that PFNA induced abnormal mitochondrial distribution and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Consequently, PFNA increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, leading to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and eventually early-stage apoptosis in oocytes. In addition, after 14 h culture, PFNA disrupted the formation of metaphase II (MII) spindle in most PFNA-treated oocytes with polar bodies. Collectively, our results indicate that PFNA interferes with oocyte maturation in vitro via disrupting spindle assembly, damaging mitochondrial functions, and inducing oxidative stress, DNA damage, and early-stage apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "While many studies have described Drosophila embryonic and larval blood cells, the hematopoietic system of the imago remains poorly characterized and conflicting data have been published concerning adult hematopoiesis. Using a combination of blood cell markers, we show that the adult hematopoietic system is essentially composed of a few distinct mature blood cell types. In addition, our transcriptomics results indicate that adult and larval blood cells have both common and specific features and it appears that adult hemocytes reactivate many gene expressed in embryonic blood cells. Interestingly, we identify a small set of blood cells that do not express differentiation markers but maintain the progenitor marker domeMeso. Yet, we show that these cells are derived from the posterior signaling center, a specialized population of cells present in the larval lymph gland, rather than from larval blood cell progenitors, and that their maintenance depends on the EBF transcription factor Collier. Furthermore, while these cells are normally quiescent, we find that some of them can differentiate and proliferate in response to bacterial infection. In sum, our results indicate that adult flies harbor a small population of specialized cells with limited hematopoietic potential and further support the idea that no substantial hematopoiesis takes place during adulthood.",

    "abstract": "During cardiac development, cells from the precardiac mesoderm fuse to form the primordial heart tube, which then grows by addition of further progenitors to the venous and arterial poles. In the zebrafish, wilms tumor 1 transcription factor a (wt1a) and b (wt1b) are expressed in the pericardial mesoderm at the venous pole of the forming heart tube. The pericardial mesoderm forms a single layered mesothelial sheet that contributes to further the growth of the myocardium, and forms the proepicardium. Proepicardial cells are subsequently transferred to the myocardial surface and give rise to the epicardium, the outer layer covering the myocardium in the adult heart. wt1a/b expression is downregulated during the transition from pericardium to myocardium, but remains high in proepicardial cells. Here we show that sustained wt1 expression impaired cardiomyocyte maturation including sarcomere assembly, ultimately affecting heart morphology and cardiac function. ATAC-seq data analysis of cardiomyocytes overexpressing wt1 revealed that chromatin regions associated with myocardial differentiation genes remain closed upon wt1b overexpression in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that wt1 represses a myocardial differentiation program. Indeed, a subset of wt1a/b-expressing cardiomyocytes changed their cell adhesion properties, delaminated from the myocardial epithelium, and upregulated the expression of epicardial genes, as confirmed by in vivo imaging. Thus, we conclude that wt1 acts as a break for cardiomyocyte differentiation by repressing chromatin opening at specific genomic loci and that sustained ectopic expression of wt1 in cardiomyocytes can lead to their transformation into epicardial cells.",

The multi-subunit CatSper complexes form highly organized calcium signaling nanodomains on flagellar membranes. Here we report identification of an uncharacterized protein C2CD6 as a novel subunit of the CatSper ion channel complex. C2CD6 contains a calcium-dependent membrane targeting C2 domain. C2CD6 interacts with the CatSper calcium-selective core forming subunits. Deficiency of C2CD6 depletes the CatSper nanodomains from the flagellum and results in male sterility. C2CD6-deficient sperm are defective in hyperactivation and fail to fertilize oocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, transient treatments with either Ca2+ ionophore, starvation, or a combination of both restore the fertilization capacity of C2CD6-deficient sperm in vitro. C2CD6 interacts with EFCAB9, a pH-dependent calcium sensor in the CatSper complex. We postulate that C2CD6 may regulate CatSper assembly, target the CatSper complex to flagellar plasma membrane, and function as a calcium sensor. The identification of C2CD6 as an essential subunit may facilitate the long-sought reconstitution of the CatSper ion channel complex in a heterologous system for male contraceptive development.",

Telacebec inhibits the mycobacterial respiratory supercomplex composed of complexes III and IV (CIII2CIV2). In mycobacterial electron transport chains, CIII2CIV2 replaces canonical CIII and CIV, transferring electrons from the intermediate carrier menaquinol to the final acceptor, molecular oxygen, while simultaneously transferring protons across the inner membrane to power ATP synthesis. We show that telacebec inhibits the menaquinol:oxygen oxidoreductase activity of purified Mycobacterium smegmatis CIII2CIV2 at concentrations similar to those needed to inhibit electron transfer in mycobacterial membranes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in culture. We then used electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to determine structures of CIII2CIV2 both in the presence and absence of telacebec. The structures suggest that telacebec prevents menaquinol oxidation by blocking two different menaquinol binding modes to prevent CIII2CIV2 activity.",

    "abstract": "The fruit fly Anastrepha obliqua is an economically important pest for mango fruits in Mexico. The sterile insect technique is used to control this pest; it involves mass production and release of sterile flies to reduce reproduction of the wild population. As noted in different tephritidae, the performance of sterile males may be affected by the assimilation of nutrients under mass-rearing conditions. In the wild, the flys life cycle suggests the acquisition of different organisms that could modulate fitness and physiology of the fly. Therefore, the microorganisms lodged in the gut may be determinative. For A. obliqua, there is no information regarding microorganisms other than bacteria. This study analyzed bacteria, fungi, and archaea communities in the A. obliqua gut through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile of 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA markers. Besides, 16S sequencing and phylogenetic analysis provided a better description of bacteria, and archaea communities. We found that wild flies presented higher microbial diversity than laboratory samples. Phylogeny analyses of wild samples suggest the presence of microbial species related to fructose assimilation while laboratory microbial species suggest the presence of microorganisms leading to a specialized metabolism to process yeast as result of the consumption of an artificial diet. Here, the archaea kingdom is suggested as an important player in fly metabolism. This is the first report of the intestinal microbial (bacteria, archaea and fungi) composition of A. obliqua, which will aid in our understanding of the role of microorganisms in the development and physiology of the flies.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics used as growth promoters in livestock and animal husbandry can be detected in animal-derived food. Epidemiological studies have implicated that exposure to these antibiotic residues in food may be associated to childhood obesity. Herein, the effect of exposure to residual dose of tylosin--an antibiotic growth promoter--on host metabolism and gut microbiota was explored in vivo. Theoretical maximal daily intake (TMDI) doses of tylosin were found to facilitate high-fat diet-induced obesity, induce insulin resistance, and perturb the composition of gut microbiota in mice. The obesity-related phenotypes were transferrable to germ-free recipient mice, indicating that the effects of TMDI dose of tylosin on obesity and insulin resistance occurred mainly via alteration of the gut microbiota. Tylosin TMDI exposure restricted to early life, which is the critical period of gut microbiota development, altered the abundance of specific bacteria related to host metabolic homeostasis later in life. Moreover, early-life exposure to tylosin TMDI was sufficient to modify the ratio of primary to secondary bile acids, thereby inducing lasting metabolic consequences via the downstream FGF15 signaling pathway. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that exposure to very low dose of antibiotic residues, whether continuously or in early life, can exert long-lasting effects on host metabolism by altering gut microbiota and its metabolites.\n\nImportanceEvidence has indicated that chronic exposure to antibiotic residues in food could contribute to obesity. However, few studies have investigated the effect of chronic exposure to very low-dose antibiotic residue in food (~1000-fold lower than the therapeutic dose) on gut microbiota and host metabolism. Our study demonstrates that even with limited exposure in early life, a residual dose of tylosin causes lasting metabolic disturbances through altering gut microbiota and its metabolites. Our findings reveal that the gut microbiota is susceptible to previously ignored environmental factors.",

Thus, changes in the phyllosphere microbiota, which includes deleterious and beneficial microbes, can have far reaching effects on plant fitness and productivity. In this context, identifying the processes and microorganisms that drive the changes in the leaf microbiota over a plants lifetime is crucial. In this study we analyzed the temporal dynamics in the leaf microbiota of Arabidopsis thaliana, integrating both compositional changes and changes in microbe-microbe interactions via the study of microbial networks. Field-grown Arabidopsis were used to follow leaf bacterial, fungal and oomycete communities, throughout the plants growing season (extending from November to March), over three consecutive years. Our results revealed the existence of conserved time patterns, with microbial communities and networks going through a stabilization phase (decreasing diversity and variability) at the beginning of the plants growing season. Despite a high turnover in these communities, we identified 19  core taxa persisting in Arabidopsis leaves across time and plant generations. With the hypothesis these microbes could be playing key roles in the structuring of leaf microbial communities, we conducted a time-informed microbial network analysis which showed core taxa are not necessarily highly connected network  hubs and  hubs alternate with time. Our study shows that leaf microbial communities exhibit reproducible dynamics and patterns, suggesting it could be possible to predict and drive these microbial communities to desired states.",

Specifically, we identified 361 genes significantly down regulated in GF embryos compared to conventionally raised embryos via RNA-Seq analysis.

    "abstract": "A fundamental concept in eukaryotic DNA replication is the temporal separation of G1 origin licensing from S phase origin firing. Re-replication and genome instability ensue if licensing occurs after DNA synthesis has started. In humans and other vertebrates, the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4Cdt2 starts to degrade the licensing factor Cdt1 after origins fire, raising the question of how cells prevent re-replication in early S phase. Here, using quantitative microscopy, we show that Cdt1 inhibits DNA synthesis during an overlap period when cells fire origins while Cdt1 is still present. Cdt1 inhibits DNA synthesis by suppressing CMG helicase progression at replication forks through the MCM-binding domain of Cdt1, and DNA synthesis commences once Cdt1 is degraded. Thus, instead of separating licensing from firing to prevent re-replication in early S phase, cells separate licensing from DNA synthesis through Cdt1-mediated inhibition of CMG helicase after firing.\n\nHighlights- Cdt1 is present together with fired origins of replication at the start of S phase\n- Cdt1 delays DNA synthesis by inhibiting CMG helicase progression after origins fire\n- Cdt1 inhibits CMG helicase progression through the MCM-binding domain of Cdt1",

    "abstract": "Sperm motility, including chemotactic behavior, is regulated by changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The cation channel of sperm (CatSper), plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In mammals, CatSper is the only Ca2+ channel that functions in the sperm, and the mice that lack the genes for the subunits of CatSper, which make up the pore region of the Ca2+ channel, are infertile due to the inhibition of hyperactivation of the sperm. CatSper is also thought to be involved in chemotaxis in sea urchins. In contrast, in the ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, the sperm-activating and -attracting factor (SAAF) interacts with Ca2+/ATPase, which is a Ca2+-pump. Although the existence of CatSper genes has been reported, it is not clear whether CatSper is the specific Ca2+ channel that functions in the ascidian sperm. Therefore, in this study, we generated Catsper3 knockout (KO) animals that found that they were significantly less motile, with few motile sperms not exhibiting any chemotactic behavior. These results suggest that CatSper plays important roles in the spermatogenesis and basic motility mechanisms of sperms in both ascidians and mammals.",

Our analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) used 11,889 gene regions annotated in the house sparrow reference genome for which we had an average of 25.7 million mapped reads/sample. PERMANOVA identified significant effects of brain region, phenotype (neophobic vs. non-neophobic), and a brain region by phenotype interaction. Comparing neophobic and non-neophobic birds revealed constitutive differences in DEGs in three of the four brain regions examined: hippocampus (12% of the transcriptome significantly differentially expressed), striatum (4%) and NCL (3%). DEGs included important known neuroendocrine mediators of learning, memory, executive function, and anxiety behavior, including serotonin receptor 5A, dopamine receptors 1, 2 and 5 (downregulated in neophobic birds), and estrogen receptor beta (upregulated in neophobic birds). These results suggest that some of the behavioral differences between phenotypes may be due to underlying gene expression differences in the brain. The large number of DEGs in neophobic and non-neophobic birds also implies that there are major differences in neural function between the two phenotypes that could affect a wide variety of behavioral traits beyond neophobia.",

    "abstract": "Detection of nucleic acids within sub-cellular compartments is key to understanding their function. Determining the intracellular distribution of nucleic acids requires quantitative retention and estimation of their association with different organelles by immunofluorescence microscopy. This is important also for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics which depends on endocytic uptake and endosomal escape. However, the current methods fail to preserve the majority of exogenously delivered nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. To solve this problem, by monitoring Cy5-labeled mRNA delivered to primary human adipocytes via lipid nanoparticles (LNP), we optimized cell fixation, permeabilization and immuno-staining of a number of organelle markers, achieving quantitative retention of mRNA and allowing visualization of levels which escape detection using conventional procedures. Additionally, we demonstrated the protocol to be effective on exogenously delivered siRNA, miRNA, as well as endogenous miRNA. Our protocol is compatible with RNA probes of single molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH) and molecular beacon, thus demonstrating that it is broadly applicable to study a variety of nucleic acids.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWood represents the majority of the biomass on land and constitutes a renewable source of biofuels and other bioproducts. However, wood is recalcitrant to bioconversion, raising a need for feedstock improvement in production of, for instance, biofuels. We investigated the properties of wood that affect bioconversion, as well as the underlying genetics, to help identify superior tree feedstocks for biorefining.\n\nResultsWe recorded 65 wood-related and growth traits in a population of 113 natural aspen genotypes from Sweden. These traits included three growth and field performance traits, 20 traits for wood chemical composition, 17 traits for wood anatomy and structure, and 25 wood saccharification traits as indicators of bioconversion potential. Glucose release after saccharification with acidic pretreatment correlated positively with tree stem height and diameter and the carbohydrate content of the wood, and negatively with the content of lignin and the hemicellulose sugar units. Most of these traits displayed extensive natural variation within the aspen population and high broad-sense heritability, supporting their potential in genetic improvement of feedstocks towards improved bioconversion. Finally, a genome wide association study (GWAS) revealed 13 genetic loci for saccharification yield (on a whole tree biomass basis), with six of them intersecting with associations for either height or stem diameter of the trees.\n\nConclusionsThe simple growth traits of stem height and diameter were identified as good predictors of wood saccharification yield in aspen trees. GWAS elucidated the underlying genetics, revealing putative genetic markers for bioconversion of bioenergy tree feedstocks.",

Here we have developed a pipeline for image processing and statistical data analysis which automatically extracts sophisticated parameters from complex multi-genotype 3D images. The pipeline includes data handling, machine-learning-enabled segmentation, multivariant statistical analysis, and graph generation. This enables researchers to run rigorous analyses on images and videos at scale and in a fraction of the time, without requiring programming skills.

    "abstract": "Rice is one of the most important staple food in the world, with irrigated rice paddies largely converted from natural wetlands. The effectiveness of rice fields in help preserve species depends partially on management practices, including the usage of pesticides. However, related studies have focused predominately on the cultivation period, leaving the effects of soil pesticide residues on aquatic invertebrates during the fallow periods little explored; other animals, such as waterbirds, also rely on aquatic invertebrates in flooded fallow fields for their survival. We therefore investigated vertebrates and macroinvertebrates (terrestrial and aquatic) on rice stands and in flooded water during cultivation and fallow periods in organic and conventional rice fields in Taiwan. Association of environmental factors with terrestrial and aquatic organisms was also analyzed. In total, 32,880 individuals of 144 invertebrate families and 381 individuals of 15 vertebrate families were recorded after nine samplings each for six organic and six conventional rice fields. Family richness and abundance of all invertebrates (terrestrial and aquatic) were higher in organic than in conventional fields during the cultivation period, but were similar between the two agricultural practices during the fallow period. Richness and abundance of terrestrial invertebrates in both organic and conventional fields increased with the progression of rice cultivation, so did the differences between the two practices. Richness of aquatic invertebrates was mostly constant across the sampling period, while abundance increased but differences decreased during the fallow period. Richness and abundance of terrestrial invertebrates were positively associated with ambient temperature and height of rice stand. Abundance of aquatic invertebrates were positively associated with pH value and amount of dissolved oxygen but negatively associated with water temperature. Richness and abundance of all vertebrates and each of the constituting groups (fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and migratory waterbird) were statistically similar between the two practices although abundance of migratory waterbirds in organic fields were two times those in conventional fields during the fallow period. Our study suggested accumulated effects of pesticides on suppressing terrestrial invertebrates during the cultivation period, but diminishing effects of pesticide residues on repressing aquatic invertebrates during the fallow period. This comprehensive study provided a holistic picture on macroinvertebrate and vertebrate fauna, as well as ramifications of pesticide usage, in a representative Southeast Asia rice paddy ecosystem. Further study should compare rice fields with natural wetlands to better assess how to capitalize on agroecosystems for biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates an approach to produce and select hybrid algal strains exhibiting increased photosynthetic productivity under multiple environmental conditions. This simultaneously addresses two major impediments to improving algal bioenergy production: 1) generating new genetic variants with improved performance; and 2) disentangling complex interactions between genetic and physiological factors contributing to these improvements. We pooled progeny generated from mating two environmental isolates of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cultured the pools under multiple environmental conditions. Strains from the outcompeting populations showed substantial (in some cases over 3 fold) increases in productivity over the parental lines under certain environments related to biomass production, including laboratory conditions as well as hyperoxia, fluctuating light, high salinity and high temperature. The results indicate that C. reinhardtii has remarkable, untapped, directed evolution capacity that may be harnessed using breeding and competition approaches. The populations were deep sequenced at multiple time points to identify \"Selection-Enriched Genomic Loci\" (SEGL) that accumulated in the populations, and thus likely confer increased fitness under the respective environmental conditions. With improved resolution, SEGL mapping can identify allelic combinations used for targeted breeding approaches, generating elite algal lines with multiple desirable traits, as well as to further understand the genetic and mechanistic bases of photosynthetic productivity.\n\nSignificance StatementIncreasing the photosynthetic efficiency of algae during biomass production is perhaps the most critical hurdle for economically sustainable algal based biofuels. This presents unique challenges because modifications designed to increase photosynthesis often result in decreased fitness, due to production of toxic reactive oxygen species when photosynthesis is not adequately regulated. These problems are exacerbated under natural and outdoor production environments because of the complex nature of photosynthesis and the multifaceted interactions between genetic, environmental and physiological factors. Here, we demonstrate a high throughput biotechnological screening approach that simultaneously produces algal strains with highly increased autotrophic productivity and identifies genomic loci contributing to these improvements. Our results demonstrate that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits high directed evolutionary capacity readily accessed through breeding and selection.",

    "abstract": "Ratiometric time-lapse FRET analysis requires a robust and accurate processing pipeline to eliminate bias in intensity measurements on fluorescent images before further quantitative analysis can be conducted. This level of robustness can only be achieved by supplementing automated tools with built-in flexibility for manual ad-hoc adjustments. FRET-IBRA is a modular and fully parallelized configuration file-based tool written in Python. It simplifies the FRET processing pipeline to achieve accurate, registered, and unified ratio image stacks. The flexibility of this tool to handle discontinuous image frame sequences with tailored configuration parameters further streamlines the processing of outliers and time-varying effects in the original microscopy images. FRET-IBRA offers cluster-based channel background subtraction, photobleaching correction, and ratio image construction in an all-in-one solution without the need for multiple applications, image format conversions, and/or plug-ins. The package accepts a variety of input formats and outputs TIFF image stacks along with performance measures to detect both the quality and failure of the background subtraction algorithm on a per frame basis. Furthermore, FRET-IBRA outputs images with superior signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy in comparison to existing background subtraction solutions, whilst maintaining a fast runtime. The FRET-IBRA package has been extensively used in quantifying the spatial distribution of calcium ions during pollen tube growth under mechanical constraints. Benchmarks against existing tools clearly demonstrate the need for FRET-IBRA in extracting reliable insights from FRET microscopy images of dynamic physiological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. The source code for Linux and Mac operating systems is released under the BSD license and, along with installation instructions, test images, example configuration files, and a step-by-step tutorial, is freely available at github.com/gmunglani/fret-ibra.\n\nAuthor SummaryFRET is a fundamental imaging technique used to generate fluorescence signals sensitive to molecular conformations and interactions. Despite its wide use and the large body of literature on the theoretical steps required to process images generated from this procedure, we were unable to locate a tool that contained the entire processing workflow, whilst allowing the user the flexibility to adjust parameters for maximum accuracy and runtime efficiency. FRET-IBRA was thus created to be an all-in-one, open-source, parallel solution to process FRET images, while eliminating complications arising from repeated image format conversions. Besides enhancing the background subtraction algorithm for FRET images, several additional options were implemented for the user to extract the cleanest signal possible for their specific use case. FRET-IBRA is primarily built for flexibility when handling large image stacks by supporting sequences of image frames to be treated independently, greatly reducing time spent on splitting and concatenating image stacks. In accuracy and speed benchmarks against more general background subtraction packages, FRET-IBRA was able to provide the cleanest results with a fast runtime, leading to reliable analysis without additional tuning.",

    "abstract": "Classification of proteins into their respective functional categories remains a long-standing key challenge in computational biology. Machine Learning (ML) based discriminative algorithms have been used extensively to address this challenge; however, the presence of small-sized, noisy, unbalanced protein classification datasets where high sequence similarity does not always imply identical functional properties have prevented robust prediction performance. Herein we present a ML method, Ensemble method for enZyme Classification (EnZymClass), that is specifically designed to address these issues. EnZymClass makes use of 47 alignment-free feature extraction techniques as numerically encoded descriptors of protein sequences to construct a stacked ensemble classification scheme capable of categorizing proteins based on their functional attributes. We used EnZymClass to classify plant acyl-ACP thioesterases (TEs) into short, long and mixed free fatty acid substrate specificity categories. While general guidelines for inferring substrate specificity have been proposed before, prediction of chain-length preference from primary sequence has remained elusive. EnZymClass achieved high classification metric scores on the TE substrate specificity prediction task (average accuracy score of 0.8, average precision and recall scores of 0.87 and 0.89 respectively on medium-chain TE prediction) producing accuracy scores that are about twice as effective at avoiding misclassifications than existing similarity-based methods of substrate specificity prediction. By applying EnZymClass to a subset of TEs in the ThYme database, we identified two acyl-ACP TE, ClFatB3 and CwFatB2, with previously uncharacterized activity in E. coli fatty acid production hosts. We incorporated modifications into ClFatB3 established in prior TE engineering studies, resulting in a 4.2-fold overall improvement in observed C10 titers over the wildtype enzyme.\n\nEnZymClass can be readily applied to other protein classification challenges and is available at: https://github.com/deeprob/ThioesteraseEnzymeSpecificity\n\nAuthor SummaryThe natural diversity of proteins has been harnessed to serve specialized applications in various fields, including medicine, renewable chemical production, and food and agriculture. Acquiring and characterizing new proteins to meet a given application, however, can be an expensive process, requiring selection from thousands to hundreds of thousands of candidates in a database and subsequent experimental screening. Using amino acid sequence to predict a proteins function has been demonstrated to accelerate this process, however standard approaches require information on previously characterized proteins and their respective sequences. Obtaining the necessary amount of data to accurately infer sequence-function relationships can be prohibitive, especially with a low-throughput testing cycle. Here, we present EnZymClass, a model that is specifically designed to work with small to medium-sized protein sequence datasets and retain high prediction performance of function. We applied EnZymClass to predict the presence or absence of a desired function among acyl-ACP thioesterases, a key enzyme class used in the production of renewable oleochemicals in microbial hosts. By training EnZymClass on only 115 functionally characterized enzyme sequences, we were able to successfully detect two plant acyl-ACP thioesterases with the desired specialized function among 617 sequences in the ThYme database.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks tick a rhythm with a nearly 24-hour period in various organisms. The clock proteins of cyanobacteria, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, compose a minimum circadian clock. The slow KaiB-KaiC complex formation, which is essential in determining the clock period, occurs when the C1 domain of KaiC binds ADP produced by ATP hydrolysis. KaiC is considered to promote this complex formation by inhibiting the backward process, ADP/ATP exchange, rather than activating the forward process, ATP hydrolysis. Remarkably, although inhibition of backward process, in general, decelerates the whole process, KaiC oppositely accelerates the complex formation. In this article, by building a novel reaction model, we investigate the molecular mechanism of the simultaneous promotion and acceleration of the complex formation, which may play a significant role in keeping the period invariant under environmental perturbations. Based on several experimental results, we assume in this model that six KaiB monomers cooperatively and rapidly binds to C1 with the stabilization of the binding-competent conformation of C1 only when C1 binds six ADP. We find the cooperative KaiB binding effectively separates the pre-binding process of C1 into a fast transformation to binding-competent C1 requiring multiple ATP hydrolyses and its slow backward transformation. Since the ADP/ATP exchange retards the forward process, its inhibition results in the acceleration of the complex formation. We also find that, in a simplified monomeric model where KaiB binds to a KaiC monomer independently of the other monomers, the ADP/ATP exchange inhibition cannot accelerate the complex formation. In summary, we conclude that the ring-shaped hexameric form of KaiC enables the acceleration of the complex formation induced by the backward process inhibition because the cooperative KaiB binding arises from the structure of KaiC.\n\nAuthor summaryCircadian clocks tick a rhythm with a nearly 24-hour period in various organisms. The cyanobacterial circadian clock has attracted much attention because of its simplicity, composed of only three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. The rate of the slow KaiB-KaiC complex formation, which plays an essential role in the period determination, is mainly regulated by the ATP hydrolysis (forward process) and the ADP/ATP exchange (backward process) of KaiC. KaiC promotes the complex formation by inhibiting the backward process rather than activating the forward process. Remarkably, although inhibition of backward process, in general, slows down the whole process, KaiC oppositely accelerates the complex formation. In this article, we investigate the molecular mechanism of this acceleration by building a novel mathematical model based on several significant experimental results. We find the cooperative binding of six KaiB to a KaiC hexamer, which arises from the ring-shaped hexameric structure of KaiC, effectively separates the pre-binding process into a fast transformation to the binding-competent KaiC requiring multiple ATP hydrolyses and its slow backward transformation. Since the ADP/ATP exchange retards the forward process, its inhibition results in the acceleration of the complex formation.",

    "abstract": "Social relationships are dynamic and evolve with shared and personal experiences. Whether the functional role of social neuromodulators also evolves with experience to shape the trajectory of relationships is unknown. We utilized pair bonding in the socially monogamous prairie voles as an example of socio-sexual experience that dramatically alters behaviors displayed toward other individuals. We investigated oxytocin-dependent modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens as a function of pair bonding status. We found that an oxytocin receptor agonist decreases the amplitude of spontaneous Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (EPSCs) in sexually naive virgin, but not pair-bonded, female voles, while it increases the amplitude of electrically evoked EPSCs in paired voles, but not in virgins. This oxytocin-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission relies on the de novo coupling between oxytocin receptor signaling and endocannabinoid CB1 receptor signaling in pair bonded voles. Blocking CB1 receptors after pair bond formation increases the occurrence of a specific form of social rejection - defensive upright response - that is displayed towards the partner but not towards a novel individual. Altogether, our results demonstrate that oxytocins action in the nucleus accumbens is changed through social experience in a way that regulates the trajectory of social interactions as the relationship with the partner unfolds, potentially promoting the maintenance of a pair bond by inhibiting aggressive responses. These results provide a mechanism by which social experience and context shift oxytocinergic signaling to impact neural and behavioral responses to social cues.",

Recent studies recognized these vesicles as vectors to horizontal gene transfer, however the parameters that mediate OMVs transfer within bacterial communities remain unclear. The present study highlights for the first time the transfer of plasmids containing resistance genes via OMVs derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). This mechanism confers DNA protection and it is plasmid copy number dependent with a ratio of 3.6 time among high copy-number plasmid (pGR) versus low copy number plasmid (PRM) and the transformation efficiency was 3.6 times greater. Therefore, the DNA amount in the vesicular lumen and the efficacy of horizontal gene transfer was strictly dependent on the identity of the plasmid. Moreover, the role of K. pneumoniae-OMVs in interspecies transfer was described. The transfer ability was not related to the phylogenetic characteristics between the donor and the recipient species. K. pneumoniae-OMVs transferred plasmid to Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. These findings address the pivotal role of K. pneumoniae-OMVs as vectors for antimicrobial resistance genes spread, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbial communities.\n\nAuthor summaryK. pneumoniae is an important opportunistic pathogen that affects several host districts, in particular respiratory and urinary tracts. Hospital-acquired K. pneumoniae infections lead to a 50% mortality rate correlated with rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Currently, the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates is a major concern worldwide. The spread of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains renders current therapeutic options ineffective. Like all Gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae secretes OMVs. OMVs are spherical structures, with a diameter between 50-250 nm, originating from the outer membrane. OMVs biogenesis allows bacteria to interact with the external environment, increasing bacterial survival under stressful conditions and regulating microbial interactions within bacterial communities. Few evidence recognized OMVs as vectors for horizontal gene transfer, contributing to the spread of resistance. In this scenario, the present study examines the potential role of K. pneumoniae-OMVs in inter- and intra-species diffusion of {beta}-lactam resistance.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans has morphogenesis as a virulence factor. The morphogenesis of C. albicans is closely related to pathogenicity (1). Ras1 in C. albicans is an important switch in the MAPK pathway for morphogenesis (2, 3). The MAPK pathway is important for the virulence, such as cell growth, morphogenesis, and biofilm formation (4, 5). Ume6 is a well-known transcriptional factor for hyphal-specific genes (6). Despite numerous studies, as a recent issue, it is necessary to develop a new drug that uses a different pathway mechanism to inhibit resistant C. albicans strains caused by chronic prescription of azole or echinocandin drugs, which are mainly used. Here, we show that the small carbazole derivatives attenuated the pathogenicity of C. albicans through inhibition of the Ras1/MAPK pathway. We found that the small molecules inhibit morphogenesis through repressing protein and RNA levels in Ras/MAPK related genes including UME6 and NRG1. Furthermore, we found the antifungal effect of the small molecules in vivo using a candidiasis murine model. We anticipate our findings are that the small molecules are the promising compounds for the development of new antifungal agents for the treatment of systemic candidiasis and possibly for other fungal diseases.\n\nAuthor summaryThe infection by the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans occurs mainly in immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans, such as AIDS patients, immunosuppressant-treated organ transplant patients, and recent COVID-19 patients. Morphogenesis which the ability to switch between yeast and hyphal growth forms is one of the representative virulence factors of C. albicans. Here, we describe novel small molecules that show antifungal effects such as the inhibition of the morphogenesis and the biofilm formation, and maintenance of biofilm. Moreover, we found that these small molecules had antifungal activity in mouse experiments, and confirmed that they were also effective in drug-resistant C. albicans strains. Studies of some small molecules with structures similar to ours have already been reported to exhibit growth inhibitory activity against bacteria and Candida species. However, the mechanism of action of these molecules has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanism by which these two small molecules inhibit C. albicans pathogenicity through inhibition of specific pathways. Our study, through the research of the mechanism of action of novel small molecules, provides new insights into the development of drug candidates not only for wild-type C. albicans, but also for strains resistant to existing drugs.",

    "abstract": "High risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections induce squamous epithelial tumors in which the virus replicates. Initially, the virus-infected epithelial cells are untransformed, but expand in both number and area at the expense of normal squamous epithelial cells. How this occurs is unknown, but is presumed to be due to viral oncogene expression. We have developed an in vitro assay in which colonies of post-confluent HPV16 expressing cells outcompete confluent surrounding normal keratinocytes for surface area. The enhanced cell competition induced by the complete HPV16 genome is conferred by E6 expression alone, and not by individual expression of E5 or E7. In traditional oncogene assays, E7 is a more potent oncogene than E6, but such assays do not include interaction with normal surrounding cells. These new results separate classic oncogenicity that is primarily conferred by E7, from cell competition that we show is primarily conferred by E6, and provides a new biological role for E6 oncoproteins from high risk human papillomaviruses.\n\nImportanceHigh risk papillomavirus infections induce epithelial tumors, some of which evolve into malignancies. The development and maintenance of cancer is due to the virally encoded E6 and E7 oncoproteins. How a virally infected keratinocyte out-competes normal uninfected keratinocytes has been unknown. The present work shows that the enhanced competition of HPV16-infected cells is primarily due to the expression of the E6 oncoprotein and not the E7 or E5 oncoproteins. This work shows the importance of measuring oncoprotein traits in the context of cell competition with uninfected cells, and shows the potential of papillomavirus oncoproteins to be novel genetic probes for the analysis of cell competition.",

    "abstract": "Perturbation and mechanistic studies have shown that the DNA-binding transcription factor Zeb2 controls cell fate decision and differentiation and/or maturation in multiple cell lineages in embryos and after birth. In cultured embryonic stem cells (ESCs) Zeb2s strong upregulation is necessary for the exit from primed pluripotency and for entering general and neural differentiation. We edited mouse ESCs to produce epitope-tagged Zeb2 from one of its two endogenous alleles. Using ChIP-sequencing, we mapped 2,432 DNA-binding sites of Zeb2 in ESC-derived neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs). A new, major site maps promoter-proximal to Zeb2 itself, and its homozygous removal demonstrates that Zeb2 autoregulation is necessary to elicit proper Zeb2-dependent effects in NPC differentiation. We then cross-referenced all Zeb2 DNA-binding sites with transcriptome data from Zeb2 perturbations in ESCs, ventral forebrain in mouse embryos, and adult neurogenesis from the mouse forebrain V-SVZ. While the characteristics of these neurodevelopmental systems differ, we still find interesting overlaps. This contributes to explaining neurodevelopmental disorders caused by ZEB2 deficiency, including Mowat-Wilson Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Supplementation with micronutrients, including vitamins, iron and zinc, is a key strategy to alleviate child malnutrition. However, adverse events resulting in gastrointestinal disorders, largely associated with iron, has resulted in ongoing debate over their administration. To better understand their impact on gut microbiota, we analysed the bacterial, protozoal, fungal and helminth communities of stool samples collected from children that had previously been recruited to a cluster randomized controlled trial of micronutrient supplementation in Pakistan. We show that while bacterial diversity was reduced in supplemented children, vitamins and iron may promote colonization with distinct protozoa and mucormycetes, whereas the addition of zinc ameliorates this effect. In addition to supplements, residence in a rural versus urban setting is an important determinant of eukaryotic composition. We suggest that the risks and benefits of such interventions may be mediated in part through eukaryotic communities, in a manner dependent on setting.",
