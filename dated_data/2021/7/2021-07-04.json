    "abstract": "The term  temporal discounting describes both choice preferences and motivation for delayed rewards. Here we show that neuronal activity in the dorsal part of the primate caudate head (dCDh) signals the temporally discounted value needed to compute the motivation for delayed rewards. Macaque monkeys performed an instrumental task, in which visual cues indicated the forthcoming size and delay duration before reward. Single dCDh neurons represented the temporally discounted value without reflecting changes in the animals physiological state. Bilateral pharmacological or chemogenetic inactivation of dCDh markedly distorted the normal task performance based on the integration of reward size and delay, but did not affect the task performance for different reward sizes without delay. These results suggest that dCDh is involved in encoding the integrated multidimensional information critical for motivation.",

    "abstract": "Biofouling on the surface of implanted medical devices severely hinders device functionality and drastically shortens device lifetime. Poly(ethylene glycol) and zwitterionic polymers are currently considered \"gold standard\" device coatings to reduce biofouling. To discover novel anti-biofouling materials, we created a combinatorial library of polyacrylamide-based copolymer hydrogels and screened their ability to prevent fouling from serum and platelet-rich plasma in a high-throughput parallel assay. We found certain non-intuitive copolymer compositions exhibit superior antibiofouling properties over current gold standard materials, and employed machine learning to identify key molecular features underpinning their performance. For validation, we coated the surfaces of electrochemical biosensors with our hydrogels and evaluated their anti-biofouling performance in vitro and in vivo in rodent models. Our copolymer hydrogels preserved device function and enabled continuous measurements of a small-molecule drug in vivo better than gold standard coatings. The novel methodology we describe enables the discovery of anti-biofouling materials that can extend the lifetime of real-time in vivo sensing devices.",

    "abstract": "RNA splicing is an important driver of heterogeneity in single cells, both through the expression of alternative transcripts and as a major determinant of transcriptional kinetics. However, the intrinsic coverage limitations of scRNA-seq technologies make it challenging to associate specific splicing events to cell-level phenotypes. Here, we present BRIE2, a scalable computational method that resolves these issues by regressing single-cell transcriptomic data against cell-level features. We show that BRIE2 effectively identifies differential alternative splicing events that are associated with a disease. Additionally, BRIE2 allows a principled selection of genes (differential momentum genes) that capture heterogeneity in transcriptional kinetics and improve quantitatively RNA velocity analyses. BRIE2, therefore, extends the scope of single-cell transcriptomic experiments towards the identification of splicing phenotypes associated with biological changes at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Deletion of native centromeres in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii leads to neocentromere formation. Native centromeres span truncated transposable elements, while neocentromeres do not and instead span actively expressed genes. To explore the epigenetic organization of neocentromeres, we analyzed the distribution of the heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me2, 5mC DNA methylation and the euchromatin mark H3K4me2. Native centromeres are enriched for both H3K9me2 and 5mC DNA methylation marks and are devoid of H3K4me2, while neocentromeres do not exhibit any of these features. Neocentromeres in cen10{Delta} mutants are unstable and chromosome-chromosome fusions occur. After chromosome fusion, the neocentromere is inactivated and the native centromere of the chromosome fusion partner remains as the sole, active centromere. In the present study, the active centromere of a fused chromosome was deleted to investigate if epigenetic memory promoted the re-activation of the inactive neocentromere. Our results show that the inactive neocentromere is not re-activated and instead a novel neocentromere forms directly adjacent to the deleted centromere of the fused chromosome. To study the impact of transcription on centromere stability, the actively expressed URA5 gene was introduced into the CENP-A bound regions of a native centromere. The introduction of the URA5 gene led to a loss of CENP-A from the native centromere, and a neocentromere formed adjacent to the native centromere location. Remarkably, the inactive, native centromere remained enriched for heterochromatin, yet the integrated gene was expressed and devoid of H3K9me2. A cumulative analysis of multiple CENP-A distribution profiles revealed centromere drift in C. deuterogattii, a previously unreported phenomenon in fungi. The CENP-A-binding shifted within the ORF-free regions and showed a possible association with a truncated transposable element. Taken together, our findings reveal that neocentromeres in C. deuterogattii are highly unstable and are not marked with an epigenetic memory, distinguishing them from native centromeres.",

Lyme disease spirochetes express nearly a dozen outer surface lipoproteins that bind complement components and interfere with their native activities. Among these, BBK32 is unique in its selective inhibition of the classical pathway. BBK32 blocks activation of this pathway by selectively binding and inhibiting the C1r serine protease of first component of complement, C1. To understand the structural basis for BBK32-mediated C1r inhibition, we performed co-crystallography and size exclusion chromatography-coupled small angle x-ray scattering experiments, which revealed a molecular model of BBK32-C in complex with activated human C1r. Structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis was combined with surface plasmon resonance binding experiments and assays of complement function to validate the predicted molecular interface. The studies reported here, for the first time, provide a structural basis for classical pathway-specific inhibition by a human pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that spontaneously switch between phases of growth and shrinkage. The probability of transitioning from growth to shrinkage, termed catastrophe, increases with microtubule age, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we set out to test whether microtubule lattice defects formed during polymerization can affect growth at the plus end. To generate microtubules with lattice defects, we used microtubule-stabilizing agents that promote formation of polymers with different protofilament numbers. By employing different agents during nucleation of stable microtubule seeds and subsequent polymerization phase, we could reproducibly induce switches in protofilament number and induce stable lattice defects. Such drug-induced defects led to frequent catastrophes, which were not observed when microtubules were grown in the same conditions but without a protofilament number mismatch. Microtubule severing at the site of the defect was sufficient to suppress catastrophes. We conclude that structural defects within microtubule lattice can exert effects that can propagate over long distances and affect the dynamic state of the microtubule end.",

    "abstract": "The way that progenitor cell fate decisions and the associated environmental sensing are regulated to ensure the robustness of the spatial and temporal order in which cells are generated towards a fully differentiating tissue still remains elusive. Here, we investigate how cells regulate their sensing intensity and radius to guarantee the required thermodynamic robustness of a differentiated tissue. In particular, we are interested in finding the conditions where dedifferentiation at cell level is possible (microscopic reversibility) but tissue maintains its spatial order and differentiation integrity (macroscopic irreversibility). In order to tackle this, we exploit the recently postulated Least microEnvironmental Uncertainty Principle (LEUP) to develop a theory of stochastic thermodynamics for cell differentiation. To assess the predictive and explanatory power of our theory, we challenge it against the avian photoreceptor mosaic data. By calibrating a single parameter, the LEUP can predict the cone color spatial distribution in the avian retina and, at the same time, suggest that such a spatial pattern is associated with quasi-optimal cell sensing. By means of the stochastic thermodynamics formalism, we find out that thermodynamic robustness of differentiated tissues depends on cell metabolism and cell sensing properties. In turn, we calculate the limits of the cell sensing radius that ensure the robustness of differentiated tissue spatial order. Finally, we further constrain our model predictions to the avian photoreceptor mosaic.",

    "abstract": "There has been a spate of interest in association networks in biological and medical research, for example, genetic interaction networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, the extended joint hub graphical lasso (EDOHA), to estimate multiple related interaction networks for high dimensional omics data across multiple distinct classes. To be specific, we construct a convex penalized log likelihood optimization problem and solve it with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed method can also be adapted to estimate interaction networks for high dimensional compositional data such as microbial interaction networks. The performance of the proposed method in the simulated studies shows that EDOHA has remarkable advantages in recognizing class-specific hubs than the existing comparable methods. We also present three applications of real datasets. Biological interpretations of our results confirm those of previous studies and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism in disease.\n\nAuthor summaryReconstruction of multiple association networks from high dimensional omics data is an important topic, especially in biology. Previous studies focused on estimating different networks and detecting common hubs among all classes. Integration of information over different classes of data while allowing difference in the hub nodes is also biologically plausible. Therefore, we propose a method, EDOHA, to jointly construct multiple interaction networks with capacity in finding different hub networks for each class of data. Simulation studies show the better performance over conventional methods. The method has been demonstrated in three real world data.",

    "abstract": "LRRK2 serine/threonine kinase is associated with inherited Parkinsons disease. LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases within their switch 2 motif to control their interactions with effectors. Recent work has shown that the metal-dependent protein phosphatase PPM1H counteracts LRRK2 by dephosphorylating Rabs. PPM1H is highly selective for LRRK2 phosphorylated Rabs, and closely related PPM1J exhibits no activity toward substrates such as Rab8a phosphorylated at Thr72 (pThr72). Here we have identified the structural determinant of PPM1H specificity for Rabs. The crystal structure of PPM1H reveals a structurally conserved phosphatase fold that strikingly has evolved a 110-residue flap domain adjacent to the active site. The flap domain distantly resembles tudor domains that interact with histones in the context of epigenetics. Cellular assays, crosslinking and 3-D modelling suggest that the flap domain encodes the docking motif for phosphorylated Rabs. Consistent with this hypothesis, a PPM1J chimera with the PPM1H flap domain dephosphorylates pThr72 of Rab8a both in vitro and in cellular assays. Therefore, PPM1H has acquired a Rab-specific interaction domain within a conserved phosphatase fold.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of androgen receptor (AR) signalling mechanisms during prostate carcinogenesis is instrumental in developing novel therapies. Studies have shown glycosylation as a key androgen regulated process and that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that catalyses the covalent addition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of proteins, is often up-regulated in prostate cancer (PCa) with its expression correlated with high Gleason score. In this study we have identified an AR and OGT co-regulated factor, VPRBP also known as DCAF1. We show that VPRBP is regulated by the AR at the transcript level, and stabilized by OGT at the protein level. VPRBP knockdown in PCa cells led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, p53 stabilization, nucleolar fragmentation and increased p53 recruitment to the chromatin. In human prostate tumor samples, VPRBP protein overexpression correlated with AR amplification, OGT overexpression, early biochemical relapse and poor clinical outcome. Analysis of TCGA datasets found a positive correlation of VPRBP with AR mRNA expression. Furthermore, AR activity gene signature analysis revealed a positive correlation of VPRBP with a subset of AR target genes implying that VPRBP has a preferential regulatory impact on part of the AR regulome. In conclusion, we have shown that VPRBP/DCAF1 promotes PCa cell proliferation by restraining p53 activation under the influence of the AR and OGT as well as uncovered a unique subset of AR activity gene signature that correlates with VPRBP expression with the potential for new avenues for patient stratification and treatment.",

We interrogated their function during virus-induced lung injury using the highly prevalent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which causes severe outcomes in infants. We applied complementary approaches with primary pediatric LR-MSCs and a state-of-the-art model of human RSV infection in lamb. Remarkably, RSV-infection of pediatric LR-MSCs led to a robust activation, characterized by a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory phenotype combined with mediators related to T cell function. In line with this, following in vivo infection, RSV invades and activates LR-MSCs, resulting in the expansion of the pulmonary MSC pool. Moreover, the global transcriptional response of LR-MSCs appears to follow RSV disease, switching from an early antiviral signature to repair mechanisms including differentiation, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate the involvement of LR-MSCs during virus-mediated acute lung injury and may have therapeutic implications.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThis work identifies a novel function of lung-resident MSCs during virus-induced acute lung injury.

    "abstract": "Previous psychological studies using questionnaires have consistently reported that athletes have superior motor imagery ability, both for sports-specific and sports non-specific movements. However, regarding motor imagery of sports non-specific movements, no physiological studies have demonstrated differences in neural activity between athletes and non-athletes. The purpose of the present study was to examine differences in bioelectric sensorimotor rhythms during kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI) of sports non-specific movements between gymnasts and non-gymnasts. We selected gymnasts as an example population because they are likely to have particularly superior motor imagery ability due to frequent usage of motor imagery including KMI as part of daily practice. Healthy young participants (16 gymnasts and 16 non-gymnasts) performed repeated motor execution and KMI of sports non-specific movements (wrist dorsiflexion and shoulder abduction of the dominant hand). Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. During motor execution and KMI, sensorimotor EEG power is known to decrease in the - (8-15 Hz) and {beta}-bands (16-35 Hz), referred to as event-related desynchronization (ERD). We calculated the maximal peak of ERD both in the - (ERDmax) and {beta}-bands ({beta}ERDmax) as a measure of changes in corticospinal excitability. ERDmax was significantly greater in gymnasts, who subjectively evaluated their KMI as being more vivid, for both KMI tasks. On the other hand, {beta}ERDmax was greater in gymnasts only for shoulder abduction KMI. These findings suggest gymnasts signature of flexibly modulating sensorimotor rhythm with no movements, which may be the basis of their superior ability of KMI for sports non-specific movements.\n\nNew & NoteworthyKinesthetic motor imagery of sports non-specific movements was compared between gymnasts and non-gymnasts (i.e., healthy controls) from both physiological and psychological approaches. The EEG sensorimotor rhythms during kinesthetic motor imagery were more desynchronized in gymnasts who subjectively imaged their own movements as being more vivid. The work reveals novel ability in gymnasts to flexibly control their sensorimotor rhythms with no actual movements, which would be the basis of their superior ability of motor imagery.",

Although pigmentation traits are known risk-factors for melanoma, we know little about melanocyte stem cell (McSC) populations other than hair follicle McSCs, and lack key lineage markers with which to identify McSCs and study their function. Here, we discover that Tfap2b, and a select set of its target genes, specifies an McSC population at the dorsal root ganglia in zebrafish. Functionally, Tfap2b is required for only a few late-stage embryonic melanocytes, and instead is essential for McSC-dependent melanocyte regeneration.

    "abstract": "The synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) is essential for the storage of excess fatty acids, which can subsequently be used for energy or cell growth. A series of enzymes act in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to synthesize TAG, prior to its transfer to lipid droplets (LDs), which are conserved organelles for fat storage. Here, we report that the deficiency of TMEM-120/TMEM120A, a protein with 6-transmembrane helices, retards TAG synthesis and LD expansion in C. elegans. A missense mutation near the predicted coenzyme A binding site of TMEM-120 confers strong loss of function phenotypes. GFP fusion proteins of TMEM-120, expressed at the endogenous level in live worms, were observed throughout the ER network. Using Stimulated Raman Scattering, we discovered a specific requirement of TMEM-120 in the storage of exogenous fatty acids in LDs. Knockdown of TMEM120A impedes adipogenesis of pre-adipocytes in vitro, while its over-expression is sufficient to promote LD expansion. Pharmacological studies indicate that TMEM120A most likely acts upstream of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1). Our results suggest that TMEM-120/TMEM120A plays a conserved role in increasing the efficiency of TAG synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The functional significance of BOLD signals in white matter (WM) remains unclear. The current study investigated whether 7T BOLD fMRI signal from visual WM tracts contains high fidelity retinotopic information and whether it correlates with the effective connectivity between visual areas. Population receptive field (pRF) analysis of the 7T retinotopy dataset from the Human Connectome Project revealed clear contralateral retinotopic representations from two visual WM bundles: optic radiation (OR) and vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF). The retinotopic organization of OR is consistent with post-mortem studies. The pRF size of WM voxels also increases with eccentricity. Based on the retinotopic maps of OR, we investigated whether BOLD signals in OR during visual stimulation are related to the resting-state effective connectivity between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1). Results show that visually-evoked BOLD responses in OR correlate with the feedforward and feedback connectivity between the LGN and V1 during resting state. These findings demonstrate that WM BOLD signals contain high fidelity information such as visual field maps, and also predict the functional connectivity of brain areas.\n\nSignificance statementWhite matter (WM) tracks conduct spiking activity between distant neurons. Weak fluctuations of BOLD signals in the WM can be detected with fMRI, but their functional relevance remains largely unknown. Here we characterized the visual field map properties of two major visual WM bundles: the optic radiation (OR) and vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF). Population receptive field analysis of the WM BOLD signals revealed clear visual field maps in both WM tracts. Effective connectivity analysis further showed that visually evoked BOLD responses in OR can predict the resting thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. These findings demonstrate that WM BOLD signals contain highly specific functional information and could directly index the functional connectivity between brain areas.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDiversity-dependent diversification models have been extensively used to study the effect of ecological limits and feedback of community structure on species diversification processes, such as speciation and extinction. Current diversity-dependent diversification models characterise ecological limits by carrying capacities for species richness. Such ecological limits have been justified by niche filling arguments: as species diversity increases, the number of available niches for diversification decreases.\n\nHowever, as species diversify they may diverge from one another phenotypically, which may open new niches for new species. Alternatively, this phenotypic divergence may not affect the species diversification process or even inhibit further diversification. Hence, it seems natural to explore the consequences of phylogenetic diversity-dependent (or phylodiversity-dependent) diversification. Current likelihood methods for estimating diversity-dependent diversification parameters cannot be used for this, as phylodiversity is continuously changing as time progresses and species form and become extinct.\n\nHere, we present a new method based on Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM), designed to perform statistical inference on a general class of species diversification models and implemented in the R package emphasis. We use the method to fit phylodiversity-dependent diversification models to 14 phylogenies, and compare the results to the fit of a richness-dependent diversification model. We find that in a number of phylogenies, phylogenetic divergence indeed spurs speciation even though species richness reduces it. Not only do we thus shine a new light on diversity-dependent diversification, we also argue that our inference framework can handle a large class of diversification models for which currently no inference method exists.",

    "abstract": "DNA origami purification is critical in emerging applications of functionalized DNA nanostructures from basic fundamental biophysics, nanorobots to therapeutics. Advances in DNA origami purification have led to the establishment of rate-zonal centrifugation (RZC) as a scalable, high-yield, and contamination-free approach to purifying DNA origami nanostructures. In RZC purification, a linear density gradient is created using viscous agents, such as glycerol and sucrose, to separate molecules based on their mass and shape during high-rpm centrifugation. However, current methods for creating density gradients are typically time-consuming because of their reliance on slow passive diffusion. Here, we built a LEGO gradient mixer to rapidly create a quasi-continuous density gradient with minimal layering of concentrations using simple rotational motion. We found that rotating two layers of different concentrations at an angle can reduce the diffusion time from a few hours to mere minutes. The instrument needed to perform the movement can be constructed from low-cost components, such as Arduino and LEGO Mindstorms pieces, and has comparable efficacy to commercial gradient mixers currently available. Our results demonstrate that the creation of a linear density gradient can be achieved with minimal labor, time, and cost with this machine. With the recent advances in DNA origami production, we anticipate our findings to further improve the viability of scaling up DNA origami purification in grams quantities. Our simple process enables automated large-scale purification of functionalized DNA origami more feasible in resource-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "The importance of the basal ganglia in modulating cognitive and motor behaviors is well known, yet how the basal ganglia participate in the uniquely human behavior of speech is poorly understood. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is well positioned to facilitate two basal ganglia functions critical for speech: motor learning and gain modulation. Using a novel paradigm to study cortical-subcortical interactions during speech in patients undergoing awake DBS surgery, we found evidence for a left opercular hyperdirect pathway in humans by stimulating in the STN and examining antidromic evoked activity in the left temporal, parietal and frontal opercular cortex. These high resolution cortical and subcortical mapping data provided evidence for hyperdirect connectivity between Brocas area (typically corresponding to pars triangularis and pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus) and the STN. In addition, we observed evoked potentials consistent with the presence of monosynaptic projections from areas of opercular speech cortex that are primarily sensory, including auditory cortex, to the STN. These connections may be unique to humans, evolving alongside the ability for speech.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEUsing intracranial recordings from the basal ganglia and cortex in subjects undergoing deep brain stimulation, this study provides evidence for monosynaptic cortical inputs from motor planning, motor sensory, and auditory sensory cortices to the subthalamic nucleus. These observations suggest that in humans, the cortical-basal ganglia hyperdirect pathway is uniquely positioned to participate in speech production. Moreover, the existence of a monosynaptic connection between human sensory cortical areas and the subthalamic nucleus indicates a need to update traditional models of information transfer within cortical-basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, which has significant implications for understanding other human cognitive behavior or dysfunction.",

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent kind of leukemia among children. In this study, we aimed at evaluate the role of MAGI2-AS3 in ALL and its underlying mechanisms.\n\nMethodsqPCR was adopted to determine MAGI2-AS3, miR-452-5p, and FOXN3 expression. The malignant properties of ALL cells were assessed by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry analysis. The glucose uptake, lactate production, and ATP level were measured to evaluate glycolysis. Western blotting was performed to detect PCNA, Bcl-2, Bax, and HK2 protein levels. The interaction between MAGI2-AS3/FOXN3 and miR-452-5p was validated by luciferase reporter assay. The in vivo growth of ALL cells was determined in xenograft model.\n\nResultsMAGI2-AS3 was strikingly down-regulated in ALL samples and cells. Overexpression of MAGI2-AS3 restrained growth, glycolysis and triggered apoptosis of ALL cells. Mechanistically, MAGI2-AS3 could sponge miR-452-5p to up-regulate FOXN3. Silencing of FOXN3 abolished the anti-tumor effect of MAGI2-AS3. Finally, MAGI2-AS3 suppressed the in vivo growth of ALL cells via modulating miR-452-5p/FOXN3 axis.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate that MAGI2-AS3 delays the progression of ALL by regulating miR-452-5p/FOXN3 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The prospect of rewards can have strong modulatory effects on response preparation. Importantly, selection and execution of movements in real life happens under an environment characterized by uncertainty and dynamic changes. The current study investigated how the brains motor system adapts to the dynamic changes in the environment in pursuit of rewards. In addition, we studied how the prefrontal cognitive control system contributes in this adaptive control of motor behavior. To this end, we tested the effect of rewards and expectancy on the hallmark neural signals that reflect activity in motor and prefrontal systems, the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) and the mediofrontal (mPFC) theta oscillations, while participants performed an expected and unexpected action to retrieve rewards. To better capture the dynamic changes in neural processes represented in the LRP waveform, we decomposed the LRP into the preparation (LRPprep) and execution (LRPexec) components. The overall pattern of LRPprep and LRPexec confirmed that they each reflect motor preparation based on the expectancy and motor execution when making a response that is either or not in line with the expectations. In the comparison of LRP magnitude across task conditions, we found a greater LRPprep when large rewards were more likely, reflecting a greater motor preparation to obtain larger rewards. We also found a greater LRPexec when large rewards were presented unexpectedly, suggesting a greater motor effort placed for executing a correct movement when presented with large rewards. In the analysis of mPFC theta, we found a greater theta power prior to performing an unexpected than expected response, indicating its contribution in response conflict resolution. Collectively, these results demonstrate an optimized motor control to maximize rewards under the dynamic changes of real-life environment.",

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA plays an important role in oncogene amplification in tumour cells and poor outcomes across multiple cancers. However, the function of extrachromosomal DNA in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) is very limited. Here, we investigated the availability and function of extrachromosomal DNA in GCA from a Chinese cohort of GCA using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and immunohistochemistry. For the first time, we identified the ecDNA amplicons present in most GCA patients, and found that some oncogenes are present as ecDNA amplicons in these patients. We found that oncogene ecDNA amplicons in the GCA cohort were associated with the chromothripsis process and may be induced by accumulated DNA damage due to local dietary habits in the geographic region. Strikingly, we observed diverse correlations between the presence of ecDNA oncogene amplicons and prognosis, where ERBB2 ecDNA amplicons correlated with good prognosis, EGFR ecDNA amplicons correlated with poor prognosis, and CCNE1 ecDNA amplicons did not correlate with prognosis. Large-scale ERBB2 immunohistochemistry results from 1668 GCA patients revealed that there was a positive correlation between the presence of ERBB2 and prognosis in 2-7-year survival; however, there was a negative correlation between the presence of ERBB2 and prognosis in 0-2-year survival. Our observations indicate that the presence of ERBB2 ecDNA in GCA patients may represent a good prognosis marker.",

A mesenchymal stem cell line isolated from the dental pulp of deciduous teeth (shed cells) was cultured in a 2D monolayer and then in 3D multicellular spheroids. An image of a periapical lesion of an upper lateral incisor tooth was obtained by computed micro tomography, which was used as a model for photopolymer resin 3D printing to generate a negative frame of the lesion. The negative model served to prepare a positive model of the periapical lesion cavity in an agarose gel. Shed cells cultured in monolayers or as spheroids were seeded in the positive lesion mold before or after osteoblastic differentiation. The results showed that compared to cells cultured in monolayers, the spheroids featured uniform cellularity and had a greater viability within the lesion cavity, accompanied by a temporal reduction in the expression of mRNAs typically expressed by stem cells (Cd13, Cd29, Cd44, Cd73, and Cd90). Concomitantly, there was an increase in the expression of protein markers that characterize osteoblastic differentiation (RUNX2, ALP, and BGLAP).

Given a list of side effects and the pairs of drugs causing them, APRILE identifies a set of proteins (drug targets or non-targets) and associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms as mechanistic  explanations of associated side effects.

We show that our two new metrics--pharmacogenomic information utilization and protein-protein interaction information utilization--provide quantitative estimates of mechanism complexity. Explanations were significantly consistent with state of the art disease-gene associations for 232/239 (97%) side effects. Further, APRILE generated new insights into molecular mechanisms of four diverse categories of adverse drug reactions: infection, metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and mental disorders, including paradoxical side effects.

We report a crystal structure of RT/dsDNA complex in which RT overstepped the primer 3-end of a dsDNA substrate and created a transient P-pocket at the priming site. We performed a high-throughput screening of 300 drug-like fragments by X-ray crystallography and identified binding of two to P-pocket, which is composed of structural elements from polymerase active site, primer grip, and template-primer that are resilient to drugresistance mutations. Analogs of a fragment were synthesized of which two showed noticeable RT inhibition. An engineered RT/DNA aptamer complex trapped the transient P-pocket in solution. Structures of the RT/DNA complex were determined with a fragment and a synthesized analog bound at P-pocket by single-particle cryo-EM. Identification of P-pocket and the devised structurebased platform provide an opportunity for designing new types of polymerase inhibitors.",

Therapeutically, they are some of the most cost-effective drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases ranging from skin rashes to COVID-19, but their use is limited by adverse effects. Glucocorticoids exert their effects via the glucocorticoid receptor, a type I nuclear hormone receptor which modulates gene expression. The transcriptional activity of some related, but nuclear restricted, type II nuclear hormone receptors can be enhanced by a family of intracellular transport proteins, the fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). We find that the transcriptional activity of the GR can be altered by a sub-set of FABP family members dependent on the GR-ligand. The ability of some FABPs to selectively promote or limit the transcriptional activity of the GR in a ligand-dependent manner could facilitate the discovery of drugs that narrow GR activity to only the desired subset of therapeutically relevant genes.",

Here, we describe a motif-centric phosphoproteomics approach combined with multiplexed isobaric labeling, in which in vitro kinase reaction is used to generate the targeted phosphopeptides, which are spiked into one of the isobaric channels to increase detectability. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate selective and comprehensive quantification of targeted phosphopeptides by using multiple kinases for motif-centric channels. Over 7,000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites were quantified from several tens of {micro}g of starting materials. This approach enables the quantification of multiple phosphorylation pathways under physiological or pathological regulation in a motif-centric manner.\n\nMotivationSensitivity for detecting phosphopeptides with a particular phosphorylation motif is limited, especially for tyrosine phosphopeptides.",

HAPPE+ER also includes post-processing reports of both data quality and pipeline quality metrics to facilitate the evaluation and reporting of data processing in a standardized manner. Finally, HAPPE+ER includes a post-processing script to facilitate generating ERP figures and measures for statistical analysis.

    "abstract": "Episodic memory declines with advancing adult age. This decline is particularly pronounced when associations between items and their contexts need to be formed. According to theories of neural communication, the precise coupling of gamma power to the phase of the theta rhythm supports associative memory formation. To investigate whether age differences in associative memory are related to compromised theta-gamma coupling, we took electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during the encoding phase of an item-context association task. Fifty-eight younger and 55 older adults studied pictures of objects superimposed on background scenes. In a recognition test, objects were presented on old or new backgrounds, and participants responded if they had seen (1) the object and (2) the object-scene pair. Theta-gamma coupling supported pair memory formation in both age groups. Whereas pair memory was associated with coupling closer to the peak of the theta rhythm, item-only memory was associated with a deviation in phase angle relative to pair memory. Furthermore, a stable relation between coupling phase and pair memory performance demonstrated that coupling closer to the peak is beneficial for associative memory. Critically, older adults lower pair memory was accompanied by a shift in coupling phase relative to younger adults. In concert, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that decrements in the precision with which gamma power is coupled to the theta phase underlie the decline of associative memory in normal cognitive aging.\n\nSignificance StatementAccording to prominent theories of neural communication, the precise coordination of oscillatory activity enables the formation of associative memories. We propose that normal cognitive aging impairs associative memory formation by compromising the precision of neural communication. We show that the coupling of high-frequency gamma power to low-frequency theta phase supports associative memory formation in both younger and older adults, with coupling closer to the theta peak benefitting memory performance. However, compared to younger adults, the coupling phase angle is shifted and more variable in older adults. We conclude that alterations in the precision of theta-gamma coupling contribute to adult age differences in associative memory.",

    "abstract": "Medical students and professional healthcare providers often underestimate patients pain, together with decreased neural responses to pain information in the anterior insula (AI), a brain region implicated in self-pain processing and negative affect. However, the functional significance and specificity of these neural changes remains debated. Across two experiments, we recruited university medical students and emergency nurses to test the role of healthcare experience on the brain reactivity to others pain, emotions, and beliefs, using both pictorial and verbal cues. Brain responses to self-pain was also assessed and compared with those to observed pain. Our results confirmed that healthcare experience decreased the activity in AI in response to others suffering. This effect was independent from stimulus modality (pictures or texts), but specific for pain, as it did not generalize to inferences about other mental or affective states. Furthermore, representational similarity and multivariate pattern analysis revealed that healthcare experience impacted specifically a component of the neural representation of others pain that is shared with that of first-hand nociception, and related more to AI than to other pain-responsive regions. Taken together, our study suggests a decreased propensity to appraise others suffering as ones own, associated with a reduced recruitment of pain-specific information in AI. These findings provide new insights into neural mechanisms leading to pain underestimation by caregivers in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common severe neurological disorders worldwide. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) define epilepsy as a brain disorder that generates (1) two unprovoked seizures more than 24 hrs apart, or (2) one unprovoked seizure with at least 60% risk of recurrence over the next ten years. Complete remission has been defined as ten years seizure free with the last five years medication free. This requires a cost-effective ambulatory ultra-long term out-patient monitoring solution. The common practice of self-reporting is inaccurate. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) interpretation is becoming increasingly common, but other data modalities such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) are simpler to collect and often recorded simultaneously with EEG. Both recordings contain biomarkers in the detection of seizures.\n\nHere, we propose a state-of-the-art performing AI system that combines EEG and ECG for seizure detection, tested on clinical data with early evidence demonstrating generalization across hospitals. The model was trained and validated on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) dataset. To evaluate performance in a clinical setting, we conducted nonpatient-specific inference-only tests on three out-of-distribution datasets, including EPILEPSIAE (30 patients) and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) in Sydney, Australia (31 patients shortlisted by neurologists and 30 randomly selected). Across all datasets, our multimodal approach improves the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) by an average margin of 6.71% and 14.42% for prior state-of-the-art approaches using EEG and ECG alone, respectively. Our models state-of-the-art performance and robustness to out-ofdistribution datasets can improve the accuracy and efficiency of epilepsy diagnoses.",

We confirmed that newly learned habits rely more on the anterior putamen with activation extending into caudate and nucleus accumbens. Motor and associative components of everyday-life habits were identified. We found that motor-dominant stimulus-response associations developed outside the laboratory primarily engaged posterior dorsal putamen, supplementary motor area (SMA) and cerebellum. Importantly, associative components were also represented in the posterior putamen. Thus, common neural representations for both naturalistic and laboratory-based habits were found in the left posterior and right anterior putamen. These findings suggest a partial common striatal substrate for habitual actions that are performed predominantly by stimulus-response associations represented in the posterior striatum. The overlapping neural substrates for laboratory and everyday-life habits supports the use of both methods for the analysis of habitual behaviour.",

Accurate localization is extremely important given its proximity to other thalamic nuclei. We utilized single orientation quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) at 3T to directly visualize the VIM.\n\nMethodsFour adult volunteers, one adult cadaver, and an essential tremor patient were scanned on a 3T MRI using a multi-echo gradient echo sequence. QSM images were generated using the improved sparse linear equation and least-squares (iLSQR) algorithm. Two adult subjects underwent multiple head orientation imaging for multi-orientation QSM reconstruction. The VIM was prospectively identified with direct visualization as well as indirect landmark-based localization.\n\nResultsThe bilateral VIM was consistently identified as a hypointense structure within the lateral thalamus, appearing similar on multi-orientation and single-orientation QSM, corresponding to the myelinated dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT). The indirect method resulted in a comparatively inferomedial localization, at times missing the VIM and DRTT.\n\nConclusionSingle-orientation QSM offers a clinically feasible, non-invasive imaging-based approach to directly localize the VIM.",

The arrow of time, central to thermodynamics in physics, is a hallmark of non-equilibrium and serves to distinguish between reversible and non-reversible dynamics in any system. Here, we use a deep learning Temporal Evolution NETwork (TENET) framework to discover the asymmetry in the flow of events,  arrow of time, in human brain signals, which provides a quantification of how the brain is driven by the interplay of the environment and internal processes. Specifically, we show in large-scale HCP neuroimaging data from a thousand participants that the levels of non-reversibility/non-equilibrium change across time and cognitive state with higher levels during tasks than when resting. The level of non-equilibrium also differentiates brain activity during the seven different cognitive tasks. Furthermore, using the large-scale UCLA neuroimaging dataset of 265 participants, we show that the TENET framework can distinguish with high specificity and sensitivity resting state in control and different neuropsychiatric diseases (schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and ADHD) with higher levels of non-equilibrium found in health. Overall, the present thermodynamics-based machine learning framework provides vital new insights into the fundamental tenets of brain dynamics for orchestrating the interactions between behaviour and brain in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of new immunotherapies necessitates appropriate probes to monitor the presence and distribution of distinct immune cell populations. Considering the key role of CD4+ T cells in regulating immunological processes, we generated novel single-domain antibodies (nanobodies, Nbs) that specifically recognize human CD4. After in depth analysis of their binding properties, recognized epitopes, and effects on T cell proliferation, activation and cytokine release, we selected CD4 Nbs that did not interfere with crucial T cell processes in vitro and converted them into immune tracers for non-invasive molecular imaging.\n\nBy optical imaging, we demonstrate the ability of a high-affinity CD4-Nb to specifically visualize CD4+ cells in vivo using a xenograft model. Furthermore, time-resolved immune positron emission tomography (immunoPET) of a human CD4 knock-in mouse model showed rapid accumulation of 64Cu-radiolabeled CD4-Nb in CD4+ T cell-rich tissues. We propose that the CD4 Nbs presented here could serve as versatile probes for stratifying patients and monitoring individual immune responses during personalized immunotherapy in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most encountered organisms in a polymicrobial chronic wound infection. Production of multiple virulence factors by this duo delays wound healing process. Notably, P. aeruginosa displays enhanced virulence in the presence of S. aureus by a peptidoglycan sensing mechanism. Thus, novel therapies are imperative to address polymicrobial infections effectively. Previously, it has been suggested that targeting S. aureus might be a possible approach to reduce the severity of P. aeruginosa in a polymicrobial infection. In this aspect, we have used 2-[(Methylamino)methyl]phenol (2-MAMP), our previously reported QS inhibitor to target S. aureus and phenotypically determine the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa under this condition. Analysis of major virulence factors of Pseudomonas viz. biofilm, pyocyanin and pyoveridine showed a significant reduction. The competitive index (CI) and relative increase ratio (RIR) were determined to understand the organisms interaction in co-culture. Results indicated competitiveness among the strains and on increasing ratios of S. aureus cells, co-existence was noticed. Further, as a sensible approach antibiotic - antivirulence drug combinations were tested on co-culture. Significant improvement in the growth inhibition was observed. Our preliminary results presented here would enable further research to address polymicrobial infection in a novel way.",

    "abstract": "The United States has thousands of invasive species, representing a sizable, but unknown burden to the national economy. Given the potential economic repercussions of invasive species, quantifying these costs is of paramount importance both for national economies and invasion management. Here, we used a novel global database of invasion costs (InvaCost) to quantify the overall costs of invasive species in the United States across spatiotemporal, taxonomic, and socioeconomic scales. From 1960 to 2020, reported invasion costs totaled $4.52 trillion (USD 2017). Considering only observed, highly reliable costs, this total cost reached $1.22 trillion with an average annual cost of $19.94 billion/year. These costs increased from $2.00 billion annually between 1960-1969 to $21.08 billion annually between 2010-2020. Most costs (73%) were related to resource damages and losses ($896.22 billion), as opposed to management expenditures ($46.54 billion). Moreover, the majority of costs were reported from invaders from terrestrial habitats ($643.51 billion, 53%) and agriculture was the most impacted sector ($509.55 billion). From a taxonomic perspective, mammals ($234.71 billion) and insects ($126.42 billion) were the taxonomic groups responsible for the greatest costs. Considering the apparent rising costs of invasions, coupled with increasing numbers of invasive species and the current lack of cost information for most known invaders, our findings provide critical information for policymakers and managers.",

    "abstract": "Spina bifida (SB) is a debilitating birth defect caused by multiple gene and environment interactions. Though SB shows non-Mendelian inheritance, genetic factors contribute to an estimated 70% of cases. Nevertheless, identifying human mutations conferring SB risk is challenging due to its relative rarity, genetic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance and environmental influences that hamper GWAS approaches to untargeted discovery. Thus, SB genetic studies may suffer from population substructure and/or selection bias introduced by typical candidate gene searches. We report a population based, ancestry-matched whole-genome sequence analysis of SB genetic predisposition using a systems biology strategy to interrogate 298 case-control subject genomes (149 pairs). Genes that were enriched in likely gene disrupting (LGD), rare protein-coding variants were subjected to machine learning analysis to identify genes in which LGD variants occur with a different frequency in cases vs. controls and so discriminate between these groups. Those genes with high discriminatory potential for SB significantly enriched pathways pertaining to carbon metabolism, inflammation, innate immunity, cytoskeletal regulation and essential transcriptional regulation, indicating their impact on the pathogenesis of human SB. Additionally, interrogation of conserved non-coding sequences identified robust variant enrichment in regulatory regions of several transcription factors critical to embryonic development. This genome-wide perspective offers an effective approach to interrogation of coding and non-coding sequence variant contributions to rare complex genetic disorders.",

The majority of both cis- and trans-acting genetic signals are unique for a single protein, although our results also highlight numerous highly pleiotropic genetic effects on protein levels and demonstrate that a proteins genetic association profile reflects certain characteristics of the protein, including its location in protein networks, tissue specificity and intolerance to loss of function mutations.

    "abstract": "Memory of an ordered sequence of distinct events requires encoding the temporal order as well as the intervals that separates these events. In this study, using order place association task where the animal learns to associate the location of the food pellet to the order of entry into the event arena, we probe the nature of temporal order memory in mice. In our task, individual trials, become distinct events, as the animal is trained to form unique association between entry order and a correct location. The inter-trial intervals (> 30 mins) are chosen deliberately to minimise the working memory contributions. We develop this paradigm initially using 4 order place associates and later extend it to 5 paired associates. Our results show that animals not only acquire these explicit (entry order to place) associations but also higher order associations that can only be inferred implicitly from the temporal order of these events. As an indicator of such higher order learning during the probe trail the mice exhibit predominantly prospective errors that declines proportionally with temporal distance. On the other hand, prior to acquiring the sequence the retrospective errors are dominant. Additionally, we also tested the nature of such acquisitions when temporal order CS is presented along with flavour as a compound stimulus comprising of order and flavour both simultaneously being paired with location. Results from these experiments indicate that the animal learns both order-place and flavour-place associations. Comparing with pure order place training, we find that the additional flavour in compound training did not interfere with the ability of the animals to acquire the order place associations. When tested remotely, pure order place associations could be retrieved only after a reminder training. Further higher order associations representing the temporal relationship between the events is markedly absent in the remote time.",

Despite the small size, technological advances have paved the way to effectively assess cardiac functions of zebrafish. Here, we present a novel art for long-term simultaneous monitoring and analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) in multiple zebrafish with controlled environment. The system helps minimize the effect of anesthetic drug and temperature to cardiac rhythm side effects as well as save time and efforts by 40-50 fold compared with the conventional approach. We further employed the system to study the Na+ sensitivity in the development of sinus arrest in Tg(SCN5A-D1275N) fish, a study model of the sick sinus syndrome, as well as the relationship between this variant and drug administration. The novel ECG system developed in this study holds promise to greatly accelerate other cardiovascular studies and drug screening using zebrafish.",

We employ gold nanoporous microelectrodes that maintain robust sensor performance even after repeated tissue implantation and extended exposure to the tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate continuous in vivo monitoring of concentrations of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin at multiple tumor sites in a rodent model, and demonstrate clear differences in pharmacokinetics relative to the circulation that could meaningfully affect drug efficacy and safety. This platform could prove valuable for preclinical in vivo characterization of cancer therapeutics, and may offer a foundation for future clinical applications.",

However, the poor scalability and high complexity of most FD-NIRS systems assembled to date have contributed to its limited clinical impact. To address these shortcomings, we present a scalable, digital-based FD-NIRS platform capable of measuring optical properties and tissue chromophore concentrations in real-time. The system provides single-channel FD-NIRS amplitude/phase, optical property, and chromophore data at a maximum display rate of 36.6 kHz, 17.9 kHz, and 10.2 kHz, respectively, and can be scaled to multiple channels as well as integrated into a handheld format. The entire system is enabled by several innovations including an ultra-high-speed k-nearest neighbor lookup table method (maximum of 250,000 inversions/s for large 2500x700 table of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients), embedded FPGA and CPU high-speed co-processing, and high-speed data transfer (due to on-board processing). We show that our 6-wavelength, broad modulation bandwidth (1-400 MHz) system can be used to perform 2D high-density spatial mapping of optical properties.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening emergency with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Rapid and accurate detection of ICH is crucial for patients to get a timely treatment. In order to achieve the automatic diagnosis of ICH, most deep learning models rely on huge amounts of slice labels for training. Unfortunately, the manual annotation of CT slices by radiologists is time-consuming and costly. To diagnose ICH, in this work, we propose to use an attention-based multiple instance learning (Att-MIL) approach implemented through the combination of an attention-based convolutional neural network (Att-CNN) and a variational Gaussian process for multiple instance learning (VGP-MIL). Only labels at scan-level are necessary for training. Our method trains the model using scan labels and assigns each slice with an attention weight, which can be used to provide slice-level predictions, and uses the VGPMIL model based on low-dimensional features extracted by the Att-CNN to obtain improved predictions both at slice and scan levels. To analyze the performance of the proposed approach, our model has been trained on 1150 scans from an RSNA dataset and evaluated on 490 scans from an external CQ500 dataset. Our method outperforms other methods using the same scan-level training and is able to achieve comparable or even better results than other methods relying on slicelevel annotations.",

However, one must exercise caution in interpreting algorithm assertions, particularly in pathology where an incorrect classification could have profound impacts on a patient, and rare classes exist that may not have been seen by the algorithm during training. A more robust approach would be to identify areas of an image for which the pathologist should concentrate their effort to make a final diagnosis. This anomaly detection strategy would be ideal for WSI, but given the extremely high resolution and large file sizes, such an approach is difficult. Here, we combine progressive generative adversarial networks with a flexible adversarial autoencoder architecture capable of learning the \"normal distribution\" of WSIs of normal skin tissue at extremely high resolution and demonstrate its anomaly detection performance. Our approach yielded pixel-level accuracy of 89% for identifying melanoma, suggesting that our label-free anomaly detection pipeline is a viable strategy for generating high quality annotations - without tedious manual segmentation by pathologists.

They are premotor to all jaw-opening and tongue muscles. Stimulation of either, in awake animals, opens the jaw, while IRtPhox2b alone also protracts the tongue. Moreover, stationary stimulation of IRtPhox2b entrains a rhythmic alternation of tongue protraction and retraction, synchronized with jaw opening and closing, that mimics lapping. Finally, fiber photometric recordings show that IRtPhox2b is active during volitional lapping. Our study identifies one of the long hypothesized subcortical nuclei underpinning a stereotyped feeding behavior.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relative contributions of historical and anthropogenic factors to declines in genetic diversity is important for informing conservation action. Using genome-wide DNA of fresh and historic specimens, including that of two species widely thought to be extinct, we investigated fluctuations in genetic diversity and present the first complete phylogenomic tree for all nine species of the threatened shorebird genus Numenius, known as whimbrels and curlews. Most species faced sharp declines in effective population size, a proxy for genetic diversity, soon after the Last Glacial Maximum (around 20,000 years ago). These declines occurred prior to the Anthropocene and in spite of an increase in breeding area predicted by environmental niche modelling, suggesting that they were not caused by climatic or recent anthropogenic factors. Crucially, these genetic diversity declines coincide with mass extinctions of mammalian megafauna in the Northern Hemisphere. Demise of ecosystem-engineering megafauna which maintained open habitats would have been detrimental for grassland and tundra-breeding Numenius shorebirds. Our work suggests that the impact of historical factors such as megafaunal extinction may have had wider repercussions on present-day population dynamics of open habitat biota than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is often required in patients with pulmonary disease to maintain adequate gas exchange. Despite improved knowledge regarding the risks of over ventilating the lung, ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) remains a major clinical problem due to inhomogeneities within the diseased lung itself as well as the need to increase pressure or volume of oxygen to the lung as a life-saving measure. VILI is characterized by increased physical forces exerted within the lung, which results in cell death, inflammation and long-term fibrotic remodeling. Animal models can be used to study VILI, but it is challenging to distinguish the contributions of individual cell types in such a setup. In vitro models, which allow for controlled stretching of specific lung cell types have emerged as a potential option, but these models and the membranes used in them are unable to recapitulate some key features of the lung such as the 3D nanofibrous structure of the alveolar basement membrane while also allowing for cells to be cultured at an air liquid interface (ALI) and undergo increased mechanical stretch that mimics VILI. Here we develop a lung on a chip device with a nanofibrous synthetic membrane to provide ALI conditions and controllable stretching, including injurious stretching mimicking VILI. The lung on a chip device consists of a thin (i.e. [~]20 {micro}m) stretchable poly(caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibrous membrane placed between two channels fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using 3D printed molds. We demonstrate that this lung on a chip device can be used to induce mechanotrauma in lung epithelial cells due to cyclic pathophysiologic stretch ([~]25%) that mimics clinical VILI. Pathophysiologic stretch induces cell injury and subsequently cell death, which results in loss of the epithelial monolayer, a feature mimicking the early stages of VILI. We also validate the potential of our lung on a chip device to be used to explore cellular pathways known to be altered with mechanical stretch and show that pathophysiologic stretch of lung epithelial cells causes nuclear translocation of the mechanotransducers YAP/TAZ. In conclusion, we show that a breathable lung on a chip device with a nanofibrous membrane can be easily fabricated using 3D printing of the lung on a chip molds and that this model can be used to explore pathomechanisms in mechanically induced lung injury.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel heuristic to predict RNA secondary structure formation pathways that has two components: (i) a folding algorithm and (ii) a kinetic ansatz. This heuristic is inspired by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, by which molecules follow alternative folding pathways to their native structure, some much faster than others. Similarly, our algorithm RAFFT starts by generating an ensemble of concurrent folding pathways ending in multiple metastable structures, which is in contrast with traditional thermodynamic approaches that find single structures with minimal free energies. When we constrained the algorithm to predict only 50 structures per sequence, nearnative structures were found for RNA molecules of length [&le;] 200 nucleotides. Our heuristic has been tested on the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE): an ensemble of 68 distinct structures allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. Thanks to the fast Fourier transform on which RAFFT is based, these computations are efficient, with complexity [O](L2 log L).",

    "abstract": "Low-density Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (e.g. fewer than 32 electrodes) are widely-used in research and clinical practice and enable scalable brain function measurement across a variety of settings and populations. Though a number of automated pipelines have recently been proposed to standardize and optimize EEG preprocessing for high-density systems with state-of-the-art methods, few solutions have emerged that are compatible with low-density systems. However, low-density data often include long recording times and/or large sample sizes that would benefit from similar standardization and automation with contemporary methods. To address this need, we propose the HAPPE In Low Electrode Electroencephalography (HAPPILEE) pipeline as a standardized, automated pipeline optimized for EEG recordings with low density channel layouts of any size. HAPPILEE processes task-free (e.g. resting-state) and task-related EEG, and event-related potential (ERP) data, from raw files through a series of processing steps including filtering, line noise reduction, bad channel detection, artifact rejection from continuous data, segmentation, and bad segment rejection that have all been optimized for low density data. HAPPILEE also includes post-processing reports of data and pipeline quality metrics to facilitate the evaluation and reporting of data quality and processing-related changes to the data in a standardized manner. We describe multiple approaches with both recorded and simulated EEG data to optimize and validate pipeline performance.

    "abstract": "The common {gamma}-chain receptor cytokines coordinate the proliferation and function of immune cell populations. One of these cytokines, interleukin (IL)-2, has potential as a therapy in autoimmune disease but is limited in effectiveness by its modest specificity toward regulatory T cells (Tregs). Engineering Treg-selective IL-2 has primarily focused on retaining binding to the high-affinity receptor, expressed more highly on Tregs, while reducing binding to the lower affinity receptor with broader expression. However, other parameters, such as the orientation and valency of Fc fusion, have signaling effects that have never been systematically explored. Here, we systematically profiled the signaling responses to a panel of wild type and mutein IL-2-Fc fusions across time, cell types, and concentrations. Exploring these responses, we found that dimeric muteins have unique specificity for Tregs through binding avidity. A mechanistic model of receptor interactions could capture these effects and directed the design of tetravalent IL-2-Fc fusions with greater Treg specificity than possible with current design strategies. Exploration of other surface targets on Tregs revealed that there are no other binding moieties that could be fused to IL-2 for greater selectivity. Instead, IL2R itself is a maximally unique surface target for Tregs, and so avidity is likely the only route to more selective Treg interaction. However, the binding model revealed that asymmetrical, multivalent IL-2 fusions can bias avidity effects toward IL2R for even further enhanced Treg selectivity. These findings present a comprehensive analysis of how ligand properties and their effects on surface receptor-ligand interactions translate to selective activation of immune cell populations, and consequently reveals two new routes toward therapeutic cytokines with superior Treg selectivity that can be exploited for designing selective therapies in many other contexts.\n\nSignificance StatementSignaling in off-target immune cells has hindered the effectiveness of IL-2 as an immunotherapy. We show that IL-2-Fc fusions with higher valency can exhibit enhanced regulatory T cell selectivity. This altered selectivity is explained by the kinetics of surface receptor-ligand binding and can be quantitatively predicted using a multivalent binding model. Using these insights, we successfully develop two new strategies for IL-2 therapies with unprecedented selectivity.\n\nHighlightsO_LICurrent IL-2 therapies are limited by a selectivity/target potency tradeoff.\nC_LIO_LIMultivalency enhances selectivity for Tregs through IL2R avidity.\nC_LIO_LITreg selectivity cannot be enhanced by targeting other surface protein markers.\nC_LIO_LIMultivalency can decouple selectivity from signaling using asymmetric cytokine fusions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for over 200 million infections and 400,000 deaths per year. At multiple stages during its complex life cycle, P. falciparum expresses several essential proteins tethered to its surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are critical for biological processes such as parasite egress and reinvasion of host red blood cells. Targeting this pathway therapeutically has the potential to broadly impact parasite development across several life stages. Here, we characterize an upstream component of GPI anchor biosynthesis, the putative phosphomannomutase (EC 5.4.2.8) of the parasites, HAD5 (PF3D7_1017400). We confirm the phosphomannomutase and phosphoglucomutase activity of purified recombinant HAD5. By regulating expression of HAD5 in transgenic parasites, we demonstrate that HAD5 is required for malaria parasite egress and erythrocyte reinvasion. Finally, we determine the three-dimensional crystal structure of HAD5 and identify a substrate analog that specifically inhibits HAD5, compared to orthologous human phosphomannomutases. These findings demonstrate that the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway is exceptionally sensitive to inhibition, and that HAD5 has potential as a multi-stage antimalarial target.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding of plant DNA recovered from environmental samples, termed environmental DNA (eDNA), has been used to detect invasive species, track biodiversity changes and reconstruct past ecosystems. The P6 loop of the trnL intron is the most widely utilized gene region for metabarcoding plants due to the short fragment length and subsequent ease of recovery from degraded DNA, which is characteristic of environmental samples. However, the taxonomic resolution for this gene region is limited, often precluding species level identification. Additionally, targeting gene regions using universal primers can bias results as some taxa will amplify more effectively than others. To increase the ability of DNA metabarcoding to better resolve flowering plant species (angiosperms) within environmental samples, and reduce bias in amplification, we developed a multi-gene targeted capture method that simultaneously targets 20 chloroplast gene regions in a single assay across all flowering plant species. Using this approach, we effectively recovered multiple chloroplast gene regions for three species within artificial DNA mixtures down to 0.001 ng/{micro}L of DNA. We tested the detection level of this approach, successfully recovering target genes for 10 flowering plant species. Finally, we applied this approach to sediment samples containing unknown compositions of environmental DNA and confidently detected plant species that were later verified with observation data. Targeting multiple chloroplast gene regions in environmental samples enabled species-level information to be recovered from complex DNA mixtures. Thus, the method developed here, confers an improved level of data on community composition, which can be used to better understand flowering plant assemblages in environmental samples.",

    "abstract": "Viral infection involves complex set of events orchestrated by multiple viral proteins. To identify functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we performed transcriptomic analyses of cells expressing individual viral proteins. Expression of Nsp14, a protein involved in viral RNA replication, provoked a dramatic remodeling of the transcriptome that strongly resembled that observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Nsp14 expression altered the splicing of more than 1,000 genes and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of circRNAs, which are linked to innate immunity. These effects were independent of the Nsp14 exonuclease activity and required the N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain of the protein. Activation of the NFkB pathway and increased expression of CXCL8 occurred early upon Nsp14 expression. We identified IMPDH2, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of guanine nucleotides biosynthesis, as a key mediator of these effects. Nsp14 expression caused an increase in GTP cellular levels, and the effect of Nsp14 was strongly decreased in presence of IMPDH2 inhibitors. Together, our data demonstrate an unknown role for Nsp14 with implications for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease involving cystic lung destruction by invasive LAM cells. These cells harbor loss-of-function mutations in TSC2, conferring constitutive mTORC1 signaling. Rapamycin is the only clinically approved disease-modifying treatment, but its action is cytostatic and disease progresses upon its withdrawal. There is a critical need to identify novel agents that prevent the invasive phenotype and/or eradicate the neoplastic LAM cells. Here, we employed novel cellular and extracellular models to screen for candidate therapeutics in a physiologically relevant setting. We observed that lung-mimetic hydrogel culture of pluripotent stem cell-derived diseased cells more faithfully recapitulates human LAM biology compared to conventional culture on two-dimensional tissue culture plastic. Leveraging our culture system, we conducted a three-dimensional drug screen using a custom 800-compound library, tracking cytotoxicity and invasion modulation phenotypes at the single cell level. We identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a group of anti-invasive agents that are also selectively cytotoxic towards TSC2-/- cells. Unexpectedly, we observed that next generation ATP-competitive mTORC1/2 inhibitors potentiate invasion. We determined anti-invasive effects of HDAC inhibitors to be independent of genotype, while selective cell death is mTORC1-dependent and mediated by apoptosis. Drug performance was subsequently evaluated at the single cell level in zebrafish xenografts. We observed consistent therapeutic efficacy in vivo at equivalent concentrations to those used in vitro, substantiating HDAC inhibitors as potential therapeutic candidates for pursuit in patients with LAM.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe performed a drug screen in 3D and discovered HDAC inhibitors exhibit therapeutic efficacy in models of the lung disease lymphangioleiomyomatosis.",

Heat and acidity can limit trypanosomatid infection in warm-blooded hosts, and could shape infection resistance in insects as well. The colony-level endothermy and acidic guts of social bees provide unique opportunities to study how temperature and acidity shape insect-parasite associations. We compared temperature and pH tolerance between three trypanosomatid parasites from social bees and a related trypanosomatid from poikilothermic mosquitoes, which have alkaline guts.\n\nRelative to the mosquito parasites, all three bee parasites had higher heat tolerance that reflected levels of endothermy in hosts. Heat tolerance of the honey bee parasite Crithidia mellificae was exceptional for its genus, implicating honey bee endothermy as a filter of parasite establishment. The lesser heat tolerance of the emerging Lotmaria passim suggests possible spillover from a less endothermic host. Whereas both honey bee parasites tolerated the acidic pHs found in bee intestines, mosquito parasites tolerated the alkaline conditions found in mosquito midguts, suggesting that both gut pH and temperature could structure host-parasite specificity. Elucidating how host temperature and gut pH affect infection--and corresponding parasite adaptations to these factors--could help explain trypanosomatids distribution among insects and invasion of mammals.",

Classical methods of testing for natural selection, such as Tajimas D and its relatives, require the null model to have constant population size over time and therefore can confound demographic change with natural selection.{rho} can directly incorporate a null hypothesis reflecting general demographic histories. It has a natural Bayesian interpretation as an approximation to the log-probability of the null model, given the data. We use simulations to show that{rho} has greater power than Tajimas D to detect departure from neutrality for a range of scenarios of positive and negative selection. We also show how{rho} can be adapted to account for sequencing error. Application to the ACKR1 (FYO) gene in humans supported previous studies inferring positive selection in sub-Saharan populations which were based on inter-population comparisons. However, we did not find the signal of selection to be maximal in the region of the FY*O or Duffy-null allele in these populations. We also applied{rho} to investigate in greater detail a region on the 2q11.1 band of the human genome that has previously been identified as showing evidence of selection. This was done for a range of populations: for the European populations we incorporated a demographic history with a bottleneck corresponding to the putative out of Africa event. We were able to localise signals of selection to some specific regions and genes. Overall, we suggest that{rho} will be a useful tool for identifying genomic regions that may be subject to natural selection.",

High tumor mutation burden (TMB) and high levels of tumor-infiltrating T cells have been associated with response to immunotherapy, but integrative models to predict clinical benefit using DNA or RNA alone have not been comprehensively explored. We sequenced DNA and RNA from melanoma patients receiving CPB, and aggregated previously published data, yielding whole exome sequencing data for 189 patients and bulk RNA sequencing data for 178 patients. Using these datasets, we derived genomic and transcriptomic factors that predict overall survival (OS) and response to immunotherapy. Using whole-exome DNA data alone, we calculated T cell burden (TCB) and B cell burden (BCB) based on rearranged TCR/Ig DNA sequences and found that patients whose melanomas have high TMB together with either high TCB or high BCB survived longer and had higher response rates as compared to patients with either low TMB or TCB/BCB. Next, using bulk RNA-Seq data, differential expression analysis identified 83 genes associated with high or low OS. By combining pairs of immune-expressed genes with tumor-expressed genes, we identified three gene pairs associated with response and survival (Bonferroni P<0.05). All three gene pair models were validated in an independent cohort (n=180) (Bonferroni P<0.05). The best performing gene pair model included the lymphocyte-expressed MAP4K1 (Mitogen- Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase 1) combined with the transcription factor TBX3 (T-Box Transcription Factor 3) which is overexpressed in poorly differentiated melanomas. We conclude that RNA-based (MAP4K1&TBX3) or DNA-based (TCB&TMB) models combining immune and tumor measures improve predictions of outcome after checkpoint blockade in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Brain evolution is hypothesized to be driven by neuroarchitectural requirements for behavioral performance. Assessments of such needs should be informed by the nature of sensory and motor processes underpinning behavior. We developed a novel metric to estimate the relative neuroanatomical investments required to perform tasks varying in sensorimotor and processing demands across polymorphic and polyethic workers of the leafcutter ant Atta cephalotes and quantified brain size and structure to examine their correspondence with our computational approximations. Investment in multi-sensory integration and motor requirements for task performance was estimated to be greatest for media workers whose leaf-harvesting repertoire involves the most diverse and demanding sensory and motor processes, including plant discrimination, leaf cutting, and fragment transportation. Volumetric analysis of confocal brain images revealed that absolute brain size increased with worker size and compartmental scaling allometries among functionally specialized brain compartments differed among polymorphic workers. The mushroom bodies, centers of sensory integration and learning, and the antennal lobes, which process olfactory inputs, were significantly larger in medias than in minim workers (fungal gardeners) and major workers (\"soldiers\"), which had lower estimated task-related neural demands. Minims had a proportionally larger central complex, perhaps to control navigation in subterranean fungal garden chambers. These results indicate that variation in task performance requirements has selected for adaptive variation in brain size and mosaic scaling.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic variability in immune system genes can often underlie variability in immune responses to pathogens. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are emerging as critical determinants of both SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and long-term immunity, either after recovery or vaccination. A hallmark of COVID-19 is its highly variable severity and breadth of immune responses between individuals. To address the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon we analyzed the proteolytic processing of S1 spike glycoprotein precursor antigenic peptides by 10 common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), a polymorphic intracellular enzyme that can regulate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses by generating or destroying antigenic peptides. We utilized a systematic proteomic approach that allows the concurrent analysis of hundreds of trimming reactions in parallel, thus better emulating antigen processing in the cell. While all ERAP1 allotypes were capable of producing optimal ligands for MHC class I molecules, including known SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, they presented significant differences in peptide sequences produced, suggesting allotype-dependent sequence biases. Allotype 10, previously suggested to be enzymatically deficient, was rather found to be functionally distinct from other allotypes. Our findings suggest that common ERAP1 allotypes can be a major source of heterogeneity in antigen processing and through this mechanism contribute to variable immune responses to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Despite the advances in the techniques of indirect estimation of leaf area, the destructive measurement approaches have still remained as the reference and the most accurate methods. However, even utilizing the modern sensors and applications usually requires the laborious and time-consuming practice of unfolding and analyzing the single leaves, separately. In the present study, a volumetric approach was tested to determine the pile leaf area based on the ratio of leaf volume divided by thickness. For this purpose, the suspension technique was used for volumetry, which is based on the simple practice and calculations of the Archimedes principle. The results indicated that the wheat volumetric leaf area (VLA), had an approximately 1:1 correlation with the conventionally measured optical leaf area (OLA). Exclusion of the midrib volume from calculations, did not affect the estimation error (i.e. NRMSE less than 2.61%); however, improved the slope of the linear model by about 6%. The error of sampling for determining the mean leaf thickness of the pile, was also less than 2% throughout the season. Besides, a more practical and facilitated version of the pile volumetry was tested using a Specific Gravity Bench (SGB), which is currently available as a laboratory equipment. As an important observation, which was also expectable according to the 3D shape of the leaf (i.e. expansion in a 2D plane), it was evidenced that the variations in the OLA exactly follows the pattern of the changes in the leaf volume. Accordingly, it was suggested that the relative leaf areas of various experimental treatments may be compared directly based on the volume, and independently of leaf thickness. Furthermore, no considerable difference was observed among the OLAs measured using various image resolutions (NRMSE < 0.212%); which indicates that even the current superfast scanners with low resolutions as 200 dpi may be used for a precision optical measurement of leaf area. It is expected that utilizing the reliable and simple concept of volumetric leaf area, based on which the measurement time may be independent of the sample size, facilitate the laborious practice of leaf area measurement; and consequently, improve the precision of the field experiments.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is composed of functional networks that have a modular topology, where brain regions are organized into communities that form internally dense (segregated) and externally sparse (integrated) subnetworks that underlie higher-order cognitive functioning. It is hypothesized that amyloid-{beta} and tau pathology in preclinical Alzheimers disease (AD) spread through functional networks, disrupting neural communication that results in cognitive dysfunction. We used high-resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses to test whether in vivo amyloid-{beta} and tau burden was associated with the segregation and integration of brain functional connections, and episodic memory, in cognitively-unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers who are expected to develop early-onset AD dementia in approximately 13 years on average. Compared to non-carriers, mutation carriers exhibited less functional segregation and integration in posterior default-mode network (DMN) regions, particularly the precuneus, and in the retrospenial cortex, which has been shown to link medial temporal regions and cortical regions of the DMN. Mutation carriers also showed greater functional segregation and integration in regions connected to the salience network, including the striatum and thalamus. Greater tau burden was associated with lower segregated and integrated functional connectivity of DMN regions, particularly the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex. In turn, greater tau pathology was related to higher segregated and integrated functional connectivity in the retrospenial cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex, a hub of the salience network. These findings enlighten our understanding of how AD-related pathology distinctly alters the brains functional architecture in the preclinical stage, possibly contributing to pathology propagation and ultimately resulting in dementia.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAmyloid-{beta} and tau pathologies in Alzheimers disease (AD) are hypothesized to propagate through functional networks. Research is needed to elucidate how AD-related pathologies alter the brains functional connections years before symptom-onset to help predict pathology accumulation and dementia risk. Using high-resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses and PET imaging, we showed that greater tau burden was associated with largely dysconnectivity of posterior default-mode network brain regions, and increased connectivity of structures associated with the salience network and others that are critical for integrating information across neural systems in cognitively-unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers. Findings enlighten how amyloid-{beta} and tau relate to distinct patterns of functional connectivity in regions that underlie memory functioning and are critical for information processing, helping predict disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are glial cells that interact with neuronal synapses via their distal processes, where they remove glutamate and potassium (K+) from the extracellular space following neuronal activity. Astrocyte clearance of both glutamate and K+ is voltage-dependent, but astrocyte membrane potential (Vm) has been thought to be largely invariant. As a result, these voltage-dependencies have not been considered relevant to astrocyte function. Using genetically encoded voltage indicators enabling the measurement of Vm at distal astrocyte processes (DAPs), we report large, rapid, focal, and pathway-specific depolarizations in DAPs during neuronal activity. These activity-dependent astrocyte depolarizations are driven by action potential-mediated presynaptic K+ efflux and electrogenic glutamate transporters. We find that DAP depolarization inhibits astrocyte glutamate clearance during neuronal activity, enhancing neuronal activation by glutamate. This represents a novel class of sub-cellular astrocyte membrane dynamics and a new form of astrocyte-neuron interaction.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryGenetically encoded voltage imaging of astrocytes shows that presynaptic neuronal activity drives focal astrocyte depolarization, contributing to activity-dependent inhibition of glutamate uptake.",

How these {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets are regulated in the lung environment during homeostasis and cancer remains poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we show that lung V{gamma}6+ cells express a repertoire of cell surface molecules distinctive from V{gamma}4+ cells, including PD-1 and ICOS. We found that PD-1 functions as a co-inhibitory molecule on V{gamma}6+ cells to reduce IL-17A production, whereas manipulation of ICOS signaling fails to affect IL-17A in V{gamma}6+ cells. In a mammary tumor model, ICOS and PD-1 expression on lung V{gamma}6+ cells remained stable. However, V{gamma}6+ and V{gamma}4+ cells within the lung pre-metastatic niche increased expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, amphiregulin (AREG) and TIM-3 in response to tumor-derived IL-1{beta} and IL-23, where the upregulation of TIM-3 was specific to V{gamma}4+ cells. Inhibition of either PD-1 or TIM-3 in mammary tumor-bearing mice further increased IL-17A by V{gamma}6+ and V{gamma}4+ cells, indicating that both PD-1 and TIM-3 function as negative regulators of IL-17A-producing {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets. Together, these data demonstrate how lung {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets are differentially controlled by co-inhibitory molecules in steady-state and cancer.",

The analysis revealed coordinated inactivation of MR-proteins linked to regulatory programs potentiating efficiency of viral replication (detrimental host MR-signature) and activation of MR-proteins governing innate immune response programs (beneficial MR-signature).

While nutritional values of insects have been extensively studied in various fish species, their impact on the fish microbiota remains to be fully explored. In an 8-week freshwater feeding trial, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were fed either a commercially relevant reference diet or an insect meal diet wherein black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae meal comprised 60% of total ingredients. Microbiota of digesta and mucosa origin from the proximal and distal intestine were collected and profiled along with feed and water samples. The insect meal diet markedly modulated the salmon intestinal microbiota. Overall, the microbial diversity was lower in the digesta of salmon fed the insect meal diet but higher in the mucosa. A group of bacterial genera, dominated by members of the Bacillaceae family, was enriched in salmon fed the insect meal diet, which confirms our previous findings in a seawater feeding trial. We also found that microbiota in the intestine closely resembled that of the feeds but was distinct from the water microbiota. Notably, bacterial genera associated with the diet effects were present in the feeds as well. In conclusion, our results show consistent changes in the intestinal microbiota of Atlantic salmon fed diets containing black soldier fly larvae meal.",

    "abstract": "Hyperactivation of oncogenic pathways downstream of RAS and PI3K/AKT in normal cells induces a senescence-like phenotype that acts as a tumor-suppressive mechanism that must be overcome during transformation. We previously demonstrated that AKT-induced senescence (AIS) is associated with profound transcriptional and metabolic changes. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts undergoing AIS display increased Cystathionine-{beta}-synthase (CBS) expression and consequent activation of the transsulfuration pathway controlling hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and glutathione (GSH) metabolism. Activated transsulfuration pathway during AIS maintenance enhances the antioxidant capacity, protecting senescent cells from ROS-induced cell death via GSH and H2S. Importantly, CBS depletion allows cells that have undergone AIS to escape senescence and re-enter the cell cycle, indicating the importance of CBS activity in maintaining AIS. Mechanistically, we show this restoration of proliferation is mediated through suppressing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and increasing GSH metabolism. These findings implicate a potential tumor-suppressive role for CBS in cells with inappropriately activated PI3K/AKT signaling. Consistent with this concept, in human gastric cancer cells with activated PI3K/AKT signaling, we demonstrate that CBS expression is suppressed due to promoter hypermethylation. CBS loss cooperates with activated PI3K/AKT signaling in promoting anchorage-independent growth of gastric epithelial cells, while CBS restoration suppresses the growth of gastric tumors in vivo. Taken together, we find that CBS is a novel regulator of AIS and a potential tumor suppressor in PI3K/AKT-driven gastric cancers, providing a new exploitable metabolic vulnerability in these cancers.",

To improve current subpar regenerative treatment, developmental mechanisms of AC should be clarified and, specifically, how postnatal multi-zone organization is acquired. Primary cilia are cell surface organelles crucial for mammalian tissue morphogenesis and while the importance of chondrocyte primary cilia is well appreciated their specific roles in postnatal AC morphogenesis remain unclear. To explore these mechanisms, we used a murine conditional loss-of-function approach (Ift88-flox) targeting joint-lineage progenitors (Gdf5Cre) and monitored postnatal knee AC development. Joint formation and growth up to juvenile stages were largely unaffected, however mature AC (aged 2 months) exhibited disorganized extracellular matrix, decreased aggrecan and collagen II due to reduced gene expression (not increased catabolism), and marked reduction of AC modulus by 30-50%. In addition, we discovered the surprising findings that tidemark patterning was severely disrupted and accompanied alterations in hedgehog signaling that were also dependent on regional load-bearing functions of AC. Interestingly, Prg4 expression was also increased in those loaded sites. Together, our data provide evidence that primary cilia orchestrate postnatal AC morphogenesis, dictating tidemark topography, zonal matrix composition and mechanical load responses.",

Errors that arise during this process can lead to sterility due to low sperm counts and malformed or immotile sperm. While is estimated that 1 out of 7 couples encounter infertility, the underlying cause of male infertility can only be identified in 50% of cases. Here, we describe and examine the genetic requirements for missing minor mitochondria (mmm), sterile affecting ciliogenesis (sac), and testes of unusual size (tous), three previously uncharacterized genes that are predicted to be components of the flagellar axoneme. Using Drosophila, we demonstrate that these genes are essential for male fertility and that loss of mmm, sac, or tous results in complete immotility of the sperm flagellum. Cytological examination uncovered additional roles for sac and tous during cytokinesis and transmission electron microscopy of developing spermatids in mmm, sac, and tous mutant animals revealed defects associated with mitochondria and the accessory microtubules required for the proper elongation of the mitochondria and flagella during ciliogenesis. This study highlights the complex interactions of cilia-related proteins within the cell body and advances our understanding of male infertility by uncovering novel mitochondrial defects during spermatogenesis.",

We tested whether the bird community in Phragmites australis-invaded marsh would exhibit spatial and temporal taxonomic homogenization compared to remnant cattail and meadow marsh. We compared the bird community using marsh invaded by P. australis and remnant, uninvaded marsh vegetation in a year with average water depths and a year with above-average water depths in the coastal marshes of a World Biosphere Reserve. Our results demonstrate strong evidence for spatial and temporal homogenization of the wetland bird community following P. australis invasion. The birds present in P. australis-invaded marsh were a nested subset of those present in remnant marsh, and total beta diversity decreased when water depths were above average. In contrast, total beta diversity was high in remnant marsh vegetation and stable between the two years. The distinctively structured vegetation zones in remnant (uninvaded) marsh yields structural complexity and habitat heterogeneity that supports greater taxonomic turnover in the bird community. Our study provides evidence that invasion by a plant has resulted in biological homogenization of the wetland bird community.",

    "abstract": "Outbreaks of the Eurasian spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) have decimated millions of hectares of conifer forests in Europe in recent years. The ability of these 3-6 mm long insects to kill mature trees over a short period has been ascribed to two main factors: (1) mass attacks on the host tree to overcome tree defenses and (2) the presence of fungal symbionts that support successful beetle development in the tree. While the role of pheromones in coordinating mass attacks has been well studied, the role of chemical communication in maintaining the fungal symbiosis is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that I. typographus can recognize beneficial fungal symbionts of the genera Grosmannia, Endoconidiophora and Ophiostoma by their de novo synthesized volatile compounds. Here, we hypothesize that the fungal symbionts of the bark beetles might metabolize spruce resin monoterpenes of the beetles host tree, Norway spruce (Picea abies), and that the volatile products could be used as cues by beetles for locating breeding sites with beneficial symbionts. We show that Grosmannia penicillata and other fungal symbionts altered the profile of spruce bark volatiles by converting the major monoterpenes into an attractive blend of oxygenated derivatives. Bornyl acetate was metabolized to camphor, and - and {beta}-pinene to trans-4-thujanol and other oxygenated products. Other co-occurring non-beneficial fungi (Trichoderma sp.) also produce oxygenated monoterpenes, but in non-attractive ratios. Extensive electrophysiological measurements showed that the bark beetle possesses dedicated olfactory sensory neurons for oxygenated metabolites. Compounds such as camphor and trans-4-thujanol attracted beetles at specific doses in olfactory experiments, and the presence of symbiotic fungi enhanced attraction of females to pheromones. Finally, we show that colonization of fungal symbionts on spruce bark diet stimulated beetles to make tunnels into the diet. Collectively, our study suggests that the blends of oxygenated metabolites of conifer monoterpenes produced by fungal symbionts are used by bark beetles as attractive cues to find breeding or feeding sites containing their essential microbial symbionts. The oxygenated metabolites may aid beetles in assessing the presence of the fungus, the defense status of the host tree and the density of conspecifics at potential feeding and breeding sites.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication is thought to be a central mechanism in evolution to gain new functions, but gene families vary greatly in their rates of gene duplication and long-term retention. Here, we discover a link between the promoter architecture of vertebrate genes and their rate of duplication: Genes that harbor CpG Islands in their promoters (CGI genes) - nearly 60% of our genes - have rarely duplicated in recent evolutionary times, and most CGI gene duplication events predate the emergence of CGI as a major regulatory element of vertebrate genes. In contrast, CGI-less genes predominate duplications that have occurred since the divergence of vertebrates. Furthermore, CGI-less paralogs are transcriptionally more divergent than CGI paralogs, even when comparing CGI and CGI-less paralogs that have duplicated at similar evolutionary times - suggesting greater capacity of CGI-less promoters to enable divergence in expression. This higher divergence between CGI-less paralogs is also reflected in lower similarity of transcription factors that bind to the promoters of CGI-less paralog pairs in comparison with CGI paralogs. Finally, CGI-less paralogs have a greater tendency to sub- and neo-functionalize, and they transcriptionally diversify faster following duplication. Our results highlight the links between promoter architecture, gene expression plasticity and their impact on gene expansion, and unravel an unappreciated role of CGI elements in shaping genome evolution.\n\nSignificance statementGene duplication generates extra gene copies, providing material for evolution of new functions. However, many duplicated genes are eliminated due to functional and regulatory constraints. The evolutionary processes that govern the elimination and persistence of duplicated genes are not well understood. Here, we focus on CpG Islands (CGIs) - important elements that occur in the majority of gene promoters. We show that genes with CGIs in their promoters have duplicated almost exclusively in ancient times, and nearly all recent duplications involve CGI-less genes. Furthermore, duplicated CGI-less genes diverge more in expression and display more distinctive transcription and cis-regulation compared to duplicated CGI-genes. Our results demonstrate how promoter structure influences transcriptional evolvability and, in turn, the retention of new genes.",

However, such practice has been limited, partly due to high computational cost and the requirement to access raw data that can take a large amount of storage space. To address these computational challenges, we have developed a computational framework that uses a statistical method named TReCASE as its computational engine, and it is computationally feasible for large scale analysis. We applied it to map eQTLs in 28 human tissues using the data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Compared with a popular linear regression method that does not use ASE data, TReCASE can double the number of eGenes (i.e., genes with at least one significant eQTL) when sample size is relatively small, e.g., n = 200. We also demonstrated how to use the ASE data that we have collected to study dynamic eQTLs whose effect sizes vary with respect to another variable, such as age. We find the majority of such dynamic eQTLs are due to some underlying latent factors, such as cell type proportions. We further compare TReCASE versus another method RASQUAL. TReCASE is ten times or more faster than RASQUAL and it provides more robust type I error control.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is a major African malaria vector, transmitting parasites responsible for significant mortality and disease burden. Malaria declines have stagnated recently due to widespread insecticide resistance among vector populations. Flight acoustics are essential to mosquito mating biology and represent promising alternative targets for mosquito control. However, mosquito swarm acoustics data are limited. Here, for the first time, we present detailed analyses of free-flying male and female An. gambiae flight tones and their harmonization (harmonic convergence) over a complete swarm sequence. Audio analysis of single-sex swarms showed elevated male or female flight tone frequencies and amplitudes during swarming flight with gradual declines to pre-swarm levels over an approximately 35-min period. Analysis of mixed-sex swarms revealed additional increases in flight tone frequencies and amplitudes due to mating activity. Data from mixed-sex swarms suggest harmonic convergence during swarming enhances the efficiency of female detection by synchronizing male and female baseline swarm tones. Further, data from experiments using female swarm tone playbacks to males indicate that harmonic convergence during mating interactions coordinates male scramble competition by acoustically masking mating couple flight tones. These findings advance our knowledge of mosquito swarm acoustics, providing vital information for reproductive control strategies.",

In this paper, we describe methods that allow for the automatic discrimination of sheep with a genetic mutation that causes Batten disease from an age-matched control group, using GPS movement traces as input. Batten disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage abnormality with symptoms that are likely to affect the way that those with it move and socialise, including loss of vision and dementia. The sheep in this study displayed a full range of symptoms and during the experiment, the sheep were mixed with a large group of younger animals. We used data obtained from bespoke raw data GPS sensors carried by all animals, with a sampling rate of 1 sample/second and a positional accuracy of around 30cm. The distance covered in each ten minute period and, more specifically, outliers in each period, were used as the basis for estimating the abnormal behaviour. Our results show that, despite the variability in the sample, the bulk of the outliers during the period of observation across six days came from the sheep with Batten disease. Our results point towards the potential of using relatively simple movement metrics in identifying the onset of a phenotype in symptomatically similar conditions.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a highly invasive type of brain tumor with an irregular morphology and blurred infiltrative borders that may affect different parts of the brain. Therefore, it is a challenging task to identify the exact boundaries of the tumor in an MR image. In recent years, deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in the field of image processing and have been utilized for accurate image segmentation in medical applications. However, due to the inherent constraints of CNNs, tens of thousands of images are required for training, and collecting and annotating such a large number of images poses a serious challenge for their practical implementation. Here, for the first time, we have optimized a network based on the capsule neural network called SegCaps, to achieve accurate glioma segmentation on MR images. We have compared our results with a similar experiment conducted using the commonly utilized U-Net. Both experiments were performed on the BraTS2020 challenging dataset. For U-Net, network training was performed on the entire dataset, whereas a subset containing only 20% of the whole dataset was used for the SegCaps. To evaluate the results of our proposed method, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was used. SegCaps and U-Net reached DSC of 87.96% and 85.56% on glioma tumor core segmentation, respectively. The SegCaps uses convolutional layers as the basic components and has the intrinsic capability to generalize novel viewpoints. The network learns the spatial relationship between features using dynamic routing of capsules. These capabilities of the capsule neural network have led to a 3% improvement in results of glioma segmentation with fewer data while it contains 95.4% fewer parameters than U-Net.",

    "abstract": "Assembly of bacterial genomes from long-read data (generated by Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences platforms) can often be complete: a single contig for each chromosome or plasmid in the genome. However, even complete bacterial genome assemblies constructed solely from long reads still contain a variety of errors, and different assemblies of the same genome often contain different errors. Here, we present Trycycler, a tool which produces a consensus assembly from multiple input assemblies of the same genome. Benchmarking using both simulated and real sequencing reads showed that Trycycler consensus assemblies contained fewer errors than any of those constructed with a single long-read assembler. Post-assembly polishing with Medaka and Pilon further reduced errors and yielded the most accurate genome assemblies in our study. As Trycycler can require human judgement and manual intervention, its output is not deterministic, and different users can produce different Trycycler assemblies from the same input data. However, we demonstrated that multiple users with minimal training converge on similar assemblies that are consistently more accurate than those produced by automated assembly tools. We therefore recommend Trycycler+Medaka+Pilon as an ideal approach for generating high-quality bacterial reference genomes.\n\nData availabilitySupplementary figures, tables and code can be found at: github.com/rrwick/Trycycler-paper\n\nReads, assemblies and reference sequences can be found at: bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/Trycycler_paper_dataset/14890734",

Over the past century, the  lightscape of earth has completely changed owing to technological advancements which subsequently changed the lifestyle of human as well as the nearby animal species. This motivated the present study, wherein we investigated the impact of light at night (LAN) on behavior and physiology of a diurnal passerine finch, baya weaver (Ploceus philippinus). A group of bird (N=10) exposed to 12L:12D photoperiod was initially subjected to dark nights (0 lux) for a period of 10 days followed by 5 lux; night light for a span of 4 weeks. First week in LAN served as acute treatment with respect to fourth week (chronic). Acute exposure had more pronounced impact on the behavioral and physiological observations when compared with chronic treatment. The results reveal significant increase in nighttime activity, sleep loss, significant inclusion of drowsiness behavior during the day in response to LAN. Beside these behavioral alterations, changes in physiological parameters such as; reduction in body mass, loss of gradient between pre- and post-prandial blood glucose levels, elevation in plasma corticosterone levels were more prominent during acute exposure of LAN. Plasma metabolites such as triglycerides, total protein, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and creatinine concentrations also hiked in response to LAN treatment. Thus, the study broadly enumerates the impact of acute and chronic exposure of LAN on behavior (rest/sleep) and physiology (metabolism) of birds.",

    "abstract": "Planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling is vital for initiation of neural tube closure in mice, with diminished convergent extension (CE) cell movements leading to a severe form of neural tube defect (NTD), termed craniorachischisis (CRN). Some human NTDs are also associated with PCP gene mutations, but affected individuals are generally heterozygous, whereas PCP homozygosity or compound heterozygosity is needed to produce CRN in mice. This suggests human NTDs may involve other genetic or environmental factors, that interact with partial loss of PCP function. We found that reduced sulfation OF glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) interacts with heterozygosity for the Lp allele of Vangl2 (a core PCP gene), to cause CRN in mice. Here, we hypothesised that this GAG-PCP interaction may regulate convergent extension movements, and hence lead to severe NTDs in the context of only partial loss of PCP function. Both Lp and null alleles of Vangl2 gave similar findings. Culture of E8.5 embryos in the presence of chlorate (a GAG sulfation inhibitor), or enzymatic cleavage of GAG chains, led to failure of NT closure initiation in the majority of Lp/+ embryos, whereas few +/+ littermates exhibited CRN. The chlorate effect was rescued by exogenous sulphate. Surprisingly, DiO labeling of the embryonic node demonstrated no abnormality of midline axial extension in chlorate-treated Lp/+ embryos that developed CRN. In contrast, positive control Lp/Lp embryos displayed severe convergent extension defects in this assay. Morphometric analysis of the closure initiation site revealed abnormalities in the size and shape of somites that flank the closing neural tube in chlorate-treated Lp/+ embryos. We conclude that severe NTDs involving failure of closure initiation can arise by a mechanism other than faulty neuroepithelial convergent extension. Matrix-mediated expansion of somites, flanking the closing neural tube, may be required for closure initiation.",

    "abstract": "One strategy for population suppression seeks to use gene drive to spread genes that confer conditional lethality or sterility, providing a way of combining population modification with suppression. Stimuli of potential interest could be introduced by humans, such as an otherwise benign virus or chemical, or occur naturally on a seasonal basis, such as a change in temperature. Cleave and Rescue (ClvR) selfish genetic elements use Cas9 and gRNAs to disrupt endogenous versions of an essential gene, while also including a Rescue version of the essential gene resistant to disruption. ClvR spreads by creating loss-of-function alleles of the essential gene that select against those lacking it, resulting in populations in which the Rescue provides the only source of essential gene function. In consequence, if function of the Rescue, a kind of Trojan horse now omnipresent in a population, is condition-dependent, so too will be the survival of that population. To test this idea we created a ClvR in Drosophila in which Rescue activity of an essential gene, dribble, requires splicing of a temperature-sensitive intein (TS-ClvRdbe). This element spreads to transgene fixation at 23{degrees}C, but when populations now dependent on Ts-ClvRdbe are shifted to 29{degrees}C death and sterility result in a rapid population crash. These results show that conditional population elimination can be achieved. A similar logic, in which Rescue activity is conditional, could also be used in HEG-based drive, and to bring about suppression and/or killing of specific individuals in response to other stimuli..\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGene drive can be used to spread traits of interest through wild populations. In some contexts the goal is to suppress or eliminate the population. In principle, one way to achieve this goal is if the trait being spread confers on carriers conditional lethality in response to an environmental stimulus that is either introduced by humans into the target area at a specific time (a virus, otherwise benign chemical; a kind of species-specific insecticide), or that occurs naturally on a seasonal basis, such as a change in temperature. Here we show that ClvR selfish elements can be used to spread a gene that confers lethality and sterility in response to increased temperature, demonstrating that conditional population elimination can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) affects 10 million patients worldwide, making it the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Motor symptoms emerge from the loss of dopamine in the striatum after the death of dopaminergic neurons and the long-projecting axons of the nigrostriatal pathway. Current treatments, such as dopamine replacement, deep brain stimulation or cell therapies, disregard the loss of this pathway at the core of symptoms. We sought to address this by improving our tissue-engineered nigrostriatal pathway (TE-NSP) technology, which consists of a tubular hydrogel with a collagen/laminin core that encases an aggregate of dopaminergic neurons and their axons in a way that resembles the nigrostriatal pathway. These constructs can be implanted to replace the lost neurons and axons with fidelity to the pathway, and thus provide dopamine according to feedback from the host circuitry. While TE-NSPs have been traditionally fabricated with agarose, here we utilized a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel to expand the functionality of the encasement and our control over its properties. Using rat ventral midbrain neurons, we found that TE-NSPs exhibited longer and faster neurite growth with HA relative to agarose, with no differences observed in electrically-evoked dopamine release. When transplanted, HA hydrogels reduced host neuron loss and inflammation around the implant compared to agarose, and the cells and axons within TE-NSPs survived and maintained their cytoarchitecture for at least 2 weeks.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe fabricated engineered dopaminergic axons encased in a tubular hydrogel.\nC_LIO_LIWe made hydrogels from methacrylated hyaluronic acid and compared them to agarose.\nC_LIO_LIAxons in HA hydrogels had longer and faster axon growth and displayed evoked dopamine release.\nC_LIO_LIHA hydrogels reduced the host inflammatory response and supported neuron and axon survival in vivo.\nC_LIO_LIThis platform may be used to reconstruct the nigrostriatal pathway to treat Parkinsons disease.\nC_LI",
