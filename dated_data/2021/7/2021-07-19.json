    "abstract": "Intracellular states probed by gene expression profiles and metabolic activities are intrinsically noisy, causing phenotypic variations among cellular lineages. Understanding the adaptive and evolutionary roles of such variations requires clarifying their linkage to population growth rates. Extending a cell lineage statistics framework, here we show that a populations growth rate can be expanded by fitness cumulants of any cell lineage trait. The expansion enables quantifying the contribution of each fitness cumulant, such as variance and skewness, to population growth. We introduce a function that contains all the essential information of cell lineage statistics, including mean lineage fitness and selection strength. We reveal a relation between fitness heterogeneity and population growth rate response to perturbation. We apply the framework to experimental cell lineage data from bacteria to mammalian cells, revealing that third or higher-order cumulants contributions are negligible under constant growth conditions but could be significant in regrowing processes from growth-arrested conditions. Furthermore, we identify cellular populations in which selection leads to an increase of fitness variance among lineages. The framework assumes no particular growth models or environmental conditions, and is thus applicable to various biological phenomena for which phenotypic heterogeneity and cellular proliferation are important.",

    "abstract": "Neurons preferentially activated by learning have been ascribed the unique potential to encode memory. However, it remains unclear which genetically-defined cell types are recruited as part of such an ensemble, or what role discrete subpopulations play in behavior. Here we show that fear conditioning activates a heterogeneous neural ensemble in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), comprised to a large degree of GABAergic interneurons immunoreactive for somatostatin (SST-INs). Using an intersectional genetic approach, we demonstrate that fear learning-activated SST-INs exhibit distinct circuit properties, are preferentially reactivated during memory retrieval, and mediate the expression of defensive freezing. We further show that a rewarding experience, morphine treatment, activates an orthogonal SST-IN population that exerts opposing control over fear. These results outline an important role for discrete GABAergic ensembles in fear memory encoding, and point to an unappreciated capacity for functional specialization among SST-INs.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that excitatory neurons in the brain play a significant role in seizure generation. Nonetheless, spiny stellate cells are cortical excitatory non-pyramidal neurons in the brain, which their basic role in seizure occurrence is not well understood. In the present research, we study the critical role of spiny stellate cells or the excitatory interneurons (EI), for the first time, in epileptic seizure generation using an extended neural mass model inspired by Liu and Wang model in 2017. Applying bifurcation analysis on this modified model, we investigated the rich dynamics corresponding to the epileptic seizure onset and transition between interictal and ictal states caused by EI connectivity to other cell types. Our results indicate that the transition between interictal and ictal states (preictal signal) corresponds to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, and thus, the extended model suggests that before seizure onset, the amplitude and frequency of neural activities gradually increase. Moreover, we showed that 1) the altered function of GABAergic and glutamatergic receptors of EI can cause seizure, and 2) the pathway between the thalamic relay nucleus and EI facilitates the transition from interictal to the ictal activity by decreasing the preictal period. Thereafter, we considered both sensory and cortical periodic inputs to study model responses to various harmonic stimulations. Bifurcation analysis of the model, in this case, suggests that the initial state of the model might be the main cause for the transition between interictal and ictal states as the stimulus frequency changes. The extended thalamocortical model shows also that the amplitude jump phenomenon and nonlinear resonance behavior result from the preictal state of the modified model. These results can be considered as a step forward to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transition from normal activities to epileptic activities.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of the host cell cycle is a common strategy used by viruses to create a pro-replicative environment. To facilitate viral genome replication, vaccinia virus (VACV) has been reported to alter cell cycle regulation and trigger the host cell DNA damage response. However, the cellular factors and viral effectors that mediate these changes remain unknown. Here, we set out to investigate the effect of VACV infection on cell proliferation and host cell cycle progression. Using a subset of VACV mutants we characterize the stage of infection required for inhibition of cell proliferation and define the viral effectors required to dysregulate the host cell cycle. Consistent with previous studies, we show that VACV inhibits, and subsequently shifts the host cell cycle. We demonstrate that these two phenomena are independent of one another, with viral early genes being responsible for cell cycle inhibition, and post-replicative viral gene(s) responsible for the cell cycle shift. Extending previous findings, we show that the viral kinase F10 is required to activate the DNA damage checkpoint and that the viral B1/B12 (pseudo) kinases mediate degradation of checkpoint effectors p53 and p21 during infection. We conclude that VACV modulates host cell proliferation and host cell cycle progression through temporal expression of multiple VACV effector proteins.",

    "abstract": "During aerobic respiration, mitochondria generate superoxide anion (O2*-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (HO*), and these reactive oxygen species (ROS) are detrimental to mitochondria. Mitochondrial damage is linked to a broad spectrum of pathologies such as Alzheimers disease, hemochromatosis, and diabetes. Mitochondria contain several enzymes for rapidly removing superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, but how they antagonize HO* is elusive, representing a loophole in the anti-ROS system. Herein, we discovered that Rhodanese 2 (Rdl2) is critical for maintaining the functionality and integrity of mitochondria under sub-lethal ROS stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rdl2 converts stable sulfur species (thiosulfate and dialkyl polysulfide) to reactive sulfane sulfur including persulfide that protects mitochondrial DNA via scavenging HO*. Surprisingly, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) promotes HO* production through stimulating the Fenton reaction, leading to increased DNA damage. Our study may reveal an ex-ante mean for antagonizing HO*, patching the loophole of the anti-ROS system in mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. Altered gastrointestinal function is key in the development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which is a comorbidity often observed in PD patients. Although PD medication could be an important confounder in the reported alterations, its effect per se on the microbiota composition or the gastrointestinal function at the site of drug absorption has not been studied. To this end, healthy (i.e., not PD model) wild-type Groningen rats were employed and treated with dopamine, pramipexole (in combination with levodopa/carbidopa), or ropinirole (in combination with levodopa/carbidopa) for 14 sequential days. Rats treated with dopamine agonists showed a significant reduction in the small intestinal motility and an increase in bacterial overgrowth in the distal small intestine. Importantly, significant alterations in microbial taxa were observed between the treated and vehicle groups, analogous to the changes previously reported in human PD vs HC microbiota studies. These microbial changes included an increase in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and decrease in Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae. Importantly, certain Lactobacillus species correlated negatively with the plasma levels of levodopa. Overall, the results highlight the significant effect of PD medication per se on the gut microbiota, and the disease-associated comorbidities, including gastrointestinal dysfunction and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the last years many studies focused on the faecal microbiota profiles of Parkinsons disease (PD) patients and compared them to healthy control (HC) subjects and reported a difference between the microbiota profiles. Although some bacterial taxa have been reported to be differential abundant across studies there is a low consensus between the overall changes observed. It remains to be elucidated whether and how the disease status itself, the PD medication or the gastrointestinal dysfunction, an often reported comorbidity, plays a role in the altered microbiota profiles of Parkinsons disease patients.\n\nAdded value of this studyTwo major confounding factors potentially affecting the microbiota profiles differentiating PD patients from HC subjects are the PD medication and gastrointestinal dysfunction. We showed that PD medication elicits an decreasing effect on the small intestinal gut motility in a healthy (i.e. non Parkinson) rat model which was a contributing factor to the altered microbiota profile observed. We found that taxa reported previously to be differentially abundant were mirrored in our healthy rat model showing the impact of PD medication on microbiota profiles.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study showed that PD medication and gastrointestinal motility are important factors in the microbiota profiles and could explain some of the differential abundant taxa reported in the cross-sectional PD microbiota studies. Future studies should take the potential side effects of medication that could elicit alterations of the microbiota composition into account when seeking for microbial biomarkers of disease status.",

    "abstract": "While much progress has been made in understanding early cardiac development, the precise mechanisms that specify the different cardiomyocyte subtypes remain poorly understood. Recent data from our lab have shown that transient Foxa2 expression identifies a progenitor population with exclusive ventricular differentiation potential in the mouse heart. Here we have translated this concept to the human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) system. Using a FOXA2-GFP reporter cell line we characterized expression of FOXA2 during hPSC cardiac differentiation and found that a subset of cardiac mesoderm precursors transiently expresses FOXA2. Gene expression analysis of FOXA2+ and FOXA2- cardiac mesoderm revealed that both populations similarly express early cardiac specification markers such as PDGFRA, TBX5, and ISL1, while other key candidates including TBX20 and GATA4 are significantly upregulated in the FOXA2+ population. Isolation and subsequent differentiation of FOXA2+ and FOXA2- populations demonstrates their comparable differentiation potential to both cardiomyocytes and epicardial cells. However, cardiomyocytes derived from FOXA2+ precursors showed enhanced differentiation efficiency toward ventricular cardiomyocytes compared to cardiomyocytes derived from FOXA2- precursors. To identify new mechanisms that regulate ventricular specification, we performed small molecule screening and found that inhibition of the EGFR pathway strongly increased the cardiac mesoderm population in general, and the FOXA2+ precursors in particular. Finally, we have identified a combination of cell surface markers to specifically isolate FOXA2+ cardiac precursors. In summary, our results suggest that FOXA2+ cardiac mesoderm harbors ventricular-specific differentiation potential and isolation of these cells permits the generation of cultures enriched for ventricular cardiomyocytes. Generating such enriched cardiac populations will be relevant for regenerative medicine approaches, as well as for disease modeling from induced pluripotent stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Established non-native species can have significant impacts on native biodiversity without any possibility of complete eradication. In such cases, one management approach is functional eradication, the reduction of introduced species density below levels that cause unacceptable effects on the native community. Functional eradication may be particularly effective for species with limited dispersal ability, which may limit rates of reinvasion from distant populations. Here, we evaluate the potential for functional eradication of introduced predatory oyster drills (Urosalpinx cinerea) using a community science approach in San Francisco Bay. We combined observational surveys, targeted removals, and a caging experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating the mortality of prey Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida), a conservation and restoration priority species. Despite the efforts of over 300 volunteers that removed over 30,000 oyster drills, we report limited success and discuss several possible mechanisms for this result with broad relevance to management for this and other introduced species. We also found a strong negative relationship between oyster drills and oysters, showing virtually no coexistence across eight sites. At two removal sites, there was no effect of oyster drill removal on oyster survival, which was only observed by caging treatment (0 and 1.6% survival in open and partial cage treatments, as compared to 89.1% in predator exclusion treatments). We conclude that functional eradication of this species requires significantly greater effort and may not be a viable management strategy. Oyster restoration efforts should not be undertaken where Urosalpinx is established or is likely to invade.",

    "abstract": "Two different sarbecoviruses have caused major human outbreaks in the last two decades1,2. Both these sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, engage ACE2 via the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)2-6. However, binding to ACE2 orthologs from humans, bats, and other species has been observed only sporadically among the broader diversity of bat sarbecoviruses7-11. Here, we use high-throughput assays12 to trace the evolutionary history of ACE2 binding across a diverse range of sarbecoviruses and ACE2 orthologs. We find that ACE2 binding is an ancestral trait of sarbecovirus RBDs that has subsequently been lost in some clades. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that bat sarbecoviruses from outside Asia can bind ACE2. In addition, ACE2 binding is highly evolvable: for many sarbecovirus RBDs there are single amino-acid mutations that enable binding to new ACE2 orthologs. However, the effects of individual mutations can differ markedly between viruses, as illustrated by the N501Y mutation which enhances human ACE2 binding affinity within several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern12 but severely dampens it for SARS-CoV-1. Our results point to the deep ancestral origin and evolutionary plasticity of ACE2 binding, broadening consideration of the range of sarbecoviruses with spillover potential.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has reached by July 2021 almost 200 million cases and more than 4 million deaths worldwide since its beginning in late 2019, leading to enhanced concern in the scientific community and the general population. One of the most important pieces of this host-pathogen interaction is the spike protein, which binds to the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) cell receptor, mediates the membrane fusion and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The multiple amino acid substitutions observed in this region, specially in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), mainly after almost one year of its emergence (late 2020), have enhanced the hACE2 binding affinity and led to several modifications in the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, improving the viral fitness and/or promoting immune evasion, with potential impact in the vaccine development. In this way, the present work aimed to evaluate the effect of positively selected mutations fixed in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 lineages and to check for mutational evidence of coevolution. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of selected mutations identified in some of the VOC and VOI lineages (C.37, B.1.1.7, P.1, and P.2) of Brazilian samples on the structural stability of the spike protein, as well as their possible association with more aggressive infection profiles by estimating the binding affinity in the RBD-hACE2 complex. We identified 48 sites under selective pressure in Brazilian spike sequences, 17 of them with the strongest evidence by the HyPhy tests, including VOC related mutation sites 138, 142, 222, 262, 484, 681, and 845, among others. The coevolutionary analysis identified a number of 28 coevolving sites that were found not to be conditionally independent, such as the couple E484K - N501Y from P.1 and B.1.351 lineages. Finally, the molecular dynamics and free energy estimates showed the structural stabilizing effect and the higher impact of E484K for the improvement of the binding affinity between the spike RBD and the hACE2 in P.1 and P.2 lineages, as well as the stabilizing and destabilizing effects for the positively selected sites.",

The length of the CAG tract accounts for over half the variance in age at onset of disease, and is influenced by other genetic factors, mostly implicating the DNA maintenance machinery. We examined a single nucleotide variant, rs79727797, on chromosome 5 in the TCERG1 gene, previously reported to be associated with Huntingtons disease and a quasi-tandem repeat (QTR) hexamer in exon 4 of TCERG1 with a central pure repeat.\n\nMethodsWe developed a novel method for calling perfect and imperfect repeats from exome sequencing data, and tested association between the QTR in TCERG1 and residual age at motor onset (after correcting for the effects of CAG length in the HTT gene) in 610 individuals with Huntingtons disease via regression analysis.\n\nResultsWe found a significant association between age at onset and the sum of the repeat lengths from both alleles of the QTR (p = 2.1x10-9), with each added repeat hexamer reducing age at onset by one year (95% confidence interval [0.7, 1.4]). This association explained that previously observed with rs79727797.\n\nConclusionsThe association with age at onset in the genome-wide association study is due to a QTR hexamer in TCERG1, translated to a glutamine/alanine tract in the protein. We could not distinguish whether this was due to cis-effects of the hexamer repeat on gene expression or of the encoded glutamine/alanine tract in the protein. These results motivate further study of the mechanisms by which TCERG1 modifies onset of HD.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThree different hypotheses proposed via the controversial evidence from cultural, anthropological and uniparental genetic analysis respectively stated that Tanka people probably originated from Han Chinese, ancient Baiyue tribe, or the admixture of them. Therefore, the genetic origin and admixture history of the Tanka people, an isolated \"Gypsies in water\" in the coastal region of Southeast China, are needed to be genetically clarified.\n\nMaterials and methodsTo elucidate the genetic origin of the Southeast Tanka people and explore their genetic relationship with surrounding indigenous Tai-Kadai and Austronesian people and Neolithic-to-historic ancients from the Yellow River Basin (YRB) and Fujian, we conducted a large-scale population genomic study among 1498 modern and ancient Eurasians, in which 73 Tanka and 4 Han people were first reported here. Both allele-shared and haplotype-based statistical methods were used here, including PCA, ADMIXTURE, f-statistics, ALDER, qpGraph-/TreeMix and qpAdm/qpWave, ChromoPainter and FineSTRUCTURE\n\nResultsWe found a specific genetic cline in PCA plots and detected the Tanka-specific homogeneous ancestry in model-based ADMIXTURE results, suggesting differentiated demographic history between Tanka and surrounding Hans. Formal tests based on sharing allele patterns showed a close relationship between Tanka people and Han Chinese, but the Tanka population harbored more southern East Asian ancestry related to Austronesian and Tai-Kadai people compared with southern Hans. Besides, the reconstructed differentiated demographic history revealed that southern Xinshizhou Tanka harbored more ancestry related to the Tai-Kadai or coastal ancient Neolithic to Bronze Age East Asians compared with northern Shacheng Tanka. The qpGraph-/TreeMix-based phylogenetic framework, qpAdm/qpWave-based admixture modeling and FineSTRUCTURE-based dendrogram among ancient northern and southern East Asians further demonstrated that the primary ancestry of modern Tanka derived from ancient millet farmers in the YRB with additional admixture from multiple southern East Asian sources.\n\nDiscussionSharing ancestry estimated from the f-statistics and sharing haplotypic landscape inferred from the ChromoPainter and FineSTRUCTURE showed that Southeast Tanka people not only had a close genetic relationship with both Northern Hans and YRB millet farmers but also possessed more southern East Asian ancestry related to Austronesian, Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien people. Our genomic data and fitted admixture models supported modern Tanka originated from ancient North China and obtained additional gene flow from ancient southern East Asians in the processes of southward migrations.",

    "abstract": "While the vaccination efforts against SARS-CoV-2 infections are ongoing worldwide, new genetic variants of the virus are emerging and spreading. Following the initial surges of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and the Beta (B.1.351) variants, a more infectious Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is now surging, further deepening the health crises caused by the pandemic. The sharp rise in cases attributed to the Delta variant has made it especially disturbing and is a variant of concern. Fortunately, current vaccines offer protection against known variants of concern, including the Delta variant. However, the Delta variant has exhibited some ability to dodge the immune system as it is found that neutralizing antibodies from prior infections or vaccines are less receptive to binding with the Delta spike protein. Here, we investigated the structural changes caused by the mutations in the Delta variants receptor-binding interface and explored the effects on binding with the ACE2 receptor as well as with neutralizing antibodies. We find that the receptor-binding {beta}-loop-{beta} motif adopts an altered but stable conformation causing separation in some of the antibody binding epitopes. Our study shows reduced binding of neutralizing antibodies and provides a possible mechanism for the immune evasion exhibited by the Delta variant.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of adult malignant brain tumor, with a median survival of only 21 months. This is partly due to the high rate of resistance to conventional therapy, including temozolomide (TMZ), leading to recurrence rates close to 100%. It still remains unknown what drives the development of this resistance. To identify the unknown genes driving the development of this resistance, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen comparing a DMSO-treated population with a TMZ-treated population over 14 days. We identified 4 previously unstudied genes - ARF4, PLAA, SPTLC1, and PIGK - that showed significant elevations in expression in recurrent tumors in patient datasets, along with significant survival benefits corresponding to low gene expression. Further investigation of ARF4, known to be involved in retrograde trafficking, allowed us to identify a mechanism of resistance that is mediated by increased retrograde transport of EGFR into the nucleus. Ultimately, our CRISPR-Cas9 screen has identified a promising therapeutic target, ARF4, which may drive GBMs high resistance to chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Cancer evolution is driven by natural selection acting upon phenotypic trait variation. However, the extent to which phenotypic variation within a tumour is a consequence of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity remains undetermined. Here we show that colorectal cancer cells frequently have highly plastic phenotypic traits in vivo in patient tumours. We measured the degree to which trait variation reflects genetic ancestry by quantifying the phylogenetic signal of gene expression across 297 samples with multi-region paired whole genome and transcriptome sequencing collected from 27 primary colorectal cancers. Within-tumour phylogenetic signal for genes and pathways was detected only infrequently, suggesting that the majority of intra-tumour variation in gene expression programmes was not strongly heritable. Expression quantitative trait loci analyses (eQTL) identified a small number of putative mechanisms of genetic control of gene expression due to the cis-acting coding, non-coding and structural genetic alteration, but most gene expression variation was not explained by our genetic analysis. Leveraging matched chromatin-accessibility sequencing data, enhancer mutations with cis regulatory effects on gene expression were associated with a change in chromatin accessibility, indicating that non-coding variation can have phenotypic consequence through modulation of the 3D architecture of the genome. This study maps the evolution of transcriptional variation during cancer evolution, highlighting that intra-tumour phenotypic plasticity is pervasive in colorectal malignancies, and may play key roles in further tumour evolution, from metastasis to therapy resistance.",

    "abstract": "Botrytis cinerea is a broad-host-range necrotrophic phytopathogen responsible for serious crops diseases. To facilitate infection, B. cinerea secretes a large number of effectors that induce plant cell death. In screening secretome data of B. cinerea during infection stage, we identified a phytotoxic protein (BcPTP1) that can also induce immune resistance in plants. BcPTP1 is a small (90 aa), cysteine rich protein without any known domains. Transiently expression of BcPTP1 in leaves caused chlorosis that intensifies with time and eventually lead to cell death. Point mutations in eight of the 10 cysteine residues of BcPTP1 abolished the toxic effect, however residual toxic activity remained after heating the peptide, suggesting contribution of unknown epitopes to protein phytotoxic effect. The transcript level of the bcptp1 gene was low during the first 36 h after inoculation and increased sharply upon transition to the late infection stage, suggesting a role of BcPTP1 in lesion spreading. While statistically insignificant, deletion of the bcptp1 gene led to slightly smaller lesions on bean leaves. Further analyses indicated that BcPTP1 is internalized into plant cells after secreting into the apoplast and its phytotoxic effect is negatively regulated by the receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Collectively, our findings show that BcPTP1 is a virulence factor that toxifies the host cells and facilitates lesion spreading during the late infection stage.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants are emerging around the globe. Unfortunately, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially, variants of concern (VOC) are less susceptible to neutralization by the convalescent and post-vaccination sera, raising concerns of increased disease transmissibility and severity. Recent data suggests the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing anti-body levels as a good correlate of vaccine mediated protection. However, currently used BSL3 based virus micro-neutralization (MN) assays are more laborious, time consuming and expensive, underscoring the need for BSL2 based, cost effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In light of this unmet need, we have developed a BSL2 pseudovirus based neutralization assay (PBNA) in cells expressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The assay is reproducible (R2=0.96), demonstrates a good dynamic range and high sensitivity. Our data suggests that the biological Anti-SARS-CoV-2 research reagents such as NIBSC 20/130 show lower neutralization against B.1.351 RSA and B1.1.7 UK VOC, whereas a commercially available monoclonal antibody MM43 retains activity against both these variants. SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudovirus based neutralization assays for VOC would be useful tools to measure the neutralization ability of candidate vaccines in both preclinical models and clinical trials and further help develop effective prophylactic countermeasures against emerging neutralization escape phenotypes.",

Human genetic variation can affect disease progression and outcome, but little is known about genetic risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 all utilize the human protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter cells. We hypothesized that the genetic variability in ACE2 may contribute to the variable clinical outcomes of COVID-19. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted an in silico investigation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of ACE2 gene. We then applied an integrated approach of genetics, biochemistry and virology to explore the capacity of select ACE2 variants to bind coronavirus spike protein and mediate viral entry. We identified the ACE2 D355N variant that restricts the spike protein-ACE2 interaction and consequently limits infection both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, ACE2 polymorphisms could modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to variable disease severity.",

Complete genomes for four isolates were resolved with Oxford Nanopore sequencing.\n\nResultsIn a highly diverse collection, Klebsiella variicola ssp. variicola caused a quarter of Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex bacteraemias. ESBL-production was limited to K. pneumoniae sensu stricto (98.5 %). A diverse ESBL population of 57 clonal groups (CGs) were dominated by multidrug resistant CG307 (17%), CG15 (12%), CG70 (6%), CG258 (5%) and CG45 (5%) carrying blaCTX-M-15.

Extensive investigations have been performed to study the clinical and cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies have revealed the cellular changes due to the infection and identified a plethora of interactors for all SARS-CoV-2 components, except for the longest non-structural protein 3 (NSP3). Here, we expressed the full-length NSP3 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to investigate their unique and shared functions using multi-omics methods. We conducted interactome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitylome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses of NSP3-expressing cells. We found that NSP3 plays essential roles in cellular functions such as RNA metabolism and immune response such as NF-{kappa}B signal transduction. Interestingly, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 has both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial localizations. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 is more closely related to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, whereas SARS-CoV NSP3 is related to the cytosolic ribosomal proteins. In summary, our multi-omics studies of NSP3 enhance our understanding of the functions of NSP3 and offer valuable insights for the development of anti-SARS strategies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how periodical disturbances affect the community assembly processes is vital for predicting temporal dynamics in microbial communities. The effect of dilutions as disturbances are poorly understood. We used a marine bacterial community to investigate the effect of disturbance (+/-) and carrying capacity (high/low) over 50 days in a dispersal-limited 2x2 factorial crossover study in triplicates. The communitys disturbance regime was crossed halfway. We modelled the rate of change in community composition between replicates and used this rate to quantify selection and ecological drift. The disturbed communities increased in Bray-Curtis similarity with 0.011{+/-}0.0045 (Period 1) and 0.0092{+/-}0.0080 day-1 (Period 2), indicating that selection dominated community assembly. The undisturbed communities decreased in similarity at a rate of -0.015{+/-}0.0038 day-1 in Period 1 and were stable in Period 2 at 0.00050{+/-}0.0040 day-1, suggesting drift structured community assembly. Interestingly, carrying capacity had minor effects on community dynamics. This study is the first to show that stochastic effects are suppressed by periodical disturbances resulting in exponential growth periods due to density-independent biomass loss and resource input. The increased contribution of selection as a response to disturbances implies that ecosystem prediction is achievable.",

    "abstract": "Genetic dissection of highly polygenic traits is a challenge, in part due to the power necessary to confidently identify loci with minor effects. Experimental crosses are valuable resources for mapping such traits. Traditionally, genome-wide analyses of experimental crosses have targeted major loci using data from a single generation, often the F2, with additional, later generation individuals being generated for replication and fine-mapping. Here, we aim to confidently identify minor-effect loci contributing to the highly polygenic basis of the long-term, divergent bi-directional selection responses for 56-day body weight in the Virginia chicken lines. To achieve this, a powerful strategy was developed to make use of data from all generations (F2-F18) of an advanced intercross line, developed by crossing the low and high selected lines after 40 generations of selection. A cost-efficient low-coverage sequencing based approach was used to obtain high-confidence genotypes in 1Mb bins across 99.3% of the chicken genome for >3,300 intercross individuals. In total, 12 genome-wide significant and 10 additional suggestive QTL for 56-day body weight were mapped, with only two of these QTL reaching genome-wide, and one suggestive, significance in analyses of the F2 generation. Five of the significant, and four of the suggestive, QTL were among the 20 loci reaching a 20% FDR-threshold in previous analyses of data from generation F15. The novel, minor-effect QTL mapped here were generally mapped due to an overall increase in power by integrating data across generations, with minor contributions from increased genome-coverage and improved marker information content. Significant and suggestive QTL now explain >60% of the difference between the parental lines, three times more than the previously reported significant QTL. Making integrated use of all available samples from multiple generations in experimental crosses is now economically feasible using the low-cost, sequencing-based genotyping strategies outlined here. Our empirical results illustrate the value of this strategy for mapping novel minor-effect loci contributing to complex traits to provide a more confident, comprehensive view of the individual loci that form the genetic basis of the highly polygenic, long-term selection responses for 56-day body weight in the Virginia chicken lines.",

    "abstract": "Altered expression of long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancers. LncRNAs associated with rectal neuroendocrine tumors (rNETs) remain unexplored. Here, we report the identification of 418 high confidence novel lncRNAs by analyzing publicly available RNA-Seq datasets of primary rNETs and rNETs with lymph node or liver metastases. Novel lncRNAs had basic characteristics similar to the known lncRNAs and showed individual-specific expressions. Expression analysis in the normal rectal mucosa and pancreas NETs (pNETs) and small intestine NETs (siNETs) revealed high expression of two lncRNAs, namely MSTRG30689.1 and MSTRG341161.1. Functional characterization revealed that 9 lncRNAs could work as the ce-RNA and one as miRNAs precursor. Cis- and trans- analysis of the 9 PCG-associated lncRNAs revealed that these lncRNAs could regulate various important cancer-related genes. Further, an integrated regulatory mechanism for selected cancer hallmark genes such as SMAD3, ZEB1, TCF4 and ATM through lncRNAs is predicted. Taken together, our analyses reveal common and unique lncRNAs associated with rNETs and their metastatic variants, their PCG targets, and predict mechanisms of lncRNA mediated regulation of target PCGs.",

    "abstract": "Re-exposure to an unconditioned stimulus (US) can reinstate extinguished conditioned responding elicited by a conditioned stimulus (CS). We tested the hypothesis that the reinstatement of responding to an appetitive CS is driven by an excitatory association formed between the US and the context that the US was ingested in during US re-exposure. Male, Long-Evans rats were acclimated to drinking alcohol (15%, v/v) in the home-cage, then trained to associate an auditory CS with an alcohol-US that was delivered into a fluid port for oral intake. During subsequent extinction sessions, the CS was presented as before, but without alcohol. After extinction, rats were re-exposed to alcohol as in training, but without the CS (alcohol re-exposure). 24 h later at test, the CS was presented as in training, but without alcohol. First, we tested the effect of extinguishing the context-alcohol association, formed during alcohol re-exposure, on reinstatement. Conducting four context extinction sessions across four days (spaced extinction) after the alcohol re-exposure session did not impact reinstatement. However, four context extinction sessions conducted across two days (massed extinction) prevented reinstatement. Next, we conducted alcohol re-exposure in a context that either differed from, or was the same as, the test context. One alcohol re-exposure session in a different context did not affect reinstatement, however, three alcohol re-exposure sessions in a different context significantly reduced reinstatement during the first CS trial. These results partially support the view that a context-US association formed during US re-exposure drives the reinstatement of responding to an appetitive, alcohol-predictive CS.",

    "abstract": "A computational platform, the Boolean network explorer (BoNE), has recently been developed to infuse AI-enhanced precision into drug discovery; it enables querying and navigating invariant Boolean Implication Networks of disease maps for prioritizing high-value targets. Here we used BoNE to query an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)-map and prioritize a therapeutic strategy that involves dual agonism of two nuclear receptors, PPAR/{gamma}. Balanced agonism of PPAR/{gamma} was predicted to modulate macrophage processes, ameliorate colitis in network-prioritized animal models,  reset the gene expression network from disease to health, and achieve a favorable therapeutic index that tracked other FDA-approved targets. Predictions were validated using a balanced and potent PPAR/{gamma}-dual agonist (PAR5359) in two pre-clinical murine models, i.e., Citrobacter rodentium-induced infectious colitis and DSS-induced colitis. Using a combination of selective inhibitors and agonists, we show that balanced dual agonism promotes bacterial clearance more efficiently than individual agonists, both in vivo and in vitro. PPARa is required and its agonism is sufficient to induce the pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular ROS, which are essential for bacterial clearance and immunity, whereas PPARg-agonism blunts these responses, delays microbial clearance and induces the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL10; balanced dual agonism achieved controlled inflammation while protecting the gut barrier and  reversal of the transcriptomic network. Furthermore, dual agonism reversed the defective bacterial clearance observed in PBMCs derived from IBD patients. These findings not only deliver a macrophage modulator for use as barrier-protective therapy in IBD, but also highlight the potential of BoNE to rationalize combination therapy.",

Macromolecules adopt several favored conformations in solution depending on their structure and shape, determining their dynamics and function. Integrated methods combining the lowest-frequency movements obtained by Normal Mode Analysis (NMA), and the faster movements from Molecular Dynamics (MD), and data from biophysical techniques, are necessary to establish the correlation between complex structural dynamics of macromolecules and their function. In this article, we used a hybrid simulation method to sample the conformational space to characterize the structural dynamics and global motions of WT SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and 48 mutants, including several mutations that appear in P.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.525 and B.1.429+B.1.427 variants. Integrated Hybrid methods combining NMA and MD have been useful to study the correlation between the complex structural dynamics of macromolecules and their functioning mechanisms. Here, we applied this hybrid approach to elucidate the effects of mutation in the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, considering their flexibility, solvent accessible surface area analyses, global movements, and catalytic dyad distance.

    "abstract": "Cell-based therapies cure some hematologic malignancies, although little information exists on solid cancer cell responses. The study objective was to test the hypothesis that xenogeneic fibroblasts can inhibit the growth of human cancer cell lines in vitro. Seven human cell lines (pancreatic cancer HPAF II; brain cancer U-87 MG; fibrosarcoma; ovarian cancer OVCAR3 and SKOV3; and breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB231) were co-cultured with two xenogeneic fibroblast cell lines (CV-1;monkey, Cercopithecus aethiops and DF-1; chicken, Gallus gallus) in a transwell culture system. Cancer cell proliferation was assessed colorimetrically. Different concentrations of breast and ovarian cancer cells were tested. Gene expression induced by DF-1 xenogeneic fibroblasts was assessed by RNAseq of MCF7 breast cancer cells. The proliferation of the majority of the cancer cell lines was altered by co-culture with xenogeneic fibroblasts. Cell proliferation was increased (4-17%) by CV-1; DF-1 increased brain cancer cell proliferation (16%), decreased breast and ovarian cancer cell growth (15 and 26% respectively) but did not affect fibrosarcoma and pancreatic cancer cells. When the initial cancer cell concentrations were lowered 4-fold, growth inhibition of breast and ovarian cancer increased more than 2-fold. DF-1 fibroblasts induced significant differential expression of 484 genes in MCF7 breast cancer cells; 285 genes were down-regulated and 199 genes were upregulated compared to control. Genes involved in the immune response were the major downregulated entities. RNAseq results were validated by qRT-PCR of 12 genes. The results show that xenogeneic fibroblasts can alter the growth and gene expression of cancer cells in vitro. This suggests a potentially novel investigational approach to the control of cancer cell growth.",

    "abstract": "The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) increasingly threaten the effectiveness of current first-generation COVID-19 vaccines that are administered intramuscularly and are designed to only target the spike protein. There is thus a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies to provide more broad and long-lasting protection. By using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we developed Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing Spike-1, Nucleocapsid and RdRp antigens and evaluated them following single-dose intramuscular or intranasal immunization in murine models. We show that respiratory mucosal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the three-arm immunity, consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells, and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that single-dose intranasal immunization provides robust protection against not only the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, but also two emerging VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that single-dose respiratory mucosal delivery of an Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy against current and future VOC. This strategy has great potential to be used not only to boost first-generation vaccine-induced immunity but also to expand the breadth of protective T cell immunity at the respiratory mucosa.",

The behavior of stem-like T cells in other tissues remains to be elucidated. Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are often defined as a non-circulating T cell population residing in non-lymphoid tissues. TILs carrying TRM features are associated with better tumor control. Here, we found that stem-like CD8+ T cells differentiated into TRMs in a TGF-{beta} and tumor antigen dependent manner almost exclusively in tumor draining lymph node (TDLN). TDLN-resident stemlike T cells were negatively associated with the response to tumor vaccine. In other words, after tumor vaccine, TDLN stem-like T cells transiently lost TRM features, differentiated into migratory effectors and exerted tumor control.",

    "abstract": "Chemical methods of virus inactivation are used routinely to prevent viral transmission in both a personal hygiene capacity but also in at-risk environments like hospitals. Several  virucidal products exist, including hand soaps, gels and surface disinfectants. Resin acids, which can be derived from Tall oil produced from trees, have been shown to exhibit anti-bacterial activity. However, whether these products or their derivatives have virucidal activity is unknown. Here, we assessed the capacity of Rosin soap to inactivate a panel of pathogenic mammalian viruses in vitro. We show that Rosin soap can inactivate the human enveloped viruses: influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For IAV, rosin soap could provide a 100,000-fold reduction in infectivity. However, Rosin soap failed to affect the non-enveloped encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The inhibitory effect of Rosin soap against IAV infectivity was dependent on its concentration but not dependent on incubation time nor temperature. Together, we demonstrate a novel chemical inactivation method against enveloped viruses, which could be of use in preventing virus infections in certain settings.\n\nImportanceViruses remain a significant cause of human disease and death, most notably illustrated through the current Covid-19 pandemic. Control of virus infection continues to pose a significant global health challenge to the human population. Viruses can spread through multiple routes, including via environmental and surface contamination where viruses can remain infectious for days. Methods to inactivate viruses on such surfaces may help mitigate infection. Here we present evidence identifying a novel  virucidal product in Rosin soap, which is produced from Tall oil from coniferous trees. Rosin soap was able to rapidly and potently inactivate influenza virus and other enveloped viruses.",

    "abstract": "The necrotrophic plant pathogenic bacterium Dickeya solani emerged in the potato agrosystem in Europe. All isolated strains of D. solani contain several large polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters. Analogy with genes described in other bacteria suggests that the clusters ooc and zms are involved in the production of secondary metabolites of the oocydin and zeamine families, respectively. A third cluster that we named ssm for solani secondary metabolite had an unknown function. In this study, we constructed mutants impaired in each of the three secondary metabolite clusters ssm, ooc, and zms to compare first the phenotype of the D. solani wild-type strain D s0432-1 with its associated mutants. We demonstrated the antimicrobial functions of these three PKS/NRPS clusters against bacteria, yeasts or fungi. The secondary metabolite cluster ssm, conserved in several other Dickeya species, produces a secondary metabolite inhibiting yeasts. Phenotyping and comparative genomics of different D. solani wild-type isolates revealed that the small regulatory RNA ArcZ plays a major role in the control of the clusters ssm and zms. A single-point mutation, conserved in some Dickeya wild-type strains, including the type strain IPO 2222, impairs the ArcZ function by affecting its processing into an active form.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe development of new antibacterial molecules is critical in tackling the emergence of new pathogens or bacterial strains resistant to already available antibiotics. Bacterial phytopathogens can potentially synthesize novel compounds capable of targeting a specific type of microorganism. Dickeya solani is the only of the twelve described Dickeya species that has the three secondary metabolic pathways ssm, ooc and zms. An investigation of the functions of these three clusters allowed us to identify the anti-yeast activity of the ssm cluster, a potential new molecule of clinical importance. By comparing the antimicrobial activity of several Dickeya solani strains, we identified the small RNA regulator ArcZ as a critical regulator in the activation of the ssm and zms clusters. Our study showed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms of sRNA encoding genes can have huge impacts on bacterial phenotypes. It is thus critical to pay attention to the allele diversity of sRNA genes.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is strongly associated with the temporal regulation of cardiac immunity. However, a variety of current clinical trials have failed because of the lack of post-MI immunomodulating/anti-inflammatory targets. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of cardiac Cd45+ immune cell at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days after injury in a mouse left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model. Major immune cell populations, distinct subsets, and dynamic changes were identified. Macrophages (Mo)/monocytes were most abundant, peaking at 3 days after infarction. Mo-5 and Mo-6 were the predominant infiltrated subsets at this time point, with strong expression of inflammatory factors. Further analysis demonstrated that suppressing these sets attenuated pathological MI progression by preventing subsequent leukocyte extravasation and adverse remodeling. We also detected abundant apoptotic neutrophils and a profibrotic macrophage subset on days 7 and 14 respectively. These results provide a basis for developing cell type- and time-specific interventions in MI.\n\nGraphic abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/452902v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7c810org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18f9c9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17325f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c1a4e7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Temporal regulation of cardiac immunity is strongly associated with the onset, progression, and outcomes of MI.

    "abstract": "Understanding the function of genes and their regulation in tissue homeostasis and disease requires knowing the cellular context in which genes are expressed in tissues across the body. Single cell genomics allows the generation of detailed cellular atlases in human tissues, but most efforts are focused on single tissue types. Here, we establish a framework for profiling multiple tissues across the human body at single-cell resolution using single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq), and apply it to 8 diverse, archived, frozen tissue types (three donors per tissue). We apply four snRNA-seq methods to each of 25 samples from 16 donors, generating a cross-tissue atlas of 209,126 nuclei profiles, and benchmark them vs. scRNA-seq of comparable fresh tissues. We use a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to integrate an atlas across tissues, donors, and laboratory methods. We highlight shared and tissue-specific features of tissue-resident immune cells, identifying tissue-restricted and non-restricted resident myeloid populations. These include a cross-tissue conserved dichotomy between LYVE1- and HLA class II-expressing macrophages, and the broad presence of LAM-like macrophages across healthy tissues that is also observed in disease. For rare, monogenic muscle diseases, we identify cell types that likely underlie the neuromuscular, metabolic, and immune components of these diseases, and biological processes involved in their pathology. For common complex diseases and traits analyzed by GWAS, we identify the cell types and gene modules that potentially underlie disease mechanisms. The experimental and analytical frameworks we describe will enable the generation of large-scale studies of how cellular and molecular processes vary across individuals and populations.",

    "abstract": "As for most of the life that inhabits our planet, microorganisms play an essential role in the fitness of insects, including nutrition, reproduction, defence, and many other functions. More recently, we assisted in an exponential growth of studies describing the taxonomical composition of bacterial communities across insects phylogeny. However, there is still an outstanding question that needs to be answered: which factors contribute most to shape insects microbiomes? This study tries to find an answer to this question by taking advantage of publicly available sequencing data and reanalysing over 4,000 samples of insect-associated bacterial communities under a common framework. Results suggest that insect taxonomy has a wider impact on the structure and diversity of their associated microbial communities than the other factors considered (diet, sex, life stage, sample origin, and treatment). However, when specifically testing for signatures of co-diversification of insect species and their microbiota, analyses found weak support for this, suggesting that while insect species strongly drive the structure and diversity of insect microbiota, the diversification of those microbial communities did not follow their hosts phylogeny. Furthermore, a parallel survey of the literature highlights several methodological limitations that need to be considered in future research endeavours.",

    "abstract": "The healthy human vaginal microbiota is generally dominated by lactobacilli, and the transition to a more diverse community of anaerobic microbes is associated with health risks. Glycogen released by lysed epithelial cells is believed to be an important nutrient source in this environment. However, the mechanism by which vaginal bacteria metabolize glycogen is unclear, with evidence implicating both microbial and human enzymes. Here, we biochemically characterize six glycogen-degrading enzymes (GDEs) from vaginal bacteria that support the growth of amylase-deficient L. crispatus on glycogen. We reveal variations in the pH tolerance and susceptibility to inhibition between enzymes from different organisms. Analysis of vaginal microbiome datasets show these enzymes are expressed in all Community State Types. Finally, we confirm the presence and activity of bacterial GDEs in cervicovaginal fluid. This work establishes that bacterial GDEs can participate in the breakdown of glycogen, providing insight into metabolism that may shape the vaginal microbiota.",

We recently identified subclonal loss-of-function mutations in the H4 lysine methyltransferase KMT5B to be associated with enhanced invasion/migration, but the mechanism by which this occurred was unclear. Here we use integrated ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on patient-derived, subclonal and CRISPR-Cas9-KD DIPG cells to show that loss of KMT5B/C causes depletion of these retained H3K27me3 loci via changes in chromatin accessibility, causing a raft of transcriptional changes which promote tumorigenesis. De-repression occurred at bivalent loci marked by H3K4me3, driving increased transcriptional heterogeneity and elevated gene expression associated with increased invasion, abrogated DNA repair and mesenchymal transition, along with a markedly altered secretome. These data suggest a previously unrecognised trans-histone (H4/H3) interaction in DIPG cells with a potentially profound effect on their diffusely infiltrating phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Gata2 is required to produce and maintain haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in development and adult haematopoiesis. Mutations in GATA2 lead to GATA2 deficiency syndrome and predispose patients to acquire leukaemia. Here we use zebrafish gata2a enhancer deletion mutants and single cell transcriptomics to understand how GATA2 mediates survival and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells in GATA2 deficiency. Gata2a mutants show marrow failure, neutropenia, B-lymphopenia and erythrocytosis from 6 months post-fertilization (mpf). Single cell transcriptional profiling of the adult kidney marrow demonstrated that HSPCs express elevated expression of erythroid- and decreased expression of myeloid genes, including cebpa. This is associated with a lineage skewing towards the erythroid fate at the expense of the myeloid fate. Thus, Gata2a is required to initiate and maintain lineage priming in HSPCs, favouring myeloid differentiation. Gata2a regulates expression of multiple targets associated with replication and DNA damage repair (DDR), including npm1a, a zebrafish NPM1 orthologue. Accordingly, mutant marrow cells show increased DNA damage associated with progressive loss of npm1a expression with age. This effect was replicated by inhibiting NPM1 activity in murine HPC7 progenitor cells. We propose that the impaired DDR leads to marrow failure in GATA2 deficiency. This leads to increased genomic instability in the surviving HSPCs, favouring acquisition of secondary leukaemogenic mutations.",

Expression and sub-cellular location of H19 lncRNA was validated in DIPG cell lines. Locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides were designed to test the function of H19 in DIPG cells. We found that H19 expression was higher in DIPG vs normal brain tissue and other pedHGGs. H19 knockdown resulted in decreased cell proliferation and survival in DIPG cells. Mechanistically, H19 buffers let-7 microRNAs, resulting in up-regulation of oncogenic let-7 target (e.g SULF2, OSMR). H19 is the first functionally characterized lncRNA in DIPG and a promising therapeutic candidate to treat this incurable cancer.",

This study investigates whether the lack of OPN ameliorates inflammation and fibrosis in the mouse prostate.\n\nWe instilled uropathogenic E. coli (UTI89) or saline (control) transurethrally to C57BL/6J (WT) or Spp1tm1Blh/J (OPN-KO) mice and collected the prostates one or 8 weeks later. We found that OPN mRNA and protein expression were significantly induced by E. coli-instillation in the dorsal prostate (DP) after one week in WT mice. Deficiency in OPN expression led to decreased inflammation and fibrosis and the prevention of urinary dysfunction after 8 weeks. RNAseq analysis identified that E. coli-instilled WT mice expressed increased levels of inflammatory and fibrotic marker RNAs compared to OPN-KO mice including Col3a1, Dpt, Lum and Mmp3 which were confirmed by RNAscope.\n\nOur results indicate that OPN is induced by inflammation and prolongs the inflammatory state; genetic blockade of OPN accelerates recovery after inflammation, including a resolution of prostate fibrosis.",

Using Txnrd3-/- mice, our biochemical, ultrastructural, and live cell imaging analyses revealed impairments in sperm morphology and motility under conditions of TXNRD3 deficiency. We reveal that mitochondria develop more defined cristae during capacitation in wild type sperm. Absence of TXNRD3 alters redox status in both the head and tail during sperm maturation and capacitation, resulting in defective mitochondrial ultrastructure and activity under capacitating conditions. These findings provide insights into molecular mechanisms of redox homeostasis and bioenergetics during sperm maturation, capacitation, and fertilization.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants in SCN2A, encoding the NaV1.2 voltage-gated sodium channel, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Some variants fit into a framework wherein gain-of-function missense variants that increase neuronal excitability lead to infantile epileptic encephalopathy, while loss-of-function variants that reduce neuronal excitability lead to developmental delay and/or autism spectrum disorder with or without co- morbid seizures. One unique case less easily classified using this binary paradigm is the de novo missense variant SCN2A p.K1422E, associated with infant-onset developmental delay, infantile spasms, and features of autism spectrum disorder. Prior structure-function studies demonstrated that K1422E substitution alters ion selectivity of NaV1.2, conferring Ca2+ permeability, lowering overall conductance, and conferring resistance to tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on heterologous expression of K1422E, we developed a compartmental neuron model that predicted mixed effects on channel function and neuronal activity. We also generated Scn2aK1422E mice and characterized effects on neurons and neurological/neurobehavioral phenotypes. Dissociated neurons from heterozygous Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited a novel TTX-resistant current with a reversal potential consistent with mixed ion permeation. Cortical slice recordings from Scn2aK1442E/+ tissue demonstrated impaired action potential initiation and larger Ca2+ transients at the axon initial segment during the rising phase of the action potential, suggesting mixed effects on channel function. Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited rare spontaneous seizures, interictal EEG abnormalities, altered response to induced seizures, reduced anxiety-like behavior and alterations in olfactory-guided social behavior. Overall, Scn2aK1422E/+ mice present with phenotypes similar yet distinct from Scn2a knockout models, consistent with mixed effects of K1422E on NaV1.2 channel function.\n\nSignificance StatementThe early-onset epilepsy variant SCN2A-p.K1422E displays unique biophysical properties in vitro. To model the impact of this rare variant, we generated Scn2aK1422E mice. Neurons from heterozygous Scn2aK1422E/+ mice showed functional deficits similar to the loss-of-function effects observed in the Scn2a haploinsufficiency model, as well as gain-of-function effects specific to the K1422E variant. There is also some overlap in neurobehavioral phenotypes between Scn2aK1422E/+ and Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. However, Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited unique epilepsy-related phenotypes, including epileptiform events and seizures. Scn2aK1422E/+ mice serve as a useful platform to investigate phenotypic complexity of SCN2A-associated disorders.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine use disorder is associated with alterations in immune function including altered expression of multiple peripheral cytokines in humans - several of which correlate with drug use. Individuals suffering from cocaine use disorder show altered immune system responses to drug-associated cues, highlighting the interaction between the brain and immune system as a critical factor in the development and expression of cocaine use disorder. We have previously demonstrated in animal models that cocaine use upregulates expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) - a pleiotropic cytokine - in the serum and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). G-CSF signaling has been causally linked to behavioral responses to cocaine across multiple behavioral domains. The goal of this study was to define whether increases in G-CSF alter the pharmacodynamic effects of cocaine on the dopamine system and whether this occurs via direct mechanisms within local NAc microcircuits. We find that systemic G-CSF injection increases cocaine effects on dopamine terminals. The enhanced dopamine levels in the presence of cocaine occur through a release-based mechanism, rather than through effects on the dopamine transporter - as uptake rates were unchanged following G-CSF treatment. Critically, this effect could be recapitulated by acute bath application of G-CSF to dopamine terminals, an effect that was occluded by prior G-CSF treatment, suggesting a similar mechanistic basis for direct and systemic exposures. This work highlights the critical interaction between the immune system and psychostimulant effects that can alter drug responses and may play a role in vulnerability to cocaine use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Introductory ParagraphFor opportunistic pathogens, the switch from a commensal to an invasive lifestyle is often considered an accidental event. But with plentiful opportunity, what leads one accidental event to result in an invasive infection, and another not to? And how much of this apparent stochasticity is driven by bacterial factors? To answer these questions, here we focussed on the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which can both reside asymptomatically as a member of our respiratory microbiome, or become invasive and cause infections as severe as bacteraemia. Survival upon exposure to the antibacterial factors found in serum is a critical aspect of their ability to cause bacteraemia, and across a collection of 300 clinical isolates we found there to be significant variability in this capability. Utilising a GWAS approach we have uncovered the genetic basis of much of this variability through the identification and functional verification of a number of new polymorphic loci that affect serum survival: tcaA, tarK, gntR, ilvC, arsB, yfhO, and pdhD. The expression of one of these genes, tcaA, was found to be induced upon exposure to serum, while simultaneously enhancing the sensitivity of S. aureus to serum through a process involving the ligation of wall teichoic acids into the cell wall. As blood-stage infections are a transmission dead-end for the bacteria, that S. aureus actively responds to serum to produce a protein which specifically limits their ability to survive in this environment demonstrates that the switch from the commensal to the invasive lifestyle is complex, and that TcaA may contribute to the long-term success of S. aureus by restricting the bacteria to their more readily transmissible commensal state.",

After scanning 4000 F gene nucleotide sequences in the NCBI database, a single RE (BsaHI) digesting site was discovered in the cleavage site. APMV-I \"F gene\" Class II specific primer-based reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was utilized to amplify a 535 bp fragment, which was then digested with a single RE (BsaHI) for pathotyping avian NDV field isolates and pigeon paramyxovirus-1 isolates. The avirulent (lentogenic and mesogenic strains) produce 189 and 346 bp fragments, respectively, but the result in velogenic strains remains undigested with 535 bp fragments. In addition, 45 field NDV isolates and 8 vaccine strains were used to confirm the approach. The sequence-based analysis also agrees with the data obtained utilizing the single RE (BsaHI) digestion approach. The proposed technique had the potential to distinguish between avirulent and virulent strains in a short space of time, making it valuable in NDV surveillance and monitoring research.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants can compromise the effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies. Most clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies target the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), but variants often have multiple mutations in several spike regions. To help predict antibody potency against emerging variants, we evaluated 25 clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies for neutralization activity against 60 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with single or multiple substitutions in several spike domains, including the full set of substitutions in B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), A.23.1 and R.1 variants. We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside of the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies.\n\nImportanceTherapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), but their effectiveness may be reduced by virus variants with mutations affecting the spike protein. To help predict resistance to therapeutic antibodies in emerging variants, we profiled resistance patterns of 25 antibody products in late stages of clinical development against a large panel of variants that include single and multiple substitutions found in the spike protein. We found that the presence of a key substitution in variants with multiple spike substitutions can predict resistance against a variant, but that other substitutions can affect the degree of resistance in unpredictable ways. These finding highlight complex interactions among substitutions in the spike protein affecting virus neutralization and potentially virus entry into cells.",

    "abstract": "Wnt signaling is essential for normal development and is a therapeutic target in cancer. The enzyme PORCN, or porcupine, is a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) that is required for the post-translational modification of all Wnts, adding an essential mono-unsaturated palmitoleic acid to a serine on the tip of Wnt hairpin 2. Inherited mutations in PORCN cause focal dermal hypoplasia, and therapeutic inhibition of PORCN slows the growth of Wnt-dependent cancers. Here, based on homology to mammalian MBOAT proteins we develop and validate a molecular structural model of PORCN. The model accommodates palmitoleoyl-CoA and Wnt hairpin 2 in two tunnels in the conserved catalytic core, shedding light on the catalytic mechanism. The model predicts how previously uncharacterized human variants of uncertain significance can alter PORCN function. Drugs including ETC-159, IWP-L6 and LGK-974 dock in the PORCN catalytic site, providing insights into PORCN pharmacologic inhibition. This structural model provides mechanistic insights into PORCN substrate recognition and catalysis as well as the inhibition of its enzymatic activity and can facilitate the development of improved inhibitors and the understanding of disease relevant PORCN mutants.",

We used HAD-MSCs as seed cells and gradually obtained mature hepatoid cells with normal phenotype and function after induction with small molecule compounds and growth factor system in vitro. The hepatoid cells induced by the two groups showed high similarity in phenotype and functional characteristics of mature hepatocytes. The differentiation system of human adipose mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes induced by small-molecule compounds in vitro was successfully constructed.

    "abstract": "Removal of damaged organelles via the process of selective autophagy constitutes a major form of cellular quality control. Damaged organelles are recognized by a dedicated surveillance machinery, leading to the assembly of an autophagosome around the damaged organelle, prior to fusion with the degradative lysosomal compartment. Lysosomes themselves are also prone to damage and are degraded through the process of lysophagy. While early steps involve recognition of ruptured lysosomal membranes by glycan-binding Galectins and ubiquitylation of transmembrane lysosomal proteins, many steps in the process, and their inter-relationships, remain poorly understood, including the role and identity of cargo receptors required for completion of lysophagy. Here, we employ quantitative organelle capture and proximity biotinylation proteomics of autophagy adaptors, cargo receptors, and Galectins in response to acute lysosomal damage, thereby revealing the landscape of lysosomal proteome remodeling during lysophagy. Among proteins dynamically recruited to damaged lysosomes were ubiquitin-binding autophagic cargo receptors. Using newly developed lysophagic flux reporters including Lyso-Keima, we demonstrate that TAX1BP1, together with its associated kinase TBK1, are both necessary and sufficient to promote lysophagic flux in both Hela cells and induced neurons (iNeurons). While the related receptor OPTN can drive damage-dependent lysophagy when overexpressed, cells lacking either OPTN or CALCOCO2 still maintain significant lysophagic flux in HeLa cells. Mechanistically, TAX1BP1-driven lysophagy requires its N-terminal SKICH domain, which binds both TBK1 and the autophagy regulatory factor RB1CC1, and requires upstream ubiquitylation events for efficient recruitment and lysophagic flux. These results identify TAX1BP1 as a central component in the lysophagy pathway and provide a proteomic resource for future studies of the lysophagy process.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the regulation of nucleolar function are critical for ascertaining clearer insights into the basic biological underpinnings of ribosome biogenesis, and for future development of therapeutics to treat cancer and ribosomopathies. A number of high-throughput primary assays based on morphological alterations of the nucleolus can indirectly identify hits affecting ribosome biogenesis. However, there is a need for a more direct high-throughput assay for nucleolar function to further evaluate hits. Previous reports have monitored nucleolar RNA biogenesis using 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU) in low-throughput. We report a miniaturized, high-throughput 5-EU assay for nucleolar function which enables specific calculation of nucleolar rRNA biogenesis inhibition, based on co-staining of the nucleolar protein fibrillarin (FBL). The assay utilizes two siRNA controls, a negative non-targeting siRNA control (siNT) and a positive siRNA control targeting POLR1A (siPOLR1A), and specifically quantifies median 5-EU signal within nucleoli. Maximum nuclear 5-EU signal can also be used to monitor the effects of putative small molecule inhibitors of RNAP1, like BMH-21, or other treatment conditions that cause FBL dissociation. We validate the 5-EU assay on 68 predominately nucleolar hits from a high-throughput primary screen, showing that 58/68 hits significantly inhibit nucleolar rRNA biogenesis. Our new method establishes direct quantification of nucleolar function in high-throughput, facilitating closer study of ribosome biogenesis in health and disease.",

Due to their importance, large effort is being carried out on drug development by small-molecule inhibitors.

In the case of the Ras family, their multiple conformational states can affect the binding of potential drug inhibitors. To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational framework based on combined all-atom Molecular Dynamics and Metadynamics simulations able to accurately access conformational variants of the target protein. We tested the methodology using a G12D mutated GTP bound oncogenic KRas-4B protein located at the interface of a DOPC/DOPS/cholesterol model anionic cell membrane. Two main orientations of KRas-4B at the anionic membrane have been obtained and explored. The corresponding angles have been taken as reliable reaction coordinates so that free-energy landscapes have been obtained by well-tempered metadynamics simulations, revealing the local and global minima of KRas-4B binding to the cell membrane, unvealing reactive paths of the system between the two preferential orientations and highlighting opportunities for targeting the unique metastable states through the identification of druggable pockets.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish is an important animal system for modelling human diseases. This includes kidney dysfunction as the embryonic kidney (pronephros) shares considerable molecular and morphological homology with the human nephron. Zebrafish also have a high fecundity, with females capable of laying 200-300 eggs per week, thereby facilitating chemical and mutation screening. A key clinical indicator of kidney disease is proteinuria, but a high-throughput readout of proteinuria in the zebrafish is lacking. Coupling the advantages of the zebrafish system with a tool to measure proteinuria will advance the scope for testing the efficacy of drugs to treat kidney diseases. Here, we generated a stable transgenic zebrafish line using the l-fabp10 liver-specific promoter to over-express a nanoluciferase molecule fused with the D3 domain of Receptor-Associated-Protein (RAP) to create NL-D3. In the healthy state, NL-D3 is excreted, but when embryos were treated with chemicals that affected either proximal tubular reabsorption (cisplatin, gentamicin) or glomerular filtration (angiotensin II, Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, Bovine Serum Albumin), NL-D3 presence in the urine increased. Similarly, depletion of several gene products associated with kidney disease (nphs1, nphs2, lrp2a, ocrl, col4a3, col4a4, and col4a5) also induced NL-D3 proteinuria. Furthermore, we found that treating col4a4 depleted zebrafish larvae (a model of Alport syndrome) with captopril reduced proteinuria. Our findings confirm the use of the NL-D3 transgenic zebrafish as a robust and quantifiable proteinuria reporter. Given the feasibility of high-throughput assays in zebrafish, this novel reporter will permit screening for drugs that ameliorate proteinuria and thereby prioritise candidates for further translational studies.\n\nSignificance StatementThe zebrafish has become an important system for modelling kidney disease. However, proteinuria, an important clinical indicator of kidney dysfunction, is not easily detected in zebrafish. Here, we describe a transgenic line that uses a nanoluciferase reporter to enable detection of proteinuria in multiple models of glomerular and proximal tubular kidney disease in the zebrafish. In this system proteinuria can be accurately measured in a high-throughput manner and will enable the screening of drugs that affect glomerular filtration or protein re-uptake in the proximal tubule.",

Insufficient decidualization of endometrium contributes to not only the failure of embryo implantation and unexplained infertility, but also the occurrence of recurrent spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, preeclampsia, and other clinical gynecological diseases. However, the potential molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the initiation and maintenance of decidualization in humans is yet to be fully elucidated. In this investigation, we document that SOX4 is a key regulator of human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) decidualization by directly regulating PRL and FOXO1 expression as revealed by whole genomic binding of SOX4 assay and RNA-Seq. Besides, our immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry results unravel that SOX4 modulates progesterone receptor (PGR) stability through repressing E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC4 mediated degradation. More importantly, we provide evidence that dysregulated SOX4-HERC4-PGR axis is a potential cause of defective decidualization and recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in IVF patients. In summary, this study evidences that SOX4 is a new and critical regulator for human endometrial decidualization, and provides insightful information for the pathology of decidualization-related infertility and will pave the way for pregnancy improvement.",

    "abstract": "In ripening tomato fruits, the leaf-specific carotenoids biosynthesis mediated by phytoene synthase 2 (PSY2) is replaced by a fruit-specific pathway by the expression of two chromoplast-specific genes: phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1) and lycopene-{beta}-cyclase (CYCB). Though both PSY1 and PSY2 genes express in tomato fruits, the functional role of PSY2 is not known. To decipher whether PSY2-mediated carotenogenesis operates in ripening fruits, we blocked the in vivo activity of lycopene-{beta}-cyclases in fruits of several carotenoids and ripening mutants by CPTA (2-(4-Chlorophenylthio)triethylamine hydrochloride), an inhibitor of lycopene-{beta}-cyclases. The CPTA-treatment induced accumulation of lycopene in leaves, immature-green and ripening fruits. Even, in psy1 mutants V7 and r that are deficient in fruit-specific carotenoid biosynthesis, CPTA triggered lycopene accumulation but lowered the abscisic acid level. Differing from fruit-specific carotenogenesis, CPTA-treated V7 and r mutant fruits accumulated lycopene but not phytoene and phytofluene. The lack of phytoene and phytofluene accumulation was reminiscent of PSY2-mediated leaf-like carotenogenesis, where phytoene and phytofluene accumulation is never seen. The lycopene accumulation was associated with the partial transformation of chloroplasts to chromoplasts bearing thread-like crystalline structures. Our study uncovers the operation of a parallel carotenogenesis pathway mediated by PSY2 that provides precursors for abscisic acid biosynthesis in ripening tomato fruits.\n\nSignificance statementIt is believed that in ripening tomato fruits phytoene synthase 2 that drives carotenoid biosynthesis in leaves is redundant. Contrary to this, we show that in phytoene synthase 1 mutant fruit that is bereft of lycopene, the chemical inhibition of lycopene {beta}-cyclases triggers lycopene accumulation. Our results uncover that phytoene synthase 2 remains functional in ripening fruits and provides precursors for abscisic acid formation in fruits.",

    "abstract": "During photosynthesis, chloroplasts can produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly under stressful conditions. Along with other nutrients, chloroplasts also contain 80% of a leafs nitrogen supply. For these reasons, chloroplasts are prime targets for cellular degradation to protect cells from photo-oxidative damage and to redistribute nutrients to sink tissues. Multiple chloroplast degradation pathways have been described and are induced by photo-oxidative stress and nutrient starvation. However, the mechanisms by which damaged or senescing chloroplasts are identified, transported to the central vacuole, and ultimately degraded are not well characterized. Here, we investigated the subcellular structures involved with degrading chloroplasts induced by the ROS singlet oxygen (1O2) in the Arabidopsis thaliana plastid ferrochelatase two (fc2) mutant. Using a three-dimensional serial-block face electron microscopy analysis, we show up to 35% of degrading chloroplasts in fc2 mutants protrude into the central vacuole. While the location of a chloroplast within a cell had no effect on the likelihood of its degradation, chloroplasts in spongy mesophyll cells were degraded at a higher rate than those in palisade mesophyll cells. To determine if degrading chloroplasts have unique structural characteristics allowing them to be distinguished from healthy chloroplasts, we analyzed fc2 seedlings grown under different levels of photo-oxidative stress. A clear correlation was observed between chloroplast swelling, 1O2-signaling, and the state of degradation. Finally, plastoglobule enzymes involved in chloroplast disassembly were shown to be upregulated while plastoglobules increased their association with the thylakoid grana, implicating an interaction between 1O2-induced chloroplast degradation and senescence pathways.",

    "abstract": "Natural materials such as bone, wood, and bamboo can inspire the fabrication of stiff, lightweight structural materials. Biofilms are one of the most dominant forms of life in nature. However, little is known about their physical properties as a structural material. Here we report an Escherichia coli biofilm having a Youngs modulus close to 10 GPa with ultra-low density, indicating a high-performance structural material. The mechanical and structural characterization of the biofilm and its components illuminates its adaptable bottom-up design, consisting of lightweight microscale cells covered by a dense network of amyloid nanofibrils on the surface. We engineered E. coli such that 1) carbon nanotubes assembled on the biofilm, enhancing its stiffness to over 30 GPa, or that 2) the biofilm sensitively detected heavy metal as an example of an environmental toxin. These demonstrations offer new opportunities for developing responsive living structural materials to serve many real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Although considered the ternary inflammasome structure, whether the singular, perinuclear NLRP3:ASC speck is synonymous with the NLRP3 inflammasome is unclear. Herein we report that the NLRP3:ASC speck is not required for nigericin-induced inflammasome activation, but facilitates and maximizes IL-1{beta} processing. Further, the NLRP3 agonists H2O2 and MSU elicited IL-1{beta} maturation without inducing specks. Notably, caspase-1 activity is spatially distinct from the speck, occurring at multiple cytoplasmic sites. Additionally, caspase-1 activity negatively regulates speck frequency and speck size while speck numbers and IL-1{beta} processing are negatively correlated, cyclical, and can be uncoupled by NLRP3 mutations or inhibiting microtubule polymerization. Finally, when specks are present, caspase-1 is likely activated after leaving the speck structure. Thus, the speck is not the NLRP3 inflammasome itself, but is instead a dynamic structure which may amplify the NLRP3 response to weak stimuli by facilitating the formation and release of small NLRP3:ASC complexes which in turn activate caspase-1.",

    "abstract": "Intra-tumour heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of all cancers. In some cases, such variation can be maintained by interactions between tumour subclones with distinct molecular and phenotypic characteristics. In paediatric gliomas, interactions can take the form of enhanced invasive phenotype, a hallmark of these malignancies. However, subclonal interactions are hard to quantify and difficult to distinguish from spatial confounding factors and experimental bias. Here we combine spatial computational modelling of cellular interactions and invasion, with co-evolution experiments of clonally disassembled primary glioma lines derived at autopsy. We design a Bayesian inference framework to quantify spatial subclonal interactions between molecular and phenotypically distinct lineages with different patterns of invasion. We show how this approach could discriminate genuine subclonal interactions where one clone enhanced the invasive phenotype of another, from apparent interactions that were only due to the complex dynamics of subclones growing in space. This study provides a new approach for the identification and quantification of spatial subclonal interactions in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Sensory input provides incomplete and often misleading information about the physical world. To compensate, the brain uses internal models to predict what the inputs should be from context, experience, and innate biases (Liberman and Mattingly, 1985; Komatsu, 2006; Gilbert and Sigman, 2007; Heald and Nusbaum, 2014). For example, when speech is interrupted by noise, humans perceive the missing sounds behind the noise (Miller and Licklider, 1950; Warren, 1970; Samuel, 1996), a perceptual illusion known as phonemic (or auditory) restoration. The neural mechanisms allowing the auditory system to generate predictions that override ascending sensory information remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) exhibits auditory restoration of conspecific song both in a behavioral task and in neural recordings from the equivalent of auditory cortex. Decoding the responses of a population of single units to occluded songs reveals the spectrotemporal structure of the missing syllables. Surprisingly, restoration occurs under anesthesia and for songs that the bird has not heard. These results show that an internal model of the general structure of conspecific vocalizations can bias sensory processing without attention.",

    "abstract": "Autistic traits represent a continuum dimension across the population, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) being the extreme end of the distribution. Accumulating evidence shows that neuroanatomical and neurofunctional profiles described in relatives of ASD individuals reflect an intermediate neurobiological pattern between the clinical population and healthy controls. This suggests that quantitative measures detecting autistic traits in the general population represent potential candidates for the development of biomarkers identifying early pathophysiological processes associated with ASD. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been extensively employed to investigate neural development and function. In contrast, the potential of fNIRS to define reliable biomarkers of brain activity has been barely explored. Features of non-invasiveness, portability, ease of administration and low-operating costs make fNIRS a suitable instrument to assess brain function for differential diagnosis, follow-up, analysis of treatment outcomes and personalized medicine in several neurological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel standardized procedure with high entertaining value to measure hemodynamic responses (HDR) in the occipital cortex of adult subjects and children. We found that the variability of evoked HDR correlates with the autistic traits of children, assessed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. Interestingly, HDR amplitude was especially linked to social and communication features, representing the core symptoms of ASD. These findings establish a quick and easy strategy for measuring visually-evoked cortical activity with fNIRS that optimize the compliance of young subjects, setting the background for testing the diagnostic value of fNIRS visual measurements in the ASD clinical population.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) function requires the stoichiometric interaction among dozens of proteins but their co-regulation has not been defined in the human brain. Here, using quantitative proteomics across three independent cohorts we systematically characterized the co-regulation patterns of mitochondrial RC proteins in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Whereas the abundance of RC protein subunits that physically assemble into stable complexes were correlated, indicating their co-regulation, RC assembly factors exhibited modest co-regulation. Within complex I, nuclear DNA-encoded subunits exhibited >2.5-times higher co-regulation than mitochondrial (mt)DNA-encoded subunits. Moreover, mtDNA copy number was unrelated to mtDNA-encoded subunits abundance, suggesting that mtDNA content is not limiting. Alzheimers disease (AD) brains exhibited reduced abundance of complex I RC subunits, an effect largely driven by a 2-4% overall lower mitochondrial protein content. These findings provide foundational knowledge to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to age- and disease-related erosion of mitochondrial function in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Proteins that interact within molecular networks tend to have similar functions and when perturbed influence the same organismal traits. Interaction networks can be used to expand the list of likely trait associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we used improvements in SNP-to-gene mapping to perform network based expansion of trait associated genes for 1,002 human traits showing that this recovers known disease genes or drug targets. The similarity of network expansion scores identifies groups of traits likely to share a common genetic basis as well as the biological processes underlying this. We identified 73 pleiotropic gene modules linked to multiple traits that are enriched in genes involved in processes such as protein ubiquitination and RNA processing. We show examples of modules linked to human diseases enriched in genes with pathogenic variants found in patients or relevant mouse knock-out phenotypes and can be used to map targets of approved drugs for repurposing opportunities. Finally, we illustrate the use of the network expansion scores to study genes at inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) GWAS loci, and implicate IBD-relevant genes with strong functional and genetic support.",
