    "abstract": "Supergenes are genetic architectures associated with discrete and concerted variation in multiple traits. It has long been suggested that supergenes control these complex polymorphisms by suppressing recombination between set of coadapted genes. However, because recombination suppression hinders the dissociation of the individual effects of genes within supergenes, there is still little evidence that supergenes evolve by tightening linkage between coadapted genes. Here, combining an landmark-free phenotyping algorithm with multivariate genome wide association studies, we dissected the genetic basis of wing pattern variation in the butterfly Heliconius numata. We showed that the supergene controlling the striking wing-pattern polymorphism displayed by this species contains many independent loci associated with different features of wing patterns. The three chromosomal inversions of this supergene suppress recombination between these loci, supporting the hypothesis that they may have evolved because they captured beneficial combinations of alleles. Some of these loci are associated with colour variations only in morphs controlled by inversions, indicating that they were recruited after the formation of these inversions. Our study shows that supergenes and clusters of adaptive loci in general may form via the evolution of chromosomal rearrangements suppressing recombination between co-adapted loci but also via the subsequent recruitment of linked adaptive mutations.",

    "abstract": "The lesser marbled fritillary, Brenthis ino (Rottemburg, 1775), is a species of Palearctic butterfly. Male B. ino individuals have been reported to have between 12 and 14 pairs of chromosomes, a much reduced chromosome number than is typical in butterflies. Here we present a chromosome-level genome assembly for B. ino, as well as gene and transposable element annotations. The assembly is 411.8 Mb in span with contig and scaffold N50s of 9.6 and 29.5 Mb respectively. We also show evidence that the male individual from which we generated HiC data was heterozygous for a neo-Z chromosome, consistent with inheriting 14 chromosomes from one parent and 13 from the other. This genome assembly will be a valuable resource for studying chromosome evolution in Lepidoptera, as well as for comparative and population genomics more generally.",

Hence, there is a need for objective, generalizable methods that detect underlying patterns in these data, categorize sounds into distinct groups, and quantify similarities between them. Among all computational methods that have been proposed to accomplish this, neighborhood-based dimensionality reduction of spectrograms to produce a latent-space representation of calls stands out for its conceptual simplicity and effectiveness. Using a dataset of manually annotated meerkat (Suricata suricatta) vocalizations, we demonstrate how this method can be used to obtain meaningful latent space representations that reflect the established taxonomy of call types. We analyze strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach, give recommendations for its usage and show application examples, such as the classification of ambiguous calls and the detection of mislabeled calls. All analyses are accompanied by example code to help researchers realize the potential of this method for the study of animal vocalizations.",

    "abstract": "Social isolation, particularly in early life, leads to deleterious physiological and behavioral outcomes. Few studies, if any, have been able to capture the behavioral and neurogenomic consequences of early life social isolation together in a single social animal system. Here, we leverage new high-throughput tools to comprehensively investigate the impact of isolation in the bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) from behavioral, molecular, and neuroanatomical perspectives. We reared newly emerged bumblebees either in complete isolation, small groups, or in their natal colony, and then analyzed their behaviors while alone or paired with another bee. We find that when alone, individuals of each rearing condition show distinct behavioral signatures. When paired with a conspecific, bees reared in small groups or in the natal colony express similar behavioral profiles. Isolated bees, however, showed increased social interactions. To identify the neurobiological correlates of these differences, we quantified brain gene expression and measured the volumes of key brain regions for a subset of individuals from each rearing condition. Overall, we find that isolation increases social interactions and disrupts gene expression and brain development. Limited social experience in small groups is sufficient to preserve typical patterns of brain development and social behavior.",

    "abstract": "Diet-induced obesity (DIO) leads to dysfunctional feeding behavior. However, the precise molecular nodes underlying diet-induced dysregulation of satiety sensing and feeding motivation are poorly understood. The fruit fly is a simple genetic model system yet displays significant evolutionary conservation to mammalian nutrient sensing and energy balance. Using a longitudinal high sugar regime in Drosophila, we sought to address how lipid alteration in fat cells alters feeding behavior. We find that prolonged exposure to HSD degrades the hunger-driven feeding (HDF) response. Lipidomics analysis reveals that longitudinal exposure to HSD significantly alters whole body phospholipid profiles. By performing a systematic screen for phospholipid enzymes, we identify Pect as a critical regulator of hunger-driven feeding. Pect is a rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis pathway and the fly ortholog of human PCYT2. We show that disrupting Pect only in the fat body causes insulin-resistant phenotypes and a loss of hunger-driven feeding. Excitingly, we find that overexpression of Pect restores HSD-induced loss of hunger-driven feeding response. Strikingly human studies have noted a correlation between PCYT2/Pect levels and clinical obesity. Now, our unbiased studies in Drosophila provide specific genetic evidence for Pect in maintaining nutrient sensing during DIO. Our study provides novel insights into the role of phospholipids in interorgan communication of nutrient status.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=193 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472854v4_ufigA1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecf3eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b800f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@461a7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75651c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Fire stimulates germination of most seeds in fire-prone vegetation. Fruits of Leucadendron (Proteaceae) are winged achenes or nutlets that correlate with their requirements for smoke and/or heat in promoting germination. We describe five possible smoke-heat dormancy-release/germination syndromes among plants, of which Leucadendron displays three (no response, smoke only, smoke and heat). As seed-coat thickness varies with seed-storage location (plant or soil) and morphology (winged or wingless), we tested its possible role in water uptake and germination. Species with winged seeds achieved 100% germination in the absence of smoke/heat, seed coats were an order of magnitude thinner, and their permeability greatly exceeded that of nutlets. As seed-coat thickness increased a) imbibitional water uptake declined at a decreasing rate, and b) the response to smoke, and to a lesser extent heat, increased linearly to reach levels of germination approaching those of winged seeds. For species responsive to smoke and heat, there was no additive effect when applied together, suggesting that they may have promoted the same physiological process. By what mechanisms a) the smoke response is greater the thicker the seed coat, and b) smoke chemicals could increase water permeability to explain the non-additive effect of smoke and heat, warrant further investigation.\n\nHighlightWe show Leucadendron seeds are either plant-stored with thin, highly permeable seed-coats that germinate readily; or soil-stored and the thicker their seed-coat, the lower their permeability and greater their need for smoke/heat to promote germination.",

A YYDRxG motif encoded by IGHD3-22 in CDR H3 facilitates targeting to a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. A computational search for a YYDRxG pattern in publicly available sequences identified many antibodies with broad neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV.

The combination of T cell responses to these new pools and Spike (S) were used to discriminate four groups of subjects with different SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine status: non-infected, non-vaccinated (I-V-); infected and non-vaccinated (I+V-); infected and then vaccinated (I+V+); and non-infected and vaccinated (I-V+). The overall classification accuracy based on 30 subjects/group was 89.2% in the original cohort and 88.5% in a validation cohort of 96 subjects. The T cell classification scheme was applicable to different mRNA vaccines, and different lengths of time post-infection/post-vaccination. T cell responses from breakthrough infections (infected vaccinees, V+I+) were also effectively segregated from the responses of vaccinated subjects using the same classification tool system.

Indeed, the recent emergence of the highly-transmissible B.1.1.529 Omicron variant is especially concerning because of the number of mutations, deletions, and insertions in the spike protein. Here, using a panel of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to those with emergency use authorization (EUA) or in advanced clinical development by Vir Biotechnology (S309, the parent mAbs of VIR-7381), AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016), and Celltrion (CT-P59), we report the impact on neutralization of a prevailing, infectious B.1.1.529 Omicron isolate compared to a historical WA1/2020 D614G strain. Several highly neutralizing mAbs (LY-CoV555, LY-CoV016, REGN10933, REGN10987, and CT-P59) completely lost inhibitory activity against B.1.1.529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, whereas others were reduced ([~]12-fold decrease, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination) or minimally affected (S309).

With this first clinical, wound-centric resource of miRs and mRNAs, we identified 17 pathologically relevant miRs that exhibited abnormal VU expression and displayed their targets enriched explicitly in the VU gene signature. Intermeshing regulatory networks controlled by these miRs revealed their high cooperativity in contributing to chronic wound pathology characterized by persistent inflammation and proliferative phase initiation failure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-34a, miR-424, and miR-516, upregulated in VU, cooperatively suppressed keratinocyte growth while promoting inflammatory response.

The molecular mechanism governing the exit of 2C-like state remains obscure, partly due to the lack of a reporter system that can genetically mark intermediate states during exiting process. Here, we identify an intermediate state that is marked by the co-expression of MERVL::tdTomato and OCT4-GFP (MERLOT) during 2C-like-to-pluripotent state transition (2CLPT). Transcriptome and epigenome analyses demonstrate that MERLOT cells cluster closely with 8-16 cell stage mouse embryos, suggesting that 2CLPT partly mimics early preimplantation development. Through a CRISPRa screen, we identify an ARRDC3-NEDD4-OCT4 regulatory axis that plays an essential role in controlling 2CLPT. Furthermore, re-evaluating previously reported 2C-like state regulators reveals dual function of Chaf1a in regulating the entry and exit of 2C-like state. Finally, ATAC-Seq footprinting analysis uncovers Klf3 as an essential transcription factor required for efficient 2CLPT. Together, our study identifies a genetically traceable intermediate state during 2CLPT and provides a valuable tool to study molecular mechanisms regulating this process.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms of cancer cell recognition and elimination by the innate immune system remains unclear. Circulating hemocytes are associated with the hematopoietic tumors in Drosophila mxcmbn1 mutant larvae. The innate immune signalling pathways are activated in the fat body to suppress the tumor growth by inducing antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Here, we investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying the activation in the mutant. Reactive oxygen species accumulated in the hemocytes due to induction of dual oxidase and its activator. The hemocytes were also localized on the fat body. These were essential for transmitting the information on tumors toward the fat body to induce AMP expression. Regarding to the tumor recognition, we found that matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and MMP2 were highly expressed in the tumors. Ectopic expression of MMP2 was associated with AMP induction in the mutants. Furthermore, the basement membrane components in the tumors were reduced and ultimately lost. The hemocytes may recognize the disassembly in the tumors. Our findings highlight the underlying mechanism via which macrophage-like hemocytes recognize tumor cells and relay the information toward the fat body to induce AMPs. and contribute to uncover the immune systems roles against cancer.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTDrosophila blood cells transmit information regarding the existence of tumor cells to the fat body and induce the production of anti-tumor peptides via the generation of reactive oxygen species.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAssembly of plant communities has long been scrutinized through the lens of trait-based ecology. Studies generally analyze functional traits related to the vegetative growth, survival and resource acquisition and thus ignore how ecological processes may affect plants at other stages of their lifecycle, particularly when seeds disperse, persist in soil and germinate.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we analyzed an extensive data set of 16 traits for 167 species measured in-situ in 36 grasslands located along an elevational gradient and compared the impact of abiotic filtering, biotic interactions and dispersal on traits reflecting different trait categories: plant vegetative growth, germination, dispersal, and seed morphology. For each community, we quantified community weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity (FD) for all traits and established their relationships to mean annual temperature.\nC_LIO_LIThe seed traits were weakly correlated to vegetative traits and thus constituted independent axes of plant phenotypical variation that were affected differently by the ecological processes considered. Abiotic filtering impacted mostly the vegetative traits and to a lesser extent on seed germination and morphological traits. Increasing low-temperature stress towards colder sites selected for short-stature, slow-growing and frost-tolerant species that produce small quantity of smaller seeds with higher degree of dormancy, high temperature requirements for germination and comparatively low germination speed.\nC_LIO_LIBiotic interactions, specifically competition in the lowlands and facilitation in uplands, also filtered certain functional traits in the study communities. The benign climate in lowlands promoted plant with competitive strategies including fast growth and resource acquisition (vegetative growth traits) and early and fast germination (germination traits), whereas the effects of facilitation on the vegetative and germination traits were cancelled out by the strong abiotic filtering.\nC_LIO_LIThe changes in the main dispersal vector from zoochory to anemochory along the gradient strongly affected the dispersal and the seed morphological trait structure of the communities. Specifically, stronger vertical turbulence and moderate warm-upwinds combined with low grazing intensity selected for light and non-round shaped seeds with lower terminal velocity and endozoochorous potential.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. We clearly demonstrate that, in addition to vegetation traits, seed traits can substantially contribute to functional structuring of plant communities along environmental gradients. Thus, the, hard seed traits related to germination and dispersal are critical to detect multiple, complex community assembly rules. Consequently, such traits should be included in core lists of plant traits and, when applicable, be incorporated into analysis of community assembly.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "As warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) has innate immunity against African swine fever (ASF), it is critical to understand the evolutionary novelty of warthog to explain its specific ASF resistance. Here, we present two completed new genomes of one warthog and one Kenyan domestic pig, as the fundamental genomic references to decode the genetic mechanism on ASF tolerance. Our results indicated, multiple genomic variations, including gene losses, independent contraction and expansion of specific gene families, likely moulded warthogs genome to adapt the environment. Importantly, the analysis of the presence and absence of genomic sequences revealed that, the warthog genome had a DNA sequence absence of the lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) gene on chromosome 2 compared to the reference genome. The overexpression and siRNA of LDHB indicated that its inhibition on the replication of ASFV. Combining with large-scale sequencing data of 123 pigs from all over the world, contraction and expansion of TRIM genes families revealed that TRIM family genes in the warthog genome were potentially responsible for its tolerance to ASF. Our results will help further improve the understanding of genetic resistance ASF in pigs.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWTo date, ancient genome analyses have been largely confined to the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major contributor of disease and of evolutionary adaptation, but identifying CNVs in ancient shotgun-sequenced genomes is hampered by typical low coverage (<1 x) and short fragments (<80 bps), precluding standard CNV detection software to be effectively applied to ancient genomes. Here we present CONGA, tailored for genotyping CNVs at low coverage. Simulations and down-sampling experiments suggest that CONGA can genotype deletions >1 kbps with F-scores >0.75 at [&ge;]1x, and distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous states. We applied CONGA to genotype 10,002 outgroup-ascertained deletions across a heterogenous set of 71 ancient human genomes spanning the last 50,000 years, produced using variable experimental protocols. A fraction of these (21/71) display divergent deletion profiles unrelated to their population origin, but attributable to technical factors such as coverage and read length. The majority of the sample (50/71), despite originating from nine different laboratories and having coverages 0.44x-26x (median 4x) and read lengths 52-121 bp (median 69), exhibit coherent deletion frequencies. Across these 50 genomes, inter-individual genetic diversity measured using SNPs and CONGA-genotyped deletions are strongly correlated. CONGA-genotyped deletions also display purifying selection signatures, as expected. CONGA thus paves the way for systematic CNV analyses in ancient genomes, despite the technical challenges posed by low and variable genome coverage.",

    "abstract": "The presence of naturally-occurring color mutants in plants has permitted the identification of many regulatory genes implicated in the synthesis of discrete metabolic compounds, mostly anthocyanins and carotenoids. Conversely, transcription factors that coordinate more than one specialized metabolic pathway seem challenging to screen from a forward genetics perspective. We explored the relationship between different branches of the phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways while examining an infrequent berry skin color variegation in grapevine. Red and white berry skin sections were compared at the genetic, transcriptomic and metabolomic levels showing that, as in most cultivated white grape varieties, the uncolored skin section convened the non-functional alleles of the anthocyanin regulators MYBA1 and MYBA2, explaining the lack of pigments. In contrast, light-responsive flavonols and monoterpenes increased in anthocyanin-depleted areas. We disclosed an enrichment of the flavonol, terpene and carotenoid pathways among up-regulated genes from white-skin sections, accompanied by increased expressions of flavonol regulators and the still uncharacterized MYB24 gene. We used DAP-seq to examine the in vitro binding of affinity-purified MYB24 protein to genomic DNA and demonstrated its binding in the promoter regions of terpene (22) and carotenoid (6) genes, in addition to more than 30 photosynthesis and light-response genes, including the flavonol-regulator HY5 homologue (HYH). We confirmed the activation of TPS35 and HYH promoter:luciferase reporters in the presence of MYB24 and the grape bHLH MYC2, all of which correlate in their higher expression in white skin variegated sections. The integration of several datasets allowed to define a list of high confidence targets, suggesting MYB24 as a modulator of light responses including the synthesis of flavonoids (flavonols) and isoprenoids (terpenes, and putatively carotenoids). The correspondence between MYB24 and monoterpenes in all conditions surveyed implies that this regulatory network is broadly triggered towards berry ripening, and that the absence of anthocyanin sunscreens accelerates its activation most likely in a dose-dependent manner due to increased radiation exposure.",

    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a rare X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, mainly caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Reduction in monoamine levels in RTT patients and mouse models suggested the possibility to rescue clinical phenotypes through antidepressants. Accordingly, we tested mirtazapine (MTZ), a noradrenergic and specific-serotonergic tetracyclic antidepressant (NaSSA). In previous studies, we showed high tolerability and significant positive effects of MTZ in male Mecp21m1.1Bird-knock-out mice, adult female Mecp2tm1.1Bird-heterozygous (Mecp2+/-) mice, and adult female RTT patients. However, it remained to explore MTZ efficacy in female Mecp2+/- mice at young ages. As RTT-like phenotypes in young Mecp2+/- mice have been less investigated, we carried out a behavioural characterization to analyze Mecp2+/- mice in \"early adolescence\" (6 weeks) and \"late adolescence/young adulthood\" (11 weeks) and identified several progressive phenotypes. Then, we evaluated the effects of either a 15- or a 30-day MTZ treatment on body weight and impaired motor behaviours in 11-week-old Mecp2+/- mice. Finally, since defective cortical development is a hallmark of RTT, we performed a histological study on the maturation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) and parvalbuminergic (PV) neurons in the primary motor cortex. The 30-day MTZ treatment was more effective than the shorter 15-day treatment, leading to the significant rescue of body weight, hindlimb clasping and motor learning in the accelerating rotarod test. Behavioral improvement was associated with normalized PV immunoreactivity levels and PNN thickness. These results support the use of MTZ as a new potential treatment for adolescent girls affected by RTT and suggest a possible mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the sleep-wake states have been analysed using novel complexity measures, complementing the classical analysis of EEGs by frequency bands. This new approach consistently shows a decrease in EEGs complexity during slow-wave sleep, yet it is unclear how cortical oscillations shape these complexity variations. In this work, we analyse how the frequency content of brain signals affects the complexity estimates in freely moving rats. We find that the low-frequency spectrum - including the Delta, Theta, and Sigma frequency bands - drives the complexity changes during the sleep-wake states. This happens because low-frequency oscillations emerge from neuronal population patterns, as we show by recovering the complexity variations during the sleep-wake cycle from micro, meso, and macroscopic recordings. Moreover, we find that the lower frequencies reveal synchronisation patterns across the neocortex, such as a sensory-motor decoupling that happens during REM sleep. Overall, our works shows that EEGs low frequencies are critical in shaping the sleep-wake states complexity across cortical scales.",

    "abstract": "Methods for patterning neurons in vitro have gradually improved and are used to investigate questions difficult to address in or ex vivo. Though these techniques guide axons between groups of neurons, multiscale control of neuronal connectivity, from circuits to synapses, is yet to be achieved in vitro. As studying neuronal circuits with synaptic resolution in vivo poses significant challenges, an in vitro alternative could serve as a testbed for in vivo experiments or as a platform for validating biophysical and computational models. In this work we use a combination of electron beam and photolithography to create polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures with features ranging from 150 nanometers to a few millimeters. Leveraging the difference between average axon and dendritic spine diameters, we restrict axon growth while allowing spines to pass through nanochannels to guide synapse formation between small groups of neurons (i.e. nodes). We show this technique can be used to generate large numbers of isolated feed-forward circuits where connections between nodes are restricted to regions connected by nanochannels. Using a genetically encoded calcium indicator in combination with fluorescently tagged post synaptic protein, PSD-95, we demonstrate functional synapses can form in this region. Although more work needs to be done to control connectivity in vitro, we believe this is a significant step in that direction.",

To date, the neurophysiological mechanisms that implement contextual priors to guide subsequent actions remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that increasing behavioral uncertainty introduces a shift from an oscillatory to a continuous processing mode in human prefrontal cortex. At the population level, we found that oscillatory and continuous dynamics reflect dissociable signatures that support distinct aspects of encoding, transmission and execution of context-dependent action plans. We show that prefrontal population activity encodes predictive context and action plans in serially unfolding orthogonal subspaces, while prefrontal-motor theta oscillations synchronize action-encoding population subspaces to mediate the hand-off of action plans. Collectively, our results reveal how two key features of large-scale population activity, namely continuous population trajectories and oscillatory synchrony, operate in concert to guide context-dependent human behavior.",

Here we report that tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate, small molecule metabolites secreted by the probiotic milk-fermented yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus inhibit hyperinflammation (e.g., \"cytokine storm\"). Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro analyses, employing LPS-induced hyperinflammation models, reveal dramatic effects of the molecules, added in tandem, on mice morbidity, laboratory parameters, and mortality. Specifically, we observed attenuated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1, IL-1{beta} and TNF-, and reduced reactive oxygen species. Importantly, tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate did not completely suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, rather brought their concentrations back to baseline levels thus maintaining core immune functions, including phagocytosis. The anti-inflammatory effects of tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate were mediated through downregulation of TLR4, IL-1R, and TNFR signaling pathways and increased A20 expression, leading to NF-kB inhibition. Overall, this work illuminates phenomenological and molecular details underscoring anti-inflammatory properties of small molecules identified in a probiotic mixture, pointing to potential therapeutic avenues against severe inflammation.",

For these purposes we created a database consisting of 347 records of the roller made ever in Ukraine. We employed a species distribution modeling (SDM) approach to hindcast changes in the suitable range of the roller during historical times across Ukraine and to derive spatially explicit predictions of climatic suitability for the species under current climate. SDMs were created for three time intervals (before 1980, 1985-2009, 2010-2021) using corresponding climate data extracted from the TerraClim database. SDMs show a decline of suitable for rollers areas in the country from 85 to 46%. Several factors, including land cover and use, human population density and climate, that could have contributed to the decline of the species in Ukraine were considered.

    "abstract": "Most genomic prediction models are linear regression models that assume continuous and normally distributed phenotypes, but responses to diseases such as stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) are commonly recorded in ordinal scales and percentages. Disease severity (SEV) and infection type (IT) data in germplasm screening nurseries generally do not follow these assumptions. On this regard, researchers may ignore the lack of normality, transform the phenotypes, use generalized linear models, or use supervised learning algorithms and classification models with no restriction on the distribution of response variables, which are less sensitive when modeling ordinal scores. The goal of this research was to compare classification and regression genomic selection models for skewed phenotypes using stripe rust SEV and IT in winter wheat. We extensively compared both regression and classification prediction models using two training populations composed of breeding lines phenotyped in four years (2016-2018, and 2020) and a diversity panel phenotyped in four years (2013-2016). The prediction models used 19,861 genotyping-by-sequencing single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Overall, square root transformed phenotypes using rrBLUP and support vector machine regression models displayed the highest combination of accuracy and relative efficiency across the regression and classification models. Further, a classification system based on support vector machine and ordinal Bayesian models with a 2-Class scale for SEV reached the highest class accuracy of 0.99. This study showed that breeders can use linear and non-parametric regression models within their own breeding lines over combined years to accurately predict skewed phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Flippases and floppases are two classes of proteins that have opposing functions in the maintenance of lipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane. Flippases translocate lipids from the exoplasmic leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet, and floppases act in the opposite direction. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major component of the eukaryotic plasma membrane and is asymmetrically distributed, being more abundant in the exoplasmic leaflet. Here we show that gene amplification of a putative PC floppase or double disruption of two PC flippases in the pathogenic yeast Candida parapsilosis results in resistance to miltefosine, an alkylphosphocholine drug that affects PC metabolism that has recently been granted orphan drug designation approval by the US FDA for treatment of invasive candidiasis. We analysed the genomes of 170 C. parapsilosis isolates and found that 107 of them have copy number variations (CNVs) at the RTA3 gene. RTA3 encodes a putative PC floppase whose deletion is known to increase the inward translocation of PC in Candida albicans. RTA3 copy number ranges from 2 to >40 across the C. parapsilosis isolates. Interestingly, 16 distinct CNVs with unique endpoints were identified, and phylogenetic analysis shows that almost all of them have originated only once. We found that increased copy number of RTA3 correlates with miltefosine resistance. Additionally, we conducted an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment in which two C. parapsilosis isolates were cultured in increasing concentrations of miltefosine over 26 days. Two genes, CPAR2_303950 and CPAR2_102700, gained homozygous protein-disrupting mutations in the evolved strains and code for putative PC flippases homologous to S. cerevisiae DNF1. Our results indicate that alteration of lipid asymmetry across the plasma membrane is a key mechanism of miltefosine resistance. We also find that C. parapsilosis is likely to gain resistance to miltefosine rapidly, because many isolates carry loss-of-function alleles in one of the flippase genes.\n\nAuthor summaryMiltefosine was developed as an anticancer drug but is commonly used to treat infections with the protozoan parasites Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi. More recently, it has been used to treat fungal infections, and in 2021 it was designated as an orphan drug by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of invasive candidiasis. Miltefosine is a derivative of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major constituent of the cell membrane. PC and other phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed across the cell membrane. The mechanism of action of miltefosine is unknown. Here, we show that either increasing the activity of a putative floppase, which controls outward \"flop\" movement of phospholipids, or decreasing the activity of flippases, which control inward \"flip\" movement, results in increased resistance of the fungal pathogen Candida parapsilosis to miltefosine. This result suggests that miltefosine acts by controlling the localisation of PC or other phospholipids in the membrane. Importantly, we find that many C. parapsilosis isolates carry mutations in one flippase gene, which renders them partially resistant to miltefosine, and prone to easily acquiring increased resistance.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between human Growth Hormone (hGH) and hGH Receptor (hGHR) has great relevance to human diseases such as acromegaly and cancer. HGH has been extensively engineered by other workers to improve binding and other properties. We used a computational screen to select substitutions at single hGH positions within the hGHR-binding site. We find that, while many successfully slow down dissociation of the hGH-hGHR complex once bound, they also slow down the association of hGH to hGHR. We are particularly interested in E174 which belongs to the hGH zinc-binding triad, and which spans coiled-coil helices and obeys the coiled-coil heptad pattern. Surprisingly, substituting E174 with A leads to substantial increase in an experimental measure of coiled-coil content. E174A is known to increase affinity of hGH against hGHR; here we show that this is simply because the off-rate is slowed down more than the on-rate, in line with what has been found for other affinity-improving mutations. For E174Y (and mutations at other sites) the slowdown in on-rate was greater, leading to decreased affinity. The results point to a link between coiled-coiling, zinc binding, and hGHR-binding affinity in hGH, and also suggest rules for choosing affinity-increasing substitutions.",

    "abstract": "Perforin-like proteins (PLPs) play key roles in the mechanisms associated with parasitic disease caused by apicomplexans such as Plasmodium (malaria) and Toxoplasma. The T. gondii PLP1 (TgPLP1) mediates tachyzoite egress from cells, while the five Plasmodium PLPs carry out various roles in the life cycle of the parasite and with respect to the molecular basis of disease. Here we focus on Plasmodium vivax PLP1 and PLP2 (PvPLP1 and PvPLP2) compared to TgPLP1; PvPLP1 is important for invasion of mammalian hosts by the parasite and establishment of a chronic infection, PvPLP2 is important during the symptomatic blood stage of the parasite life cycle. Determination of the crystal structure of the membrane-binding APC{beta} domain of PvPLP1 reveals notable differences with that of TgPLP1, which are reflected in its inability to bind lipid bilayers in the way that TgPLP1 and PvPLP2 can be shown to. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays allow a dissection of the binding interactions of TgPLP1 and PvPLP2 on lipid bilayers, and reveal a similar tropism for lipids found enriched in the inner leaflet of the mammalian plasma membrane. In addition to this shared mode of membrane binding PvPLP2 displays a secondary synergistic interaction side-on from its principal bilayer interface. This study underlines the substantial differences between the biophysical properties of the APC{beta} domains of Apicomplexan PLPs, which reflect their significant sequence diversity. Such differences will be important factors in determining the cell targeting and membrane-binding activity of the different proteins, in their different developmental roles within parasite life cycles.",

In this work, we localize the cleavage site in the first loop of the extracellular domain using amino-terminal protein sequencing of purified receptor and by mutagenesis studies. We further show, that a receptor mutant not susceptible to proteolytic cleavage exhibits reduced signaling to Gs and increased activation of Gq compared to wild-type PTH1R.

    "abstract": "Electrical waves that rotate in the heart organize dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Finding the region around which such rotation occurs is one of the most important practical questions for arrhythmia management. For many years, the main method for finding such regions was so-called phase mapping, in which a continuous phase was assigned to points in the heart based on their excitation status and defining the rotation region as a point of phase singularity. Recent analysis, however, showed that in many rotation regimes there exist phase discontinuities and the region of rotation must be defined not as a point of phase singularity, but as a phase defect line. In this paper, we use this novel methodology and perform a comparative study of three different phase definitions applied to in silico data and to experimental data obtained from optical voltage mapping experiments on monolayers of human atrial myocytes. We introduce new phase defect detection algorithms and compare them with those that appeared in literature already. We find that the phase definition is more important than the algorithm to identify sudden spatial phase variations. Sharp phase defect lines can be obtained from a phase derived from local activation times observed during one cycle of arrhythmia. Alternatively, similar quality can be obtained from a reparameterization of the classical phase obtained from observation of a single timeframe of transmembrane potential. We found that the phase defect line length was (35.9 {+/-} 6.2) mm in the Fenton-Karma model and (4.01 {+/-} 0.55) mm in cardiac human atrial myocyte monolayers. As local activation times are obtained during standard clinical cardiac mapping, the methods are also suitable to be applied to clinical datasets. All studied methods are publicly available and can be downloaded from an institutional web-server.",

Here, we report in vitro assembly conditions with recombinant tau that replicate the structures of filaments from both Alzheimers disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as determined by cryo-EM. Our results suggest that post-translational modifications of tau modulate filament assembly, and that previously observed additional densities in AD and CTE filaments may arise from the presence of inorganic salts, like phosphates and sodium chloride. In vitro assembly of tau into disease-relevant filaments will facilitate studies to determine their roles in different diseases, as well as the development of compounds that specifically bind to these structures or prevent their formation.",

    "abstract": "Reconstitution of T cell repertoire after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a long and often incomplete process. As a result, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a frequent complication that may be treated by adoptive transfer of donor-derived EBV-specific T cells. We generated donor-derived EBV-specific T cells by peptide stimulation and adoptively transferred them to a patient with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), who had developed persisting high titers of EBV concomitant to relapse after transplantation. T cell receptor beta (TCR{beta}) deep sequencing showed that the T cell repertoire of the patient early after transplantation (day 60) was strongly reduced and only very low numbers of EBV-specific T cells were detectable. Manufacturing and in vitro expansion of donor-derived EBV-specific T cells resulted in enrichment of EBV epitope-specific, HLA-restricted T cells. Monitoring after adoptive transfer revealed that the dominant TCR sequences from peptide-stimulated T cells persisted long-term and established an EBV-specific TCR clonotype repertoire in the host, with many of the EBV-specific TCRs present in the donor. This reconstituted repertoire was associated with immunological control of EBV and with lack of further AITL relapse.\n\nAuthor summaryA characteristic feature of all herpesviruses is their persistence in the hosts body after primary infection. Hence, the hosts immune system is confronted with the problem to control these viruses life-long. Well-known representative of the herpesvirus group are the classic Herpes-Simplex Virus (HSV-1) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, causing chicken pox); a less known representative is Epstein Barr Virus (EBV, causing mononucleosis). When the immune system is severely compromised, for example after stem cell transplantation from a foreign (allogeneic) donor, these viruses can reappear, as they are already in the hosts body. Especially EBV cause life-threatening complications after stem cell transplantation and only reinforcement of the hosts immune system can reestablish viral control. Here we show that ex vivo manufactured EBV-specific T cells can reestablish long-term control of EBV and that these cells persist in the hosts body over months. These results give us a better understanding of viral immune reconstitution post-transplant and of clinically-relevant T cell populations against EBV.",

    "abstract": "The genus Neisseria includes two pathogenic species, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, and numerous commensal species. Neisseria species frequently exchange DNA with one other, primarily via transformation and homologous recombination, and via multiple types of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Few Neisseria bacteriophages (phages) have been identified and their impact on bacterial physiology is poorly understood. Furthermore, little is known about the range of species that Neisseria phages can infect. In this study, we used three virus prediction tools to scan 248 genomes of 21 different Neisseria species and identified 1302 unique predicted prophages. Using comparative genomics, we found that many predictions are dissimilar from other prophages and MGEs previously described to infect Neisseria species. We also identified similar predicted prophages in genomes of different Neisseria species. Additionally, we examined CRISPR-Cas targeting of each Neisseria genome and predicted prophage. While CRISPR targeting of chromosomal DNA appears to be common among several Neisseria species, we found that 20% of the prophages we predicted are targeted significantly more than the rest of the bacterial genome in which they were identified (i.e., backbone). Furthermore, many predicted prophages are targeted by CRISPR spacers encoded by other species. We then used these results to infer additional host species of known Neisseria prophages and predictions that are highly targeted relative to the backbone. Together, our results suggest that we have identified novel Neisseria prophages, several of which may infect multiple Neisseria species. These findings have important implications for understanding horizontal gene transfer between members of this genus.\n\nIMPORTANCEDrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major threat to human health. Commensal Neisseria species are thought to serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes for the pathogenic species N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. Therefore, it is important to understand both the diversity of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that can mediate horizontal gene transfer within this genus, and the breadth of species these MGEs can infect. In particular, few bacteriophages (phages) have been identified and characterized in Neisseria species. In this study, we identified a large number of candidate phages integrated within the genomes of commensal and pathogenic Neisseria species, many of which appear to be novel phages. Importantly, we discovered extensive interspecies targeting of predicted phages by Neisseria CRISPR-Cas systems, which may reflect their movement between different species. Uncovering the diversity and host range of phages is essential for understanding how they influence the evolution of their microbial hosts.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that reside in a bacterial host chromosome and are prominent drivers of bacterial evolution. They are also powerful tools for genetic analyses and engineering. Transfer of an ICE to a new host involves many steps, including excision from the chromosome, DNA processing and replication, transfer across the envelope of the donor and recipient, processing of the DNA, and eventual integration into the chromosome of the new host (now a stable transconjugant). Interactions between an ICE and its hosts throughout the life cycle likely influence the efficiencies of acquisition by new hosts. Here, we investigated how different functional modules of two ICEs, Tn916 and ICEBs1, affect the transfer efficiencies into different host bacteria. We constructed hybrid elements that utilize the high-efficiency regulatory and excision modules of ICEBs1 and the conjugation genes of Tn916. These elements produced more transconjugants than Tn916, likely due to increased excision frequencies. We also found that several Tn916 and ICEBs1 components can substitute for one other. Using B. subtilis donors and three Enterococcus species as recipients, we found that different hybrid elements were more readily acquired by some species than others, demonstrating species-specific interactions in steps of the ICE life cycle. This work demonstrates that hybrid elements utilizing the efficient regulatory functions of ICEBs1 can be built to enable efficient transfer into and engineering of a variety of other species.\n\nAuthor summary (non-technical)Horizontal gene transfer helps drive microbial evolution, enabling bacteria to rapidly acquire new genes and traits. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that reside in a bacterial host chromosome and are prominent drivers of horizontal gene transfer. They are also powerful tools for genetic analyses and engineering. Some ICEs carry genes that confer obvious properties to host bacteria, including antibiotic resistances, symbiosis, and pathogenesis. When activated, an ICE-encoded machine is made that can transfer the element to other cells, where it then integrates into the chromosome of the new host. Specific ICEs transfer more effectively into some bacterial species compared to others, yet little is known about the determinants of the efficiencies and specificity of acquisition by different bacterial species. We made and utilized hybrid ICEs, composed of parts of two different elements, to investigate determinants of transfer efficiencies. Our findings demonstrate that there are species-specific interactions that help determine efficiencies of stable acquisition, and that this explains, in part, the efficiencies of different ICEs. These hybrid elements are also useful in genetic engineering and synthetic biology to move genes and pathways into different bacterial species with greater efficiencies than can be achieved with naturally occurring ICEs.",

    "abstract": "Quick and accurate detection of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against yellow fever is essential in serodiagnosis during outbreaks, for surveillance and to evaluate vaccine efficacy in population-wide studies. All this requires serological assays that can process a large number of samples in a highly standardized format. Albeit being laborious, time-consuming and limited in throughput, classical plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is still considered gold standard for the detection and quantification of nAbs due to its sensitivity and specificity. Here we report the development of an alternative fluorescence-based serological assay (SNTFLUO) with an equally high sensitivity and specificity that is fit for high-throughput testing with the potential for automation. Finally, our novel SNTFLUO was cross-validated in several reference laboratories and against international WHO standards showing its potential to be implemented in clinical use. SNTFLUO assays with similar performance are available for the Japanese encephalitis, Zika and dengue viruses amenable for differential diagnostics.\n\nIMPORTANCEFast and accurate detection of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against yellow fever virus (YFV) is key in yellow fever serodiagnosis, outbreak surveillance and monitoring of vaccine efficacy.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Trypanosoma cruzi infection renders the transfer of the mitochondrion kinetoplast DNA minicircle sequences into the hosts genome. The Aves are refractory to the infection, but chicks hatched from the T. cruzi inoculated eggs integrate the DNA minicircle sequences into the germ line cells. Rabbits, mice and chickens with the minicircle sequences mutations develop the Chagas cardiomyopathy and the DNA transfer underpins the heart disease.\n\nMethodologyThe PCR with the specific primer sets revealed the Protist nuclear DNA and the kinetoplast DNA in the agarose gels bands probed with the radiolabel specific sequences from tissues of the T. cruzi-infected rabbits and of the mice. A target- primer TAIL-PCR amplification employing primer sets from the chickens, rabbits and mice, in combination with primer sets from the the T. cruzi kinetoplast minicircle sequences was used. This approach led us to disclose the integration sites of the kinetoplast DNA biomarker, then, used to monitor the effect of multidrug treatment of the T. cruzi infected mice.\n\nPrincipal findingsThe Southern hybridization, clone and sequence of the amplification products revealed the DNA minicircle sequences integrations sites in the LINE transposable elements. An array of inhibitors of eukaryote cells division was used to arrest the DNA transfer. It was shown that nine out of 12 inhibitors prevented the kinetoplast DNA integration into the macrophage genome. The multidrug treatment of the acutely T. cruzi-infected mice with Benznidazole, Azidothymidine and Ofloxacin lessened circa 2.5-fold the rate of the minicircle sequences integrations in the mouse genome and inhibited the rejection of the target heart cells.\n\nConclusion and significanceThe T. cruzi mitochondrion kinetoplast minicircle sequences transfer driven pathogenesis of Chagas disease is an ancient Cross-Kingdom DNA phenomenon of evolution and, therefore, paradigm research with effective purposing inhibitors is needed.\n\nAuthors summaryChagas disease is considered the main cause of human heart failure in the Western Hemisphere. The treatment of the clinically manifested Chagas heart disease is considered unsatisfactory. Perhaps the most important problem in the field of Chagas disease is determination of the pathogenesis of the target heart cells lysis. We showed the transfer of the T. cruzi kDNA minicircle sequences into the genome of rabbits and mice, and to Bird refractory to the infections. The inoculation of a few T. cruzi in the fertile chicken eggs renders the kDNA sequences integration in the stem cells. Interestingly, the chicks that hatched retain the kDNA and develop the Chagas-like cardiomyopathy indistinguishable to that in the rabbits and mice. This result prompted the multidrug treatment of the Chagas heart disease with inhibitors of the eukaryotic cells division. We showed that nine out of 12 inhibitors prevented the transfer of the kDNA mutations into the macrophage genome, and that the treatment of the acutely T. cruzi-infected mice with Benznidazole + Ofloxacin + Azidothymidine lowered circa 2.5-fold the rate of the mutations in the chromosomes. These findings translated to the pathology showing inhibition of the heart lesions in the treated T. cruzi-infected mice. We suggest purposing new inhibitors should be tested to overturning the Chagas heart disease.",

    "abstract": "The protist parasite Trypanosoma brucei has a single mitochondrion with a single unit genome termed kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Faithfull segregation of replicated kDNA is ensured by a complicated structure termed tripartite attachment complex (TAC). The TAC physically links the basal body of the flagellum with the kDNA spanning the two mitochondrial membranes. Here, we characterized p166 as the only TAC subunit that is anchored in the inner membrane. Its C-terminal transmembrane domain separates the protein into a large N-terminal region that interacts with the kDNA-localized TAC102 and a 34 aa C-tail that binds to the intermembrane space-exposed loop of the integral outer membrane protein TAC60. Thus, in contrast to the outer membrane TAC region which requires four essential subunits for proper function a single inner membrane TAC subunit is sufficient to bridge the distance from the OM to the kDNA. Surprisingly, non-functional p166 lacking the C-terminal 34 aa still localizes to the TAC region. This suggests the existence of non-essential TAC-associated proteins in the OM. These proteins can loosely bind to non-functional p166 lacking the C-terminal 34 aa and keep it at the TAC but their binding would not be strong enough to withstand the mechanical force upon kDNA segregation.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMitochondria evolved from a single endosymbiotic event and are a hallmark of eukaryotes. The large majority of genes for mitochondrial proteins are nuclear encoded now and only a small number are found in the mitochondrial genome. The protist Trypanosoma brucei is an extreme eukaryote in many aspects. For instance, trypanosomes have a single mitochondrion and its genome - called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) - locates as a single unit inside the mitochondrion close to the basal body of the flagellum. The tripartite attachment complex (TAC) forms a connection between the basal body and the kDNA ensuring faithful segregation of kDNA among the daughter cells upon cytokinesis. Recently, several TAC subunits of the cytoplasm, the outer mitochondrial membrane (OM) and the mitochondrial matrix have been characterized. Here, we identify p166 as the first TAC subunit of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is anchored with a single transmembrane domain separating the protein into a N-terminal moiety located in the matrix and a short C-tail. The latter reaches into the intermembrane space and binds the OM subunit TAC60 whereas the N-terminus interacts with the matrix subunit TAC102. Thus, with p166 we identified the missing link required to connect different modules of the TAC.",

    "abstract": "LTBP1 is a large extracellular matrix protein and an associated ligand of fibrillinmicrofibrils. Knowledge of LTBP1 functions is largely limited to its role in targeting and sequestering TGF{beta} growth factors within the extracellular matrix, thereby regulating their bioavailability. However, the recent description of a wide spectrum of phenotypes in multiple tissues in patients harboring LTBP1 pathogenic variants suggests a multifaceted role of the protein in the homeostasis of connective tissues. To better understand the human pathology caused by LTBP1 deficiency it is important to investigate its functional role in extracellular matrix formation. In this study, we show that LTBP1 coordinates the incorporation of fibrillin-1 and -2 into the extracellular matrix in vitro. We also demonstrate that this function is differentially exerted by the two isoforms, the short and long forms of LTBP1. Thereby our findings uncover a novel TGF{beta}-independent LTBP1 function potentially contributing to the development of connective tissue disorders.",

While directional migration often relies on a chemokine gradient generated from a localized source, we find that zebrafish ventrolateral mesoderm is guided by the uniformly expressed and secreted protein Toddler/ELABELA/Apela, acting as a self-generated gradient. We show that the Apelin receptor, which is specifically expressed in mesodermal cells, has a dual role during gastrulation, acting as a scavenger receptor to generate a Toddler gradient, and as a chemokine receptor to sense this guidance cue. Thus, we uncover a single receptor-based self-generated gradient as the enigmatic guidance cue that can robustly steer the directional migration of mesoderm through the complex and continuously changing environment of the gastrulating embryo.\n\nOne sentence summaryAplnr has a dual role to self-generate and sense a Toddler gradient directing mesodermal cells during zebrafish gastrulation.",

Ly6a, also known as Sca1 (Stem Cell Antigen-1) and TAP (T-cell activating protein), is a member of the Ly6a subfamily gene cluster.

    "abstract": "Given a limited number of molecular components, cells face various allocation problems demanding decisions on how to distribute their resources. For instance, cells decide which enzymes to produce at what quantity, but also where to position them. Here we focus on the spatial allocation problem of how to distribute enzymes such as to maximize the total reaction flux produced by them in a system with given geometry and boundary conditions. So far, such distributions have been studied by computational optimization, but a deeper theoretical understanding was lacking. We derive an optimal allocation principle, which demands that the available enzymes are distributed such that the marginal flux returns at each occupied position are equal. This  homogeneous marginal returns criterion (HMR criterion) corresponds to a portfolio optimization criterion in a scenario where each investment globally feeds back onto all payoffs. The HMR criterion allows us to analytically understand and characterize a localization-delocalization transition in the optimal enzyme distribution that was previously observed numerically. In particular, our analysis reveals the generality of the transition, and produces a practical test for the optimality of enzyme localization by comparing the reaction flux to the influx of substrate. Based on these results, we devise an additive construction algorithm, which builds up optimal enzyme arrangements systematically rather than by trial and error. Taken together, our results reveal a common principle in allocation problems from biology and economics, which can also serve as a design principle for synthetic biomolecular systems.",

We present bnClustOmics, a statistical model and computational tool for multi-omics unsupervised clustering, which serves a dual purpose: Clustering patient samples based on a Bayesian network mixture model and learning the networks of omics variables representing these clusters. The discovered networks encode interactions among all omics variables and provide a molecular characterization of each patient subgroup. We conducted simulation studies that demonstrated the advantages of our approach compared to other clustering methods in the case where the generative model is a mixture of Bayesian networks. We applied bnClustOmics to a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dataset comprising genome (mutation and copy number), transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data. We identified three main HCC subtypes together with molecular characteristics, some of which are associated with survival even when adjusting for the clinical stage. Cluster-specific networks shed light on the links between genotypes and molecular phenotypes of samples within their respective clusters and suggest targets for personalized treatments.\n\nAuthor summaryMulti-omics approaches to cancer subtyping can provide more insights into molecular changes in tumors compared to single-omics approaches. However, most multi-omics clustering methods do not take into account that gene products interact, for example, as parts of protein complexes or signaling networks. Here we present bnClustOmics, a Bayesian network mixture model for unsupervised clustering of multi-omics data, which can represent dependencies among molecular changes of various omics types explicitly. Unlike other approaches that use data from public interaction databases as ground truth, bnClustOmics learns the dependencies between genes from the analyzed multi-omics dataset. At the same time, our approach can also account for prior knowledge from public interaction databases and use it to guide network learning without losing the ability to learn new dependencies. We applied bnClustOmics to a multi-omics HCC dataset and identified three subtypes similar to those identified in other HCC studies. The cluster-specific networks learned by bnClustOmics revealed additional insights into the molecular characterization of the discovered subgroups and highlighted the changes in signaling networks leading to distinct HCC phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "In vivo calcium imaging is a standard neuroimaging technique that allows selective observation of target neuronal activities. In calcium imaging, neuron activation signals provide key information for the investigation of neural circuits. For efficient extraction of the calcium signals of neurons, selective detection of the region of interest (ROI) pixels corresponding to the active subcellular region of the target neuron is essential. However, current ROI detection methods for calcium imaging data exhibit a relatively low signal extraction performance from neurons with a low signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR). This is problematic because a low SNR is unavoidable in many biological experiments. Therefore, we propose an iterative correlation-based ROI detection (ICoRD) method that robustly extracts the calcium signal of the target neuron from a calcium imaging series with severe noise. ICoRD extracts calcium signals closer to the ground-truth calcium signal than the conventional method from simulated calcium imaging data in all low SNR ranges. Additionally, this study confirmed that ICoRD robustly extracts activation signals against noise, even within in vivo environments. ICoRD showed reliable detection from neurons with a low SNR and sparse activation, which were not detected by conventional methods. ICoRD will facilitate our understanding of neural circuit activity by providing significantly improved ROI detection in noisy images.",

    "abstract": "Patients with early-onset Alzheimers disease (EOAD) are at elevated risk for seizures, including patients with presenilin 2 (PSEN2) variants. Like people with epilepsy, uncontrolled seizures may worsen cognitive function in AD. While the relationship between seizures and amyloid beta accumulation has been more thoroughly investigated, the role of other drivers of seizure susceptibility in EOAD remain relatively understudied. We therefore sought to define the impact of loss of normal PSEN2 function and chronic seizures on cognitive function in the aged brain. Male and female PSEN2 KO and age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) mice were sham or corneal kindled beginning at 6-months-old. Kindled and sham-kindled mice were then challenged up to 6 weeks later in a battery of cognitive tests: non-habituated open field (OF), T-maze spontaneous alternation (TM), and Barnes maze (BM), followed by immunohistochemistry for markers of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity. PSEN2 KO mice required significantly more stimulations to kindle (males: p<0.02; females: p<0.02) versus WT. Across a range of behavioral tests, the cognitive performance of kindled female PSEN2 KO mice was most significantly impaired versus age-matched WT females. Male BM performance was generally worsened by seizures (p=0.038), but loss of PSEN2 function did not itself worsen cognitive performance. Conversely, kindled PSEN2 KO females made the most BM errors (p=0.007). Chronic seizures also significantly altered expression of hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity markers in a sex-specific manner. Chronic seizures may thus significantly worsen hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits in aged female, but not male, PSEN2 KO mice. Our work suggests that untreated focal seizures may worsen cognitive burden with loss of normal PSEN2 function in a sex-related manner.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of everyday activities are central to the diagnosis of pre-dementia and dementia. Yet, little is known about the brain substrates and processes that contribute to everyday functional impairment, particularly during early stages of cognitive decline. We investigated everyday function using a complex gait task in normal older adults stratified by risk of cognitive impairment. We applied a novel EEG approach, which combines electroencephalographic with 3D-body tracking technology to measure brain-gait dynamics with millisecond precision while participants are in motion. Twenty-six participants (mean age = 74.9 years) with cognitive and everyday functional profiles within the normal range for their age and sex were ranked for risk of cognitive impairment. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment battery, a global index of cognition with a range from 0 to 30, to classify individuals as being at higher (22-26) and lower risk (27+). Individuals walking on a treadmill were exposed to visual perturbation designed to destabilize gait. Assuming that brain changes precede behavioral decline, we predicted that older adults increase step width to gain stability, yet the underlying neural signatures would be different for lower versus higher risk individuals. When pooling across risk groups, we found that step width increased and fronto-parietal activation shifted from transient, during swing phases, to sustained across the gait cycle during visually perturbed input. As predicted, step width increased in both groups but underlying neural signatures were different. Fronto-medial theta (3-7Hz) power of gait-related brain oscillations were increased in higher risk individuals during both perturbed and unperturbed inputs. On the other hand, left central gyri beta (13-28Hz) power was decreased in lower risk individuals, specifically during visually perturbed input. Finally, relating MoCA scores to spectral power pooled across fronto-parietal regions, we found associations between increased theta power and worse MoCA scores and between decreased beta power and better MoCA scores.Able-bodied older adults at-risk of cognitive impairment are characterized by unique neural signatures of mobility. Stronger reliance on frontomedial theta activation in at-risk individuals may reflect higher-order compensatory responses for deterioration of basic sensorimotor processes. Region and spectral-specific signatures of mobility may provide brain targets for early intervention against everyday functional decline.",

    "abstract": "Although typically associated with onset in young adults, multiple sclerosis (MS) also attacks aged people, which is termed late-onset MS. The disease can be recapitulated and studied in the aged mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The onset of induced EAE is delayed in aged mice, but the disease severity is increased relative to standard EAE in young mice. Given that CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells play an ameliorative role in MS/EAE severity and the aged immune system accumulates Treg cells, failure of these cells to prevent or ameliorate EAE disease is enigmatic. When analyzing the distribution of Treg cells in EAE mice, the aged mice exhibited a higher proportion of polyclonal(pan) Treg cells and a lower proportion of antigen-specific-Treg cells in their periphery, but lower proportions of pan- and antigen-specific-Treg cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, in the aged CNS, Treg cells exhibited a higher plasticity and T effector (Teff) cells exhibited a greater clonal expansion, which disrupted the Treg/Teff balance. Transiently inhibiting FoxP3 expression in peripheral Treg cells partially ameliorated the disease and corrected Treg distribution in the aged mice. These results provide evidence that accumulated aged Treg cells play a detrimental role in neuronal inflammation of aged MS.\n\nHighlightsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells typically play an ameliorative role in multiple sclerosis (MS) onset and severity. However, why aged immune system has accumulated peripheral Treg cells, but the elderly has more severe MS symptoms?\n\nFindingsAged Treg cells cannot easily distribute to the CNS of aged EAE mice, and those aged Treg cells that did enter the CNS exhibited increased plastic features. However, transient inhibition of peripherally accumulated Treg cells corrected Treg distribution and partially ameliorated the disease in the aged mice.\n\nConclusion and mechanistic insightsAccumulated aged Treg cells within an \"inflammaging\" condition do not play an ameliorative role but are potentially detrimental for inflamed CNS repair processes in aged EAE mice due to impeding the trafficking of immune cells into the inflamed CNS.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Superinfection exclusion (SIE) is a phenomenon in which a primary viral infection interferes with secondary viral infections within that same cell. Although SIE has been observed across many viruses, it has remained relatively understudied. A recently characterized glycoprotein D (gD) -independent SIE of alphaherpesviruses presents a novel mechanism of co-infection restriction for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Pseudorabies virus (PRV). In this study, we evaluated the role of multiplicity of infection (MOI), receptor expression, and trafficking of virions to gain greater insight into potential mechanisms of alphaherpesvirus SIE.\n\nWe observed that high MOI secondary viral infections were able to overcome SIE in a manner that was independent of receptor availability. Utilizing recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent protein fusions, we assessed virion localization during SIE through live fluorescent microscopy of dual-labeled virions and localization of capsid assemblies. Analysis of these assemblies confirmed changes in the distribution of capsids during SIE. These results indicate that SIE during PRV infection inhibits viral entry or fusion while HSV-1 SIE inhibits infection through a post-entry mechanism. Although the timing and phenotype of SIE is similar between alphaherpesviruses, the related viruses implement different mechanisms to restrict coinfection.\n\nIMPORTANCEMost viruses utilize a form of superinfection exclusion to conserve resources and control population dynamics. gD-dependent superinfection exclusion in alphaherpesviruses is well-documented. However, the under-characterized gD-independent SIE provides new insight into how alphaherpesviruses limit sequential infection. The observations described here demonstrate that gD-independent SIE differs between PRV and HSV-1. Comparing these differences provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of SIE implemented by two related viruses.",

    "abstract": "Cells migrate collectively through confined environments during development and cancer metastasis. The nucleus, a stiff organelle, impedes single cells from squeezing into narrow channels within artificial environments, but how nuclei affect collective cell migration into compact tissues in vivo is unknown. Here, we use border cells in the fly ovary to study nuclear dynamics in collective, confined in vivo migration. Border cells delaminate from the follicular epithelium and squeeze into tiny spaces between cells called nurse cells. The lead cell nucleus transiently deforms as it extends into the lead cell protrusion, which then widens. The nuclei of follower cells deform less. Depletion of the Drosophila B-type lamin, Lam, compromises nuclear integrity, hinders expansion of a leading protrusion, and impedes border cell movement. Cortical myosin II accumulates behind the nucleus and moves it into the protrusion in wildtype but not Lam-depleted cells. These data suggest that the nucleus stabilizes lead cell protrusions to help cells wedge open spaces between nurse cells.\n\nSummaryDuring Drosophila border cell migration, the B-type lamin Lam maintains nuclear envelope integrity, stabilizes the lead cell protrusion, and promotes cluster invasion between nurse cells. The nucleus may function as a wedge to prom collective, confined in vivo movement.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages accumulate triglycerides under certain pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis. Triglycerides are carried in the bloodstream as part of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons. How macrophages take up and process VLDL-lipids is not very well known. Here, using VLDL-sized triglyceride-rich emulsion particles, we aimed to study the mechanism by which VLDL-triglycerides are taken up, processed, and stored in macrophages. Our results show that macrophage uptake of emulsion particles mimicking VLDL (VLDLm) is dependent on lipoproteins lipase (LPL) and requires the lipoprotein-binding C-terminal domain of LPL but not the catalytic N-terminal domain. Subsequent internalization of VLDLm-triglycerides by macrophages is carried out by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, followed by triglyceride hydrolysis catalyzed by lysosomal acid lipase. Transfer of lysosomal fatty acids to the ER for subsequent storage as triglycerides is mediated by Stard3, whereas NPC1 was found to promote the extracellular efflux of fatty acids from lysosomes. Our data provide novel insights into how macrophages process VLDL-derived triglycerides and suggest that macrophages have the remarkable capacity to excrete part of the internalized triglycerides as fatty acids.\n\nSummaryTriglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants contribute to atherosclerosis, possibly by carrying remnant cholesterol and/or by exerting a pro-inflammatory effect on macrophage. Nevertheless, little is known about how macrophages process triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We show that uptake by macrophages of VLDL-like particles is dependent on the enzyme lipoproteins lipase via its C-terminal domain. Subsequent internalization of VLDL-triglycerides by macrophages is carried out by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, followed by hydrolysis by lysosomal acid lipase.

    "abstract": "Monophyly is a feature of a set of genetic lineages in which every lineage in the set is more closely related to all other members of the set than it is to any lineage outside the set. Multiple sets of lineages that are separately monophyletic are said to be reciprocally monophyletic, or jointly monophyletic. The prevalence of reciprocal monophyly, or joint monophyly, has been used to evaluate phylogenetic and phylogeographic hypotheses, as well as to delimit species. These applications often make use of a probability of joint monophyly under models of gene lineage evolution. Studies in coalescent theory have computed this joint monophyly probability for small numbers of separate groups in arbitrary species trees, and for arbitrary numbers of separate groups in trivial species trees. Here, generalizing existing results on monophyly probabilities under the multispecies coalescent, we derive the probability of joint monophyly for arbitrary numbers of separate groups in arbitrary species trees. We illustrate how our result collapses to previously examined cases. We also study the effect of tree height, sample size, and number of species on the probability of joint monophyly. The result also enables computation of relatively simple lower and upper bounds on the joint monophyly probability. Our results expand the scope of joint monophyly calculations beyond small numbers of species, subsuming past formulas that have been used in simpler cases.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomic analysis of Vibrio cholerae El Tor associated with endemic cholera in Asia revealed two distinct lineages, one dominant in Bangladesh and the other in India. An in depth whole genome study of V. cholerae El Tor clinical strains isolated during endemic cholera in Bangladesh (1991 - 2017) included reference genome sequence data obtained online. Core genome phylogeny established using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed V. cholerae El Tor strains comprised two lineages, BD-1 and BD-2, which, according to Bayesian phylodynamic analysis, originated from paraphyletic group BD-0 around 1981. BD-1 and BD-2 lineages overlapped temporally but were negatively associated as causative agents of cholera 2004-2017. Genome wide association study (GWAS) revealed 140 SNPs and 31 indels, resulting in gene alleles unique to BD-1 and BD-2. Regression analysis of root to tip distance and year of isolation indicated early BD-0 strains at the base, whereas BD-1 and BD-2 subsequently emerged and progressed by accumulating SNPs. Pangenome analysis provided evidence of gene acquisition by both BD-1 and BD-2, of which six crucial proteins of known function were predominant in BD-2. BD-1 and BD-2 diverged and have distinctively different genomic traits, namely heterogeneity in VSP-2, VPI-1, mobile elements, toxin encoding elements, and total gene abundance. In addition, the observed phage-inducible chromosomal island-like element (PLE1), and SXT ICE elements (ICETET) in BD-2 presumably provided a fitness advantage for the lineage to outcompete BD-1 as the etiological agent of the endemic cholera in Bangladesh, with implications for global cholera epidemiology.\n\nImportanceCholera is a global disease with specific reference to the Bay of Bengal Ganges Delta where Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor, causative agent of the disease showed two circulating lineages, one dominant in Bangladesh and the other in India. Results of in-depth genomic study of V. cholerae associated with endemic cholera during the past 27 years (1991 - 2017) indicate emergence and succession of the two lineages, BD-1 and BD-2, arising from a common ancestral paraphylatic group, BD-0, comprising the early strains and short-term evolution of the bacterium in Bangladesh. Among the two V. cholerae lineages, BD-2 supersedes BD-1 and is predominant in the most recent endemic cholera in Bangladesh. The BD-2 lineage contained significantly more SNPs and indels, and showed richness in gene abundance, including antimicrobial resistance genes, gene cassettes, and PLE to fight against bacteriophage infection, acquired over time. These findings have important epidemic implications at a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Inside the nucleus, chromosomes are subjected to direct physical interaction between different components, active forces, and thermal noise, leading to the formation of an ensemble of three-dimensional structures. However, it is still not well understood to what extent and how the structural ensemble varies from one chromosome region or cell-type to another. We designed a statistical analysis technique and applied it to single-cell chromosome imaging data to reveal the heterogeneity of individual chromosome structures. By analyzing the resulting structural landscape, we find that the largest dynamic variation is the overall radius of gyration of the chromatin region, followed by domain reorganization within the region. By comparing different human cell-lines and experimental perturbation data using this statistical analysis technique and a network-based similarity quantification approach, we identify both cell-type and condition-specific features of the structural landscapes. We identify a relationship between epigenetic state and the properties of chromosome structure fluctuation and validate this relationship through polymer simulations. Overall, our study suggests that the types of variation in a chromosome structure ensemble are cell-type as well as region-specific and can be attributed to constraints placed on the structure by factors such as variation in epigenetic state.",

    "abstract": "Galvanotaxis describes the functional response of organisms to electric fields. In ciliates, the electric field influences the electrophysiology and thus the cilia beat dynamics. This leads to a change of the swimming direction towards the cathode. The dynamical response to electric fields of Coleps hirtus has not been studied since the observations of Verworn in 1890 (1). While galvanotaxis has been studied in other cilitates, C. hirtus exhibit properties not found elsewhere, such as biomineralization-processes of alveolar plates with impact on the intracellular calcium regulation and a bimodal resting membrane potential, which leads unique electrophysiological driven bimodal swimming dynamics. Here, we statistically analyze the galvanotactic dynamics of C. hirtus by automated cell tracking routines. We found that the number of cells that show a galvanotactic response, increases with the increase of the applied electric field strength with a mean at about 2.1 V/cm. The spatiotemporal swimming dynamics change and lead to a statistical increase of linear elongated cell trajectories that point toward the cathode. Further, the increase of the electric fields decreases the mean velocity variance for electric fields larger than about 1.3 V/cm, while showing no significant change in the absolute velocity for any applied electric field. Fully functional galvanotactic responses were observed at a minimum extracellular calcium concentration of 20 {micro}M. The results add important insights to the current understanding of cellular dynamics of ciliates and suggest that the currently accepted model lags the inclusion of the swimming dynamics and the complex calcium regulatory system of the cell. The results of this study do not only extend the fundamental understanding of C. hirtus dynamics, but also open possibilities for technical applications, such as biosensors or microrobots in the future.",

In this study, we reported the effect of spirulina polysaccharide (Sp) on galectin-3 modulatory activity on gastric cancer cells. The polysaccharide was isolated from the spirulina biomass, characterized, and the in silico, in vitro studies are carried out to assess the bioactivities. The isolated Sp possessed average molecular weight of 1457 kDa, and galactose (42%) as major sugar along with Rhamnose, Arabinose, Xylose, and Mannose. Further, characterization of Sp by FT-IR and NMR spectrum indicated the presence of ({beta}1-4D) galactose sugar with galactoarabinorhamnoglycan backbone. Among the monosaccharides, galactose showed highest binding affinity with galectin-3 protein as evidenced by the in silico interaction study. The obtained Sp, inhibited the proliferation of AGS gastric cancer cells by 48 % without affecting normal NIH/3T3 cells as opposed to doxorubicin, a known anticancer drug. Also, Sp exhibited galectin-3 mediated haemagglutination inhibition with MIC of 9.37 g/mL compared to galactose 6.25 g/mL, sugar specific to galectin-3. The Sp treatment significantly (p<0.05) lowered the expression of galectin-3 by 32 % compared to untreated control cells. In addition, Sp exhibited the potent cytoprotection in RBCs, Buccal cells, and DNA exposed to oxidants. Thus, the findings suggest that the polysaccharide from spirulina offer a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of gastric cancer in addition to its currently known nutritional and pharmaceutical applications.",

A total of 19 non repeated pus/wound swab samples from different anatomic locations and 17 samples that were previously identified as S. aureus and preserved in the labs were included in the study. The Staphylococcus aureus was identified on the basis of colony morphology, Grams stain, biochemical tests (catalase and coagulase tests) and molecular identification through PCR amplification.\n\nMethodologyA total of 26 samples were recovered out of the 31 samples. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to determine the sensitivity or resistance of S. aureus to methicillin. Out of the 26 strains, 4 were highly resistant, 10 were moderately resistant and 12 strains were sensitive. Three different protocols (Tube Method, Congo Red Agar Method and Tissue Culture plate method) were used for the detection of biofilm formation for both resistant and sensitive strains.\n\nResultComparative analysis of the antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm formation by different protocols showed that 70% strains that are resistant to antibiotic methicillin produced moderate-strong biofilms. 50% have produced the moderate-strong biofilms in all 3 protocols. In case of sensitive, 50% strains had produced none-weak biofilms in all 3 protocols.\n\nDecisionsThe strains that had zone of inhibition of close to resistance produced weak-strong biofilms but they all produced weak biofilms in CRA method. It can be concluded that the strains of S. aureus that have the ability to produce biofilms become methicillin resistant.",

Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is modified at more than 100 locations, particularly at highly conserved and functionally important nucleotides. During ribosome biogenesis, modifications are added at various stages of assembly. The existence of differently modified classes of ribosomes in normal cells is unknown because no method exists to simultaneously evaluate the modification status at all sites within a single rRNA molecule. Using a combination of yeast genetics and nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we developed a reliable method to track the modification status of single rRNA molecules at 37 sites in 18S rRNA and 73 sites in 25S rRNA. We use our method to characterize patterns of modification heterogeneity and identify concerted modification of nucleotides found near functional centers of the ribosome. Distinct, undermodified subpopulations of rRNAs accumulate upon loss of Dbp3 or Prp43 RNA helicases, suggesting overlapping roles in ribosome biogenesis.

    "abstract": "The BTB domain is an oligomerization domain found in over 200 proteins encoded in the human genome. In the family of BTB domain and Zinc Finger-containing (ZBTB) transcription factors, 49 members share the same protein architecture. The N-terminal BTB domain is structurally conserved among the family members and serves as the dimerization site while the C-terminal zinc finger motifs mediate DNA binding. The available BTB domain structures from this family reveal a natural inclination for homodimerization. In this study we investigated the potential for heterodimer formation in the cellular environment. We selected five BTB homodimers and four heterodimer structures. We performed in vitro binding assays with fluorescent protein-BTB domain fusions to assess dimer formation. We tested the binding of several BTB pairs, and we were able to confirm the heterodimeric physical interaction between the BTB domains of PATZ1 and PATZ2, previously reported only in an interactome mapping experiment. We also found this pair to be co-expressed in several immune system cell types. Finally, we used the available structures of BTB domain dimers and newly constructed models in extended molecular dynamics simulations (500 ns) to understand the energetic determinants of homo and heterodimer formation. We conclude that heterodimer formation, although frequently described as less preferred than homodimers, is a possible mechanism to increase the combinatorial specificity of this transcription factor family.",

    "abstract": "Species interactions are influenced by the trait structure of local multi-trophic communities. However, it remains unclear whether mutualistic interactions in particular can drive trait patterns at the global scale, where climatic constraints and biogeographic processes gain importance. Here we evaluate global relationships between traits of frugivorous birds and palms (Arecaceae), and how these relationships are affected, directly or indirectly, by assemblage richness, climate and biogeographic history. We leverage a new and expanded gape size dataset for nearly all avian frugivores, and find a positive relationship between gape size and fruit size, i.e., trait matching, which is influenced indirectly by palm richness and climate. We also uncover a latitudinal gradient in trait matching strength, which increases towards the tropics and varies among zoogeographic realms. Taken together, our results suggest trophic interactions have consistent influences on trait structure, but that abiotic, biogeographic and richness effects also play important, though sometimes indirect, roles in shaping the functional biogeography of mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition is a central factor influencing immunity and resistance to infection, but the extent to which nutrition during development affects adult responses to infections is poorly understood. Our study investigated how the nutritional composition of the larval diet affects the survival, pathogen load, and food intake of adult fruit flies, Bactrocera tryoni, after bacterial septic infection. We found a sex-specific effect of larval diet composition on survival post-infection: survival rate was higher and bacterial load was lower for infected females fed sugar-rich larval diet compared with females fed protein-rich larval diet, an effect that was absent in males. Both males and females were heavier when fed a balanced larval diet compared to protein- or sugar-rich diet, while body lipid reserves were higher in the sugar-rich larval diet compared with other diets. Body protein reserve was lower for sugar-rich larval diets compared to other diets in males, but not females. Both females and males shifted their nutrient intake to ingest a sugar-rich diet when infected compared with sham-infected flies without any effect of the larval diet, suggesting that sugar-rich diets can be beneficial to fight off bacterial infection. Overall, our findings show that nutrition during early life can shape individual fitness in adulthood.\n\nSummary statementDevelopmental conditions influence adulthood. Here we showed that when the larval diet is rich in sugar, resistance to infection is increased in females at adulthood, in a polyphagous fly.",

    "abstract": "Classical models that ignore linkage predict that deleterious recessive mutations should purge or fix within inbred populations, yet inbred populations often retain moderate to high segregating load. True overdominance could generate balancing selection strong enough to sustain inbreeding depression even within inbred populations, but this is considered rare. However, arrays of deleterious recessives linked in repulsion could generate appreciable pseudo-overdominance that would also sustain segregating load. We used simulations to explore how long pseudo-overdominant (POD) zones persist once created (e.g., by hybridization between populations fixed for alternative mildly deleterious mutations). Balanced haplotype loads, tight linkage, and moderate to strong cumulative selective effects all serve to maintain POD zones. Tight linkage is key, suggesting that such regions are most likely to arise and persist in low recombination regions (like inversions). Selection and drift unbalance the load, eventually eliminating POD zones, but this process is quite slow under strong pseudo-overdominance. Background selection accelerates the loss of weak POD zones but reinforces strong ones in inbred populations by disfavoring homozygotes. Models and empirical studies of POD dynamics within populations help us understand how POD zones may allow the load to persist, greatly affecting load dynamics and mating systems evolution.",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystem disorder with neurobehavioral, metabolic, and hormonal phenotypes, caused by loss of expression of a paternally-expressed imprinted gene cluster. Prior evidence from a PWS mouse model identified abnormal pancreatic islet development with retention of aged insulin and deficient insulin secretion. To determine the collective roles of PWS genes in {beta}-cell biology, we used genome-editing to generate isogenic, clonal INS-1 insulinoma lines having 3.16 Mb deletions of the silent, maternal (control) or active, paternal PWS-alleles. PWS {beta}-cells demonstrated a significant cell-autonomous reduction in basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Further, proteomic analyses revealed reduced levels of cellular and secreted hormones, including all insulin peptides and amylin, concomitant with reduction of at least ten endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones, including GRP78 and GRP94. Critically, transcriptomic studies demonstrated that the broad reduction of ER chaperones originated from transcriptional downregulation without corresponding changes for Ins1 and Ins2. In contrast to the dosage compensation previously seen for ER chaperones in Grp78 or Grp94 gene knockouts or knockdown, compensation is precluded by the stress-independent deficiency of ER chaperones in PWS {beta}-cells. Consistent with reduced ER chaperones levels, PWS INS-1 {beta}-cells are more sensitive to ER stress, leading to earlier activation of all three arms of the unfolded protein response. These findings suggest that a chronic shortage of ER chaperones in PWS {beta}-cells leads to a deficiency of protein folding and/or delay in ER transit of insulin and other cargo. In summary, our results illuminate the pathophysiological basis of pancreatic {beta}-cell hormone deficits in PWS, with evolutionary implications for the multigenic PWS-domain, and indicate that PWS-imprinted genes coordinate concerted regulation of ER chaperone biosynthesis and {beta}-cell secretory pathway function.",

In addition to assigning gene function, single-cell transcriptional phenotypes allow for in-depth dissection of complex cellular phenomena - from RNA processing to differentiation. We leverage this ability to systematically identify the genetic drivers and consequences of aneuploidy and to discover an unanticipated layer of stress-specific regulation of the mitochondrial genome.

Whether the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), like other molecules, is vulnerable to folding transitions or might adopt alternative conformations remains unknown. The current understanding points to a rigid molecular structure suitable for binding of its ligands, like the anticoagulant protein C, or the CIDR1 domains of Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, we have identified a novel conformation of EPCR, captured by X-ray diffraction analyses, whereby Tyr154 shows a dramatically altered structural arrangement, likely incompatible with protein C binding. Biolayer interferometry analysis confirms previous results supporting a critical role for this position in protein C binding. Importantly, the conformational change has no apparent effect in the bound lipid.

Uncanny similarities with amyloid-disease associated blood coagulation and fibrinolytic disturbances together with neurologic and cardiac problems led us to investigate the amyloidogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein). Amyloid fibril assays of peptide library mixtures and theoretical predictions identified seven amyloidogenic sequences within the S-protein. All seven peptides in isolation formed aggregates during incubation at 37{degrees}C. Three 20-amino acid long synthetic Spike peptides (sequence 191-210, 599-618, 1165-1184) fulfilled three amyloid fibril criteria: nucleation dependent polymerization kinetics by ThT, Congo red positivity and ultrastructural fibrillar morphology. Full-length folded S-protein did not form amyloid fibrils, but amyloid-like fibrils with evident branching were formed during 24 hours of S-protein co-incubation with the protease neutrophil elastase (NE) in vitro. NE efficiently cleaved S-protein rendering exposure of amyloidogenic segments and accumulation of the peptide 193-202, part of the most amyloidogenic synthetic Spike peptide. NE is overexpressed at inflamed sites of viral infection and at vaccine injection sites. Our data propose a molecular mechanism for amyloidogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in humans facilitated by endoproteolysis. The potential implications of S-protein amyloidogenesis in COVID-19 disease associated pathogenesis and consequences following S-protein based vaccines should be addressed in understanding the disease, long COVID-19, and vaccine side effects.",

Here, by integrating pan-cancer clinical and molecular data, we tried to predict immune-related adverse events (irAEs, risk) and objective response rates (ORRs, benefit) based on enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) expression among patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. We built two effective regression models, explaining 71% variance (R=0.84) of irAEs with three eRNAs and 79% (R=0.89) of ORRs with five eRNAs. Interestingly, target genes of irAE-related enhancers, including upstream regulators of MYC, were involved in metabolism, inflammation, and immune activation, while ORR-related enhancers target PAK2 and DLG1 which directly participate in T cell activation. Our study provides references for the identification of immunotherapy-related biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets during immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Human prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that may have prolonged asymptomatic incubation periods. However, the underlying mechanism by which prions cause brain damage remains unclear. In turn, characterization of early pathological aspects would be of benefit for the diagnosis and potential treatment of these progressive neurodegenerative disorders. We investigated chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI based on its exquisite sensitivity to cytosol protein content as a surrogate for prion disease pathology. Three groups of prion-infected mice at different stages of the disease underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and CEST MRI at 9.4T. For each mouse, chemical exchange contrasts were measured by applying five RF powers at various frequency offsets using magnetization transfer asymmetries. Relayed Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE*) and amide proton transfer (APT*) were also assessed. For comparison, CEST MRI measurements were also made in healthy control mice brains. Here we show that alterations in CEST signal were detected before structural modifications or any clinical signs of prion disease. The detected CEST signal displayed different patterns at different stages of the disease indicating its potential for use as a longitudinal marker of disease progression. Highly significant correlations were found between CEST metrics and histopathological findings. A decline in NOE signal was positively correlated with abnormal prion protein deposition (R2 = 0.91) in the thalami of prion infected mice. Moreover, the NOE signal was negatively correlated with astrogliosis (R2 = 0.71) in the thalamus. No significant correlations were detected between NOE signals and spongiosis. MTR asymmetry at 3.5 ppm was also correlated with astrogliosis (R2 = 0.59), and prion protein deposition (R2 = 0.63) in thalamus. No significant changes were detected in APT* between prion-infected and control mice at all stages of the disease. Finally, MTR asymmetry between 2.8 and 3.2 ppm was correlated with prion protein deposition (R2 = 0.47) in the thalamus of prion -infected mice. To conclude, CEST MRI has potential utility as a biomarker of neurodegenerative processes in prion disease.",

    "abstract": "Ozone (O3) is an air pollutant which primarily damages the lungs, but growing evidence supports that O3 exposure can also affect the brain. Serum amyloid A (SAA) and kynurenine have been identified as circulating factors that are upregulated by O3, and both can contribute to depressive-like behaviors in mice. However, little is known about the relations of O3 exposure to sickness and depressive-like behaviors in experimental settings. In this study, we evaluated O3 dose-, time- and sex-dependent changes in circulating SAA in context of pulmonary inflammation and damage, sickness and depressive-like behavioral changes, and systemic changes in kynurenine and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that regulates kynurenine production and contributes to inflammation-induced depressive-like behaviors. Our results in Balb/c and CD-1 mice showed that 3ppm O3, but not 2 or 1ppm O3, caused elevations in serum SAA and pulmonary neutrophils, and these responses resolved by 48 hours. Sickness and depressive-like behaviors were observed at all O3 doses (1-3ppm), although the detection of certain behavioral changes varied by dose. We also found that Ido1 mRNA expression was increased in the brain and spleen 24 hours after 3ppm O3, and that kynurenine was increased in blood. Together, these findings indicate that acute O3 exposure induces transient symptoms of sickness and depressive-like behaviors which may occur in the presence or absence of overt pulmonary neutrophilia and systemic increases of SAA. We also present evidence that the IDO/kynurenine pathway is upregulated systemically following an acute exposure to O3 in mice.",

    "abstract": "The kidney plays an essential role in regulating the homeostasis of electrolytes, acid-base species, and fluids. Kidney structure and function are significantly affected in diabetes. These pathophysiological changes include glomerular hyperfiltration and tubular hypertrophy, and ultimately leading to diabetic kidney disease. A class of medications that have shown promise in slowing the progression to diabetic kidney disease are the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors target Na+ and glucose reabsorption along the proximal convoluted tubule, enhance urinary glucose, Na+ and fluid excretion, and lower hyperglycemia in diabetes. We postulate that both diabetes-induced and SGLT2 inhibition-induced changes in kidney may exhibit significant sex differences, because the distribution of renal transporters along the nephron may be markedly different between women and men, as recently shown in rodents. The goals of this study are to (i) analyze how kidney function is altered in male and female patients with diabetes, (ii) assess the renal effects, in women and men, of an anti-hyperglycemic therapy that inhibits the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal convoluted tubules, and (iii) study how those renal effects are altered in uninephrectomy. To accomplish these goals, we have developed computational models of kidney function, separate for male and female patients with diabetes and/or uninephredctomy. The simulation results indicate that by inducing osmotic diuresis in the proximal tubules, SGLT2 inhibition reduces paracellular transport, eventually leading to diuresis and natriuresis.",

The presence of BSEs affects leaf hydraulics and photosynthetic rate. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) obscuravenosa (obv) mutant lacks BSEs. Here we identify the obv gene and the causative mutation, a non-synonymous amino acid change that disrupts a C2H2 zinc finger motif in a putative transcription factor. This mutation exists as a rare polymorphism in the natural range of wild tomatoes, but has increased in frequency in domesticated tomatoes, suggesting that the latter diversified into heterobaric and homobaric leaf types. The obv mutant displays reduced vein density, leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic assimilation rate. We show that these and other effects on plant development, including changes in leaf insertion angle, leaf margin serration, minor vein density and fruit shape, are controlled by OBV via changes in auxin signalling. Loss of function of the transcriptional regulator AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF4) also results in defective BSE development, revealing an additional component of a novel genetic module controlling aspects of leaf development important for ecological adaptation and subject to breeding selection.\n\nOne sentence summarydistribution of tomato heterobaric and homobaric leaves is controlled by a single-nucleotide polymorphism in an auxin-related transcription factor",

    "abstract": "Premise of this studySalvia is the most species-rich genus in Lamiaceae, encompassing approximately 1000 species distributed all over the world. We sought a new evolutionary perspective for Salvia by employing macroevolutionary analyses to address the tempo and mode of diversification. To study the association of floral traits with speciation and extinction, we modeled and explored the evolution of corolla length and the lever-mechanism pollination system across our Salvia phylogeny.\n\nMethodsWe reconstructed a multigene phylogeny for 366 species of Salvia in the broad sense including all major recognized lineages and numerous species from Iran, a region previously overlooked in studies of the genus. Our phylogenetic data in combination with divergence time estimates were used to examine the evolution of corolla length, woody vs. herbaceous habit, and presence vs. absence of a lever mechanism. We investigated the timing and dependence of Salvia diversification related to corolla length evolution through a disparity test and BAMM analysis. A HiSSE model was used to evaluate the dependency of diversification on the lever-mechanism pollination system in Salvia.\n\nKey ResultsBased on recent investigations and classifications, Salvia is monophyletic and comprises [~]1000 species. Our inclusion, for the first time, of a comprehensive sampling for Iranian species of Salvia provides higher phylogenetic resolution for southwestern Asian species than obtained in previous studies. A medium corolla length (15-18mm) was reconstructed as the ancestral state for Salvia with multiple shifts to shorter and longer corollas. Macroevolutionary model analyses indicate that corolla length disparity is high throughout Salvia evolution, significantly different from expectations under a Brownian motion model during the last 28 million years of evolution. Our analyses show evidence of a higher diversification rate of corolla length for some Andean species of Salvia compared to other members of the genus. Based on our tests of diversification models, we reject the hypothesis of a direct effect of the lever mechanism on Salvia diversification.\n\nConclusionsUsing a broader species sampling than previous studies, we obtained a well- resolved phylogeny for southwest Asian species of Salvia. Corolla length is an adaptive trait throughout the Salvia phylogeny with a higher rate of diversification in the South American clade. Our results suggest caution in considering the lever-mechanism pollination system as one of the main drivers of speciation in Salvia.",

    "abstract": "The first draft of the Arabidopsis genome was released more than 20 years ago and despite intensive molecular research, more than 30% of Arabidopsis genes remained uncharacterized or without an assigned function. This is in part due to gene redundancy within gene families or the essential nature of genes, where their deletion results in lethality (i.e., the dark genome).\n\nHigh-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) offers an automated and unbiased approach to characterize subtle or transient phenotypes resulting from gene redundancy or inducible gene silencing; however, commercial HTPP platforms remain unaffordable. Here we describe the design and implementation of OPEN leaf, an open-source HTPP system with cloud connectivity and remote bilateral communication to facilitate data collection, sharing and processing.\n\nOPEN leaf, coupled with the SMART imaging processing package was able to consistently document and quantify dynamic morphological changes over time at the whole rosette level and also at leaf-specific resolution when plants experienced changes in nutrient availability.\n\nThe modular design of OPEN leaf allows for additional sensor integration. Notably, our data demonstrate that VIS sensors remain underutilized and can be used in high-throughput screens to identify characterize previously unidentified phenotypes in a leaf-specific manner.\n\nSignificance StatementMany bottlenecks exist in high-throughput phenotyping involving computing power for processing and a lack of focus on abiotic stresses that has prevented an advancement in phenotyping on par with genotyping. Therefore, we create an automated HTP system that performs nutrient studies on Arabidopsis thaliana with cloud-based image processing that quantifies plant traits at a whole and leaf-level.",

Here, we suggest a strategy for learning DBNs from gene expression data by employing a Bayesian approach that is scalable to large networks and is targeted at learning models with high predictive accuracy. Our framework can be used to learn DBNs for multiple groups of samples and highlight differences and similarities in their gene regulatory networks. We learn these DBN models based on different structural and parametric assumptions and select the optimal model based on the cross-validated predictive accuracy. We show in simulation studies that our approach is better equipped to prevent overfitting than techniques used in previous studies. We applied the proposed DBN-based classification approach to two time series transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, each comprising data from distinct phenotypic groups of the same tissue type. In the first case, we used DBNs to characterize responders and non-responders to anti-cancer therapy. In the second case, we compared normal to tumor cells of colorectal tissue. The classification accuracy reached by the DBN-based classifier for both datasets was higher than reported previously. For the colorectal cancer dataset, our analysis suggested that GRNs for cancer and normal tissues have a lot of differences, which are most pronounced in the neighborhoods of oncogenes and known cancer tissue markers. The identified differences in gene networks of cancer and normal cells may be used for the discovery of targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Pre-symptomatic studies in mouse models of the neurodegenerative motor neuron (MN) disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) highlight early alterations in intrinsic and synaptic excitability and have supported an excitotoxic theory of MN death. However, a role for synaptic inhibition in disease development is not sufficiently explored among other mechanisms. Since inhibition plays a role in both regulating motor output and in neuroprotection, we examined the age-dependent anatomical changes in inhibitory presynaptic terminals on MN cell bodies using fluorescent immunohistochemistry for GAD67 (GABA) and GlyT2 (glycine) presynaptic proteins comparing ALS-vulnerable trigeminal jaw closer (JC) motor pools with the ALS-resistant extraocular (EO) MNs in the SOD1G93A mouse model for ALS. Our results indicate differential patterns of temporal changes of these terminals in vulnerable versus resilient MNs and relative differences between SOD1G93A and wild-type (WT) MNs. Notably, we found pre-symptomatic up-regulation in inhibitory terminals in the EO MNs while the vulnerable JC MNs mostly showed a decrease in inhibitory terminals. Specifically, there was a statistically significant decrease in the GAD67 somatic abuttal in the SOD1G93A JC MNs compared to WT around P12. Using in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found a parallel decrease in the ambient GABA-dependent tonic inhibition in the SOD1G93A JC MNs. While it is unclear if the two mechanisms are directly related, pharmacological blockade of specific subtype of GABAA-5 receptors suggests that tonic inhibition can control MN recruitment threshold. Furthermore, reduction in tonic GABA current as observed here in the mutant, identifies a putative molecular mechanism explaining our observations of hyperexcitable shifts in JC MN recruitment threshold in the SOD1G93A mouse. Lastly, we showcase non-parametric resampling-based bootstrap statistics for data analyses, and provide the Python code on GitHub for wider reuse.",

In Ppt1-/- cortical neurons, upscaling induction triggers exaggerated responses of synaptic calcium-permeable AMPA receptors composed of palmitoylated GluA1 subunits. Consequently, Ppt1-/- visual cortex exhibits hypersynchrony in vivo. Remarkably, we also find an overload of palmitoylated A-kinase anchor protein 5 (Akap5) in Ppt1-/- mouse brains, leading to microglial activation through NFAT. These findings indicate Ppt1 acts as a gatekeeper of homeostatic plasticity by regulating the proteostasis of palmitoylated synaptic proteins.

The thymus is also extremely sensitive to acute insult and although capable of regeneration, this capacity declines with age. Focusing on non-hematopoietic stromal cells, and using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, lineage-tracing, and advanced imaging, we discovered two atypical thymic epithelial cell (TEC) states that emerged with age. Age-associated (aa)TECs formed atypical high-density epithelial clusters that were devoid of thymocytes, an accretion of non-functional thymic tissue that worsened with age and exhibited features of partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In silico interaction analysis revealed that aaTEC emergence drew tonic signals from other TEC populations at baseline, acting as a sink for TEC growth factors. Following damage, aaTEC expanded substantially, further perturbing trophic pathways, and correlating with defective regeneration of the involuted thymus.

    "abstract": "Immune sensing of the Gram-negative bacterial membrane glycolipid lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is both a critical component of host defense against Gram-negative bacterial infection, and a contributor to hyper-inflammatory response, leading to sepsis and death. Innate immune activation by LPS is due to the lipid A moiety, an acylated di-glucosamine molecule that can activate inflammatory responses via the extracellular sensor TLR4/MD2 or the cytosolic sensor caspase-11 (Casp11). The number and length of acyl chains present on bacterial lipid A structures vary across bacterial species and strains, which affects the magnitude of TLR4 and Casp11 activation. TLR4 and Casp11 are thought to respond similarly to various lipid A structures, as tetra-acylated lipid A structures do not activate either sensor, whereas hexa-acylated structures activate both sensors. However, direct analysis of extracellular and cytosolic responses to the same sources and preparations of LPS/lipid A structures have been limited, and the precise features of lipid A that determine the differential activation of each receptor remain poorly defined. To address this question, we used rationally engineered lipid A isolated from a series of bacterial acyl-transferase mutants that produce novel, structurally defined molecules. Intriguingly, we find that the location of specific secondary acyl chains on lipid A resulted in differential recognition by TLR4- or Casp11, providing new insight into the structural features of lipid A required to activate either TLR4- or Casp11. Our findings indicate that TLR4 and Casp11 sense non-overlapping areas of lipid A chemical space, thereby constraining the ability of Gram-negative pathogens to evade innate immunity.",

Here we focused on the varroa mite, an emergent parasite that vectors over 20 honey bee viruses, and has been responsible for colony collapses worldwide, as well as changes in global viral populations. Co-evolution of the varroa and the viral community makes it possible to investigate whether viruses affect vector gene expression, and whether these interactions affect viral epidemiology. Using a large set of available varroa transcriptomes we identified how abundances of individual viruses affect the vectors transcriptional network. Perhaps surprisingly, we found no evidence of competition between viruses, but rather that some virus abundances are positively correlated. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between the extent to which a virus interacts with the vectors gene expression and co-occurrence with other viruses, suggesting that interactions with the vector affect epidemiology. We experimentally validated this observation by silencing candidate genes using RNAi and found that reduction in varroa gene expression was accompanied by a change in viral load. Combined, the meta-transcriptomic analysis and experimental results shed light on the mechanism by which viruses interact with each other and with their vector to shape the disease course.",

    "abstract": "Evolution in response to a change in ecology often coincides with various morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. For most organisms little is known about the genetic and functional relationship between evolutionarily derived traits, representing a critical gap in our understanding of adaptation The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, consists of largely independent populations of fish that inhabit at least 30 caves in Northeast Mexico, and a surface fish population, that inhabits the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. The recent application of molecular genetic approaches combined with behavioral phenotyping have established A. mexicanus as a model for studying the evolution of complex traits. Cave populations of A. mexicanus are interfertile with surface populations and have evolved numerous traits including eye degeneration, insomnia, albinism and enhanced mechanosensory function. The interfertility of different populations from the same species provides a unique opportunity to define the genetic relationship between evolved traits and assess the co-evolution of behavioral and morphological traits with one another. To define the relationships between morphological and behavioral traits, we developed a pipeline to test individual fish for multiple traits. This pipeline confirmed differences in locomotor activity, prey capture, and startle reflex between surface and cavefish populations. To measure the relationship between traits, individual F2 hybrid fish were characterized for locomotor behavior, prey-capture behavior, startle reflex and morphological attributes. Analysis revealed an association between body length and slower escape reflex, suggesting a trade-off between increased size and predator avoidance in cavefish. Overall, there were few associations between individual behavioral traits, or behavioral and morphological traits, suggesting independent genetic changes underlie the evolution of behavioral and morphological traits. Taken together, this approach provides a novel system to identify genes that underlie naturally occurring genetic variation in morphological and behavioral traits.",

Tolerance to pesticides should have an evolutionary basis, but this is poorly understood. Invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations in North America have been controlled with a pesticide lethal to them at lower concentrations than native fishes. We addressed how interspecific variation in gene expression and detoxification gene diversity confer differential pesticide sensitivity in two fish species. We exposed sea lamprey and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), a tolerant native species, to TFM, a pesticide commonly used in sea lamprey control, and used whole-transcriptome sequencing of gill and liver to characterize the cellular response. Comparatively, bluegill exhibited a larger number of detoxification genes expressed and a larger number of responsive transcripts overall, which likely contributes to greater tolerance to TFM. Understanding the genetic and physiological basis for pesticide tolerance is crucial for managing invasive species.",

    "abstract": "The use of organoids has become increasingly popular recently due to their self-organizing abilities, which facilitate developmental and disease modeling. Various methods have been described to create embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from embryonic or pluripotent stem cells but with varying levels of differentiation success and producing organoids of variable size. Commercial ultra-low attachment (ULA) V-bottom well plates are frequently used to generate EBs. These plates are relatively expensive and not as widely available as standard concave well plates. Here, we describe a cost-effective and low labor-intensive method that creates homogeneous EBs at high yield in standard V- and U-bottom well plates by applying an antiadherence solution to reduce surface attachment, followed by centrifugation to enhance cellular aggregation. We also explore the effect of different seeding densities, in the range of 1 to 11 x103 cells per well, for the fabrication of neuroepithelial EBs. Our results show that the use of V-bottom well plates briefly treated with anti-adherent solution (for 5 min at room temperature) consistently yields functional neural EBs in the range of seeding densities from 5 to 11x103 cells per well. A brief post-seeding centrifugation step further enhances EB establishment. EBs fabricated using centrifugation exhibited lower variability in their final size than their noncentrifuged counterparts, and centrifugation also improved EB yield. The span of conditions for reliable EB production is narrower in U-bottom wells than in V-bottom wells (i.e., seeding densities between 7x103 and 11x103 and using a centrifugation step). We show that EBs generated by the protocols introduced here successfully developed into neural organoids and expressed the relevant markers associated with their lineages.\n\nWe anticipate that the cost-effective and easily implemented protocols presented here will greatly facilitate the generation of EBs, thereby further democratizing the worldwide ability to conduct organoid-based research.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck position (HNP) has been identified in literature as important influence on wellbeing. It was investigated in ridden elite dressage horses whether there is a relation between the HNP, ethological indicators and the grading in the warm-up area and in the test. 49 starters (83%) of a Grand-Prix Special (CDIO5 *) as part of the CHIO in Aachen 2018 and 2019 were examined. For each horse-rider pair, HNP (angle at vertical (AT), poll angle (PA), neck angel (NA)) used were analysed as well as conflict behavior for 3 minutes each in warm-up area and test. 6571 individual frames were used. The noseline was carried significantly less behind the vertical in test vs. warm-up (5.43 {degrees} {+/-} 4.19 vs. 11.01 {degrees} {+/-} 4.54 behind the vertical; T = 34.0; p < 0.05). The horses showed significantly less conflict behavior in the test vs. warm-up (123 {+/-} 54 vs. 160 {+/-} 75) (T = 76.00; p < 0.01). In the latter, a smaller PA and more defensive behaviour of the horses was observed compared to the test. A correlation between the grading of test and HNP was found (R = 0.38; p < 0.05). The further the noseline was behind the vertical, the higher was the chance of a good rating. The higher riders were ranked in the \"FEI world ranking\", the higher were their marks in the competition (2018: r = -0.69, p < 0.05; 2019: r = -0.76, p < 0.05). Horses of riders higher in world ranking tended to show more unusual oral behaviour (r = -0.30, p < 0.05), and a noseline stronger behind the vertical (r = - 0.37, p < 0.05) resulting in a smaller NA (r = 0.43, p < 0.05).

    "abstract": "Epidemiological surveillance systems for pathogens in wild species have been proposed as a preventive measure for epidemic events. These systems can minimize the detrimental effects of an outbreak, but most importantly, passive surveillance systems are the best adapted to countries with limited resources. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the technical and infrastructural feasibility to establish this type of scheme in Costa Rica targeting thedetection of pathogens of zoonotic and conservation importance in wildlife. Between 2018 and 2020, 85 carcasses of free-ranging vertebrates were admitted for post mortem analysis and complementary laboratory analysis, representing a solid basis for the implementation of a passive surveillance system for wildlife diseases in the country. However, we encounter during this research significant constraints that affected the availability of carcasses for analysis, mainly related to the initial identification of cases, detection biases towards events in populated- or easily accessible-areas with nearby located wildlife management centers, further associated with financial disincentives, and limited local logistics capacity. Thus resulting in the exclusion of some geographic regions of the country. This epidemiological surveillance scheme allowed us to estimate the general state of health of the countrys wildlife, establishing the cause of death of the analyzed animals as follows: (i) 46 (54.1%) traumatic events, (ii) 23 (27.1%) infectious agents, (iii) two (2.4%) degenerative illness, (iv) three (3.5%) presumably poisoning, and (v) in 11 (12.9%)undetermined. It also allowed the detection of pathogens such as, canine distemper virus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma spp., Angiostrongylus spp., Dirofilaria spp., Baylisascaris spp., among others. As well as recognizing the circulation of these pathogens around national territory and also on those analyzed species. This strategy is crucial in geographical regions defined as critical for the appearance of diseases due to their great biodiversity and social conditions.",

    "abstract": "Skin wound healing is a complex process which requires the interaction of many cell types and mediators in a highly sophisticated temporal sequence. Myeloid cells compose a significant proportion of the inflammatory cells recruited to a wound site and play important roles in clearance of damaged tissue and microorganisms. Myeloid cells have also been suggested to convert into fibro-blast-like cells and endothelial cells in participation of wound healing process. However, whether myeloid cells in wound skin can convert into epithelial cells and contribute to re-epithelialization and skin appendage regeneration is still unclear. In this study, we performed double immunofluorescent staining with antibodies for hematopoietic cells and keratinocytes as well as cell tracing technique to investigate hematopoietic cell conversion. The result show that during the healing process, some of the CD45-positive hematopoietic cells are overlapped with keratin 14, the markers of keratinocytes. Further, CD11b-positive myeloid cells seem the origin of converted epithelial cells. To confirm these results, we culture CD11b-posiitve myeloid cells from mouse splenocytes in a medium containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and dermal injection of these cells into the healthy skin when punch biopsy is created in mouse skin. Tracing injected labeled splenocyte-derived myeloid cells in skin, we confirm that myeloid cells able to convert into keratinocytes in repaired skin. Furthermore, our results from in vivo experiments provide new information on contribution of myeloid cells in hair follicle regeneration. In conclusion, this work highlights the myeloid cell contributions in wound repair and hair follicle regeneration in mice through conversion of M-CSF-stimulated CD11b+ myeloid cells into epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis may contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, yet it is often unclear how risk genes associated with these disorders affect gut physiology in a manner that could impact microbial colonization. We addressed this question using Drosophila melanogaster with a null mutation in kismet, the ortholog of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD) family members CHD7 and CHD8. In humans, CHD7 and CHD8 are risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders with co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms. We found kismet mutant flies have a significant increase in gastrointestinal transit time, indicating functional homology of kismet with CHD7/CHD8 in vertebrates. To measure gut tissue mechanics, we used a high-precision force transducer and length controller, capable of measuring forces to micro-Newton precision, which revealed significant changes in the mechanics of kismet mutant guts, in terms of elasticity, strain stiffening, and tensile strength. Using 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing, we also found kismet mutants have reduced diversity of gut microbiota at every taxonomic level and an increase in pathogenic taxa. To investigate the connection between the gut microbiome and behavior, we depleted gut microbiota in kismet mutant and control flies and measured courtship behavior. Depletion of gut microbiota rescued courtship defects of kismet mutant flies, indicating a connection between gut microbiota and behavior. In striking contrast, depletion of gut microbiome in the control strain reduced courtship activity. This result demonstrated that antibiotic treatment can have differential impacts on behavior that may depend on the status of microbial dysbiosis in the gut prior to depletion. We propose that Kismet influences multiple gastrointestinal phenotypes that contribute to the gut-brain axis to influence behavior. Based on our results, we also suggest that gut tissue mechanics should be considered as an element in the gut-brain communication loop, both influenced by and potentially influencing the gut microbiome and neuronal development.",
