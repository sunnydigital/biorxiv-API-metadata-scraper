    "abstract": "The rational design and realisation of simple-to-use genetic control elements that are modular, orthogonal and robust is essential to the construction of predictable and reliable biological systems of increasing complexity. To this effect, we introduce modular Artificial RNA interference (mARi), a rational, modular and extensible design framework that enables robust, portable and multiplexed post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. The regulatory function of mARi was characterised in a range of relevant genetic contexts, demonstrating its independence from other genetic control elements and the gene of interest, and providing new insight into the design rules of RNA based regulation in E. coli, while a range of cellular contexts also demonstrated it to be independent of growth-phase and strain type. Importantly, the extensibility and orthogonality of mARi enables the simultaneous post-transcriptional regulation of multi-gene systems as both single-gene cassettes and poly-cistronic operons. To facilitate adoption, mARi was designed to be directly integrated into the modular BASIC DNA assembly framework. We anticipate that mARi-based genetic control within an extensible DNA assembly framework will facilitate metabolic engineering, layered genetic control, and advanced genetic circuit applications.",

    "abstract": "U12-type or minor introns are found in most multicellular eukaryotes and constitute [~]0.5% of all introns in species with a minor spliceosome. Although the biological significance for evolutionary conservation of U12-type introns is debated, mutations disrupting U12 splicing cause developmental defects in both plants and animals. In human hematopoietic stem cells, U12 splicing defects disrupt proper differentiation of myeloid lineages and are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), predisposing individuals to acute myeloid leukemia. Mutants in the maize ortholog of RNA Binding Motif Protein48 (RBM48) have aberrant U12-type intron splicing. Human RBM48 was recently purified biochemically as part of the minor spliceosome and shown to recognize the 5 end of the U6atac snRNA. In this report, we use CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of RBM48 in human K-562 cells to show the genetic function of RBM48. RNA-seq analysis comparing wild-type and mutant K-562 genotypes found that 48% of minor intron containing genes (MIGs) have significant U12-type intron retention in RBM48 mutants. Comparing these results to maize rbm48 mutants defined a subset of MIGs disrupted in both species. Mutations in the majority of these orthologous MIGs have been reported to cause developmental defects in both plants and animals. Our results provide genetic evidence that the primary defect of human RBM48 mutants is aberrant U12-type intron splicing, while a comparison of human and maize RNA-seq data identifies candidate genes likely to mediate mutant phenotypes of U12-type splicing defects.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle and differentiation decisions are tightly linked; however, the underlying principles that drive these decisions are not fully understood. Here, we combined cell-cycle reporter system and single-cell RNA-seq profiling to study the transcriptomes of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the context of cell cycle states and differentiation. By applying retinoic acid, a multi-linage differentiation assay, on G1 and G2/M pre-sorted ESCs, we show that only G2/M ESCs were capable of differentiating into extraembryonic endoderm cells (XENs), whereas cells in the G1 phase predominantly produce Epiblast Stem Cells. We identified ESRRB, a key pluripotency factor that is upregulated during G2/M phase, as a central driver of XEN differentiation. Furthermore, enhancer chromatin states based on WT and Esrrb-KO ESCs show association of ESRRB with XEN poised enhancers. Cells engineered to overexpress Esrrb during G1 allow ESCs to produce XENs, while ESRRB-KO ESCs lost their potential to differentiate into XEN. In addition, Embryonic bodies (EBs) are not affected by deletion of ESRRB but trigger apoptosis upon attempts to apply direct XEN differentiation. Taken together, this study reveals an important functional link between Esrrb and cell-cycle states during the exit from pluripotency. Finally, the experimental scheme of single cell RNA-seq in the context of cell cycle can be further expanded into other cellular systems to better understand differentiation decisions and cancer models.",

Competition experiments between a lab-adapted African parasite (NF54), and a recently isolated Asian parasite (NHP4026) reveal contrasting outcomes in different media: NF54 outcompetes NHP4026 in media containing human serum, while NHP4026 outcompetes NF54 in media containing AlbuMAX, a lipid-rich bovine serum formulation. We conducted parasite genetic crosses and compared genome-wide allele frequency changes in progeny populations cultured in media containing serum or AlbuMAX: this bulk segregant analysis (BSA) reveals three quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying differential growth. The strongest QTL (chromosome 13) contains EBA-140: competition experiments between EBA-140-knockout and isogenic wildtype parasites showed fitness reversals in the two media types, validating this locus as the causative gene. These results (i) demonstrate the effectiveness of BSA for dissecting fitness traits in Plasmodium falciparum, and (ii) reveal an intimate link between red blood cell invasion and nutrient composition of growth media.",

    "abstract": "To determine how much cognitive control to invest in a task, people need to consider whether exerting control matters for obtaining rewards. In particular, they need to account for the efficacy of their performance - the degree to which rewards are determined by performance or by independent factors. Yet it remains unclear how people learn about their performance efficacy in an environment. Here we combined computational modeling with measures of task performance and EEG, to provide a mechanistic account of how people (a) learn and update efficacy expectations in a changing environment, and (b) proactively adjust control allocation based on current efficacy expectations. Across two studies subjects performed an incentivized cognitive control task while their performance efficacy (the likelihood that rewards are performance- contingent or random) varied over time. We show that people update their efficacy beliefs based on prediction errors - leveraging similar neural and computational substrates as those that underpin reward learning - and adjust how much control they allocate according to these beliefs. Using computational modeling, we show that these control adjustments reflect changes in information processing, rather than the speed-accuracy tradeoff. These findings demonstrate the neurocomputational mechanism through which people learn how worthwhile their cognitive control is.",

    "abstract": "Bigger brains are thought to support richer abilities, including perceptual abilities. But bigger brains are typically organized differently (e.g., with more cortical areas). Thus, the extent to which a neural systems size versus organization underlies complex abilities remains unclear. The marmoset monkey is evolutionarily peculiar: it has a small brain, yet many cortical areas. We used this natural experiment to test organization as source of high-level visual abilities independent of size, via large-scale psychophysics comparing marmosets to different species on identical tasks. Marmosets far out--performed rats--a marmoset-sized rodent--on a simple visual recognition task. On another visual task, which is difficult for both humans and machines, marmosets achieved high performance. Strikingly, their image-by-image behavior revealed that they did so in a manner highly similar to humans--marmosets were nearly as human-like as were macaques. These results suggest a key role for brain organization--not simply size--in the evolution of sophisticated abilities.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation is regarded as a prerequisite for evolution. Theoretical models suggest epigenetic information inherited independently of DNA sequence can also enable evolution. However, whether epigenetic inheritance mediates phenotypic evolution in natural populations is unknown. Here we show that natural epigenetic DNA methylation variation in gene bodies regulates genes expression, and thereby influences the natural variation of complex traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. Notably, the effects of methylation variation on phenotypic diversity and gene expression variance are comparable with those of DNA sequence polymorphism. We also identify methylation epialleles in numerous genes associated with environmental conditions in native habitats, suggesting that intragenic methylation facilitates adaptation to fluctuating environments. Our results demonstrate that methylation variation fundamentally shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations and provides an epigenetic basis for adaptive Darwinian evolution independent of genetic polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "Plasma membrane damage (PMD) occurs in all cell types due to environmental perturbation and cell-autonomous activities. However, cellular outcomes of PMD remain largely unknown except for recovery or death. Here, using budding yeast and normal human fibroblasts, we show that cellular senescence, irreversible cell cycle arrest contributing to organismal aging, is the long-term outcome of PMD. To identify the genes essential for PMD response, we developed a simple PMD-damaging assay using a detergent and performed a systematic yeast genome-wide screen. The screen identified 48 genes. The top hits in the screen are the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) genes, encoding the well-described plasma membrane repair proteins in eukaryotes. Unexpectedly, the replicative lifespan regulator genes are enriched in our 48 hits. This finding suggests a close genetic association between the PMD response and the replicative lifespan regulations. Indeed, we show that PMD limits the replicative lifespan in budding yeast; the ESCRT activator AAA-ATPase VPS4-overexpression extends it. These results suggest that PMD limits replicative lifespan in budding yeast. Moreover, in normal human fibroblasts, we find that PMD induces premature senescence via the Ca2+-p53 axis but not the major senescence pathway, ATM/ATR pathway. Consistent with the results in yeast, transient overexpression of ESCRT-III, CHMP4B, suppressed the PMD-dependent senescence in normal human fibroblasts. Our study proposes that PMD limits cellular lifespan in two different eukaryotic cell types and highlights an underappreciated but ubiquitous senescent cell subtype, namely PMD-dependent senescent cells.",

    "abstract": "Environment can alter the degree of phenotypic variation and covariation, potentially influencing evolutionary trajectories. However, environment-driven changes in phenotypic variation remain understudied. In an effort to exploit the abundance of RNASequencing data now available, an increasing number of ecological studies rely on population-level correlation to characterize the plastic response of the entire transcriptome and to identify environmentally responsive molecular pathways. These studies are fundamentally interested in identifying groups of genes that respond in concert to environmental shifts. We show that population-level differential co-expression exhibits biases when capturing changes of regulatory activity and strength in rice plants responding to elevated temperature. One possible cause of this bias is regulatory saturation, the observation that detectable co-variance between a regulator and its target may be low as their transcript abundances are induced. This phenomenon appears to be particularly acute for rapid-onset environmental stressors. However, our results suggest that temporal correlations may be a reliable means to detect transient regulatory activity following rapid onset environmental perturbations such as temperature stress. Such temporal bias is likely to confound the studies of phenotypic integration, where high-order organismal traits are hypothesized to be more integrated with strong correlation under stressful conditions, while recent transcriptome studies exhibited weaker coexpression between genes under stressful conditions. Collectively, our results point to the need to account for the nuances of molecular interactions and the possibly confounding effects that these can introduce into conventional approaches to study transcriptome datasets.",

However, the cortical substrates underlying this audiovisual integration remain uncertain. Here, we show that mouse frontal cortex combines auditory and visual evidence; that this combination is additive, mirroring behavior; and that it evolves with learning. Scanning optogenetic inactivation demonstrated that inactivating frontal cortex impaired choices based on either sensory modality. Recordings from >10,000 neurons indicated that after task learning, activity in frontal area MOs (secondary motor cortex) encodes an additive combination of visual and auditory signals, consistent with the mices behavioral strategy. An accumulator model applied to these sensory representations reproduced both the observed choices and reaction times. These results indicate that frontal cortex adapts through learning to combine evidence across sensory cortices, providing a signal that is transformed into a binary decision by a downstream accumulator.",

    "abstract": "Resource choice behaviour has enormous fitness consequences and can drive niche expansion. However, individual behavioural choices are often mediated by context, determined by past experience. Are such context-dependent behaviours adaptive? Using Tribolium castaneum (the red flour beetle), we demonstrate that context-dependent oviposition choice reflects distinct, context-specific local fitness peaks. Manipulating female egg allocation in a habitat containing optimal and suboptimal resource patches, we measured offspring fitness to generate fitness landscapes as a function of all possible oviposition behaviours (i.e., combinations of fecundity and resource preference). Females from different age and competition contexts exhibit distinct behaviours which optimize different fitness components that are linked in a tradeoff. With increasing age and prior exposure to competition, they produce few but fast-developing offspring that are advantageous under high resource competition. In contrast, young naive females produce many slow-developing offspring, beneficial under weak competition. Systematically mapping complete context-dependent fitness landscapes is thus critical to infer behavioural optimality and offers predictive power in novel contexts.\n\nPreprint available at - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.27.445916v1.full\n\nCitation - Vrinda Ravi Kumar, Gaurav Agavekar, Deepa Agashe; bioRxiv 2021.05.27.445916; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.27.445916",

    "abstract": "Our ability to effectively retrieve complex semantic knowledge meaningfully impacts our daily lives, yet the neural processes that underly successful access and transient failures in access remain only partially understood. In this fMRI study, we contrast activation during successful semantic access, unsuccessful semantic access due to transient access-failures (i.e.,  tip-of-the-tongue,  feeling-of-knowing), and trials where the semantic knowledge was not possessed. Twenty-four human participants (14 female) were presented 240 trivia-based questions relating to person, place, object or scholastic knowledge-domains. Analyses of the recall event indicated a relatively greater role of a dorsomedial section of the prefrontal cortex in unsuccessful semantic access and relatively greater recruitment of the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus in successful access. Successful access was also associated with increased activation in knowledge-domain selective areas. Generally, knowledge-domain selective areas showed increased responses for both preferred and non-preferred stimulus classes. The exception was place-selective regions (PPA, TOS and RSC), which were recruited during unsuccessful access attempts for all stimulus domains. Collectively, these results suggest that prefrontal semantic control systems and classical spatial-knowledge selective regions work together to locate relevant information and that access to complex knowledge results in a broad activation of semantic representation extending to regions selective for other knowledge domains.",

Here, we demonstrate that a novel Fiji/ImageJ-based plugin, Analyze_Blebs, can be used to quickly obtain cell migration parameters and morphometrics from time lapse images. As validation, we show that Analyze_Blebs can detect significant differences in cell migration and morphometrics, such as the largest bleb size, upon introducing different live markers of F-actin, including F-tractin and LifeAct tagged with green and red fluorescent proteins. We also demonstrate, using flow cytometry, that live markers increase total levels of F-actin. Furthermore, that F-tractin increases cell stiffness, which was found to correlate with a decrease in migration, thus reaffirming the importance of cell mechanics as a determinant of Leader Bleb-Based Migration (LBBM).\n\nHighlight summaryA new plugin, Analyze_Blebs, enables the rapid analysis of cell migration and morphometrics of fast amoeboid cells. Morphometrics combined with cell stiffness are found to be predictive of confined, fast amoeboid (leader bleb-based), migration.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveType 1 Diabetes (T1D) is characterized by progressive loss of insulin-producing pancreatic {beta} cells as a result of autoimmune destruction. In addition to {beta} cell death, recent work has shown that subpopulations of {beta} cells acquire dysfunction during T1D. We previously reported that some {beta} cells adopt a senescent fate involving a DNA damage response (DDR) during the pathogenesis of T1D, however, the question of how senescence develops in {beta} cells has not been investigated.\n\nMethodsHere, we tested the hypothesis that unrepaired DNA damage triggers {beta} cell senescence using culture models including the mouse NIT1 {beta} cell line derived from the T1D-susceptible nonobese diabetic (NOD) strain, human donor islets and EndoC {beta} cells. DNA damage was chemically induced using etoposide or bleomycin and cells or islets were analyzed by a combination of molecular assays for senescence phenotypes including Western blotting, qRT-PCR, Luminex assays, flow cytometry and histochemical staining. RNA-seq was carried out to profile global transcriptomic changes in human islets undergoing DDR and senescence. Insulin ELISAs were used to quantify glucose stimulated insulin secretion from chemically-induced senescent islets and cells in culture.\n\nResultsSub-lethal DNA damage in NIT1 cells led to several classical hallmarks of senescence including sustained DDR activation, growth arrest, enlarged flattened morphology and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) resembling what occurs in primary {beta} cells during T1D in NOD mice. Some of these phenotypes differed between NIT1 cells and the MIN6 {beta} cell line derived from a non-T1D susceptible mouse strain. RNA-seq analysis of human islets undergoing DDR and early senescence revealed a coordinated p53-p21 transcriptional program and upregulation of prosurvival signaling and SASP genes, which were confirmed in independent islet preparations at the protein level. Importantly, chemically induced DNA damage also led to DDR activation and senescence phenotypes in the EndoC-{beta}H5 human {beta} cell line, confirming that this response can occur directly in human {beta} cells. Finally, DNA damage and senescence in both mouse {beta} cell lines and human islets led to decreased insulin content.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, these findings suggest that some of the phenotypes of {beta} cell senescence during T1D can be modeled by chemically induced DNA damage in mouse {beta} cell lines and human islets and {beta} cells in culture. These culture models will be useful tools to understand some of the mechanisms of {beta} cell senescence in T1D.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDNA damage induces senescent phenotypes in mouse {beta} cell lines\nC_LIO_LIDNA damage induces a p53-p21 transcriptional program and senescent phenotypes in human islets and EndoC cells\nC_LIO_LIDNA damage and senescence leads to decreased insulin content\nC_LIO_LIDNA damage models some aspects of {beta} cell senescence in Type 1 Diabetes\nC_LI",

In this study we investigate whether chemically defined spent media (CDSM) waste from cell culture bioprocess can be recycled and used as a feed in secondary microbial fermentation to produce new recombinant protein products. Our results show that CDSM supplemented with 2% glycerol supported a specific growth rate of E. coli cultures equivalent to that achieved using a nutritionally rich microbiological media (LB). The titre of recombinant protein produced following induction in a 4-hour expression screen was approximately equivalent in the CDSM fed cultures to that of baseline, and this was maintained in a 16-hr preparative fermentation. To understand the protein production achieved in CDSM fed culture we performed a quantitative analysis of proteome changes in the E. coli using mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed significant upregulation of protein synthesis machinery enzymes and significant downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. We conclude that spent cell culture media, which represents 100s of millions of litres of waste generated by the bioprocessing industry annually, may be valorized as a feed resource for the production of recombinant proteins in secondary microbial fermentations.",

    "abstract": "The process of smolting is a critical phase in the life-cycle of anadromous salmonids and it has been associated with substantial rates of mortality. Survival during freshwater and marine migration is known to have population level effects, thus an understanding of the patterns of mortality has the potential to yield important insights into population bottlenecks. Despite important advancements in tracking techniques, the specifics of mortality events in anadromous salmonids during their initial migration to sea remains somewhat elusive. Here, we develop a framework combining spatial and temporal detections of smolt riverine migration from two tracking techniques, which enable inferences to be made about mortality locations, causes, and rates. In this study, we demonstrate that during their initial riverine transitional phase, smolts were particularly vulnerable to predators. Specifically, avian predation appeared to be the main cause of mortality (42%), although piscine predation events were not trivial (14%). Our results suggested some direct and indirect tagging-induced mortality (e.g., through increased predation vulnerability), which highlights the importance of determining tagging mortality in a telemetry study to ensure adequate interpretation of migration success. Overall, by estimating migration loss and its variability, our study framework should help to guide management actions to mitigate the widespread population declines these species are currently facing.",

BFG has been implemented in Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens (BFG-Y2H). While Y2H requires test protein pairs to localize in the nucleus for reporter reconstruction, Dihydrofolate Reductase Protein-Fragment Complementation Assay (DHFR-PCA) allows proteins to localize in broader subcellular contexts and proves to be largely orthogonal to Y2H. Here, we implemented BFG to DHFR-PCA (BFG-PCA). This plasmid-based system can leverage ORF collections across model organisms to perform comparative analysis, unlike the original DHFR-PCA that requires yeast genomic integration. The scalability and quality of BFG-PCA were demonstrated by screening human and yeast interactions for >11,000 protein pairs. BFG-PCA showed high-sensitivity and high-specificity for capturing known interactions for both species. BFG-Y2H and BFG-PCA capture distinct sets of PPIs, which can partially be explained based on the domain orientation of the reporter tags.

Unlike prior methods that only focus on the average expression levels of genes in clusters or cell types, TraSig fully utilizes the dynamic information to identify significant ligand-receptor pairs with similar trajectories, which in turn are used to score interacting cell clusters. We applied TraSig to several scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show, using the ordering information allows TraSig to obtain unique predictions that improve upon those identified by prior methods.

    "abstract": "Sequence logos are used to visually display conservations and variations in short sequences. They can indicate the fixed patterns or conserved motifs in a batch of DNA or protein sequences. However, most of the popular sequence logo generators are based on the assumption that all the input sequences are from the same homologous group, which will lead to an overlook of the heterogeneity among the sequences during the sequence logo making process. Heterogeneous groups of sequences may represent clades of different evolutionary origins, or genes families with different functions. Therefore, it is essential to divide the sequences into different phylogenetic or functional groups to reveal their specific sequence motifs and conservation patterns. To solve these problems, we developed MetaLogo, which can automatically cluster the input sequences after multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction, and then output sequence logos for multiple groups and aligned them in one figure. User-defined grouping is also supported by MetaLogo to allow users to investigate functional motifs in a more delicate and dynamic perspective. MetaLogo can highlight both the homologous and nonhomologous sites among sequences. MetaLogo can also be used to annotate the evolutionary positions and gene functions of unknown sequences, together with their local sequence characteristics. We provide users a public MetaLogo web server (http://metalogo.omicsnet.org), a standalone Python package (https://github.com/labomics/MetaLogo), and also a built-in web server available for local deployment. Using MetaLogo, users can draw informative, customized and publishable sequence logos without any programming experience to present and investigate new knowledge on specific sequence sets.",

    "abstract": "At the time of this writing, December 2021, potential emergence of vaccine escape variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a grave global concern. The interface between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the host receptor (ACE2) overlap with the binding site of principal neutralizing antibodies (NAb), limiting the repertoire of viable mutations. Nonetheless, variants with multiple mutations in the RBD have rose to dominance. Non-additive, epistatic relationships among RBD mutations are apparent, and assessing the impact of such epistasis on the mutational landscape is crucial. Epistasis can substantially increase the risk of vaccine escape and cannot be completely characterized through the study of the wild type (WT) alone. We employed protein structure modeling using Rosetta to compare the effects of all single mutants at the RBD-NAb and RBD-ACE2 interfaces for the WT, Delta, Gamma, and Omicron variants. Overall, epistasis at the RBD interface appears to be limited and the effects of most multiple mutations are additive. Epistasis at the Delta variant interface weakly stabilizes NAb interaction relative to ACE2 interaction, whereas in the Gamma variant, epistasis more substantially destabilizes NAb interaction. Although a small, systematic trend towards NAb destabilization not observed for Delta or Gamma was detected for Omicron, and despite bearing significantly more RBD mutations, the epistatic landscape of the Omicron variant closely resembles that of Gamma. These results suggest that, although Omicron poses new risks not observed with Delta, structural constraints on the RBD hamper continued evolution towards more complete vaccine escape. The modest ensemble of mutations relative to the WT that are currently known to reduce vaccine efficacy is likely to comprise the majority of all possible escape mutations for future variants, predicting continued efficacy of the existing vaccines.\n\nSignificanceEmergence of vaccine escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 is arguably the most pressing problem during the COVID-19 pandemic as vaccines are distributed worldwide. We employed a computational approach to assess the risk of antibody escape resulting from mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of the wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the Delta, Gamma, and Omicron variants. At the time of writing, December, 2021, Omicron is poised to replace Delta as the dominant variant worldwide. The efficacy of the existing vaccines against Omicron could be substantially reduced relative to the WT and the potential for vaccine escape is of grave concern. Our results suggest that although Omicron poses new evolutionary risks not observed for the Delta variant, structural constraints on the RBD make continued evolution towards more complete vaccine escape unlikely. The modest set of escape-enhancing mutations already identified for the wild type likely include the majority of all possible mutations with this effect.",

The rotary mechanism is influenced by the divergent peripheral stalk, conferring a greater conformational flexibility. Proton transfer in the lumenal half-channel occurs via a chain of five ordered water molecules. The dimerization interface is formed by subunit-g that is critical for interactions but not for the catalytic activity. Although overall dimer architecture varies among eukaryotes, we find that subunit-g together with subunit-e form an ancestral oligomerization motif, which is shared between the trypanosomal and mammalian lineages.

However, Zuc lacks sequence preference in vitro, pointing towards additional unknown specificity factors. We examined murine piRNAs and revealed a strong and specific enrichment of three sequences (UAA, UAG, UGA)-- corresponding to stop codons--at piRNA 5 ends. Stop codon sequences were also enriched immediately after piRNA processing intermediates, reflecting their Zuc-dependent tail-to-head arrangement. Further analyses revealed that a Zuc in vivo cleavage preference at four sequences (UAA, UAG, UGA, UAC) promotes 5 end stop codons. This observation was conserved across mammals and possibly further. Our work provides new insights into Zuc-dependent cleavage and may point to a previously unrecognized connection between piRNA biogenesis and the translational machinery.",

    "abstract": "In response to pheromone, many proteins localize on the plasma membrane of yeast cell to reform it into a polarized shmoo structure. The adaptor protein Ste50, long known as a pheromone signal enhancer critical for shmoo polarization, has never been explored systematically for its localization and function in the polarization process. Time-lapse single-cell imaging and quantitation shown here characterizes Ste50p involvement in the establishment of cell polarity. We found early localization of Ste50p patches on the cell cortex that mark the point of shmoo initiation, these polarity sites move, and patches remain associated with the growing shmoo tip in a pheromone concentration timedependent manner until shmoo maturation. By quantitative analysis we show that polarization corelates with the rising levels of Ste50p, enabling rapid individual cell responses to pheromone that corresponds to a critical level of Ste50p at the initial G1 phase. We exploited the quantitative differences in the pattern of Ste50p expression to corelate with the cell-cell phenotypic heterogeneity showing Ste50p involvement in the cellular differentiation choice. Taken together, these findings present spatiotemporal localization of Ste50p during yeast polarization, suggesting that Ste50p is a component of the polarisome, and plays a critical role in regulating the polarized growth of shmoo during pheromone response.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as tumour suppressors or oncogenes to repress/promote tumour cell proliferation via RNA-dependent mechanisms. Recently, genome sequencing has identified elevated densities of tumour somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in lncRNA genes. However, this has been attributed to phenotypically-neutral \"passenger\" processes, and the existence of positively-selected fitness-altering \"driver\" SNVs acting via lncRNAs has not been addressed. We developed and used ExInAtor2, an improved driver-discovery pipeline, to map pancancer and cancer-specific mutated lncRNAs across an extensive cohort of 2583 primary and 3527 metastatic tumours. The 54 resulting lncRNAs are mostly linked to cancer for the first time. Their significance is supported by a range of clinical and genomic evidence, and display oncogenic potential when experimentally expressed in matched tumour models. Our results revealed a striking SNV hotspot in the iconic NEAT1 oncogene, which was ascribed by previous studies to passenger processes. To directly evaluate the functional significance of NEAT1 SNVs, we used in cellulo mutagenesis to introduce tumour-like mutations in the gene and observed a consequent increase in cell proliferation in both transformed and normal backgrounds. Mechanistic analyses revealed that SNVs alter NEAT1 ribonucleoprotein assembly and boost subnuclear paraspeckles. This is the first experimental evidence that mutated lncRNAs can contribute to the pathological fitness of tumour cells.",

    "abstract": "Root hair initiation is a highly regulated aspect of root development. The plant hormone, ethylene, and its precursor, 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), induce formation and elongation of root hairs. Using confocal microscopy paired with redox biosensors and dyes, we demonstrated that treatments that elevate ethylene levels led to increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation in hair cells prior to root hair formation. In two ethylene-insensitive mutants, etr1-3 and ein3/eil1, there was no increase in root hair number or ROS accumulation. Conversely, etr1-7, a constitutive ethylene signaling receptor mutant, has increased root hair formation and ROS accumulation like ethylene-treated Col-0 seedlings. The caprice and werewolf transcription factor mutants have decreased and elevated ROS levels, which are correlated with levels of root hair initiation. The rhd2-6 mutant, with a defect in the gene encoding a ROS synthesizing Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog C (RBOHC) and the prx44-2 mutant defective in a class III peroxidase, showed impaired ethylene-dependent ROS synthesis and root hair formation and EIN3/EIL1 dependent transcriptional regulation. Together, these results indicate that ethylene increases ROS accumulation through RBOHC and PRX44 to drive root hair formation.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe gaseous hormone ethylene increases root hair initiation by elevating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in trichoblast cells. Genetic and biochemical approaches identified ethylene-regulated ROS producing enzymes that drive root hair initiation.",

Neutralization titres of Omicron by sera from vaccinees and convalescent subjects infected with early pandemic as well as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta are substantially reduced or fail to neutralize. Titres against Omicron are boosted by third vaccine doses and are high in cases both vaccinated and infected by Delta. Mutations in Omicron knock out or substantially reduce neutralization by most of a large panel of potent monoclonal antibodies and antibodies under commercial development.

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 variant (Omicron) contains 15 mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). How Omicron would evade RBD neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) requires immediate investigation. Here, we used high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the RBD escaping mutation profiles for 247 human anti-RBD NAbs and showed that the NAbs could be unsupervised clustered into six epitope groups (A-F), which is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications3-5. Strikingly, various single mutations of Omicron could impair NAbs of different epitope groups. Specifically, NAbs in Group A-D, whose epitope overlap with ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A, and Q493R. Group E (S309 site)6 and F (CR3022 site)7 NAbs, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but still, a subset of NAbs are escaped by G339D, N440K, and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that single mutation tolerating NAbs could also be escaped due to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested NAbs are escaped by Omicron. Regarding NAb drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016/LY-CoV555, REGN10933/REGN10987, AZD1061/AZD8895, and BRII-196 were greatly reduced by Omicron, while VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still function at reduced efficacy. Together, data suggest Omicron would cause significant humoral immune evasion, while NAbs targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region remain most effective. Our results offer instructions for developing NAb drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.",

    "abstract": "Clinical disease from Clostridioides difficile infection can be mediated by two toxins and their neighboring regulatory genes encoded within the five-gene pathogenicity locus (PaLoc). We provide several lines of evidence that the toxin activity of C. difficile may be modulated by genomic variants outside of the PaLoc. We used a phylogenetic tree-based approach to demonstrate discordance between toxin activity and PaLoc evolutionary history, an elastic net method to show the insufficiency of PaLoc variants alone to model toxin activity, and a convergence-based bacterial genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify correlations between non-PaLoc loci with changes in toxin activity. Combined, these data support a model of C. difficile disease wherein toxin activity may be strongly affected by many non-PaLoc loci. Additionally, we characterize multiple other in vitro phenotypes relevant to human infections including germination and sporulation. These phenotypes vary greatly in their clonality, variability, convergence, and concordance with genomic variation. Lastly, we highlight the intersection of loci identified by GWAS for different phenotypes and clinical severity. This strategy to identify the overlapping loci can facilitate the identification of genetic variation linking phenotypic variation to clinical outcomes.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile has two major disease mediating toxins, A and B, encoded within the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc). In this study we demonstrate via multiple approaches that genomic variants outside of the PaLoc are associated with changes in toxin activity. These genomic variants may provide new avenues of exploration in the hunt for novel disease modifying interventions. Additionally, we provide insight into the evolution of several additional phenotypes also critical to clinical infection such as sporulation, germination, and growth rate. These in vitro phenotypes display a range of responses to evolutionary pressures and as such vary in their appropriateness for certain bacterial genome wide association study approaches. We used a convergence-based association method to identify the genomic variants most correlated with both changes in these phenotypes and disease severity. These overlapping loci may be important to both bacterial function and human clinical disease.",

    "abstract": "B lymphocyte development has two DNA recombination processes: V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin (Igh) gene variable region and class switching of the Igh constant regions from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE. V(D)J recombination is required for successful maturation of B cells from pro-B to pre-B to immature-B and then to mature B cells in the bone marrow. CSR occurs outside of the bone marrow when mature B cells migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes. Both V(D)J recombination and CSR depend on an open chromatin state that makes DNA accessible to specific enzymes, recombination activating gene (RAG), and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Acetyltransferases GCN5 and PCAF possess redundant functions acetylating histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9). Here, we generated a mouse model that lacks both GCN5 and PCAF in B cells. We found that double-deficient mice possess low levels of mature B cells in the bone marrow and peripheral organs, an accumulation of pro-B cells in bone marrow, and reduced CSR levels. We conclude that both GCN5 and PCAF are required for B cell development in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Animal products may play a role in developing and spreading antimicrobial resistance in several ways. On the one hand, residues of antibiotics not adequately used in animal farming can enter the human body via food. But resistant bacteria may also be present in animal products, which can transfer the antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) to the bacteria in the consumers body by horizontal gene transfer. As previous studies have shown that fermented foods have a meaningful ARG content, it is indicated that such genes may also be present in silage used as mass feed in the cattle sector. In our study, we aspired to answer what ARGs occur in silage and what mobility characteristics they have? For this purpose, we have analyzed bioinformatically 52 freely available deep sequenced silage samples from shotgun metagenome next-generation sequencing. A total of 17 perfect matched ARGs occurred 55 times in the samples. More than half of these ARGs are mobile because they can be linked to integrative mobile genetic elements, prophages or plasmids. Our results point to a neglected but substantial ARG source in the food chain.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities in many ecosystems are facing a broad range of global change drivers, such as nutrient enrichment, chemical pollution, and temperature change. These drivers can cause changes in the abundance of taxa, the composition of communities, and the properties of ecosystems. While the influence of single drivers is already described in numerous studies, the effect and predictability of multiple drivers changing simultaneously is still poorly understood. In this study, we used 240 highly replicable oxic/anoxic aquatic lab microcosms and four drivers (fertilizer, glyphosate, metal pollution, antibiotics) in all possible combinations at three different temperatures (20 {degrees}C, 24 {degrees}C, and 28 {degrees}C) to shed light into consequences of multiple drivers on different levels of organization, ranging from species abundance to community and ecosystem parameters. We found (i) that at all levels of ecological organisation, combinations of drivers can change the biological consequence and direction of effect compared to single drivers (ii), that effects of combinations are further modified by temperature, (iii) that a larger number of drivers occurring simultaneously is often quite closely related to their effect size, and (iv) that there is little evidence that any of these effects are associated with the level of ecological organisation of the state variable. These findings suggest that, at least in this experimental ecosystem approximating a stratified aquatic ecosystem, there may be relatively little scope for predicting the effects of combinations of drivers from the effects of individual drivers, or by accounting for the level of ecological organisation in question, though there may be some scope for prediction based on the number of drivers that are occurring simultaneous. A priority, though also a considerable challenge, is to extend such research to consider continuous variation in the magnitude of multiple drivers acting together.",

However, the tumor immune infiltrate is highly heterogeneous and understanding how the interplay between different immune cell compartments impacts on the clinical outcome is still in its infancy.\n\nHere, we describe in a prospective cohort a novel CD8+ T effector memory population, which is characterized by high levels of Granzyme K (GZMKhigh CD8+ TEM) and is correlated with CD15high tumor infiltrating neutrophils. We provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the role of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (CXCL12/SDF-1) in driving functional changes on neutrophils at the tumor site, promoting their retention and increasing the crosstalk with CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, as a consequence of the interaction with neutrophils, CD8+ T cells are skewed towards a CD8+ TEM phenotype and produce high levels of GZMK, which in turn decreases E-cadherin pathway. The correlations of GZMKhigh CD8+ TEM and neutrophils with both tumor progression in mice and early relapse in CRC patients demonstrate the role of GZMKhigh CD8+ TEM in promoting malignancy. Indeed, a gene signature defining GZMKhigh CD8+ TEM was associated with worse prognosis on a larger independent cohort of CRC patients and a similar analysis was extended to lung cancer (TCGA).\n\nOverall, our results highlight the emergence of GZMKhigh CD8+ TEM in early-stage CRC tumors as a hallmark driven by the interaction with neutrophils, which could implement current patient stratification and be targeted by novel therapeutics.",

Although OxPhos defects modulate cytokine production in vitro and in animal models, little is known about how circulating leukocytes of patients with inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects respond to acute immune challenges. In a small cohort of healthy controls (n=21) and patients (n=12) with either the m.3243A>G mutation or single, large-scale mtDNA deletions, we examined: i) cytokine responses (IL-6, TNF-, IL-1{beta}) in response to acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, and ii) sensitivity to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoid signaling (dexamethasone) on cytokine production. In dose-response experiments to determine the half-maximal effective LPS concentration (EC50), relative to controls, leukocytes from patients with mtDNA deletions showed 74 - 79% lower responses for IL-6 and IL-1{beta} (pIL-6=0.031, pIL-1{beta}=0.009). Moreover, IL-6 response to LPS in presence of GC was also blunted in cells from patients with mtDNA deletions (pIL-6=0.006), but not in leukocytes from patients with the m.3243A>G mutation. Overall, these ex vivo data provide preliminary evidence that some systemic OxPhos defects may compromise immune cytokine responses and glucocorticoid sensitivity. Further work in larger cohorts is needed to define the nature of immune dysregulation in patients with mitochondrial disease, and their potential implications for disease phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Identification of somatic mutations with high precision is one of the major challenges in prediction of high-risk liver-cancer patients. In the past, number of mutation calling techniques have been developed that include MuTect2, MuSE, Varscan2, and SomaticSniper. In this study, an attempt has been made to benchmark potential of these techniques in predicting prognostic biomarkers for liver cancer. Initially, we extracted somatic mutations in liver-cancer patients using VCF and MAF files from the cancer genome atlas. In terms of size, the MAF files are 42 times smaller than VCF files and containing only high-quality somatic mutations. Further, machine learning based models have been developed for predicting high-risk cancer patients using mutations obtain from different techniques. The performance of different techniques and data files have been compared based on their potential to discriminate high and low risk liver-cancer patients. Finally, univariate survival analysis revealed the prognostic role of highly mutated genes. Based on correlation analysis, we selected 80 genes negatively associated with the overall survival of the liver cancer patients. Single-gene based analysis showed that MuTect2 technique based MAF file has achieved maximum HRLAMC3 9.25 with p-value 1.78E-06. Further, we developed various prediction models using selected genes for each technique, and the results indicate that MuTect2 technique based VCF files outperform all other methods with maximum AUROC of 0.72 and HR 4.50 (p-value 3.83E-15). Eventually, VCF file generated using MuTect2 technique performs better among other mutation calling techniques to explore the prognostic potential of mutations in liver cancer. We hope that our findings will provide a useful and comprehensive comparison of various mutation calling techniques for the prognostic analysis of cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Myelin is a natural and dynamic multilamellar membrane structure that continues to be of significant biological and neurological interest, especially with respect to its biosynthesis and assembly during its normal formation, maintenance, and pathological breakdown. To explore the usefulness of neutron diffraction in the structural analysis of myelin, we investigated the use of in vivo labeling by metabolically incorporating non-toxic levels of deuterium (2H; D) via drinking water into a pregnant dam (D-dam) and her developing embryos. All of the mice were sacrificed when the pups (D-pups) were 55 days old. Myelinated sciatic nerves were dissected, fixed in glutaraldehyde and examined by neutron diffraction. Parallel samples that were unfixed (trigeminal nerves) were frozen for mass spectrometry (MS). The diffraction patterns of the nerves from deuterium-fed mice (D-mice) vs. the controls (H-mice) had major differences in the intensities of the Bragg peaks but no appreciable differences in myelin periodicity. Neutron scattering density profiles showed an appreciable increase in density at the center of the lipid-rich membrane bilayer. This increase was greater in D-pups than in D-dam, and its localization was consistent with deuteration of lipid hydrocarbon, which predominates over transmembrane protein in myelin. MS analysis of the lipids isolated from the trigeminal nerves demonstrated that in the pups the percentage of lipids that had one or more deuterium atoms was uniformly high across lipid species (97.6% {+/-} 2.0%), whereas in the mother the lipids were substantially less deuterated (60.6% {+/-} 26.4%) with levels varying among lipid species and subspecies. The mass distribution pattern of deuterium-containing isotopologues indicated the fraction (in %) of each lipid (sub-)species having one or more deuteriums incorporated: in the D-pups, the pattern was always bell-shaped, and the average number of D atoms ranged from a low of [~]4 in fatty acid to a high of [~]9 in cerebroside. By contrast, in D-dam most lipids had more complex, overlapping distributions that were weighted toward a lower average number of deuteriums, which ranged from a low of [~]3-4 in fatty acid and in one species of sulfatide to a high of 6-7 in cerebroside and sphingomyelin. The consistently high level of deuteration in D-pups can be attributed to their de novo lipogenesis during gestation and rapid, postnatal myelination. The widely varying levels of deuteration in D-dam, by contrast, likely depends on the relative metabolic stability of the particular lipid species during myelin maintenance. Our current findings demonstrate that stably-incorporated D label can be detected and localized using neutron diffraction in a complex tissue such as myelin; and moreover, that MS can be used to screen a broad range of deuterated lipid species to monitor differential rates of lipid turnover. In addition to helping to develop a comprehensive understanding of the de novo synthesis and turnover of specific lipids in normal and abnormal myelin, our results also suggest application to studies on myelin proteins (which constitute only 20-30% by dry mass of the myelin, vs. 70-80% for lipid), as well as more broadly to the molecular constituents of other biological tissues.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in late 2021 and is characterised by multiple spike mutations across all spike domains. Here we show that Omicron BA.1 has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta, and confers very significant evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralisation. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D cultures replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However, in lower airway organoids, Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. We noted that despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the spike protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron virions compared to Delta virions. We mapped the replication differences between the variants to entry efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry assays. The defect for Omicron PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta entry to a greater extent as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently utilises the cellular protease TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via plasma membrane fusion. Instead, we demonstrate that Omicron spike has greater dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway requiring the activity of endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to utilise TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall, Omicron appears to have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies whilst maintaining sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron has shifted cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in cells found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts, with implications for altered pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Motor adaptation is crucial for performing accurate movements in a changing environment and relies on the cerebellum. Although cerebellar involvement has been well characterized, the neurochemical changes in the cerebellum underpinning human motor adaptation remain unknown.\n\nWe used a novel Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) technique to measure changes in the inhibitory neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human cerebellum during visuomotor adaptation. Participants used their right hand to adapt to a rotated cursor in the scanner, compared with a control task requiring no adaptation. We spatially resolved adaptation-driven GABA changes at the cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar cortex in the left and the right cerebellar hemisphere independently and found that simple right-hand movements increase GABA in the right cerebellar nuclei and decreases GABA in the left. When isolating adaptation-driven GABA changes, we found an increase in GABA in the left cerebellar nuclei and decrease in GABA in the right cerebellar nuclei. Early adaptation-driven GABA change in the right cerebellar nuclei correlated with adaptation performance: Participants showing greater GABA decrease adapted better, suggesting early GABA change is behaviourally relevant. Early GABA change also correlated with functional connectivity change in a cerebellar network: Participants showing greater decreases in GABA showed greater strength increases in cerebellar network connectivity. Results were specific to GABA, to adaptation and to the cerebellar network.\n\nThis study provides first evidence for plastic changes in cerebellar neurochemistry during motor adaptation. Characterising these naturally occurring neurochemical changes may provide a basis for developing therapeutic interventions to facilitate human motor adaptation.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite motor adaptation being fundamental to maintaining accurate movements, its neurochemical basis remains poorly understood, perhaps because measuring neurochemicals in the human cerebellum is technically challenging. Using a novel magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method, this study provides evidence for GABA changes in the left and right cerebellar nuclei driven by both simple movement and motor adaptation. The adaptation-driven GABA change in the right cerebellar nuclei correlated with adaptation performance, and with functional connectivity change in a cerebellar network. These results show the first evidence for plastic changes in cerebellar neurochemistry during a cerebellar learning task.

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, super-resolution microscopy has seen a tremendous development in speed and resolution, but for most of its methods, there exists a remarkable gap between lateral and axial resolution. Similar to conventional optical microscopy, the axial resolution is by a factor three to five worse than the lateral resolution. One recently developed method to close this gap is metal-induced energy transfer (MIET) imaging which achieves an axial resolution down to nanometers. It exploits the distance dependent quenching of fluorescence when a fluorescent molecule is brought close to a metal surface. In the present manuscript, we combine the extreme axial resolution of MIET imaging with the extraordinary lateral resolution of single-molecule localization microscopy, in particular with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). This combination allows us to achieve isotropic three-dimensional super-resolution imaging of sub-cellular structures. Moreover, we employed spectral demixing for implementing dualcolor MIET-dSTORM that allows us to image and co-localize, in three dimensions, two different cellular structures simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "A major physiological role of hERG1 (human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene) potassium channels is to repolarize cardiac action potentials. Two isoforms, hERG1a and hERG1b, associate to form the native cardiac IKr current in vivo. Inherited mutations in hERG1a or hERG1b cause prolonged cardiac repolarization, Long QT Syndrome and sudden death arrhythmia. hERG1a subunits assemble with and enhance the number of hERG1b subunits at the plasma membrane, but the mechanism for the increase in hERG1b by hERG1a is not well understood. Here, we report that the hERG1a N-terminal PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain-N-linker region expressed in trans with hERG1b markedly increased hERG1b currents and increased biotin-labelled hERG1b protein at the membrane surface. hERG1b channels with a deletion of the 1b domain did not have a measurable increase in current or biotinylated protein when co-expressed with hERG1a PAS domain-N-linker regions indicating that the 1b domain was required for the increase in hERG1b. Using a biochemical pull-down interaction assay and a FRET hybridization experiment, we detected a direct interaction between the hERG1a PAS domain-N-linker region and the hERG1b N-terminal 1b domain. Using engineered deletions and alanine mutagenesis, we identified a short span of amino acids at positions 216-220 within the hERG1a N-linker region that were necessary for the upregulation of hERG1b. Taken together, we propose that direct structural interactions between the hERG1a N-linker region and the hERG1b N-terminal 1b domain increase hERG1b at the plasma membrane. Mechanisms that enhance hERG1b current would be anticipated to shorten action potentials, which could be anti-arrhythmic, and may point toward hERG1b or the hERG1a N-linker as molecular targets for therapy for Long QT syndrome.\n\nSignificance StatementPotassium (K) ion channels help to control the membrane voltage in cardiac cells and are responsible for maintaining the normal rhythm of the heart. A decrease in the number of K channels causes cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. One K channel (KCNH2b, hERG1b) weakly forms channels at the cell membrane. Here we describe a new mechanism for upregulation of hERG1b. An N-terminal domain of a related K channel (KCNH2a, hERG1a), expressed in trans as a separate piece, interacts with hERG1b and increases the number of hERG1b channels at the membrane. A loss of hERG channels is pro-arrhythmic and an increase in hERG channels is considered anti-arrhythmic, thus the hERG1a N-terminal domain is a potential therapeutic for cardiac arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "Theories of attention hypothesize the existence of an \"attentional\" or \"target\" template that contains task-relevant information in memory when searching for an object. The target template contributes to visual search by directing visual attention towards potential targets and serving as a decisional boundary for target identification. However, debate still exists regarding how template information is stored in the human brain. Here, we conducted a pattern-based fMRI study to assess how template information is encoded to optimize target-match decisions during visual search. To ensure that match decisions reflect visual search demands, we used a visual search paradigm in which all distractors were linearly separable but highly similar to the target and were known to shift the target representation away from the distractor features (Yu & Geng, 2019). In a separate match-to-sample probe task, we measured the target representation used for match decisions across two resting state networks that have long been hypothesized to maintain and control target information: the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and the visual network (VisN). Our results showed that lateral prefrontal cortex in FPCN maintained the context-dependent \"off-veridical\" template; in contrast, VisN encoded a veridical copy of the target feature during match decisions. By using behavioral drift diffusion modeling, we verified that the decision criterion during visual search and the probe task relied on a common biased target template. Taken together, our results suggest that sensory-veridical information is transformed in lateral prefrontal cortex into an adaptive code of target-relevant information that optimizes decision processes during visual search.",

    "abstract": "In people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), bacterial infections involving the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. P. aeruginosa uses a cell-cell signaling mechanism called quorum sensing (QS) to regulate many virulence functions. One type of QS consists of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals produced by LuxI-type signal synthases, which bind a cognate LuxR-type transcription factor. In laboratory strains and conditions, P. aeruginosa employs two AHL synthase/receptor pairs arranged in a hierarchy, with the LasI/R system controlling the RhlI/R system and many downstream virulence factors. However, P. aeruginosa isolates with inactivating mutations in lasR are frequently isolated from chronic CF infections. We and others have shown that these isolates frequently use RhlR as the primary QS regulator. RhlR is rarely mutated in CF and environmental settings. We were interested if there were reproducible genetic characteristics of these isolates and if there was a central group of genes regulated by RhlR in all isolates. We examined five isolates and found signatures of adaptation common to CF isolates. We did not identify a common genetic mechanism to explain the switch from Las-to Rhl-dominated QS. We describe a core RhlR regulon encompassing 20 genes encoding 7 products. These results suggest a key group of QS-regulated factors important for pathogenesis of chronic infection, and position RhlR as a target for anti-QS therapeutics. Our work underscores the need to sample a diversity of isolates to understanding QS beyond what has been described in laboratory strains.",

Finally, we investigated the clinical effect of ALA-PDT in treating cutaneous granuloma caused by drug-resistant M. marinum.\n\nMaterials and methodsWe isolated total 9 strains of M. marinum from patients and confirmed by morphological and molecular approaches. The strains were identified by anti-mycobacterial susceptibility.

Therapeutic efficacy was further assessed in patients with cutaneous granuloma caused by drug-resistant M. marinum.\n\nResultsWe demonstrated that the ALA-PDT directly killed M. marinum in vitro. The paws cutaneous lesions of mice caused by M. marinum were fully recovered 2 weeks after ALA-PDT treatment. However, there was no significant difference for immune cells in peripheral blood before and after ALA-PDT therapy. Finally, ALA-PDT proved to be effective in treat two patients with cutaneous infection caused by drug-resistant M. marinum.\n\nConclusionsThe results suggest that ALA-PDT is effective in treating M. marinum cutaneous infections by killing M. marinum directly, independent of systemic immune responses.

    "abstract": "Protein quality control (PQC) degrons are short protein segments that target misfolded proteins for proteasomal degradation, and thus protect cells against the accumulation of potentially toxic non-native proteins. Studies have shown that PQC degrons are hydrophobic and rarely contain negatively charged residues, features which are shared with chaperone-binding regions. Here we explore the notion that chaperone-binding regions may function as PQC degrons. When directly tested, we found that a canonical Hsp70-binding motif (the APPY peptide) functioned as a dose-dependent PQC degron both in yeast and in human cells. In yeast, Hsp70, Hsp110, Fes1, and the E3 Ubr1 target the APPY degron. Screening revealed that the sequence space within the chaperone-binding region of APPY that is compatible with degron function is vast. We find that the number of exposed Hsp70-binding sites in the yeast proteome correlates with a reduced protein abundance and half-life. Our results suggest that when protein folding fails, chaperone-binding sites may operate as PQC degrons, and PQC-linked degradation therefore overlaps in specificity with chaperone binding. This sheds new light on how the PQC system has evolved to exploit the intrinsic capacity of chaperones to recognize misfolded proteins, thereby placing them at the nexus of protein folding and degradation.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is broadly accepted that misfolded proteins are often rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but how cells specifically recognize this immensely diverse group of proteins is largely unknown. Here we show that upon uncoupling of protein folding from protein degradation, a canonical chaperone-binding motif doubles as a degradation signal (degron), and that within the context of a Hsp70-binding region, many sequences are compatible with degron function. We find that degradation is correlated with the number of Hsp70-binding sites within a protein, and that the number of exposed Hsp70-binding sites in the yeast proteome correlates with more rapid degradation.",

    "abstract": "Phytohormone gibberellin (GA) is an important plant signaling molecule that regulates plant growth and defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. To date, the molecular mechanism of the plant responses to viral infection mediated by GA is still undetermined. DELLA is a repressor of GA signaling and is recognized by the F-box protein, a component of the SCFSLY1/GID2 complex. The recognized DELLA is degraded by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome, leading to the activation of the GA signaling. Here, we report that ageratum leaf curl Sichuan virus (ALCScV)-infected N. benthamiana plants showed dwarfing symptom and abnormal flower development. The infection of ALCScV alters the expressions of GA pathway-related genes and decreases the content of endogenous GA significantly in N. benthamiana. Further, ALCScV-encoded C4 protein interacts with the DELLA protein NbGAI, and interferes with the interaction between NbGAI and NbGID2 to prevent the degradation of NbGAI, leading to the inhibition of the GA signaling pathway. Silencing of NbGAI or exogenous GA3 treatment significantly reduces viral accumulation and disease symptoms in N. benthamiana plants. The same results were proved by the experiments with C4 protein encoded by tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV). Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism of geminivirus C4 proteins controling virus infection and disease symptom development through interfering GA signaling pathway.\n\nAuthor SummaryGibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that are essential for many developmental processes in plants. It has indicated that plant virus infection can induce abnormal flower development and influence GA pathway resulting the plant dwarfing symptom, but the underlying mechanisms is still not well described. Here, we demonstrate that geminivirus - encoded C4 protein regulates the GA signaling pathway to promote viral accumulation and disease symptom development. Through directly interacting with NbGAI, the C4 protein interferes with the interaction between NbGAI and NbGID2, which inhibits the degradation of NbGAI. As a result, the GA signaling pathway is blocked, and the infected plants display symptoms of typical dwarfing and delayed flowering. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which geminivirus C4 proteins influence viral pathogenicity via interfering the GA signaling pathway, and provide new insights into the interaction between virus and host.",

    "abstract": "O_LINatural history collections (NHCs) are invaluable resources for understanding biotic response to global change. Museums around the world are currently imaging specimens, capturing specimen data, and making them freely available online. In parallel to the digitisation effort, there have been great advancements in computer vision (CV): the computer trained automated recognition/detection, and measurement of features in digital images. Applying CV to digitised NHCs has the potential to greatly accelerate the use of NHCs for biotic response to global change research. In this paper, we apply CV to a very large, digitised collection to test hypotheses in an established area of biotic response to climate change research: temperature-size responses.\nC_LIO_LIWe develop a CV pipeline (Mothra) and apply it to the NHM iCollections of British butterflies (>180,000 specimens). Mothra automatically detects the specimen in the image, sets the scale, measures wing features (e.g., forewing length), determines the orientation of the specimen (pinned ventrally or dorsally), and identifies the sex. We pair these measurements and meta-data with temperature records to test how adult size varies with temperature during the immature stages of species and to assess patterns of sexual-size dimorphism across species and families.\nC_LIO_LIMothra accurately measures the forewing lengths of butterfly specimens and compared to manual baseline measurements, Mothra accurately determines sex and forewing lengths of butterfly specimens. Females are the larger sex in most species and an increase in adult body size with warm monthly temperatures during the late larval stages is the most common temperature size response. These results confirm suspected patterns and support hypotheses based on recent studies using a smaller dataset of manually measured specimens.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that CV can be a powerful tool to efficiently and accurately extract phenotypic data from a very large collection of digital NHCs. In the future, CV will become widely applied to digital NHC collections to advance ecological and evolutionary research and to accelerate the use of NHCs for biotic response to global change research.\nC_LI",

This paper describes how Bayesian inference is used to pool the information contained in different data sets (point observations, non-invasive genetics, known mortalities) for the estimation of the number of territories occupied by family packs and pairs. The output of the assessment model is a joint probability distribution, which describes current knowledge about the number of wolves within each territory. The joint distribution can be used to derive probability distributions for the total number of wolves in all territories and for the pack status within each territory. Most of the data set comprises of both voluntary-provided point observations and DNA samples provided by volunteers and research personnel. The new method reduces the role of expert judgement in the assessment process, providing increased transparency and repeatability.",

We also show the presence of topological defects such as dislocations (pentagon-heptagon disclination pairs) and Stone-Wales quadrupoles, and discuss how these defects were organized in the nest, thereby restoring order.

    "abstract": "Early-life environment is known to affect later-life health and disease, which could be mediated by the early-life programming of telomere length, a key hallmark of ageing. According to the fetal programming of telomere biology hypothesis, variation in prenatal exposure to hormones is likely to influence telomere length. Yet the contribution of key metabolic hormones, i.e. thyroid hormones (THs), has been largely ignored. We recently showed that in contrast to predictions, exposure to elevated prenatal THs increased postnatal telomere length in wild collared flycatchers, but the generality of such effect, its underlying proximate mechanisms and consequences on survival have not been investigated. We therefore conducted a comprehensive study evaluating the impact of THs on potential drivers of telomere dynamics (growth, post-natal THs, mitochondria and oxidative stress), telomere length and medium-term survival using wild great tits as a model system. While prenatal THs did not significantly affect telomere length a week after hatching (i.e. day 7), they influenced postnatal telomere shortening (i.e. shorter telomeres at day 14 and the following winter) but not apparent survival. Circulating THs, mitochondrial density or oxidative stress biomarkers were not significantly influenced, whereas TH-supplemented group showed accelerated growth, which may explain the observed delayed effect on telomeres. We discuss several alternative hypotheses that may explain the contrast with our previous findings in flycatchers. Given that shorter telomeres in early life tend to be carried until adulthood and are often associated with decreased survival prospects, the effects of prenatal THs on telomeres may have long-lasting effects on senescence.",

    "abstract": "All species within the conch snail family Strombidae possess large camera-type eyes that are surprisingly well-developed compared to those found in most other gastropods. Although these eyes are known to be structurally complex, very little research on their visual function has been conducted. Here, we use isoluminant expanding visual stimuli to measure the spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of a strombid, Conomurex luhuanus. Using these stimuli, we show that this species responds to objects as small as 1.06{degrees} in its visual field. We also show that C. luhuanus responds to Michelson contrasts of 0.07, a low contrast sensitivity between object and background. The defensive withdrawal response elicited by visual stimuli of such small angular size and low contrast suggests that conch snails may use spatial vision for the early detection of potential predators. We support these findings with morphological estimations of spatial resolution of 1.04 {+/-} 0.14{degrees}. These anatomical data therefore agree with the behavioural measures and highlight the benefits of integrating morphological and behavioural approaches in animal vision studies. Furthermore, using contemporary imaging techniques including serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that C. luhuanus have more complex retinas, in terms of cell type diversity, than previous studies of the group have discovered using TEM alone. We found the C. luhuanus retina is comprised of six cell types, including a newly identified ganglion cell and accessory photoreceptor, rather than the previously described four cell types.\n\nSummary statementBehavioural trials indicate the eyes of conch snail species Conomurex luhuanus provide high-resolution spatial vision, and morphological examination reveals the retina contains more cell types than those of other gastropods.",

    "abstract": "Control of gene expression in specific tissues and/or at certain stages of development allows the study and manipulation of gene function with high precision. Site-specific genome recombination by the Flippase (FLP) and Cre enzymes has proven particularly relevant. Joint efforts of many research groups have led to the creation of efficient FLP and Cre drivers to regulate gene expression in a variety of tissues in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we extend this toolkit by the addition of FLP lines that drive recombination specifically in distal tip cells, the somatic gonad, coelomocytes and the epithelial P lineage. In some cases, recombination-mediated gene knockouts do not completely deplete protein levels due to persistence of long-lived proteins. To overcome this, we developed a spatiotemporally regulated degradation system for GFP fusion proteins (GFPdeg) based on FLP-mediated recombination. Using two stable nuclear pore proteins, MEL-28/ELYS and NPP-2/NUP85 as examples, we report the benefit of combining tissue-specific gene knockout and protein degradation to achieve complete protein depletion. We also demonstrate that FLP-mediated recombination can be utilized to identify transcriptomes in a C. elegans tissue of interest. We have adapted RNA polymerase DamID (RAPID) for the FLP toolbox and by focusing on a well-characterized tissue, the hypodermis, we show that the vast majority of genes identified by RAPID are known to be expressed in this tissue. These tools allow combining FLP activity for simultaneous gene inactivation and transcriptomic profiling, thus enabling the inquiry of gene function in various complex biological processes.",

In this model, confidence reflects a subjects estimate of the reliability of their decision. The quality of this estimate is limited by the subjects uncertainty about the uncertainty of the variable that informs their decision (\"meta-uncertainty\"). This model provides an accurate account of choice-confidence data across a broad range of perceptual and cognitive tasks, revealing that meta-uncertainty varies across subjects, is stable over time, generalizes across some domains, and can be manipulated experimentally.

    "abstract": "In the context of untargeted metabolomics, molecular networking is a popular and efficient tool which organizes and simplifies mass spectrometry fragmentation data (LC-MS/MS), by clustering ions based on a cosine similarity score. However, the nature of the ion species is rarely taken into account, causing redundancy as a single compound may be present in different forms throughout the network. Taking advantage of the presence of such redundant ions, we developed a new method named MolNotator. Using the different ion species produced by a molecule during ionization (adducts, dimers, trimers, in-source fragments), a predicted molecule node (or neutral node) is created by triangulation, and ultimately computing the associated molecules calculated mass. These neutral nodes provide researchers with several advantages. Firstly, each molecule is then represented in its ionization context, connected to all produced ions and indirectly to some coeluted compounds, thereby also highlighting unexpected widely present adduct species. Secondly, the predicted neutrals serve as anchors to merge the complementary positive and negative ionization modes into a single network. Lastly, the dereplication is improved by the use of all available ions connected to the neutral nodes, and the computed molecular masses can be used for exact mass dereplication. MolNotator is available as a Python library and was validated using the lichen database spectra acquired on an Orbitrap, computing neutral molecules for >90% of the 156 molecules in the dataset. By focusing on actual molecules instead of ions, MolNotator greatly facilitates the selection of molecules of interest.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473622v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@730ecaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d012e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@187a1e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@195c53f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy and continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that may escape vaccine-induced immune responses highlight the urgent need for effective COVID-19 therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies used in the clinic have varying efficacies against distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants; thus, there is considerable interest in engineered ACE2 peptides with augmented binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These could have therapeutic benefit against multiple viral variants. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show how three amino acid substitutions in an engineered soluble ACE2 peptide (sACE22.v2.4-IgG1) markedly increase affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. We demonstrate high binding affinity to S protein of the early SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 isolate and also to multiple variants of concern: B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 variants. In humanized K18-hACE2 mice, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of sACE22.v2.4-IgG1 peptide prevented acute lung vascular endothelial injury and lung edema (essential features of ARDS) and significantly improved survival after infection by SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 as well as P.1 variant of concern. These studies demonstrate for the first time broad efficacy in vivo of an ACE2 decoy peptide against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and point to its therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is increasing both the average ambient temperature and the frequency and severity of heat waves. While direct mortality induced by heat waves is increasingly reported, sub-lethal effects are also likely to impact wild populations. We hypothesized that accelerated ageing could be a cost of being exposed to higher ambient temperature, especially in early-life when thermoregulatory capacities are not fully developed. We tested this hypothesis in wild great tit (Parus major) by experimentally increasing nest box temperature by ca. 2{degrees}C during postnatal growth and measuring telomere length, a biomarker of cellular ageing predictive of survival prospects in many bird species. While increasing early-life temperature does not affect growth or survival to fledging, it accelerates telomere shortening and reduces medium-term survival from 34% to 19%. Heat-induced telomere shortening was not explained by oxidative stress, but more likely by an increase in energy demand (i.e. higher thyroid hormones levels, increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor, increased mitochondrial density) leading to a reduction in telomere maintenance mechanisms (i.e. decrease in the gene expression of telomerase and protective shelterin). Our results thus suggest that climate warming can affect ageing rate in wild birds, with potential impact on population dynamics and persistence.\n\nSignificance statementStressful environmental conditions are known to accelerate cellular ageing, especially when experienced early in life. One unexplored avenue through which climate warming might affect wild animal populations is accelerated ageing. Here we show that increasing nest temperature by ca. 2{degrees}C during postnatal growth in a wild bird species can impact numerous physiological pathways and medium-term survival. Notably, artificially warming nests accelerates the shortening of telomeres, which are the protective end-caps of chromosomes considered as a hallmark of ageing. We thus suggest that warm ambient temperatures might accelerate ageing in wild animals, which can potentially impact population dynamics and extinction risk in the face of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytic responses by effector cells to antibody or complement-opsonised viruses have been recognized to play a key role in anti-viral immunity. These include antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis mediated via Fc-receptors, phagocytosis mediated by classically activated complement-fixing IgM or IgG1 antibodies and antibody independent phagocytosis mediated via direct opsonisation of viruses by complement products activated via the mannose-binding lectin pathway. Limited data suggest these phagocytic responses by effector cells may contribute to the immunological and inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, their development and clinical significance remain to be fully elucidated. In this cohort of 62 patients, acutely ill individuals were shown to mount phagocytic responses to autologous plasma-opsonised SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-coated microbeads as early as 10 days post symptom onset. Heat inactivation of the plasma prior to use as an opsonin caused 77-95% abrogation of the phagocytic response, and pre-blocking of Fc-receptors on the effector cells showed only 18-60% inhibition. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can provoke early phagocytosis, which is primarily driven by heat labile components, likely activated complements, with variable contribution from anti-Spike antibodies. During convalescence, phagocytic responses correlated significantly with anti-Spike IgG titers. Older patients and patients with severe disease had significantly higher phagocytosis and neutralisation functions when compared to younger patients or patients with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. A longitudinal study of a subset of these patients over 12 months showed preservation of phagocytic and neutralisation functions in all patients, despite a drop in the endpoint antibody titers by more than 90%. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance showed a significant increase in the affinity of the anti-Spike antibodies over time correlating with the maintenance of both the phagocytic and neutralisation functions suggesting that improvement in the antibody quality over the 12 months contributed to the retention of effector functions.\n\nAuthor SummaryLimited data suggest antibody dependent effector functions including phagocytosis may contribute to the immunological and inflammatory responses in SARS CoV-2 infection, however, their development, maintenance, and clinical significance remain unknown. In this study we show: O_LIPatients with acute SARS CoV-2 infection can mount phagocytic responses as early as 10 days post symptom onset and these responses were primarily driven by heat labile components of the autologous plasma. These results indicate that the current approach of studying phagocytosis using purified or monoclonal antibodies does not recapitulate contribution by all components in the plasma.\nC_LIO_LIIn convalescent patients, high phagocytic responses significantly correlated with increasing age, increasing disease severity, high neutralisation functions and high anti-Spike antibody titers, particularly IgG1.\nC_LIO_LILongitudinal study of convalescent patients over a 12-month period showed maintenance of phagocytic and neutralisation functions, despite a drop in the anti-Spike endpoint antibody titers by more than 90%. However, we found significant increase in the affinity of the anti-Spike antibodies over the 12-month period and these correlated with the maintenance of functions suggesting that improvement in the antibody quality over time contributed to the retention of effector functions. Clinically, measuring antibody titers in sera but not the quality of antibodies is considered a gold standard indicator of immune protection following SARS-CoV 2 infection or vaccination. Our results challenge this notion and recommends change in the current clinical practice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines generate potent neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, the principal antigenic target of these vaccines, has raised concerns over the neutralizing activity of vaccine-induced antibody responses. The Omicron variant, which emerged in November 2021, consists of over 30 mutations within the spike protein. Here, we used an authentic live virus neutralization assay to examine the neutralizing activity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant against mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses. Following the 2nd dose, we observed a 30-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against the omicron variant. Through six months after the 2nd dose, none of the sera from naive vaccinated subjects showed neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant. In contrast, recovered vaccinated individuals showed a 22-fold reduction with more than half of the subjects retaining neutralizing antibody responses. Following a booster shot (3rd dose), we observed a 14-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against the omicron variant and over 90% of boosted subjects showed neutralizing activity against the omicron variant. These findings show that a 3rd dose is required to provide robust neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron variant.",

    "abstract": "Memory B cells (MBCs) represent a second layer of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. Whether MBCs elicited by mRNA vaccines can recognize the Omicron variant is of major concern. We used bio-layer interferometry to assess the affinity against the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of Omicron spike of 313 naturally expressed monoclonal IgG that were previously tested for affinity and neutralization against VOC prior to Omicron. We report here that Omicron evades recognition from a larger fraction of these antibodies than any of the previous VOCs. Additionally, whereas 30% of these antibodies retained high affinity against Omicron-RBD, our analysis suggest that Omicron specifically evades antibodies displaying potent neutralizing activity against the D614G and Beta variant viruses.

    "abstract": "In addition to vaccines, there is an urgent need for supplemental antiviral therapeutics to dampen the persistent COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is responsible for the proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as virus priming for cell entry, appears as a rational therapeutic target for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, selective inhibitors of TMPRSS2 represent potential tools for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we tested the inhibitory capacities of the human milk glycoprotein lactoferrin and its N-terminal peptide pLF1, which we identified as inhibitors of plasminogen, a serine protease homologous to TMPRSS2. In vitro proteolysis assays revealed that, unlike full-length lactoferrin, pLF1 significantly inhibited the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2. pLF1 inhibited both the proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the SARS-CoV-2 infection of simian Vero cells. Because lactoferrin is a natural product and several biologically active peptides, such as the N-terminally derived lactoferricins, are produced naturally by pepsin-mediated digestion, natural or synthetic peptides from lactoferrin represent well-achievable candidates for supporting prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "mRNA based vaccines against COVID-19 have proven most successful at keeping the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at bay in many countries. Recently, there is an increased interest in heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategies for COVID-19 to maintain antibody response for the control of continuously emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) and to overcome other obstacles such as supply shortage, costs and reduced safety issues or inadequate induced immune-response. In this study, we investigate the antibody responses induced by heterologous prime-boost with vaccines based on mRNA and virus-like particles (VLPs). The VLP-based mCuMVTT-RBM vaccine candidate and the approved mRNA-1273 vaccine were used for this purpose. We find that homologous prime boost regimens with either mRNA or VLP induced high levels of high avidity antibodies. Optimal antibody responses were, however, induced by heterologous regimens both for priming with mRNA and boosting with VLP and vice versa, priming with VLP and boosting with mRNA. Thus, heterologous prime boost strategies may be able to optimize efficacy and economics of novel vaccine strategies.",

    "abstract": "Human plasminogen (hPg)-binding M-protein (PAM), a major virulence factor of Pattern D Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), is the primary receptor responsible for binding and activating hPg. PAM is covalently bound to the cell wall (CW) through cell membrane (CM)-resident sortase A (SrtA)-catalyzed cleavage of the PAM-proximal C-terminal LPST{downarrow}-GEAA motif present immediately upstream of its transmembrane domain (TMD), and subsequent transpeptidation to the CW. These steps expose the N-terminus of PAM to the extracellular milieu (EM) to interact with PAM ligands, e.g., hPg. Previously, we found that inactivation of SrtA showed little reduction in functional binding of PAM to hPg, indicating that PAM retained in the cell membrane (CM) by the TMD nonetheless exposed its N-terminus to the EM. In the current study, we assessed the effects of mutating the Thr4 (P1) residue of the SrtA-cleavage site in PAM (Thr355 in PAM) to delay PAM in the CM in the presence of SrtA. Using rSrtA in vitro, LPSYGEAA and LPSWGEAA peptides were shown to have low activities, while LPSTGEAA had the highest activity. Isolated CM fractions of AP53/{Delta}SrtA cells showed that LPSYGEAA and LPSWGEAA peptides were cleaved at substantially faster rates than LPSTGEAA, even in CMs with an AP53/{Delta}SrtA/PAM[T355Y] double mutation, but the transpeptidation step did not occur. These results implicate another CM-resident enzyme that cleaves LPSYGEAA and LPSWGEAA motifs, most likely LPXTGase, but cannot catalyze the transpeptidation step. We conclude that the natural P1 (Thr) of the SrtA cleavage site has evolved to dampen PAM from nonfunctional cleavage by LPXTGase.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe show in this study that functional cleavage of the sortase A (SrtA) cleavage signal for M-protein, LPST*GEAA, in the Gram+ cell membrane, which allows transpeptidation of M-protein to the cell wall, as opposed to non-functional cleavage by the highly active cell membrane nonribosomal enzyme, LPXTGase, at the downstream G-residue, is highly dependent on the presence of T at position 4. From our studies, we conclude that Streptococcus pyogenes has evolved in a manner that maximized T at this position so that SrtA preferentially cleaved the sorting signal in order that the virulence factor, M-protein, was stabilized on the cell surface through covalent attachment to the cell wall.",

    "abstract": "Sponge microbiomes contribute to host health, nutrition, and defense through the production of secondary metabolites. Chlamydiae, a phylum of obligate intracellular bacteria ranging from animal pathogens to endosymbionts of microbial eukaryotes, are frequently found associated with sponges. However, sponge-associated chlamydial diversity has not yet been investigated at the genomic level and host-interactions remain thus far unexplored. Here, we sequenced the microbiomes of three sponge species and found high, though variable, Chlamydiae relative abundances of up to 21.2% of bacterial diversity. Using genome-resolved metagenomics 18 high-quality sponge-associated chlamydial genomes were reconstructed, covering four chlamydial families. Among these, Sorochlamydiaceae shares a common ancestor with Chlamydiaceae animal pathogens, suggesting long-term co-evolution with animals. Sponge-associated chlamydiae genomes mostly resembled environmental chlamydial endosymbionts, but not pathogens, and encoded genes for degrading diverse compounds associated with sponges, such as taurine. Unexpectedly, we identified widespread genetic potential for secondary metabolite biosynthesis across Chlamydiae, which may represent an explored reservoir of novel natural products. This finding suggests that chlamydiae may partake in defensive symbioses and that secondary metabolites play a wider role in mediating intracellular interactions. Furthermore, sponge-associated chlamydiae relatives were found in other marine invertebrates, pointing towards wider impacts of this phylum on marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Asian rice is one of the most important crops because it is a staple food for almost half of the worlds population. Rice has two subspecies, JAPONICA and INDICA. To have production of rice keep pace with a growing world population, it is anticipated that the use of fertilizers will also need to increase, which may cause environmental damage through runoff impacts. An alternative strategy to increase crop yield is the use of plant growth promoting bacteria. Thousands of microbial species can exist in association with plant roots and shoots, and some are critical to the plants survival. We isolated 140 bacteria from rice and investigated whether JAPONICA and INDICA rice subspecies were positively influenced by these isolates. The bacterial isolates were screened for their ability to solubilize phosphate, a known plant growth promoting characteristic, and 25 isolates were selected for further analysis. These 25 phosphate solubilizing isolates were also able to produce other potentially growth-promoting factors. Five of the most promising bacterial isolates were chosen for whole genome sequencing. Four of these bacteria, isolates related to Pseudomonas mosselii, Microvirga sp., Paenibacillus rigui and Paenibacillus graminis, improved root and shoot growth, root to shoot ratio, and increased root dry weights of JAPONICA plants but had no effect on growth and development of INDICA plants. This indicates that while bacteria have several known plant growth promoting functions, their effects on growth parameters can be plant subspecies dependent and suggest close relationships between plants and their microbial partners.",

Although there have been suggestions that squalene could be involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, functionally and evolutionarily related to polycyclic triterpenes, evidence of this  squalene route in nature was lacking. We demonstrate that planctomycetes synthesize C30 carotenoids via squalene and that this  squalene route is widely distributed in Bacteria. We also investigated the functional roles of hopanoids and carotenoids in Planctomycetes and show that their protective functions under stress conditions are complementary. Our evolutionary analyses suggest that the C30 carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is the most ancestral, with a potential origin in Firmicutes or Planctomycetes. In addition, we propose an evolutionary scenario to explain the diversification of the different carotenoid and squalene pathways. Together, these results improve the evolutionary contextualization of these molecules. Likewise, the widespread occurrence of the squalene route in bacteria increases the functional repertoire of squalene.",

We developed a high-throughput neutralization assay for Omicron SARS-CoV-2 by engineering the Omicron spike gene into an mNeonGreen USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 (isolated in January 2020). Using this assay, we determined the neutralization titers of patient sera collected at 1- or 6-months after infection with non-Omicron SARS-CoV-2. From 1- to 6-month post-infection, the neutralization titers against USA-WA1/2020 decreased from 601 to 142 (a 4.2-fold reduction), while the neutralization titers against Omicron-spike SARS-CoV-2 remained low at 38 and 32, respectively. Thus, at 1- and 6-months after non-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection, the neutralization titers against Omicron were 15.8- and 4.4-fold lower than those against USA-WA1/2020, respectively.

    "abstract": "Functional kidney organoids have the potential to be used in implantable kidney grafts for patients with end-stage kidney disease, because they have been shown to self-organize from induced pluripotent stem cells into most important renal structures. To date, however, long-term kidney organoid culture has not succeeded, as nephrons lose their phenotype after approximately 25 days. Furthermore, the renal structures remain immature with diminishing endothelial networks with low connectivity and limited organoid invasion. We hypothesized that introducing long-term culture at physiological hypoxia, rather than the normally applied non-physiological, hyperoxic 21% O2, could initiate angiogenesis, lead to enhanced growth factor expression and improve the endothelial patterning. We therefore cultured the kidney organoids at 7% O2 instead of 21% O2 for up to 25 days and evaluated nephrogenesis, VEGF-A expression and vascularization. Whole mount imaging revealed a homogenous morphology of the endothelial network with enhanced sprouting and interconnectivity when the kidney organoids were cultured in hypoxia. Three-dimensional quantification confirmed that the hypoxic culture led to an increased average vessel length, likely due to the observed upregulation of proangiogenic VEGF-A189 mRNA and downregulation of the antiangiogenic protein VEGF-A165b measured in hypoxia. This research indicates the importance of optimization of oxygen availability in organoid systems and the potential of hypoxic culture conditions in improving the vascularization of organoids.\n\nSignificance statementCulturing kidney organoids in a hypoxic environment improved patterning of the endothelial network and improved vascularization. These findings may help improve the quality of kidney organoids, and could eventually improve the kidney graft for transplantation in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Furthermore, the organoids will be more suitable for drug testing and in developmental biology. The findings might also be translatable to other organoid models containing endothelial cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473849v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (61K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5cde7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c0ff46org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b76191org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@166823d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Although tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for respiratory tract epithelial cells is well established, an open question is whether the conjunctival epithelium is also a target for SARS-CoV-2. Conjunctival epithelial cells, which express viral entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2, constitute the largest exposed epithelium of the ocular surface tissue, and may represent a relevant viral entry route. To address this question, we generated an organotypic air-liquid-interface model of conjunctival epithelium, composed of progenitor, basal and superficial epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which could be maintained successfully up to day 75 of differentiation. Using single-cell RNA Seq, with complementary imaging and virological assays, we observed that while all conjunctival cell types were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 genome expression, a productive infection did not ensue. The early innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in conjunctival cells was characterised by a robust autocrine and paracrine NF-K{beta} activity, without activation of antiviral interferon signalling. Collectively, these data enrich our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the human ocular surface, with potential implications for the design of preventive strategies and conjunctival transplants.",

    "abstract": "Research into the systematics of Prostanthera has recently revealed a close evolutionary relationship among P. phylicifolia s. str., the critically endangered P. gilesii, and a population of uncertain identity from the Central Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. Previous analyses were unable to establish whether genetic boundaries separated these taxa. This study aimed to assess the species boundaries among these three taxa using a combination of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) sampled at the population-scale and multivariate analysis of morphological characters. Non-parametric and parametric statistics, neighbour-network analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and ancestry coefficient estimates all provided support for discrete genetic differences between the three taxa. Morphological phenetic analysis identified a suite of characters that distinguished each of these taxa. This corroboration of evidence supports the presence of three independently evolving lineages. Prostanthera gilesii and P. phylicifolia s. str. are distinct species independent from the third taxon which is described here as P. volucris R.P.ODonnell. A detailed description, diagnostic line drawings and photographs are provided. We evaluate P. volucris as satisfying criteria to be considered Critically Endangered.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of the ribosomal RNA precursor by RNA polymerase (Pol) I is a major determinant of cellular growth and dysregulation is observed in many cancer types. Here, we present the purification of human Pol I from cells carrying a genomic GFP-fusion on the largest subunit allowing the structural and functional analysis of the enzyme across species. In contrast to yeast, human Pol I carries a single-subunit stalk and in vitro transcription indicates a reduced proofreading activity. Determination of the human Pol I cryo-EM reconstruction in a close-to-native state rationalizes the effects of disease-associated mutations and uncovers an additional domain that is built into the sequence of Pol I subunit RPA1. This  dock II domain resembles a truncated HMG-box incapable of DNA-binding which may serve as a downstream-transcription factor binding platform in metazoans. Biochemical analysis and ChIP data indicate that Topoisomerase 2a can be recruited to Pol I via the domain and cooperates with the HMG-box domain containing factor UBF. These adaptations of the metazoan Pol I transcription system may allow efficient release of positive DNA supercoils accumulating downstream of the transcription bubble.",

    "abstract": "Molecular chaperones, or heat shock proteins (HSPs), protect against the toxic misfolding and aggregation of proteins. As such, mutations or deficiencies within the chaperone network can lead to disease. In fact, dominant mutations in DNAJB6 (Hsp40/Sis1), an Hsp70 co-chaperone, leads to a protein aggregate myopathy termed Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type D1 (LGMDD1). DNAJB6 client proteins and co-chaperone interactions in skeletal muscle are not known. Here, we used the yeast prion model client in conjunction with in vitro chaperone activity assays to gain mechanistic insights, and found that LGMDD1 mutants affect Hsp40 functions. Strikingly, the mutants changed the structure of client protein aggregates, as determined by altered distribution of prion strains. They also impair the Hsp70 ATPase cycle, dimerization, and substrate processing and consequently poison the function of wild-type protein. These results define the mechanisms by which LGMDD1 mutations alter chaperone activity and provide avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

Intense efforts have been devoted for the development of sLeX mimetics for the prevention of atherosclerosis. By contrast, low levels of sLeX are associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) disorders. In this context, we employed metabolic glycan engineering to alter the fine structures of sialoglycans. Treatment of HL-60 (human acute myeloid leukemia) cells with peracetyl N-cyclobutanoyl-D-mannosamine (Ac4ManNCb) resulted in a four-fold increase in both sLeX levels and adhesion to E-selectin-Fc chimera. Enhanced sLeX levels on CD162/PSGL-1, CD43, and CD44 were observed through immunoprecipitation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on interactions with E-selectin revealed dramatic differentials in the conformational dynamics of sLeX-Cb compared to sLeX, highlighting the significance of remote N-acyl side chains of sialic acids in facilitating bio-active conformations.

    "abstract": "Nucleoli have viscoelastic gel-like condensate dynamics that are not well represented in vitro. Nucleoli models, such as those formed by nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), exhibit condensate dynamics orders of magnitude faster than in vivo nucleoli. Here we show that an interplay between magnesium ions (Mg2+) and ATP governs rRNA dynamics, and this ultimately shapes the physical state of these condensates. Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that increased RNA compaction occurs in the condensates at high Mg2+ concentrations, contributing to the slowed RNA dynamics. At Mg2+ concentrations above 7 mM, rRNA is fully arrested and the condensates are gels. Below the critical gel point, NPM1-rRNA droplets age in a temperature-dependent manner, suggesting that condensates are viscoelastic materials, undergoing maturation driven by weak multivalent interactions. ATP addition reverses the dynamic arrest of rRNA, resulting in liquefaction of these gel-like structures. Surprisingly, ATP and Mg2+ both act to increase partitioning of NPM1-proteins as well as rRNA, which influences the partitioning of small client molecules. By contrast, larger ribosomes form a halo around NPM1-rRNA coacervates when Mg2+ concentrations are higher than ATP concentrations. Within cells, ATP levels fluctuate due to biomolecular reactions, and we demonstrate that a dissipative enzymatic reaction can control the biophysical properties of in vitro condensates through depletion of ATP. This enzymatic ATP depletion also reverses the formation of the ribosome halos. Our results illustrate how cells, by changing local ATP concentrations, may regulate the state and client partitioning of RNA-containing condensates such as the nucleolus.\n\nSignificance StatementO_LIThere is a significant discrepancy between the dynamics of in vitro nucleolus models and in vivo nucleoli - with the latter more gel-like.\nC_LIO_LIThe interplay between Mg2+ ions, ATP and the nucleolus components - specifically RNA - governs the dynamics, and ultimately the physical state, of nucleolus-like condensates.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that the nucleolus are dynamically adapting condensates, responding to local ATP concentrations through Mg2+-induced compaction of the RNA, and reversible relaxation when ATP binds Mg2+ again. Other condensates containing RNA probably respond in similar ways to Mg2+ and ATP.\nC_LI",

Cytoskeletal actin is largely responsible for responding to forces and transmitting them in cells, while also maintaining cell shape and integrity. Here, we describe a novel approach to employ a FRET-based DNA force sensor in vitro and in cellulo for non-invasive optical monitoring of intracellular mechanical forces. We use fluorescence lifetime imaging to determine the FRET efficiency of the sensor, which makes the measurement robust against intensity variations. We demonstrate the applicability of the sensor by monitoring cross-linking activity in in vitro actin networks by bulk rheology and confocal microscopy. We further demonstrate that the sensor readily attaches to stress fibers in living cells which opens up the possibility of live-cell force measurements.",

    "abstract": "Despite therapeutic interventions for glioblastoma (GBM), cancer stem cells (CSCs) drive recurrence. The precise mechanisms underlying CSC therapeutic resistance, namely inhibition of cell death, are unclear. We built on previous observations that the high cell surface expression of junctional adhesion molecule-A drives CSC maintenance and identified downstream signaling networks, including the cysteine protease inhibitor SerpinB3. Using genetic depletion approaches, we found that SerpinB3 is necessary for CSC maintenance, survival, and tumor growth, as well as CSC pathway activation. The knockdown of SerpinB3 also increased apoptosis and susceptibility to radiation therapy. Mechanistically, SerpinB3 was essential to buffer cathepsin L-mediated cell death, which was enhanced with radiation. Finally, we found that SerpinB3 knockdown dramatically increased the efficacy of radiation in pre-clinical models. Taken together, our findings identify a novel GBM CSC-specific survival mechanism involving a previously uninvestigated cysteine protease inhibitor, SerpinB3, and provide a potential target to improve the efficacy of standard-of-care GBM therapies against therapeutically resistant CSCs.\n\nSummaryLauko et al. demonstrate a functional role for SerpinB3, which is elevated in glioblastoma cancer stem cells and protects against lysosomal-mediated cell death.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPARP inhibitors (PARPi) kill cancer cells by stalling DNA replication and preventing DNA repair, resulting in a critical accumulation of DNA damage. Resistance to PARPi is a growing clinical problem in the treatment of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 14 (H3K14ac) and associated histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and epigenetic readers have known functions in DNA repair and replication. Our objectives are to examine their expression and activities in the context of PARPi-resistant HGSOC, and to determine if targeting H3K14ac or associated proteins has therapeutic potential.\n\nResultsUsing mass spectrometry profiling of histone modifications, we observed increased H3K14ac enrichment in PARPi-resistant HGSOC cells relative to isogenic PARPi-sensitive lines. By RT-qPCR and RNA-Seq, we also observed altered expression of numerous HATs in PARPi-resistant HGSOC cells and a PARPi-resistant PDX model. Knockdown of HATs only modestly altered PARPi response, although knockdown and inhibition of PCAF significantly increased resistance. Pharmacologic inhibition of HBO1 severely depleted H3K14ac but did not affect PARPi response. However, knockdown and inhibition of BRPF3, which is known to interact in a complex with HBO1, did reduce PARPi resistance.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that severe depletion of H3K14ac does not affect PARPi response in HGSOC. Our data suggest that bromodomain functions of HAT proteins, such as PCAF, or accessory proteins, such as BRPF3, may play a more direct role compared to direct histone acetyltransferase functions in PARPi response.",

    "abstract": "Soil samples collected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park yielded a Listeria isolate that could not be classified to the species level. Whole-genome sequence-based average nucleotide identity BLAST and in silico DNA-DNA Hybridization analyses confirmed this isolate to be a novel Listeria sensu stricto species with the highest similarity to L. marthii (ANI=93.9%, isDDH=55.9%). Additional whole-genome-based analysis using the Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit, an automated program for classifying bacterial genomes, further supported delineation as a novel Listeria sensu stricto species, as this tool failed to assign a species identification but identified L. marthii as the closest match. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization results indicate that this species is nonpathogenic. Specifically, the novel Listeria species described here is phenotypically (i) non-hemolytic and (ii) negative for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity; the draft genome lacks all virulence genes found in the Listeria pathogenicity island 1 (LIPI-1), as well as the internalin genes inlA and inlB. While the type strain for the new species is phenotypically catalase-negative (an unusual characteristic for Listeria sensu stricto species), its genome contained an apparently intact catalase gene (kat); hence assessment of this phenotype with future isolates will be important. Rapid species identification systems (Listeria API, VITEK 2, VITEK MS) misidentified this novel species as either L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, or L. marthii. We propose the name L. swaminathanii, and the type strain is FSL L7-0020T (=ATCC TSD-239T).\n\nIMPORTANCEL. swaminathanii is a novel sensu stricto species that originated from a US National Park, and its place of origin is ultimately preventing this species from achieving valid status. The US National Park Service restricts strain accessibility and open access is currently a prerequisite for species validation. Essentially the only criteria that was not met for L. swaminathanii validation is accessibility of the type strain, therefore nomenclature status should not negate the significance of this discovery. As a novel sensu stricto species, L. swaminathanii expands the group of species whose presence is associated with an increased risk of an L. monocytogenes contamination, and therefore could play an important role in public health. While developers of Listeria spp. detection methods historically only included validly publish species in their validation studies, L. swaminathanii is unequivocally a sensu stricto species and should be included as well.",

    "abstract": "Exploration is a recently discovered mode of growth and behaviour exhibited by some Streptomyces species that is distinct from their classical sporulating life cycle. While much has been uncovered regarding initiating environmental conditions and the phenotypic outcomes of exploratory growth, how this process is coordinated at a genetic level remains unclear. We used RNA-sequencing to survey global changes in the transcriptional profile of exploring cultures over time in the model organism Streptomyces venezuelae. Transcriptomic analyses revealed widespread changes in gene expression impacting diverse cellular functions. Investigations into differentially expressed regulatory elements revealed specific groups of regulatory factors to be impacted, including the expression of several extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, second messenger signalling pathways, and members of the whiB-like (wbl) family of transcription factors. Dramatic changes were observed among primary metabolic pathways, especially among respiration-associated genes and the oxidative stress response; enzyme assays confirmed that exploring cultures exhibit an enhanced oxidative stress response compared with classically growing cultures. Changes in expression of the glycerol catabolic genes in S. venezuelae led to the discovery that glycerol supplementation of the growth medium promotes a dramatic acceleration of exploration. This effect appears to be unique to glycerol as an alternative carbon source and this response is broadly conserved across other exploration-competent species.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are repaired by multiple distinct pathways, with outcomes ranging from error-free repair to extensive mutagenesis and genomic loss. Repair pathway cross-talk and compensation within the DSB-repair network is incompletely understood, despite its importance for genomic stability, oncogenesis, and the outcome of genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9. To address this, we constructed and validated three fluorescent Cas9-based reporters, named DSB-Spectrum, that simultaneously quantify the contribution of multiple distinct pathways to repair of a DSB. These reporters distinguish between DSB-repair by error-free canonical non-homologous end-joining (c-NHEJ) versus homologous recombination (HR; reporter 1), mutagenic repair versus HR (reporter 2), and mutagenic end-joining versus single strand annealing (SSA) versus HR (reporter 3). Using these reporters, we show that inhibition of the essential c-NHEJ factor DNA-PKcs not only increases repair by HR, but also results in a substantial increase in mutagenic repair by SSA. We show that SSA-mediated repair of Cas9-generated DSBs can occur between Alu elements at endogenous genomic loci, and is enhanced by inhibition of DNA-PKcs. Finally, we demonstrate that the short-range end-resection factors CtIP and Mre11 promote both SSA and HR, whereas the long-range end-resection factors DNA2 and Exo1 promote SSA, but reduce HR, when both pathways compete for the same substrate. These new Cas9-based DSB-Spectrum reporters facilitate the rapid and comprehensive analysis of repair pathway crosstalk and DSB-repair outcome.",

    "abstract": "Grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) are a primate species exhibiting strong physiological seasonality in response to environmental energetic constraint. They notably store large amounts of lipids during early winter (EW), which are thereafter mobilized during late winter (LW), when food availability is low. In addition, they develop glucose intolerance in LW only. To decipher how the hepatic mechanisms may support such metabolic flexibility, we analyzed the liver proteome of adult captive male mouse lemurs, which seasonal regulations of metabolism and reproduction are comparable to their wild counterparts, during the phases of either constitution or use of fat reserves. We highlight profound changes that reflect fat accretion in EW at the whole-body level, however, without triggering an ectopic storage of fat in the liver. Moreover, molecular regulations would be in line with the lowering of liver glucose utilization in LW, and thus with reduced tolerance to glucose. However, no major regulation was seen in insulin signaling/resistance pathways, which suggests that glucose intolerance does not reach a pathological stage. Finally, fat mobilization in LW appeared possibly linked to reactivation of the reproductive system and enhanced liver detoxification may reflect an anticipation to return to summer levels of food intake. Altogether, these results show that the physiology of mouse lemurs during winter relies on solid molecular foundations in liver processes to adapt fuel partitioning while avoiding reaching a pathological state despite large lipid fluxes. This work emphasizes how the mouse lemur is of primary interest for identifying molecular mechanisms relevant to biomedical field.",

Current TRAP toolkits available to the C. elegans community have been built using multi-copy arrays, randomly integrated in the genome. Here we introduce a Single-copy Knock In Translating Ribosome ImmunoPrecipitation (SKI TRIP) tool kit, a collection of C. elegans strains engineered by CRISPR in which tissue specific expression of FLAG tagged ribosomal subunit protein RPL-22 is driven by cassettes present in single copy from defined sites in the genome. In depth characterization of the SKI TRIP strains and methodology shows that 3xFLAG tagged RPL-22 expressed from its endogenous locus or within defined cell types incorporates into actively translating ribosomes and can be used to efficiently and cleanly pull-down cell type specific transcripts without impacting overall mRNA translation or fitness of the animal. We propose SKI TRIP use for the study of processes that are acutely sensitive to changes in translation, such as aging.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between genetic variations and variations in complex and quantitative phenotypes remains an ongoing challenge. While Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a vital tool for identifying single-locus associations, we lack methods for identifying epistatic interactions. In this article, we propose a novel method for high-order epistasis detection using mixed effect conditional inference forest (epiMEIF). The epiMEIF model is fitted on a group of potential causal SNPs and the tree structure in the forest facilitates the identification of n-way interactions between the SNPs. Additional testing strategies further improve the robustness of the method. We demonstrate its ability to detect true n-way interactions via extensive simulations in both cross-sectional and longitudinal synthetic datasets. This is further illustrated in an application to reveal epistatic interactions from natural variations of cardiac traits in flies (Drosophila). Overall, the method provides a generalized way to identify high order interactions from any GWAS data, thereby greatly improving the detection of the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "To maintain genome integrity, cells rely on a complex system of DNA repair pathways and cell cycle checkpoints, together referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). Impairments in DDR pathways are linked to cancer, but also to a wide range of degenerative processes, frequently including progressive neuropathy and accelerated aging. How defects in mechanistically distinct DDR pathways can drive similar degenerative phenotypes is not understood. Here we show that defects in various DDR components are linked to a loss of protein homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Prolonged silencing of atm-1, brc-1 or ung-1, central components in respectively checkpoint signaling, double strand break repair and base excision repair enhances the global aggregation of proteins occurring in adult animals, and accelerates polyglutamine protein aggregation in a model for neurodegenerative diseases. Overexpression of the molecular chaperone HSP-16.2 prevents enhanced protein aggregation in atm-1, brc-1 or ung-1-compromised animals. Strikingly, rebalancing protein homeostasis with HSP-16.2 almost completely rescues age-associated impaired motor function in these animals as well. This reveals that the consequences of a loss of atm-1, brc-1 or ung-1 converge on an impaired protein homeostasis to cause degeneration. These findings indicate that a loss of protein homeostasis is a crucial downstream consequence of DNA repair defects, and thereby provide an attractive novel framework for understanding the broad link between DDR defects and degenerative processes.",

Single strand (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks are bonafide stimulators of PARP1 activity. However, PAR mediated PARP1 regulation remains unexplored. Here, we report ZnF3, BRCT and WGR, hitherto uncharacterized, as PAR reader domains of PARP1. Surprisingly, these domains recognize PARylated protein with a higher affinity compared to PAR but bind with weak or no affinity to DNA breaks as standalone domains. Conversely, ZnF1 and ZnF2 of PARP1 recognize DNA breaks but weakly to PAR. In addition, PAR reader domains, together, exhibit a synergy to recognize PAR or PARylated protein. Further competition binding studies suggest that PAR binding releases DNA from PARP1, and WGR domain facilitates the DNA release. Unexpectedly, PAR showed catalytic stimulation of PARP1 but hampers the DNA-dependent stimulation. Altogether, our work discovers dedicated high-affinity PAR reader domains of PARP1 and uncovers a novel mechanism of allosteric stimulation, but retardation of DNA-dependent activities of PARP1 by its catalytic product PAR.

    "abstract": "The block of voltage-dependent sodium channels by saxitoxin (STX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) was investigated in voltage-clamped squid giant axons internally perfused with a variety of permeant monovalent cations. Substitution of internal Na+ by either NH4+ or N2H5+ resulted in a reduction of outward current through sodium channels under control conditions. In contrast, anomalous increases in both inward and outward currents were seen for the same ions if some of the channels were blocked by STX or TTX, suggesting a relief of block by these internal cations. External NH4+ was without effect on the apparent magnitude of toxin block. Likewise, internal inorganic monovalent cations were without effect, suggesting that proton donation by NH4+ might be involved in reducing toxin block. Consistent with this hypothesis, decreases in internal pH mimicked internal perfusion with NH4+ in reducing toxin block. The interaction between internally applied protons and externally applied toxin molecules appears to be competitive, as transient increases in sodium channel current were observed during step increases in intracellular pH in the presence of a fixed STX concentration. In addition to these effects on toxin block, low internal pH produced a voltage-dependent block of sodium channels and enhanced steady-state inactivation. Elevation of external buffer capacity only marginally diminished the modulation of STX block by internal NH4+, suggesting that alkalinization of the periaxonal space and a resultant decrease in the cationic STX concentration during NH4+ perfusion may play only a minor role in the effect. These observations indicate that internal monovalent cations can exert trans-channel influences on external toxin binding sites on sodium channels.",
