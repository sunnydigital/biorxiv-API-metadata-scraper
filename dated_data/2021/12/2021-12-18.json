    "abstract": "Organ growth is tightly regulated across environmental conditions to generate appropriate final size. While the size of some organs is free to vary, others need to maintain constant size to function properly. This poses a unique problem: how is robust final size achieved when environmental conditions can alter some major growth processes? While we know that brain growth is \"spared\" from the effects of the environment from humans to fruit flies, we do not understand how this process alters growth dynamics across brain compartments. Here, we explore how this robustness in brain size is achieved by examining differences in growth patterns between the larval body, the brain, and a brain compartment - the mushroom bodies - in Drosophila melanogaster across both thermal and nutritional conditions. We identify key differences in patterns of growth between the whole brain and mushroom bodies that are likely to underlie robustness of final organ shape. Further, we show that these differences produce distinct brain shapes across environments.\n\nSignificance of StudyA long-standing question in Biology has been how fully functional multicellular organisms with highly specialized organs are generated, given that organs initiate growth at different times across development. Although the genetic mechanisms that underlie growth has been studied extensively, we are yet to understand how growth pattern of organs produces distinct final shapes across changing environmental conditions. We use the Drosophila brain, to reveal that key differences in growth dynamics are likely to underlie robustness of final organ shape and are tuned by nutrition and temperature. Further deepening our knowledge of how final organ shape is maintained across environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Tumours are complex ecosystems composed of different types of cells that communicate and influence each other. While the critical role of stromal cells in affecting tumour growth is well established, the impact of mutant cancer cells on healthy surrounding tissues remains poorly defined. Here, we uncovered a paracrine mechanism by which intestinal cancer cells reactivate foetal and regenerative Yap-associated transcriptional programs in neighbouring wildtype epithelial cells, rendering them adapted to thrive in the tumour context. We identified the glycoprotein Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) as the essential factor that mediates non-cell autonomous morphological and transcriptional responses. Importantly, Thbs1 is associated with bad prognosis in several human cancers. This study reveals the THBS1-YAP axis as the mechanistic link mediating paracrine interactions between epithelial cells in intestinal tumours.",

    "abstract": "The morphology of breast cancer cells is often used as an indicator of tumour severity and prognosis. Additionally, morphology can be used to identify more fine-grained, molecular developments within a cancer cell, such as transcriptomic changes and signaling pathway activity. Delineating the interface between morphology and signaling is important to understand the mechanical cues that a cell processes in order to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and consequently metastasize. However, the exact regulatory systems that define these changes remain poorly characterised. In this study, we employ a network-systems approach to integrate imaging data and RNA-seq expression data. Our workflow allows the discovery of unbiased and context-specific gene expression signatures and cell signaling sub-networks relevant to the regulation of cell shape, rather than focusing on the identification of previously known, but not always representative, pathways. By constructing a cell-shape signaling network from shape-correlated gene expression modules and their upstream regulators, we found central roles for developmental pathways such as WNT and Notch as well as evidence for the fine control of NFkB signaling by numerous kinase and transcriptional regulators. Further analysis of our network implicates a gene expression module enriched in the RAP1 signaling pathway as a mediator between the sensing of mechanical stimuli and regulation of NFkB activity, with specific relevance to cell shape in breast cancer.",

Here we show by application of several super-resolution microscopy techniques to cultured neurons and mouse striatal slices, that the dopamine transporter (DAT), a key protein in varicosities of dopaminergic neurons, exists in the membrane in dynamic equilibrium between an inward-facing nanodomain-localized and outward-facing unclustered configuration. The balance between these configurations is inversely regulated by excitatory drive and by DA D2-autoreceptor activation in manner dependent on Ca2+-influx via N-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels. The DAT nanodomains contain tens of transporters molecules and overlap with nanodomains of PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) but show little overlap with D2-autoreceptor, syntaxin-1 and clathrin nanodomains. Summarized, the data reveal a mechanism for rapid alterations in nanoscopic DAT distribution and show a striking link of this to the conformational state of the transporter.",

    "abstract": "Marine algae viruses are important for controlling microorganism communities in the marine ecosystem and played fundamental roles during the early events of viral evolution. Here, we have focused on one major group of marine algae viruses, the ssDNA viruses from the Bacilladnaviridae family. We present the capsid structure of the bacilladnavirus, Chaetoceros tenuissimus DNA virus type II (CtenDNAV-II), determined at 2.3 [A] resolution. A structure-based phylogenetic analysis supported the previous theory that bacilladnaviruses have acquired their capsid protein via horizontal gene transfer from a ssRNA virus. The capsid protein contains the widespread virus jelly-roll fold, but has additional unique features; a third {beta}-sheet and a long C-terminal tail. Further, low-resolution reconstructions of the CtenDNAV-II genome revealed a partially spooled structure, an arrangement previously only described for dsRNA and dsDNA viruses. Together, these results exemplify the importance of genetic recombination for the emergence and evolution of ssDNA viruses and provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms that dictate genome organisation.",

    "abstract": "Mental imagery is an important tool in the cognitive control of emotion. The present study tests the prediction that visual imagery can generate and regulate differential fear conditioning via the activation and prioritization of stimulus representations in early visual cortices. We combined differential fear conditioning with manipulations of viewing and imagining basic visual stimuli in humans. We discovered that mental imagery of a fear-conditioned stimulus compared to imagery of a safe conditioned stimulus generated a significantly greater conditioned response as measured by self-reported fear, the skin conductance response, and right anterior insula activity (experiment 1). Moreover, mental imagery effectively down- and up-regulated the fear conditioned responses (experiment 2). Multivariate classification using the functional magnetic resonance imaging data from retinotopically defined early visual regions revealed significant decoding of the imagined stimuli in V2 and V3 (experiment 1) but significantly reduced decoding in these regions during imagery-based regulation (experiment 2). Together, the present findings indicate that mental imagery can generate and regulate a differential fear conditioned response via mechanisms of the depictive theory of imagery and the biased-competition theory of attention. These findings also highlight the potential importance of mental imagery in the manifestation and treatment of psychological illnesses.",

    "abstract": "Inverse-variance weighted two-sample Mendelian randomization (IVW-MR) is the most widely used approach that utilizes genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics to infer the existence and the strength of the causal effect between an exposure and an outcome. Estimates from this approach can be subject to different biases due to the use of weak instruments and winners curse, which can change as a function of the overlap between the exposure and outcome samples.\n\nWe developed a method (MRlap) that simultaneously considers weak instrument bias and winners curse, while accounting for potential sample overlap. Assuming spike-and-slab genomic architecture and leveraging LD-score regression and other techniques, we could analytically derive, reliably estimate, and hence correct for the bias of IVW-MR using association summary statistics only.\n\nWe tested our approach using simulated data for a wide range of realistic settings. In all the explored scenarios, our correction reduced the bias, in some situations by as much as 30 folds. Additionally, our results are consistent with the fact that the strength of the biases will decrease as the sample size increases and we also showed that the overall bias is also dependent on the genetic architecture of the exposure, and traits with low heritability and/or high polygenicity are more strongly affected. Applying MRlap to obesity-related exposures revealed significant differences between IVW-based and corrected effects, both for non-overlapping and fully overlapping samples.\n\nOur method not only reduces bias in causal effect estimation but also enables the use of much larger GWAS sample sizes, by allowing for potentially overlapping samples.",

However, the molecular determinants controlling corticopontine connectivity are insufficiently understood.

Transgenic mice lacking cortical expression of Nr2f1 and exhibiting areal organization defects were used as model systems to investigate the arrangement of corticopontine projections. Combining three-dimensional digital brain atlas tools, Cre-dependent mouse lines, and axonal tracing, we show that Nr2f1 expression in postmitotic neurons spatially and temporally controls somatosensory topographic projections, whereas expression in progenitor cells influences the ratio between corticopontine and corticospinal fibres passing the pontine nuclei. We conclude that cortical gradients of area patterning genes are directly implicated in the establishment of a topographic somatotopic mapping from the cortex onto pontine nuclei.\n\nSummary statementCortical gradient expression of the area patterning gene Nr2f1 spatially and temporally controls corticopontine topographic connectivity in layer V projection neurons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRegional distribution of somatic mutations in cancer genomes associates with DNA replication timing (RT) and chromatin accessibility (CA), however normal tissues and cell lines have contributed these insights while associations with the epigenomes of primary cancers remain uncharacterized.\n\nResultsHere we model megabase-scale mutation burden in whole cancer genomes using [~]900 CA and RT profiles of primary cancers, normal tissues, and cell lines. CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than normal tissues, predict regional mutagenesis in most cancer types. Regional mutation burden associates with the CA profiles of matching cancer types, indicating tissue-specific determinants of mutagenesis. However, mutagenesis in squamous cell and lymphoid cancers instead associates with RT profiles. Mutational signatures also show tissue-specific associations with cancer epigenomes, especially for carcinogen-induced and unannotated signatures. Lastly, while each cancer type includes certain frequently-mutated genomic regions exceeding epigenome-informed predictions of mutation burden, these regions show a pan-cancer convergence to biological processes involved in development and cancer. Thus, modelling excess mutations using epigenomes highlights known cancer driver genes as well as frequently mutated non-coding regions.\n\nConclusionsThe dominant association of regional mutation burden with cancer epigenomes suggests that many passenger mutations are determined by the epigenetic landscapes of transformed cells and may occur later in tumor evolution. CA-informed models help find cancer genes and pathways with positive selection and highlight regions where additional mutation burden is contributed by local mutational processes. This study underlines the complex interplay of mutational processes, genome function and evolution in cancer and tissues of origin.",

Increases in selfing rate, and concomitant increases in population-level homozygosity, can increase or decrease the efficacy of selection, depending on the dominance and selection coefficients of the deleterious mutations. Most theory has focused on how (partial) selfing affects the efficacy of selection for mutations of a given dominance and fitness effect in isolation. It remains unclear how selfing affects the purging of deleterious mutations in a genome-wide context where mutations with different selection and dominance coefficients co-segregate. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate how mutation, selection and recombination interact with selfing rate to shape genome-wide patterns of genetic load. We recover various mechanisms previously described for how (partial) selfing affects the efficacy of selection against mutations of a given dominance class. However, we find that the interaction of purifying selection against mutations of different dominance classes changes with selfing rate. In particular, as outcrossing populations transition from purifying selection to pseudo-overdominance they experience a dramatic increase in the genetic load caused by additive, mildly deleterious mutations. We describe the threshold selfing rate that prevents pseudo-overdominance and decreases genetic load.",

Such a mechanism requires that cPcdh cis dimers form promiscuously to generate diverse recognition units, and that trans interactions have precise specificity so that isoform mismatches terminate chain growth. However, the extent to which cPcdh interactions fulfill these requirements has not been definitively demonstrated. Here we report biophysical experiments showing that cPcdh cis interactions are promiscuous, but with preferences favoring formation of heterologous cis dimers. Trans-homophilic interactions are remarkably precise, with no evidence for heterophilic interactions between different isoforms. A new C-type cPcdh crystal structure and mutagenesis data help to explain these observations. Overall, the interaction characteristics we report for cPcdhs help explain their function in neuronal self/non-self-discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) are a major component of reproductive isolation between species. DMIs imply negative epistasis, and are exposed when two diverged populations hybridize. Mapping the locations of DMIs has largely relied on classical genetic mapping. Approaches to date are hampered by low power and the challenge of identifying DMI loci on the same chromosome, because strong initial linkage of parental haplotypes weakens statistical tests. Here, we propose new statistics to infer negative epistasis from haplotype frequencies in hybrid populations. When two divergent populations hybridize, the variance in heterozygosity at two loci decreases faster with time at DMI loci than at random pairs of loci. When two populations hybridize at near-even admixture proportions, the deviation of the observed variance from its expectation becomes negative for the DMI pair. This negative deviation enables us to detect intermediate to strong negative epistasis both within and between chromosomes. In practice, the detection window in hybrid populations depends on the demographic scenario, the recombination rate, and the strength of epistasis. When the initial proportion of the two parental populations is uneven, only strong DMIs can be detected with our method unless migration prevents parental haplotypes from being lost. We use the new statistics to infer candidate DMIs from three hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We identify numerous new DMI candidates, some of which are inferred to interact with several loci within and between chromosomes. Moreover, we discuss our results in the context of an expected enrichment in intrachromosomal over interchromosomal DMIs.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenetic incompatibility in the form of (Bateson-)Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) is an important component of reproductive isolation between species. However, the evolutionary role of DMIs during the process of speciation is contentious. DMIs occur when two or more genetic variants interact to reduce their carriers fitness. Once recombination combines incompatible variants in hybrids, selection acts to remove these variants from the population. One step towards addressing the evolutionary role of DMIs is to quantify the prevalence of DMIs in incipient and hybridizing species. Here, we present statistics that are sensitive to the resulting recombinant imbalance and that can indicate the location of DMIs in hybrid genomes in various demographic scenarios. We use simulations to show that the time window during which a DMI is detectable depends on its genomic location, the severity of the DMI, and the populations demography. Importantly, our statistic distinguishes genetic associations arising due to physical linkage from those arising due to gene interactions, which allows for the inference of both inter- and intrachromosomal DMIs. Applying our statistics to three hybrid populations of swordtail fish, we confirm previously known DMIs and identify new candidate incompatibilities.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCondensed tannins in plants are found free and attached to protein and fibre but it is not known whether these fractions influence rumen degradation and microbial colonization. This study explored the rumen degradation of tropical tannins-rich plants and the relationship between condensed tannins fractions disappearance and microbial communities colonising plant particles. Leaves from Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala, pods from Acacia nilotica and the leaves of two agricultural by-products: Manihot esculenta and Musa spp. were incubated in situ in the rumen of dairy cows. An in vitro approach was also used to assess the effects of these plants on rumen fermentation parameters. All plants contained more than 100 g/kg of condensed tannins with a large proportion (32 to 61%) bound to proteins. Calliandra calothyrsus had the highest concentration of condensed tannins at 361 g/kg, whereas Acacia nilotica was particularly rich in hydrolysable tannins (350 g/kg). Hydrolysable and free condensed tannins from all plants completely disappeared after 24 h incubation in the rumen. Disappearance of protein-bound condensed tannins was variable with values ranging from 93% for Gliricidia sepium to 21% for Acacia nilotica. In contrast, fibre-bound condensed tannins disappearance averaged ~82% and did not vary between plants. Disappearance of bound fractions of condensed tannins was not associated with degradability of plant fractions. The presence of tannins interfered with the microbial colonisation of plants. Each plant had distinct bacterial and archaeal communities after 3 and 12 h of incubation in the rumen and distinct protozoal communities at 3 h. Adherent communities in tannin-rich plants had a lower relative abundance of fibrolytic microbes, notably Fibrobacter spp. Whereas, archaea diversity was reduced in high tannin-containing Calliandra calothyrsus and Acacia nilotica at 12 h of incubation. Concurrently, in vitro methane production was lower for Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala although for the latter total volatile fatty acids production was not affected and was similar to control. Here we show that the total amount of hydrolysable and condensed tannins contained in a plant govern the interaction with rumen microbes affecting degradability and fermentation. The effect of protein- and fibre-bound condensed tannins on degradability is less important.",

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are frequently observed on structural neuroimaging of elderly populations and are associated with cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia. Many existing WMH segmentation algorithms produce suboptimal results in populations with vascular lesions or brain atrophy, or require parameter tuning and are computationally expensive. Additionally, most algorithms do not generate a confidence estimate of segmentation quality, limiting their interpretation. MRI-based segmentation methods are often sensitive to acquisition protocols, scanners, noise-level, and image contrast, failing to generalize to other populations and out-of-distribution datasets. Given these concerns, we propose a novel Bayesian 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture that automatically segments WMH, provides uncertainty estimates of the segmentation output for quality control and is robust to changes in acquisition protocols. We also provide a second model to differentiate deep and periventricular WMH. 432 subjects were recruited to train the CNNs from four multi-site imaging studies. A separate test set of 158 subjects was used for evaluation, including an unseen multi-site study. We compared our model to two established state-of-the-art techniques (BIANCA and DeepMedic), highlighting its accuracy and efficiency. Our Bayesian 3D U-Net achieved the highest Dice similarity coefficient of 0.89 {+/-} 0.08 and the lowest modified Hausdorff distance of 2.98 {+/-} 4.40 mm. We further validated our models highlighting their robustness on  clinical adversarial cases simulating data with low signal-to-noise ratio, low resolution, and different contrast (stemming from MRI sequences with different parameters).

    "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA), the part of the amygdala complex involved in the transduction of perceptual stimuli into emotion, undergoes profound reorganization at adolescence in rodents and humans. How cellular and synaptic plasticity evolve throughout postnatal development in both sexes is only partially understood. We used a cross-sectional approach to compare the morphology, neuronal, and synaptic properties of BLA neurons in rats of both sexes at adolescence and adulthood. While BLA pyramidal neurons from rats of both sexes displayed similar current-voltage relationships, rheobases, and resting potentials during pubescence, differences in these parameters emerged between sexes at adulthood: BLA neurons were more excitable in males than females. During pubescence, BLA neuron excitability was highest in females and unchanged in males; male action potentials were smaller and shorter than females and fast afterhyperpolarizations were larger in males. During post-natal maturation, no difference in spine density was observed between groups or sexes but spine length increased and decreased in females and males, respectively. A reduction in spine head diameter and volume was observed exclusively in females. Basic synaptic properties also displayed sex-specific maturational differences. Stimulus-response relationships and maximal fEPSP amplitudes where higher in male adolescents compared with adults but were similar in females of both ages. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by AMPA receptors were smaller in BLA neurons from adolescent female compared with their adult counterparts but were unchanged in males. These differences did not directly convert into changes in overall synaptic strength estimated from the AMPA/NMDA ratio, which was smaller in adolescent females. Finally, the developmental courses of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP, LTD) were sexually dimorphic. LTP was similarly present during the adolescent period in males and females but was not apparent at adulthood in females. In contrast, LTD followed an opposite development: present in adolescent females and expressed in both sexes at adulthood. These data reveal divergent maturational trajectories in the BLA of male and female rats and suggest cellular substrates to the BLA linked sex-specific behaviors at adolescence and adulthood.",

Improved drugs constitute a continued area of study. However, there remains no reductionist method to examine the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds in living cells. Here, we developed new intensity-based drug sensing fluorescent reporters (\"iDrugSnFRs\") for the nicotinic partial agonists dianicline, cytisine, and two cytisine derivatives - 10-fluorocytisine and 9-bromo-10-ethylcytisine. We report the first atomic-scale structures of liganded periplasmic binding protein-based biosensors, accelerating development of iDrugSnFRs and also explaining the activation mechanism. The nicotinic iDrugSnFRs detect their drug partners in solution, as well as at the plasma membrane (PM) and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cell lines and mouse hippocampal neurons. At the PM, the speed of solution changes limits the growth and decay rates of the fluorescence response in almost all cases. In contrast, we found that rates of membrane crossing differ among these nicotinic drugs by > 30 fold. The new nicotinic iDrugSnFRs provide insight into the real-time pharmacokinetic properties of nicotinic agonists and provide a methodology whereby iDrugSnFRs can inform both pharmaceutical neuroscience and addiction neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is the primary analytical tool used to characterize proteins within the biopharmaceutical industry. Electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to liquid chromatography (LC) is the current gold standard for intact protein analysis. However, inherent speed limitations of LC/MS prevent analysis of large sample numbers (>1000) in a day. Infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI-MS), an ambient ionization MS technology, has recently been established as a platform for high throughput small molecule analysis. Here we report the applications of such a system for the analysis of intact proteins commonly performed within the drug discovery process. A wide molecular weight range of proteins 10 - 150 kDa was detected on the system with improved tolerance to salts and buffers compared to ESI. With high concentrations and model proteins, a sample rate up to 22 Hz was obtained. For proteins at low concentrations and in buffers used in commonly employed assays, robust data at a sample rate of 1.5 Hz was achieved, which is [~] 22x faster than current technologies used for high throughput ESI-MS-based protein assays. In addition, two multiplexed plate-based high throughput sample cleanup methods were coupled to IR-MALDESI-MS to enable analysis of samples containing excessive amounts of salts and buffers without fully compromising productivity. Example experiments, which leverage the speed of the IR-MALDESI-MS system to monitor NISTmAb reduction, protein autophosphorylation and compound binding kinetics in near real-time, are demonstrated.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467755v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afa091org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@56b6ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1034f83org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5949fb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer has a relentless tendency to come back after treatment. Analyses of public data from about 2100 breast cancers produce a model that explains this recurrence and implicates variants of Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV or Human Herpes Virus 4). These viruses cause chromosome breaks. Broken chromosome pieces rejoin abnormally, sometimes including two centromeres. Two centromeres on the same chromosome interfere with cell division. Each centromere gets pulled toward a different pole. This mechanical stress shatters chromosomes. Shattered chromosome fragments rejoin arbitrarily, but showers of mutations accompany their rejoining. In this way, a single break can destabilize the entire genome. The breast cancer phenotype is not fixed and constantly creates new cancer driver genes. The phenotype becomes independent of the original virus and its dosage. Cancer comes back because treatment does not explicitly target the underlying breakage-rejoining cycles or the contributing virus.\n\nThe following data support this model. EBV causes chromosome breaks, and breast cancer chromosomes often have two centromeres. Breast cancer breakpoints on all chromosomes aggregate around the same positions as breakpoints in cancers definitively associated with EBV infection (nasopharyngeal cancer and endemic Burkitts lymphoma). Rejoined boundaries of highly fragmented chromosomes characteristic of breakage fusion cycles cluster around viral sequences. There is presumptive evidence of past infection. Human EBV sequences distribute like retrovirus transposons near dense piRNA clusters at a critical MHC-immune response region of chromosome 6. Other viruses strongly resemble endogenous transposons which piRNAs inactivate by methylation and cleavage. Remnants of exogenous EBV variants sit close to inactive transposons in piRNA sandwiches. The arrangement grossly resembles bacterial CRISPR and adds a layer of DNA protection to the immune system. Breast cancers target this protection with chromosome breaks and mutations and have a distinctive methylation signature nearby. Finally, areas near EBV docking sites can have increased numbers of breaks.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467751v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@abc058org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e0ffe9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c13bc9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c16d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This ability, also known as insight, is critically required for reality testing and is impaired in psychosis, yet very little is known about its cognitive underpinnings. We developed a Bayesian modeling framework and a novel psychophysics paradigm to quantitatively characterize this type of insight while participants experienced a motion after-effect illusion. Participants could incorporate knowledge about the illusion into their decisions when judging the actual direction of a motion stimulus, compensating for the illusion (and often overcompensating). Furthermore, confidence, reaction-time, and pupil-dilation data all showed signatures consistent with inferential adjustments in the Bayesian insight model. Our results suggest that people can question the veracity of what they see by making insightful inferences that incorporate introspective knowledge about internal distortions.",

    "abstract": "We present single molecule experimental and computational modeling studies investigating the accessibility of human telomeric overhangs of physiologically relevant lengths. We studied 25 different overhangs that contain 4-28 repeats of GGGTTA (G-Tract) sequence and accommodate 1-7 tandem G-quadruplex (GQ) structures. Using FRET-PAINT method, we probed the distribution of accessible sites via a short imager strand, which is complementary to a G-Tract and transiently binds to available sites. We report accessibility patterns that periodically change with overhang length and interpret these patterns in terms of the underlying folding landscape and folding frustration. Overhangs that have [4n]G-Tracts, (12, 16, 20...), demonstrate the broadest accessibility patterns where the PNA probe accesses G-Tracts throughout the overhang. On the other hand, constructs with [4n+2]G-Tracts, (14, 18, 22...), have narrower patterns where the neighborhood of the junction between single and double stranded telomere is most accessible. We interpret these results as the folding frustration being higher in [4n]G-Tract constructs compared to [4n+2]G-Tract constructs. We also developed a computational model that tests the consistency of different folding stabilities and cooperativities between neighboring GQs with the observed accessibility patterns. Our experimental and computational studies suggest the neighborhood of the junction between single and double stranded telomere is least stable and most accessible, which is significant as this is a potential site where the connection between POT1/TPP1 (bound to single stranded telomere) and other shelterin proteins (localized on double stranded telomere) is established.\n\nSignificance StatementThe ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes are capped by telomeres which terminate with a single-stranded overhang. Telomeric overhangs fold into compact structures, called G-quadruplex, that inhibit access to these critical genomic sites. We report single molecule measurements and computational modeling studies probing the accessibility of a set of human telomeric overhangs that covers a significant portion of the physiologically relevant length scale. We observe novel accessibility patterns which have a well-defined periodicity and show that certain regions are significantly more accessible than others. These accessibility patterns also suggest the underlying folding frustration of G-quadruplexes depends on telomere length. These patterns have significant implications for regulating the access of DNA processing enzymes and DNA binding proteins that can target telomeric overhangs.",

    "abstract": "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is an aggressive liver cancer with no effective therapeutic options. The extracellular environment of FLC tumors is poorly characterized and may contribute to cancer growth and/or metastasis. To bridge this knowledge gap, we assessed pathways relevant to proteoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix. We first analyzed gene expression data from FLC and non-malignant liver tissue (n=27) to identify changes in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis pathways and found that genes associated with production of chondroitin sulfate, but not other GAGs, are significantly increased by 8-fold. We then implemented a novel LC-MS/MS based method to quantify the abundance of different types of GAGs in patient tumors (n=16) and found that chondroitin sulfate is significantly more abundant in FLC tumors by 6-fold. Upon further analysis of GAG-associated proteins we found that versican (VCAN) expression is significantly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels, the latter of which was validated by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we performed single-cell assay for transposon-accessible chromatin-sequencing on FLC tumors (n=3), which revealed for the first time the different cell types in FLC tumors and also showed that VCAN is likely produced not only from FLC tumor epithelial cells but also activated stellate cells. Our results reveal a pathologic aberrancy in chondroitin (but not heparan) sulfate proteoglycans in FLC and highlight a potential role for activated stellate cells.\n\nSignificanceThis study leverages a multi-disciplinary approach, including state-of-the-art chemical analyses and cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, to identify for the first time a marked chondroitin sulfate aberrancy in fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) that could open novel therapeutic avenues in the future.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal injury is common in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, but the underlying pathogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we hypothesize that the presence of the adjacent fluid-containing temporal horn exacerbates the biomechanical vulnerability of the hippocampus. Two finite element models of the human head were used to investigate this hypothesis, one with and one without the temporal horn, and both including a detailed hippocampal subfield delineation. A fluid-structure interaction coupling approach was used to simulate the brain-ventricle interface, in which the intraventricular cerebrospinal fluid was represented by an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian multi-material formation to account for its fluid behavior. By comparing the response of these two models under identical loadings, the model that included the temporal horn predicted increased magnitudes of strain and strain rate in the hippocampus with respect to its counterpart without the temporal horn. This specifically affected cornu ammonis (CA) 1 (CA1), CA2/3, hippocampal tail, subiculum, and the adjacent amygdala and ventral diencephalon. These computational results suggest that the presence of the temporal horn exacerbate the vulnerability of the hippocampus, highlighting the mechanobiological dependency of the hippocampus on the temporal horn.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are no approved medications to treat cocaine addiction. In this context, d-amphetamine maintenance therapy is a promising pharmacological strategy to reduce cocaine use. In both male rats and human cocaine users, d-amphetamine treatment reduces cocaine taking and seeking. However, this has not been examined systematically in female animals, even though cocaine addiction afflicts both women and men, and the sexes can differ in their response to cocaine. Here, we determined how d-amphetamine maintenance therapy during cocaine self-administration influences cocaine use in female rats. In experiment 1, two groups of female rats received 14 intermittent access (IntA) cocaine self-administration sessions. One group received concomitant d-amphetamine maintenance treatment (COC + A rats; 5 mg/kg/day, via minipump), the other group did not (COC rats). After discontinuing d-amphetamine treatment, we measured responding for cocaine under a progressive ratio schedule, responding under extinction and cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking. In experiment 2, we assessed the effects of d-amphetamine maintenance on these measures in already cocaine-experienced rats. To this end, rats first received 14 IntA cocaine self-administration sessions without d-amphetamine. They then received 14 more sessions now either with (COC/COC + A rats) or without (COC/COC rats) concomitant d-amphetamine treatment. In both experiments, d-amphetamine treatment did not influence cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking. However, after d-amphetamine treatment, rats responded less for cocaine both under progressive ratio and extinction conditions. Thus, d-amphetamine treatment can both prevent and reverse increases in the motivation to take and seek cocaine in female animals.",

    "abstract": "We assembled estimated biomass (B) time series from stock assessments for 24 Pacific Canadian groundfish stocks and modelled average and stock status through 2020 based on biomass relative to each stocks (1) Limit Reference Point (B/LRP), (2) Upper Stock Reference (B/USR), and (3) biomass at maximum sustainable yield (B/BMSY). The overall mean B/LRP in 2020 was 3.2 (95% credible interval [CI]: 2.6-3.9). The overall mean B/USR and B/BMSY in 2020 was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9) and 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.7), respectively. Average stock status declined from 1950 to around 2000 and has remained relatively stable since then. The change around 2000 followed the implementation of ITQs (individual transferable quotas) for the trawl fleet and the commencement of the synoptic trawl surveys. As of their last assessment, four stocks (Strait of Georgia Lingcod [Area 4B], coastwide Bocaccio, and inside and outside Quillback Rockfish) had a greater than 5% probability of being below their LRP (i.e., in the \" critical zone\"); Pacific Cod in Area 3CD had a 4.6% probability. Roughly one-third of stocks had a greater than 1 in 4 chance of being below their USR (i.e., in the \" cautious zone\"). Conversely, two-thirds of assessed groundfish stocks had a high (>75%) probability of being above the USR (i.e., in the \" healthy zone\").",

    "abstract": "The latency of spikes relative to a stimulus conveys sensory information across modalities. However, in most cases it remains unclear whether and how such latency codes are utilized by postsynaptic neurons. In the active electrosensory system of mormyrid fish, a latency code for stimulus amplitude in electroreceptor afferent nerve fibers (EAs) is hypothesized to be read out by a central reference provided by motor corollary discharge (CD). Here we demonstrate that CD enhances sensory responses in postsynaptic granular cells of the electrosensory lobe, but is not required for reading out EA input. Instead, diverse latency and spike count tuning across the EA population gives rise to graded information about stimulus amplitude that can be read out by standard integration of converging excitatory synaptic inputs. Inhibitory control over the temporal window of integration renders two granular cell subclasses differentially sensitive to information derived from relative spike latency versus spike count.",

    "abstract": "The complex interactions between gut microbiome and host or pathogen colonization resistance cannot solely be understood from community composition. Missing are causal relationships such as metabolic interactions among species to better understand what shapes the microbiome. Here, we focused on metabolic niches generated and occupied by the Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota consortium, a synthetic community composed of 12 members that is increasingly used as a model for the mouse gut microbiome. Combining mono-cultures and spent medium experiments with untargeted metabolomics uncovered broad metabolic diversity in the consortium, constituting a dense cross-feeding network with more than 100 pairwise interactions. Quantitative analysis of the cross-feeding network revealed distinct C and N food webs that highlight the two Bacteroidetes consortium members B. caecimuris and M. intestinale as primary suppliers of carbon, and a more diverse group as nitrogen providers. Cross-fed metabolites were mainly carboxylic acids, amino acids, and the so far not reported nucleobases. In particular the dicarboxylic acids malate and fumarate provided a strong physiological benefit to consumers, presumably as anaerobic electron acceptors. Isotopic tracer experiments validated the fate of a subset of cross-fed metabolites, in particular the conversion of the most abundant cross-fed compound succinate to butyrate. Thus, we show that this consortium is tailored to produce the anti-inflammatory metabolite butyrate. Overall, we provide evidence for metabolic niches generated and occupied by OMM members that lays a metabolic foundation to facilitate understanding of the more complex in vivo behavior of this consortium in the mouse gut.\n\nImportanceThis article maps out the cross-feeding network amongst 10 members of a synthetic consortium that is increasingly used as the model mouse gut microbiota. Combining metabolomics with in vitro cultivations, two dense networks of carbon and nitrogen exchange are described. The vast majority of the about 100 interactions are synergistic in nature, in several cases providing distinct physiological benefits to the recipient species. These networks lay the ground work towards understanding gut community dynamics and host-gut microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Diet-induced obesity (DIO) leads to dysfunctional feeding behavior. However, the precise molecular nodes underlying diet-induced dysregulation of satiety sensing and feeding motivation are poorly understood. The fruit fly is a simple genetic model system yet displays significant evolutionary conservation to mammalian nutrient sensing and energy balance. Using a longitudinal high sugar regime in Drosophila, we sought to address how lipid alteration in fat cells alters feeding behavior. We find that prolonged exposure to HSD degrades the hunger-driven feeding (HDF) response. Lipidomics analysis reveals that longitudinal exposure to HSD significantly alters whole body phospholipid profiles. By performing a systematic screen for phospholipid enzymes, we identify Pect as a critical regulator of hunger-driven feeding. Pect is a rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis pathway and the fly ortholog of human PCYT2. We show that disrupting Pect only in the fat body causes insulin-resistant phenotypes and a loss of hunger-driven feeding. Excitingly, we find that overexpression of Pect restores HSD-induced loss of hunger-driven feeding response. Strikingly human studies have noted a correlation between PCYT2/Pect levels and clinical obesity. Now, our unbiased studies in Drosophila provide specific genetic evidence for Pect in maintaining nutrient sensing during DIO. Our study provides novel insights into the role of phospholipids in interorgan communication of nutrient status.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=193 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472854v4_ufigA1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecf3eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b800f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@461a7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75651c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The Gorongosa fossil sites offer the first evidence of persistent woodlands and forests on the coastal margins of southeastern Africa during the Miocene, and an exceptional assemblage of fossil vertebrates including new species. Further work will allow the testing of hypotheses positing the formation of a northeast-southwest arid corridor isolating species on the eastern coastal forests from those elsewhere in Africa.\n\nBriefThe Miocene is a key time in the evolution of African mammals and their ecosystems encompassing hominine origins and the establishment of an arid corridor that isolated eastern Africas coastal forests.

    "abstract": "Linear photosynthetic electron flow (LEF) produces NADPH and generates a proton electrochemical potential gradient across the thylakoid membrane used to synthesize ATP, both of which are required for CO2 fixation. As cellular demand for ATP and NADPH are variable, cyclic electron flow (CEF) between PSI and cytochrome b6f complex (b6f) produces extra ATP. The b6f regulates LEF and CEF via photosynthetic control, which is a pH-dependent b6f slowdown of plastoquinol oxidation at the lumenal site. This protection mechanism is triggered at more alkaline lumen pH in the pgr1 mutant of the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana, carrying Pro194Leu in the b6f Rieske Iron-sulfur protein. In this work, we introduced pgr1 mutation in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (PETC-P171L). Consistent with pgr1 phenotype, PETC-P171L displayed an impaired NPQ induction along with slower photoautotrophic growth under high light conditions. Our data provides evidence that the {Delta}pH component in PETC-P171L is dependent on oxygen availability. Only under low oxygen conditions the {Delta}pH component was sufficient to trigger a phenotype in algal PETC-P171L where the mutant b6f was more restricted to oxidize the PQ pool and showed a diminished electron flow through the b6f complex.\n\nOne sentence summaryChange of PETC to P171L via site directed mutagenesis alters the pH dependency of the photosynthetic control mechanism",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are found in nerve terminals, synaptic vesicles, and synaptosomes, but it is unclear whether synaptic and cytosolic miRNA populations differ in Alzheimers disease (AD) or if synaptosomal miRNAs affect AD synapse activity. To address these questions, we generated synaptosomes and cytosolic fractions from postmortem brains of AD and unaffected control (UC) samples and analyzed them using a global Affymetrix miRNAs microarray platform. A group of miRNAs significantly differed (p<0.0001) with high fold changes variance (+/- >200-fold) in their expressions in different comparisons- 1) UC synaptosome vs UC cytosol, 2) AD synaptosomes vs AD cytosol, 3) AD cytosol vs UC cytosol, and 4) AD synaptosomes vs UC synaptosomes. MiRNAs data analysis revealed that some potential miRNAs were consistently different across sample groups.

The miR-501-3p, miR-502-3p and miR-877-5p were identified as potential synaptosomal miRNAs upregulated with disease progression based on AD Braak stages.

This study shows that three doses of the same synthetic peptide vaccine eliciting an exclusive CD8+ T cell response against one SARS-CoV-2 Spike epitope protected all mice against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, while only a second vaccination with this T cell vaccine was insufficient to provide protection. The third vaccine dose of the single T cell epitope peptide resulted in superior generation of effector-memory T cells in the circulation and tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, and these tertiary vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells were characterized by enhanced polyfunctional cytokine production. Moreover, fate mapping showed that a substantial fraction of the tertiary effector-memory CD8+ T cells developed from remigrated TRM cells. Thus, repeated booster vaccinations quantitatively and qualitatively improve the CD8+ T cell response leading to protection against otherwise lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nSummaryA third dose with a single T cell epitope-vaccine promotes a strong increase in tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and fully protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection, while single B cell epitope-eliciting vaccines are unable to provide protection.",

Here, we created next-generation isogenic Ogawa and Inaba V. cholerae challenge strains (ZChol strains) derived from a contemporary Zambian clinical isolate representative of current dominant pandemic V. cholerae. To minimize the risk of severe diarrhea these strains were rendered non-toxigenic, since antibody responses which limit V. cholerae colonization are the primary mechanism of immune protection. These strains did not cause diarrhea in infant mice and proved to accurately gauge reduction in intestinal colonization mediated by effective vaccination. They are also valuable as targets for measuring vibriocidal antibody responses. Using barcoded ZChol strains, we discovered that vaccination tightens the infection bottleneck without restricting pathogen expansion in vivo. ZChol strains have the potential to enhance the safety, relevance, and scope of future cholera vaccine challenge studies and be valuable reagents for studies of immunity to cholera.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistance emergence and selection have become major public health issues globally. The presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in natural and anthroposophical environments threatens to compromise the sustainability of care in human and animal populations. This study was undertaken to develop a simple model formalizing the selective impact of antibiotics and pollutants on the dynamics of bacterial resistance in water and use the model to analyze longitudinal spatiotemporal data collected in hospital and urban wastewaters. Longitudinal-sampling data were collected between 2012 and 2015 in four different locations in Haute-Savoie, France: hospital and urban wastewaters, before and after water-treatment plants. Concentration in three different types of compounds: 1) heavy metals 2) antibiotics and 3) surfactants; and abundance of 88 individual genes and mobile genetic elements, mostly conferring resistance to antibiotics, were simultaneously collected. A simple hypothesis-driven model describing the weekly ARB dynamics was proposed to fit available data by assuming normalized gene abundance to be proportional to ARB populations in water. Compounds impacts on the dynamics of 17 genes found in multiple sites were estimated. We found that while mercury and vancomycin had relevant effects on ARB dynamics, respectively positively affecting the dynamics of 10 and 12 identified genes, surfactants antagonistically affected genes dynamics (identified for three genes). This simple model enables analyzing the relationship between resistance-gene persistence in aquatic environments and specific compounds inherent to human activities. Applying our model to longitudinal data, we identified compounds that act as co-selectors for antibiotic resistance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe analyzed longitudinal wastewater resistance genes and environmental data\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a simple hypothesis-driven model to assess resistance selection\nC_LIO_LIMercury and vancomycin were key drivers of antibiotic resistance in wastewater\nC_LI",

Here, we use cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram analysis to visualize the dynamics of translation inside the prokaryote Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We first obtain an in-cell atomic model for the M. pneumoniae ribosome that reveals distinct extensions of ribosomal proteins. Classification then resolves thirteen ribosome states that differ in conformation and composition and reflect intermediates during translation. Based on these states, we animate translation elongation and demonstrate how antibiotics reshape the translation landscape inside cells. During translation elongation, ribosomes often arrange in a defined manner to form polysomes. By mapping the intracellular three-dimensional organization of translating ribosomes, we show that their association into polysomes exerts a local coordination mechanism that is mediated by the ribosomal protein L9. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of visualizing molecular processes at atomic detail inside cells.",

    "abstract": "The kinetics of DNA hybridisation are fundamental to biological processes and DNA-based technologies. However, the precise physical mechanisms that determine why different DNA sequences hybridise at different rates are not well understood. Secondary structure is one predictable factor that influences hybridisation rates but is not sufficient on its own to fully explain the observed sequence-dependent variance. Consequently, to achieve a good correlation with experimental data, current prediction algorithms require many parameters that provide little mechanistic insight into DNA hybridisation. In this context, we measured hybridisation rates of 43 different DNA sequences that are not predicted to form secondary structure and present a parsimonious physically justified model to quantify their hybridisation rates. Accounting only for the combinatorics of complementary nucleating interactions and their sequence-dependent stability, the model achieves good correlation with experiment with only two free parameters, thus providing new insight into the physical factors underpinning DNA hybridisation rates.",

Known BMCs exhibit liquid-like properties and are typically visualized on the scale of ~1 m. They have been studied mostly by microscopy, examining select individual proteins. Here, we investigate the global organization of native cytoplasm with quantitative proteomics, using differential pressure filtration, size exclusion, and dilution experiments. These assays reveal that BMCs form throughout the cytosplasm, predominantly at the mesoscale of ~100 nm. Our data indicate that at least 18% of the proteome is organized via such mesoscale BMCs, suggesting that cells widely employ dynamic liquid-like clustering to organize their cytoplasm, at surprisingly small length scales.",

    "abstract": "Proteome imbalance can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation which is associated with pathologies. Protein aggregation can also be an active, organized process and can be exploited by cells as a survival strategy. In adverse conditions, it is beneficial to deposit the proteins in a condensate rather degrading and resynthesizing. Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are biological condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), involving cellular components such as nucleic acids and proteins. LLPS is a regulated process, which when perturbed, can undergo a transition from a physiological liquid condensate to pathological solid-like protein aggregates.\n\nTo understand how the MLO-associated proteins (MLO-APs) behave during aging, we performed a comparative meta-analysis with age related proteome of C. elegans. We found that the MLO-APs are highly abundant throughout the lifespan. Interestingly, they are aggregating more in long-lived mutant worms compared to the age matched wildtype worms. GO term analysis revealed that the cell cycle and embryonic development are among the top enriched processes in addition to RNP components in insoluble proteome. Considering antagonistic pleotropic nature of these developmental genes and post mitotic status of C. elegans, we assume that these proteins phase transit during post development. As the organism ages, these MLO-APs either mature to become more insoluble or dissolve in uncontrolled manner. However, in the long-lived daf-2 mutant worms, the MLOs may attain protective states due to extended availability and association of molecular chaperones.",

Using simulated viromes, we displayed superior performance of vRhyme compared to available binning tools in constructing more complete and uncontaminated vMAGs. When applied to 10,601 viral scaffolds from human skin, vRhyme advanced our understanding of resident viruses, highlighted by identification of a Herelleviridae vMAG comprised of 22 scaffolds, and another vMAG encoding a nitrate reductase metabolic gene, representing near-complete genomes post-binning. vRhyme will enable a convention of binning uncultivated viral genomes and has the potential to transform metagenome-based viral ecology.",

    "abstract": "Designing entirely new protein structures remains challenging because we do not fully understand the biophysical determinants of folding stability. Yet some protein folds are easier to design than others. Previous work identified the 43-residue {square}{beta}{beta}{square} fold as especially challenging: the best designs had only a 2% success rate, compared to 39-87% success for other simple folds (1). This suggested the {square}{beta}{beta}{square} fold would be a useful model system for gaining a deeper understanding of folding stability determinants and for testing new protein design methods. Here, we designed over ten thousand new {square}{beta}{beta}{square} proteins and found over three thousand of them to fold into stable structures using a high-throughput protease-based assay. Nuclear magnetic resonance, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, circular dichroism, deep mutational scanning, and scrambled sequence control experiments indicated that our stable designs fold into their designed {square}{beta}{beta}{square} structures with exceptional stability for their small size. Our large dataset enabled us to quantify the influence of universal stability determinants including nonpolar burial, helix capping, and buried unsatisfied polar atoms, as well as stability determinants unique to the {square}{beta}{beta}{square} topology. Our work demonstrates how large-scale design and test cycles can solve challenging design problems while illuminating the biophysical determinants of folding.\n\nSignificanceMost computationally designed proteins fail to fold into their designed structures. This low success rate is a major obstacle to expanding the applications of protein design. In previous work, we discovered a small protein fold that was paradoxically challenging to design (only a 2% success rate) even though the fold itself is very simple. Here, we used a recently developed high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine the design rules for this simple fold. By designing over ten thousand proteins and experimentally measuring their folding stability, we discovered the key biophysical properties that determine the stability of these designs. Our results illustrate general lessons for protein design and also demonstrate how high-throughput stability studies can quantify the importance of different biophysical forces.",

    "abstract": "Cellular responses to stress can cause a similar change in some facets of fitness even if the stresses are different. Lactose as a sole carbon source for Escherichia coli is an established example: too little causes starvation while excessive lactose import causes toxicity as a side-effect. In an E. coli strain that is robust to osmotic and ionic differences in growth media, B REL606, the rate of antibiotic-tolerant persister formation is elevated in both starvation-inducing and toxicity-inducing concentrations of lactose in comparison to less stressful intermediate concentrations. Such similarities between starvation and toxification raise the question of how much the global stress response stimulon differs between them. We hypothesized that a common stress response is conserved between the two conditions, but that a previously shown threshold driving growth rate heterogeneity in a lactose-toxifying medium would reveal that the growing fraction of cells in that medium to be missing key stress responses that curb growth. To test this, we performed RNA-seq in three representative conditions for differential expression analysis. In comparison to nominally unstressed cultures, both stress conditions showed global shifts in gene expression, with informative similarities and differences. Functional analysis of pathways, gene ontology terms, and clusters of orthogonal groups revealed signatures of overflow metabolism, membrane component shifts, and altered cytosolic and periplasmic contents in toxified cultures. Starving cultures showed an increased tendency toward stringent response-like regulatory signatures. Along with other emerging evidence, our results show multiple possible pathways to stress responses, persistence, and possibly other phenotypes. These results suggest a set of overlapping responses that drives emergence of stress-tolerant phenotypes in diverse conditions.",

Here we used a rhesus macaque model of SIV/Mtb co-infection to study the early effects of acute SIV infection on CD4 T cells in pulmonary Mtb granulomas. Two weeks after SIV co-infection CD4 T cells were dramatically depleted from granulomas, before significant bacterial outgrowth, disease reactivation as measured by PET-CT imaging, or CD4 T cell loss in blood, airways, and lymph nodes. Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, CCR5-expressing, in granulomas were preferentially depleted by SIV infection. Moreover, CD4 T cells were preferentially depleted from the granuloma core and lymphocyte cuff relative to B cell-rich regions, and live imaging of granuloma explants showed that SIV co-infection reduced T cell motility. Thus, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells in pulmonary granulomas may be decimated before many patients even experience the first symptoms of acute HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are major pathogens of agricultural crops. Viral infections often start after the virus enters the outer layer of a tissue or surface and many successful viruses, after local replication in the infected tissue, are able to spread systemically. Quantitative details of virus dynamics in plants, however, have been poorly understood, in part, because of the lack of experimental methods allowing to accurately measure the degree of infection in individual plant tissues. Recently, by using flow cytometry and two different flourescently-labeled strains of the Tobacco etch virus (TEV), Venus and BFP, kinetics of viral infection of individual cells in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum plants was followed over time [1]. A simple mathematical model, assuming that viral spread occurs from lower to upper leaves, was fitted to these data. While the the original model could accurately describe the kinetics of viral spread locally and systemically, we also found that many alternative versions of the model, for example, if viral spread starts at upper leaves and progresses to lower leaves or when virus dissemination is stopped due to an immune response, provided fits of the data with reasonable quality, and yet with different parameter estimates. These results strongly suggest that experimental measurements of the virus infection in individual leaves may not be sufficient to identify the pathways of viral dissemination between different leaves and reasons for viral control; we propose experiments that may allow discrimination between the alternatives. By analyzing the kinetics of coinfection of individual cells by Venus and BFP strains of TEV we found a strong deviation from the random infection model, suggesting cooperation between the two strains when infecting plant cells. Importantly, we showed that many mathematical models on the kinetics of coinfection of cells with two strains could not adequately describe the data, and the best fit model needed to assume i) different susceptibility of uninfected cells to infection by two viruses locally in the leaf vs. systemically from other leaves, and ii) decrease in the infection rate depending on the fraction of uninfected cells which could be due to a systemic immune response. Our results thus demonstrate the difficulty in reaching definite conclusions from extensive and yet limited experimental data and provide evidence of potential cooperation between different viral variants infecting individual cells in plants.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how antimicrobial resistance spreads is critical for optimal application of new treatments. In the naturally competent human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics is mediated by recombination events in genes encoding the target proteins, resulting in reduced drug binding affinity. However, for the front-line antibiotic amoxicillin, the exact mechanism of resistance still needs to be elucidated. Through successive rounds of transformation with genomic DNA from a clinically resistant isolate, we followed amoxicillin resistance development. Using whole genome sequencing, we showed that multiple recombination events occurred at different loci during one round of transformation. We found examples of non-contiguous recombination, and demonstrated that this could occur either through multiple D-loop formation from one donor DNA molecule, or by the integration of multiple DNA fragments. We also show that the final minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) differs depending on recipient genome, explained by differences in the extent of recombination at key loci. Finally, through back transformations of mutant alleles and fluorescently labelled penicillin (bocillin-FL) binding assays, we confirm that pbp1a, pbp2b, pbp2x, and murM are the main resistance determinants for amoxicillin resistance, and that the order of allele uptake is important for successful resistance evolution. We conclude that recombination events are complex, and that this complexity contributes to the highly diverse genotypes of amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates.",

The overall proportion of ARG hits was similar to that found in temperate-zone rural water bodies with moderate human inputs.

    "abstract": "The increased propensity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) and exposure from HABs-cyanotoxin causes human toxicity. It has been associated with the progression of several diseases that encompass the liver, kidneys, and immune system. Recently, a strong association of cyano-HAB toxicity with the altered host gut microbiome has been shown. We tested the hypothesis that prior exposure to cyanotoxin microcystin may alter the microbiome and induce microbiome-host-resistome crosstalk. Using both wild-type and humanized mice, we show that the mice exposed to microcystin had an altered microbiome signature that harbored antimicrobial resistance genes. Host resistome phenotypes such as mefA, msrD, mel, ant6, and tet40 increased in diversity and relative abundance following microcystin exposure. Interestingly, the increased abundance of these genes was traced to resistance to common antibiotics such as tetracycline, macrolides, glycopeptide, and aminoglycosides, crucial for modern-day treatment for several diseases. Increased abundance of these genes was positively associated with increased expression of PD1, a T-cell homeostasis marker, and pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine IL-6 with a concomitant negative association with immunosurveillance markers IL7 and TLR2. Microcystin exposure also caused decreased TLR2, TLR4, and REG3G expressions, increased immunosenescence, and higher systemic levels of IL-6 in both wild-type and humanized mice. In conclusion, the results show a first-ever characterization of the host resistome of microcystin exposure and its connection to host immune status and antibiotic resistance. The results may be crucial for understanding the ability of exposed subjects to fight future bacterial infections and the progression of the debilitating disease in hospital settings.",

    "abstract": "Dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated through plasmids is a major global concern. Genomic epidemiology studies have shown varying success of different AMR plasmids during outbreaks, but the underlying reasons for these differences are unclear. Here, we investigated two Shigella plasmids (pKSR100 and pAPR100) that circulated in the same transmission network but had starkly contrasting epidemiological outcomes to identify plasmid features that may have contributed to the differences. We used plasmid comparative genomics to reveal divergence between the two plasmids in genes encoding AMR, SOS response alleviation, and conjugation. Experimental analyses revealed that these genomic differences corresponded with reduced conjugation rates for the epidemiologically successful pKSR100, but more extensive AMR, reduced fitness costs, and a reduced SOS response in the presence of antimicrobials, compared with the less successful pAPR100. The discrepant phenotypes between the two plasmids are consistent with the hypothesis that plasmid associated phenotypes contribute to determining the epidemiological outcome of AMR HGT and suggest that phenotypes relevant in responding to antimicrobial pressure and fitness impact may be more important than those around conjugation in this setting. Plasmid phenotypes could thus be valuable tools in conjunction with genomic epidemiology for predicting AMR dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Methylxanthines have a rich history as therapeutics and pharmaceuticals. However, natural dimethyl- and monomethylxanthines are difficult to produce synthetically, which has limited further exploration of these compounds in medicinal applications. A biosynthetic method for production of methylxanthines from whole cell biocatalysts is an attractive alternative. The bacterium Pseudomonas putida CBB5 contains a set of five enzymes, NdmABCDE, which are responsible for methylxanthine metabolism via N-demethylation to xanthine. The recent elucidation of the crystal structures of NdmA and NdmB, which remove the N1- and N3-methyl groups of caffeine, respectively, has opened new avenues to create biocatalysts for methylxanthine production. We have created a set of fifteen N-demethylase mutants and expressed them in E. coli BL21(DE3) as whole cell biocatalysts. The activity of each mutant was characterized for their affinity towards caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. Two mutant enzymes in particular, labeled NdmA3 and NdmA4, both exhibited selectivity towards the N3-methyl group instead of the N1-methyl group. We also discovered that specific point mutations in NdmD resulted in the ability to tune the rate of the N-demethylase reaction. These new enzymes provide the capability of producing high-value methylxanthines, such as paraxanthine and 1-methylxanthine, through a biocatalytic route.",

    "abstract": "Wound infections are often polymicrobial in nature and are associated with poor disease prognoses. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are among the top five most cultured pathogens from wound infections. However, little is known about the polymicrobial interactions between E. coli and S. aureus during wound infections. In this study, we show that E. coli kills S. aureus both in vitro and in a mouse excisional wound model via the genotoxin, colibactin. We also show that the BarA-UvrY two component system (TCS) is a novel regulator of the pks island, which acts through the carbon storage global regulatory (Csr) system. Together, our data demonstrate the role of colibactin in inter-species competition and show that it is regulated by BarA-UvrY TCS, a previously uncharacterized regulator of the pks island.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular small RNAs (sRNA) are abundant in many biofluids, but little is known about their mechanisms of transport and stability in RNase-rich environments. We previously reported that high-density lipoproteins (HDL) of mice were enriched with multiple classes of sRNA derived from the endogenous transcriptome, but also exogenous organisms. Here, we show that human HDL transports tRNA-derived sRNAs (tDRs) from host and non-host species which were found to be altered in human atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that HDL binds to tDRs through apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and these interactions are conferred by RNA-specific features. We tested this using microscale thermophoresis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays and found that HDL bind tDRs and other single-stranded sRNAs with strong affinity, but not doublestranded RNA or DNA. Natural and synthetic RNA modifications influenced tDR binding to HDL. Reconstituted HDL bound tDRs only in the presence of apoA-I and purified apoA-I alone was sufficient for binding sRNA. Conversely, phosphatidylcholine vesicles did not bind tDRs. In summary, HDL preferentially binds to single-stranded sRNAs likely through non-ionic interactions with apoA-I. These studies highlight binding properties that likely enable extracellular RNA communication and provide a foundation for future studies to manipulate HDL-sRNA for therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat disease.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a DNA damage sensor and contributes to both DNA repair and cell death processes. However, how PARP-1 signaling is regulated to switch its function from DNA repair to cell death remains largely unknown. Here, we found that PARP-1 plays a central role in alkylating agent-induced PARthanatic cancer cell death. Lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B) was identified as a key cell death effector in PARthanatos. Knockout of KDM6B or loss of KDM6B demethylase activity conferred cancer cells resistance to PARthanatic cell death in response to alkylating agents. Mechanistically, KDM6B knockout suppressed methylation at the promoter of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) to enhance MGMT expression and its direct DNA repair function, thereby inhibiting DNA damage-evoked PARP-1 hyperactivation and subsequent cell death. Moreover, KDM6B knockout triggered sustained Chk1 phosphorylation and activated a second repair machinery to fix DNA damage evading from MGMT repair. Inhibition of MGMT or checkpoint response re-sensitized KDM6B deficient cells to PARthanatos induced by alkylating agents. These findings provide new molecular insights into epigenetic regulation of PARP-1 signaling mediating DNA repair or cell death and identify KDM6B as a biomarker for prediction of cancer cell vulnerability to alkylating agent treatment.",

    "abstract": "Developmental control of jaw size is crucial to prevent disease and facilitate evolution. We have shown that species-specific differences in jaw size are established by neural crest mesenchyme (NCM), which are the jaw progenitors that migrate into the mandibular primordia. NCM relies on multiple signaling molecules including Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) to mediate interactions with mandibular epithelium that facilitate outgrowth of the jaws. SHH signaling is known to promote outgrowth and so we tested if differential regulation of the SHH pathway can account for species-specific variation in mandibular primordia size. We analyze gene expression of SHH pathway members in duck, chick, and quail, and find higher transcriptional activation in the larger mandibular primordia of duck relative to those of chick and quail. We generate quail-duck chimeras and demonstrate that such activation is NCM-mediated. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments reveal a species-specific response to SHH signaling, with the target Gas1 being most sensitive to manipulations. Gas1 overexpression and knockdown in NCM alters cell number and/or mandibular primordia size. Our work suggests that NCM-mediated changes in SHH signaling may modulate jaw size during development, disease, and evolution.\n\nSummary StatementWe have determined that Gas1, which is a component of the SHH signaling pathway, plays a key role in the development and evolution of jaw size.",

To access representatives of locally and globally distinct wild plants and investigate their viral diversity, we extracted and sequenced dsRNA from leaves from 16 healthy oak and conifer trees in the UC Davis Arboretum (Davis, California). From de novo assemblies, we recovered 389 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences from 384 putative viral species, and a further 580 putative viral contigs were identified with virus prediction software followed by manual confirmation of virus annotation. Based on similarity to known viruses, most recovered viruses were predicted to infect plants or fungi, with the highest diversity and abundance observed in the Totiviridae and Mitoviridae families. Phyllosphere viral community composition differed significantly by host plant phylogeny, suggesting the potential for host-specific viromes. The phyllosphere viral community of one oak tree differed substantially from other oak viral communities and contained a greater proportion of putative mycoviral sequences, potentially due to the trees more advanced senescence at the time of sampling. These results suggest that oaks and conifers harbor a vast diversity of viruses with as-yet unknown roles in plant health and phyllosphere microbial ecology.",

Here, we investigate the evolutionary, genetic, and developmental mechanisms driving tail-length differences between forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We first show that long-tailed forest mice perform better in an arboreal locomotion assay, consistent with tails being important for balance during climbing. The long tails of these forest mice consist of both longer and more caudal vertebrae than prairie mice. Using quantitative genetics, we identify six genomic regions that contribute to differences in total tail length, three of which associate with vertebra length and the other three with vertebra number. For all six loci, the forest allele increases tail length, consistent with the cumulative effect of natural selection. Two of the genomic regions associated with variation in vertebra number contain Hox gene clusters. Of those, we find an allele-specific decrease in Hoxd13 expression in the embryonic tail bud of long-tailed forest mice, consistent with its role in axial elongation. Additionally, we find that forest embryos have more presomitic mesoderm than prairie embryos, and that this correlates with an increase in the number of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), which are modulated by Hox13 paralogs. Together, these results suggest a role for Hoxd13 in the development of natural variation in adaptive morphology on a microevolutionary timescale.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIn deer mice, the long-tailed forest ecotype outperforms the short-tailed prairie ecotype in climbing, consistent with the tails role in balance.\nC_LIO_LILong tails are due to mutations on distinct chromosomes that affect either length or number of caudal vertebrae.\nC_LIO_LIQTL mapping identifies Hox clusters, one gene of which - Hoxd13 - shows low allele-specific expression in the embryonic tail bud of forest mice.\nC_LIO_LIForest mouse embryos have a larger presomitic mesoderm (PSM), likely mediated by a larger progenitor population (NMPs) and lower Hoxd13 levels.\nC_LI",

Here, we present 2FAST2Q, a versatile and intuitive standalone program capable of extracting and counting feature occurrences in FASTQ files. 2FAST2Q can be used in any experimental setup that requires feature extraction from raw reads, being able to quickly handle mismatch alignments, nucleotide wise Phred score filtering, custom read trimming, and sequence searching within a single program. Using published CRISPRi datasets in which Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene essentiality, as well as host-cell sensitivity towards SARS-CoV2 infectivity were tested, we demonstrate that 2FAST2Q efficiently recapitulates the output in read counts per provided feature as with traditional pipelines. Moreover, we show how different FASTQ read filtering parameters impact downstream analysis, and suggest a default usage protocol. 2FAST2Q has a familiar user interface and uses a custom sequence mismatch search algorithm, taking advantage of Pythons numba module JIT runtime speeds. It is thus easier to use and faster than currently available tools, efficiently processing large CRISPRi-Seq or random-barcode sequencing datasets on any up-to-date laptop. 2FAST2Q is available as an executable file for all current operating systems without installation and as a Python3 module on the PyPI repository (available at https://veeninglab.com/2fast2q).

The p53 pathway has therefore served as the focus for drug-discovery efforts. p53 is negatively regulated by hDMX and hDM2; prior studies have identified 14-3-3 proteins as hDMX and hDM2 client proteins. 14-3-3 proteins are adaptor proteins that modulate localisation, degradation and interactions of their targets in response to phosphorylation. Thus 14-3-3 proteins may indirectly modulate the interaction between hDMX or hDM2 and p53 and represent potential targets for modulation of the p53 pathway. In this manuscript we report on the biophysical and structural characterization of peptide/protein interactions that are representative of the interaction between 14-3-3 and hDMX or hDM2. The data establish that proximal phosphosites spaced [~]20-25 residues apart in both hDMX and hDM2 co-operate to facilitate high-affinity 14-3-3 binding and provide structural insight that can be utilized in future stabilizer/inhibitor discovery efforts.",

Under all nutrient conditions, intra-colony channel width was observed to increase non-linearly with radial distance from the centre of the biofilm. Notably, the channels were around 25% wider at the centre of glucose-limited biofilms compared to ammonium-limited biofilms. Channel density also differed in colonies grown on rich and minimal media, with the former creating a network of tightly packed channels and the latter leading to well-separated, wider channels with defined edges.

The DamX bifunctional division protein, which is essential for UPEC filamentation, was initially non-localized but then assembled at multiple division sites in the filaments prior to division. DamX rings maintained consistent thickness during constriction and remained at the septum until after membrane fusion was completed, like in rod cell division. Our findings suggest a mechanism involving regulated dissipation of DamX, leading to division arrest and filamentation, followed by its reassembly into division rings to promote UPEC dispersal and survival during infection.",

    "abstract": "1Cold and nutrient activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) is capable of increasing systemic energy expenditure via uncoupled respiration and secretion of endocrine factors thereby protecting mice against diet-induced obesity and improving insulin response and glucose tolerance in men. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been identified as fine tuning regulators of cellular function. While certain lncRNAs have been functionally characterised in adipose tissue, their overall contribution in the activation of BAT remains elusive. We identified lncRNAs correlating to inter-scapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) function in high fat diet (HFD) and cold stressed mice. We focused on Gm15551 which has an adipose tissue specific expression profile, is highly upregulated during adipogenesis and downregulated by {beta}-adrenergic activation in mature adipocytes. Albeit we performed comprehensive transcriptional and adipocyte physiology profiling in vitro and in vivo, we could not detect an effect of gain or loss of function of Gm15551.",

    "abstract": "Current therapies for Fabry disease are based on reversing intra-cellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or chaperone-mediated stabilization of the defective enzyme, thereby alleviating lysosome dysfunction. However, their effect in the reversal of endorgan damage, like kidney injury and chronic kidney disease remains unclear. First, ultrastructural analysis of serial human kidney biopsies showed that longterm use of ERT reduced Gb3 accumulation in podocytes but did not reverse podocyte injury. Then, a CRISPR/CAS9-mediated -Galactosidase knockout podocyte cell line confirmed ERT-mediated reversal of Gb3 accumulation without resolution of lysosomal dysfunction. Transcriptome-based connectivity mapping and SILAC-based quantitative proteomics identified alpha-synuclein (SNCA) accumulation as a key event mediating podocyte injury. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SNCA improved lysosomal structure and function in Fabry podocytes, exceeding the benefits of ERT. Together, this work reconceptualizes Fabry-associated cell injury beyond Gb3 accumulation, and introduces SNCA modulation as a potential intervention, especially for patients with Fabry nephropathy.",

A canonical complex centered around the conserved RNA-binding protein family CPEB has been shown to be responsible for this process. We have previously reported evidence for an alternative non-canonical, CPEB-independent complex in Drosophila, of which the RNA-interference factor Dicer-2 is a component. Here, we investigate Dicer-2 mRNA targets and protein co-factors in cytoplasmic polyadenylation. Using RIP-Seq analysis we identify hundreds of novel Dicer-2 target transcripts, [~]50% of which were previously found as targets of the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase Wispy, suggesting widespread roles of Dicer-2 in cytoplasmic polyadenylation. Large-scale immunoprecipitation revealed Ataxin-2 and Twenty-four among the high-confidence interactors of Dicer-2. Functional analysis indicate that both factors form an RNA-independent complex with Dicer-2, and are required for cytoplasmic polyadenylation of Dicer-2 targets. Our results reveal the composition of a novel cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex that operates during Drosophila early embryogenesis.",

Moreover, increased levels of cGMP were detected. The translational readthrough inducing drug (TRID) PTC124 was investigated as a potential therapeutic. LCA4 retinal organoids exhibited rescue of AIPL1 and PDE6; however, the level of full-length, functional AIPL1 induced through PTC124 treatment was insufficient to reduce cGMP levels and fully rescue the LCA4 phenotype.

The nature and regulation of CCAN assembly, interactions, and dynamics required to facilitate changing centromere properties and requirements remain to be fully elucidated. The CENP-LN CCAN sub-complex displays a unique cell cycle-dependent localization behavior, peaking in S phase. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of CENP-L and CENP-N controls CENP-LN complex formation and localization in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of either CENP-L or CENP-N or simultaneously preventing phosphorylation of both proteins prevents CENP-LN localization and disrupts chromosome segregation. Together, our work suggests that cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critical for CENP-LN complex recruitment and dynamics at centromeres to enable cell cycle-dependent CCAN reorganization.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic studies of how protein ubiquitylation regulates the cell cycle, in particular during mitosis, has provided unique insights which have contributed to the emergence of the  Ubiquitin code. In contrast to RING E3 ubiquitin ligases such as the APC/c ligase complex, the contribution of other E3 ligase families during cell cycle progression remains less well understood. Similarly, the contribution of ubiquitin chain types beyond homotypic K48 chains in S-phase or branched K11/K48 chains assembled by APC/c during mitosis, also remains to be fully determined. Our recent findings that HECTD1 ubiquitin ligase activity assembles branched K29/K48 ubiquitin linkages prompted us to evaluate its function during the cell cycle. We used transient knockdown and genetic knockout to show that HECTD1 depletion in HEK293T and HeLa cells decreases cell proliferation and we established that this is mediated through loss of its ubiquitin ligase activity. Interestingly, we found that HECTD1 depletion increases the proportion of cells with aligned chromosomes (Prometa/Metaphase). We confirmed this molecularly using phospho-Histone H3 (Ser28) as a marker of mitosis. Time-lapse microscopy of NEBD to anaphase onset established that HECTD1-depleted cells take on average longer to go through mitosis. To explore the mechanisms involved, we used proteomics to explore the endogenous HECTD1 interactome in mitosis and validated the Mitosis Checkpoint Complex protein BUB3 as a novel HECTD1 interactor. In line with this, we found that HECTD1 depletion reduces the activity of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint. Overall, our data suggests a novel role for HECTD1 ubiquitin ligase activity in mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1-3 regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. These three enzymes are targets for cancer chemotherapy and are studied for the treatment of immune disorders and neurodegeneration, but there is a lack of selective pharmacological tool compounds to unravel their individual roles. Potent inhibitors of HDACs 1-3 often display slow-binding kinetics, which causes a delay in inhibitor-enzyme equilibration and may affect assay readout. Here, we compare the potency and selectivity of slow-binding inhibitors measured by discontinuous and continuous assays. We find that entinostat, a clinical candidate, inhibits HDACs 1-3 by a two-step, slow-binding mechanism with lower potencies than previously reported. In addition, we show that RGFP966, commercialized as HDAC3-selective probe, is a slow-binding inhibitor with inhibitor constants of 57 nM, 31 nM, and 13 nM against HDACs 1-3, respectively. These data highlight a need for thorough kinetic investigation in the development of selective HDAC probes.\n\nTable of Contents artwork\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473277v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b1ef16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c79359org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ae077org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6ad25_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Some species possess the dimeric RC-LH1 complex with an additional polypeptide PufX, representing the largest photosynthetic complex in anoxygenic phototrophs. However, the details of the architecture and assembly mechanism of the RC-LH1 dimer are unclear. Here we report seven cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of RC-LH1 supercomplexes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Our structures reveal that two PufX polypeptides are positioned in the center of the S-shaped RC-LH1 dimer, interlocking association between the components and mediating RC-LH1 dimerization. Moreover, we identify a new transmembrane peptide, designated PufY, which is located between the RC and LH1 subunits near the LH1 opening. PufY binds a quinone molecule and prevents LH1 subunits from completely encircling the RC, creating a channel for quinone/quinol exchange. Genetic mutagenesis, cryo-EM structures, and computational simulations enable a mechanistic understanding of the assembly and electron transport pathways of the RC-LH1 dimer and elucidate the roles of individual components in ensuring the structural and functional integrity of the photosynthetic supercomplex.",

Regression analysis was used to map regional neural response profiles to different social features. Multivariate pattern analysis was then utilized to establish the spatial specificity of these responses. The results revealed a gradient in the processing of social information in the brain. Posterior temporal and occipital regions were broadly tuned to most social dimensions and the classifier revealed that these responses showed spatial specificity for social dimensions; in contrast Heschl gyri and parietal areas were also broadly associated with different social signals, yet the spatial patterns of responses did not differentiate social dimensions. Frontal and subcortical regions responded only to a limited number of social dimensions and the spatial response patterns did not differentiate social dimension.

However, when deciding to help others in danger, one must consider not only their distress, but also the risk to oneself. Whereas the role of self-defence in helping has been overlooked in human research, studies in other animals indicate defensive responses are necessary for the protection of conspecifics. In this pre-registered study (N=49), we demonstrate that human defensive neural circuits are implicated in helping others under threat. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while deciding whether to help another participant avoid aversive electrical shocks, at the risk of also being shocked. We found that higher engagement of neural circuits that coordinate fast escape from self-directed danger (including the insula, PAG and ACC) facilitated decisions to help others. Importantly, using Representational Similarity Analysis, we found that the strength with which the amygdala and insula uniquely represented the threat to oneself (and not the others distress) predicted helping. Our findings indicate that in humans, as other mammals, defensive mechanisms play a greater role in helping behaviour than previously understood.",

    "abstract": "Working memory allows us to retain visual information to guide upcoming future behavior. In line with this future-oriented purpose of working memory, recent studies have shown that action planning occurs during encoding and retention of a single visual item, for which the upcoming action is certain. We asked whether and how this extends to multi-item visual working memory, when visual representations serve the potential future. Human participants performed a visual working memory task with a memory-load manipulation (one/two/four items), and a delayed orientation-reproduction report (of one item). We measured EEG to track 15-25 Hz beta activity in electrodes contralateral to the required response hand - a canonical marker of action planning. We show an attenuation of beta activity, not only in load one (with one certain future action), but also in load two (with two potential future actions), compared to load four (with low prospective-action certainty). Moreover, in load two, potential action planning occurs regardless whether both visual items afford similar or dissimilar manual responses; and it predicts the speed of ensuing memory-guided behavior. This shows that potential action planning occurs during multi-item visual working memory, and brings the perspective that working memory helps us prepare for the potential future.",

    "abstract": "Sequence variation in enhancers, a class of cis-regulatory elements that control cell type-specific gene transcription, contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations. Enhancers are short DNA sequences ([~]200 bp) composed of multiple binding sites (4-10 bp) for transcription factors (TFs). The transcriptional regulatory activity of an enhancer is encoded by the type, number, and distribution of TF binding sites that it contains. However, the sequence determinants of TF binding to enhancers and the relationship between TF binding and enhancer activity are complex, and thus it remains difficult to predict the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function. Here, we generate allele-specific maps of TF binding and enhancer activity in fibroblasts from a panel of F1 hybrid mice that have a high frequency of sequence variants. We identified thousands of enhancers that exhibit differences in TF binding and/or activity between alleles and use these data to define features of sequence variants that are most likely to impact enhancer function. Our data demonstrate a critical role for AP-1 TFs at many fibroblast enhancers, reveal a hierarchical relationship between AP-1 and TEAD TF binding at enhancers, and delineate the nature of sequence variants that contribute to AP-1 TF binding. These data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments to date of the impact of sequence variation on enhancer function in chromatin, with implications for identifying functional cis-regulatory variation in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Birdsong plays an important role in mate attraction and territorial defense. Many birds, especially Passerines, produce varying sequences of multiple notes resulting in complex songs. Studying the diversity of notes within these songs can give insights into an individuals reproductive fitness. We first looked at the previously described and commonly used diversity measures to understand the possible case-specific limitations. We then developed a new diversity measure-Song Richness Index (SRI). We compared SRI with three measures of diversity using all possible combinations of notes to understand the case-specific advantages and limitations of all approaches. Simulating all possible combinations gave us insights into how each diversity measure works in a real scenario. SRI showed an advantage over conventional measures of diversity like Note Diversity Index (NDI), Shannons Equitability (SH), and Simpsons Diversity (SI), especially in the cases where songs are made up of only one type of repetitive note.",

    "abstract": "Gene co-expression networks can be used to infer functional relationships between genes, but they do not work well for all genes. We investigated whether DNA methylation can provide complementary information for such genes. We first carried out an eQTM meta-analysis of 3,574 gene expression and methylation samples from blood, brain and nasal epithelial brushed cells to identify links between methylated CpG sites and genes. This revealed 6,067 significant eQTM genes, and we observed that histone modification information is predictive of both eQTM direction and presence, enabling us to link many CpG sites to genes. We then generated a co-methylation network - MethylationNetwork - using 27,720 publicly available methylation profiles and integrated it with a public RNA-seq co-expression dataset of 31,499 samples. Here, we observed that MethylationNetwork can identify experimentally validated interacting pairs of genes that could not be identified in the RNA-seq datasets. We then developed a novel integration pipeline based on CCA and used the integrated methylation and gene networks to predict gene pairs reported in the STRING database. The integrated network showed significantly improved prediction performance compared to using a DNA co-methylation or a gene co-expression network alone. This is the first study to integrate data from two -omics layers from unmatched public samples across different tissues and diseases, and our results highlight the issues and potential of integrating public datasets from multiple molecular phenotypes. The eQTMs we identified can be used as an annotation resource for epigenome-wide association, and we believe that our integration pipeline can be used as a framework for future -omics integration analyses of public datasets.\n\nWe provide supporting materials and results, including the harmonized DNA methylation data from multiple tissues and diseases in https://data.harmjanwestra.nl/comethylation/, the discovered and predicted eQTMs, the corresponding CCA components and the trained prediction models in a Zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/record/4666994). We provide notebooks to facilitate use of the proposed pipeline in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/molgenis/methylationnetwork).",
