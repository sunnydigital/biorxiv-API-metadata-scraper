    "abstract": "Protein homeostasis is crucial for viability of all organisms, and mutations that enhance protein aggregation cause different human pathologies, including polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, such as some spinocerebellar ataxias or Huntington disease. Here, we report that neuronal Stomatin-like protein UNC-1 protects against aggregation of prone-to-aggregate proteins, like polyQs, -synuclein and {beta}-amyloid, in C. elegans. UNC-1, in IL2 neurons, antagonizes the function of the cytosolic sulfotransferase SSU-1 in neurohormonal signalling from ASJ neurons. The target of this hormone is the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-1, which acts cell-autonomously to protect from aggregation in muscles. A second nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12, functions oppositely to NHR-1 to maintain protein homeostasis. Transcriptomics analyses reveal deep changes in the expression of genes involved in fat metabolism, in unc-1 mutants, which are regulated by NHR-1. This suggest that fat metabolism changes, controlled by neurohormonal signalling, contributes to modulate protein homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The Marburg and Ebola filoviruses cause a severe, often fatal, disease in humans and nonhuman primates but have only subclinical effects in bats, including Egyptian rousettes, which are a natural reservoir of Marburg virus. A fundamental question is why these viruses are highly pathogenic in humans but fail to cause disease in bats. To understand how bats resist the disease caused by filoviruses, we infected one cohort of Egyptian rousette bats with Marburg virus and another cohort with Ebola virus and harvested multiple tissues for mRNA expression analysis. While virus transcripts were found primarily in the liver, Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed coordinated changes across multiple tissues. Gene signatures in kidney and liver pointed at induction of vasodilation, reduction of coagulation and changes in the regulation of iron metabolism. Signatures of immune response detected in spleen and liver indicated a robust anti-inflammatory state signified by macrophages in the M2 state and an active T cell response. Many of the responsive genes were found to be evolutionarily divergent, providing a framework for understanding the differences in outcomes of filovirus infections between bats and humans. In this study, we outline multiple interconnected pathways that respond to infection by MARV and EBOV, providing insights into the complexity of the mechanisms that enable bats to resist the disease caused by filoviral infections. The results have the potential to aid in the development of new strategies to effectively mitigate and treat the disease caused by these viruses in humans.",

    "abstract": "A key question in theoretical neuroscience is the relation between the connectivity structure and the collective dynamics of a network of neurons. Here we study the connectivity-dynamics relation as reflected in the distribution of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the dynamic fluctuations of the neuronal activities, which is closely related to the networks Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the associated effective dimensionality. We consider the spontaneous fluctuations around a steady state in a randomly connected recurrent network of stochastic neurons. An exact analytical expression for the covariance eigenvalue distribution in the large-network limit can be obtained using results from random matrices. The distribution has a finitely supported smooth bulk spectrum and exhibits an approximate power-law tail for coupling matrices near the critical edge. We generalize the results to include connectivity motifs and discuss extensions to Excitatory-Inhibitory networks. The theoretical results are compared with those from finite-size networks and and the effects of temporal and spatial sampling are studied. Preliminary application to whole-brain imaging data is presented. Using simple connectivity models, our work provides theoretical predictions for the covariance spectrum, a fundamental property of recurrent neuronal dynamics, that can be compared with experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is a data transformation technique widely used in various fields of genomics research. The application of dimensionality reduction to genotype data is known to capture genetic similarity between individuals, and is used for visualization of genetic variation, identification of population structure as well as ancestry mapping. Among frequently used methods are PCA, which is a linear transform that often misses more fine-scale structures, and neighbor-graph based methods which focus on local relationships rather than large-scale patterns.\n\nDeep learning models are a type of nonlinear machine learning method in which the features used in data transformation are decided by the model in a data-driven manner, rather than by the researcher, and have been shown to present a promising alternative to traditional statistical methods for various applications in omics research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on a convolutional autoencoder architecture for dimensionality reduction of genotype data.\n\nUsing a highly diverse cohort of human samples, we demonstrate that the model can identify population clusters and provide richer visual information in comparison to PCA, while preserving global geometry to a higher extent than t-SNE and UMAP. We also discuss the use of the methodology for more general characterization of genotype data, showing that models of a similar architecture can be used as a genetic clustering method, comparing results to the ADMIXTURE software frequently used in population genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "A framework to pinpoint the scope of unconscious processing is critical to improve our models of visual consciousness. Previous research observed brain signatures of unconscious processing in visual cortex but these were not reliably identified. Further, whether unconscious content is represented in high-level stages of the ventral visual stream and linked parieto-frontal areas remains unknown. Using a within-subject, high-precision fMRI approach, we show that unconscious contents can be decoded from multivoxel patterns that are highly distributed alongside the ventral visual pathway and also involving parieto-frontal substrates. Classifiers trained with multivoxel patterns of conscious items generalised to predict the unconscious counterparts, indicating that their neural representations overlap. These findings suggest revisions to models of consciousness such as the neuronal global workspace. We then provide a computational simulation of visual processing/representation without perceptual sensitivity by using deep neural networks performing a similar visual task. The work provides a framework for pinpointing the representation of unconscious knowledge across different task domains.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drivers are selfish genetic elements that manipulate meiosis to increase their transmission to the next generation to the detriment of the rest of the genome. One example is the t haplotype in house mice, which is a naturally occurring meiotic driver with deleterious traits--poor fitness in polyandrous matings and homozygote inviability or infertility--that prevent its fixation. Recently, we discovered and validated a novel effect of t in a long-term field study on free-living wild house mice and with experiments: t-carriers are more likely to disperse. Here, we ask what known traits of the t haplotype can select for a difference in dispersal between t-carriers and wildtype mice. To that end, we built individual-based models with dispersal loci on the t and the homologous wildtype chromosomes. We also allow for density-dependent expression of these loci. The t haplotype consistently evolves to increase the dispersal propensity of its carriers, particularly at high densities. By examining variants of the model that modify different costs caused by t, we show that the increase in dispersal is driven by the deleterious traits of t, disadvantage in polyandrous matings and lethal homozygosity or male sterility. Finally, we show that an increase in driver-carrier dispersal can evolve across a range of values in driver strength and disadvantages.",

During the time necessary to perform a single acquisition, it is likely that uncontrollable factors alter the validity of the initial mass calibration of the instrument, resulting in mass errors of magnitude significantly larger than their expected values. This phenomenon has a two-fold detrimental effect: a) it reduces the ability to interpret the results based on the observed signals, b) it can affect the quality of the observed signal spatial distributions.\n\nResultsWe present a post-acquisition computational method capable of reducing the observed mass drift by up to 60 ppm in biological samples, exploiting the presence of typical molecules with a known mass-to-charge ratio. The procedure, tested on time-of-flight (TOF) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry analyzers interfaced to a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) source, improves the molecular annotation quality and the spatial distributions of the detected ions.\n\nConclusionThe presented method represents a robust and accurate tool for performing post-acquisition mass recalibration of DESI-MSI datasets and can help to increase the reliability of the molecular assignment and the data quality.",

    "abstract": "Biofiltration processes help to remove trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) both in wastewater and drinking water treatment systems. However, the detailed TOrCs biotransformation mechanisms as well as the underlying drivers behind the variability of site specific transformation processes remain elusive. In this study, we used laboratory batch incubations to investigate the biotransformation of 51 TOrCs in eight bioactive filter materials of different origins treating a range of waters, from wastewater effluents to drinking water. Microscopy, 16S rRNA amplicon and whole metagenome sequencing for assessing associations between the biotransformation rate constants, microbial composition and genetic potential complemented chemical analysis. We observed strong differences in the mean global removal of TOrCs between the individual sand filters (-1.4% to 58%), which were mirrored in overall biomass, microbial community composition, and enzyme encoding genes. From the six investigated biomass markers, ATP turned out to be a major predictor of the mean global biotransformation rate, while compound specific biotransformations were correlated with the microbial community composition. High biomass ecosystems were indicated in our systems by a dominance of Nitrospirae, but individual TOrC biotransformation was statistically connected to rare taxa (< 2%) such as Hydrogenophaga, or indiviudal functions such as the enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoding genes. In general, this study provides new insights into so far rarely addressed variability of TOrCs biotransformation. We propose novel biological indicators for the removal performance of TOrCs in biofiltration systems, highlighting the role of living biomass in predicting and normalizing the global transformation, and the role of the microbial community for the individual transformation of TOrCs in engineered and natural systems.\n\nContribution to the Field StatementTrace organic chemicals (TOrCs) are an emerging problem in the aquatic environment that has attracted global attention over the last decade. Recent research efforts on this topic have increased our knowledge on the transformation of TOrCs and various technologies have been developed to improve their removal. In this study, we investigated a wide range of biotransformation of TOrCs by eight sand filter materials from wastewater and water treatment plants. Biotransformation rate constants were calculated using first-order kinetics to evaluate TOrC removal performance. We reevaluated the role of biomass and could thus explain a greater part of the global TOrC removal performance. The remaining variation in removal rates of individual compounds correlated with the microbiome of the biofilter. Rare biosphere lineages and specific enzyme categories genes were correlated with the removal of certain compounds. In summary, our research identified future indicators for successful biotransformation of TOrCs in biofilter systems.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful tool for studying G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as they can be functionally coupled to its pheromone response pathway. However, some exogenous GPCRs, including the mu opioid receptor, are non-functional in yeast, which may be due to the presence of the fungal sterol ergosterol instead of the animal sterol cholesterol. We engineered yeast to produce cholesterol and introduced the human mu opioid receptor, creating an opioid biosensor capable of detecting the peptide DAMGO at an EC50 of 62 nM and the opiate morphine at an EC50 of 882 nM. Furthermore, introducing mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors from diverse vertebrates consistently yielded active opioid biosensors that both recapitulated expected agonist binding profiles with EC50s as low as 2.5 nM and were inhibited by the antagonist naltrexone. Additionally, clinically relevant human mu opioid receptor alleles, or variants with terminal mutations, resulted in biosensors that largely displayed the expected changes in activity. We also tested mu opioid receptor-based biosensors with systematically adjusted biosynthetic intermediates of cholesterol, enabling us to relate sterol profiles with biosensor sensitivity. Finally, cholesterol-producing and sterol intermediate biosensor backgrounds were applied to other human GPCRs, resulting in SSTR5, 5-HTR4, FPR1 and NPY1R signaling with varying degrees of cholesterol dependence. Our sterol-optimized platform will be a valuable tool in generating human GPCR-based biosensors, aiding in ongoing receptor deorphanization efforts, and providing a framework for high-throughput screening of receptors and effectors.",

The accuracy of these responses relies on the ability of cells to discriminate between signal and noise. How cells filter noise in signaling pathways is not well understood. Here, we analyze noise suppression in the yeast pheromone signaling pathway and show that the poorly characterized protein Kel1 serves as a major noise suppressor and prevents cell death. At the molecular level, Kel1 prevents spontaneous activation of the pheromone response by inhibiting membrane recruitment of Ste5 and Far1. Only a hypophosphorylated form of Kel1 suppresses signaling, reduces noise and prevents pheromone-associated cell death, and our data indicate that the MAPK Fus3 contributes to Kel1 phosphorylation. Taken together, Kel1 serves as a phospho-regulated suppressor of the pheromone pathway to reduce noise, inhibit spontaneous activation of the pathway, regulate mating efficiency, and to prevent pheromone-associated cell death.",

Nevertheless, experimental evidence for the existence of this operation in the human brain is still scant. Here, using functional MRI, we explored the role of normalization across the visual hierarchy in the human visual cortex. Using stimuli form the two categories of human bodies and houses, we presented objects in isolation or in clutter and asked participants to attend or ignore the stimuli.Focusing on the primary visual area V1, the object-selective regions LO and pFs, and the category-selective regions EBA and PPA, we first modeled single-voxel responses using a weighted sum, a weighted average, and a normalization model and demonstrated that the response to multiple stimuli could best be described by a model that takes normalization into account. We then explored the observed effects of attention on cortical responses and demonstrated that these effects were predicted by the normalization model, but not by the weighted sum or the weighted average models. Our results thus provide compelling evidence for normalization as a canonical computation operating in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) have been associated with various cognitive functions, including perception. Their phase and amplitude independently predict cortical excitability and subsequent perceptual performance. Yet, the causal role of alpha phase-amplitude tradeoffs on visual perception remains ill-defined. We aimed to fill this gap and tested two clear predictions from the Pulsed Inhibition theory according to which alpha oscillations are associated with periodic functional inhibition. (1) High alpha amplitude induces cortical inhibition at specific phases, associated with low perceptual performance, while at opposite phases, inhibition decreases (potentially increasing excitation) and perceptual performance increases. (2) Low alpha amplitude is less susceptible to these phasic (periodic) pulses of inhibition, leading to overall higher perceptual performance. Here, cortical excitability was assessed in humans using phosphene (illusory) perception induced by single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over visual cortex at perceptual threshold, and its post-pulse evoked activity recorded with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). We observed that pre-pulse alpha phase modulates the probability to perceive a phosphene, predominantly for high alpha amplitude, with a non-optimal phase for phosphene perception between -{pi}/2 and -{pi}/4. The pre-pulse non-optimal phase further leads to an increase in post-pulse evoked activity (ERP), in phosphene-perceived trials specifically.

In turn, low alpha oscillations amplitude is less susceptible to phasic moments of pulsed inhibition leading to overall higher perceptual performance. Using TMS with simultaneous EEG recordings in humans, we found that specific phases of spontaneous alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) decrease cortical excitability and the subsequent perceptual outcomes predominantly when alpha amplitude is high. Our results provide strong causal evidence in favor of the Pulsed Inhibition theory.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe utility of long-read genome sequencing platforms has been shown in many fields including whole genome assembly, metagenomics, and amplicon sequencing. Less clear is the applicability of long reads to reference-guided human genomics, the foundation of genomic medicine. Here, we benchmark available platform-agnostic alignment tools on datasets from nanopore and single-molecule real-time platforms to understand their suitability in producing a genome representation.\n\nResultsFor this study, we leveraged publicly-available data from sample NA12878 generated on Oxford Nanopore and sample NA24385 on Pacific Biosciences platforms. Each tool that was benchmarked, including GraphMap2, LRA, Minimap2, NGMLR, and Winnowmap2 produced the same alignment file each time. However, the different tools widely disagreed on which reads to leave unaligned, affecting the end genome coverage and the number of discoverable breakpoints. Minimap2 and winnowmap2 were computationally lightweight enough for use at scale. No alignment from one tool independently resolved all large structural variants (10,000-100,000 basepairs) present in the Database of Genome Variants (DGV) for sample NA12878 or the truthset for NA24385.\n\nConclusionsIt should be best practice to use an analysis pipeline that generates alignments with both minimap2 and winnowmap2 as both are lightweight and yield different views of the genome. If computational resources and time are not a factor for a given case or experiment, a third representation from NGMLR will provide another view, and another chance to resolve a case. LRA, while fast, did not work on the nanopore data for our cluster, but PacBio results were promising in that those computations completed faster than Mininmap2. Graphmap2 is not an ideal tool for exploration of a whole human genome generated on a long-read sequencing platform.",

    "abstract": "The peptidoglycan cell wall is a predominant structure of bacteria, determining cell shape and supporting survival in diverse conditions. Peptidoglycan is dynamic and requires regulated synthesis of new material, remodeling, and turnover - or autolysis - of old material. Despite exploitation of peptidoglycan synthesis as an antibiotic target, we lack a fundamental understanding of how peptidoglycan synthesis and autolysis intersect to maintain the cell wall. Here, we uncover a critical physiological role for a widely misunderstood class of autolytic enzymes, lytic transglycosylases (LTGs). We demonstrate that LTG activity is essential to survival by contributing to periplasmic processes upstream and independent of peptidoglycan recycling. Defects accumulate in Vibrio cholerae LTG mutants due to generally inadequate LTG activity, rather than absence of specific enzymes, and essential LTG activities are likely independent of protein-protein interactions, as heterologous expression of a non-native LTG rescues growth of a conditionally LTG-null mutant. Lastly, we demonstrate that soluble, uncrosslinked, endopeptidase-dependent peptidoglycan chains, also detected in the wild-type, are enriched in LTG mutants, and that LTG mutants are hypersusceptible to the production of diverse periplasmic polymers. Collectively, our results suggest that LTGs prevent toxic crowding of the periplasm with synthesis-derived peptidoglycan polymers and contrary to prevailing models, that this autolytic function can be temporally separate from peptidoglycan synthesis.",

    "abstract": "In silico predictions combined with in vitro, in vivo and in situ observations collectively suggest that mouse adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires an aromatic substitution in position 501 or position 498 (but not both) of the spike proteins receptor binding domain. This effect could be enhanced by mutations in positions 417, 484, and 493 (especially K417N, E484K, Q493K and Q493R), and to a lesser extent by mutations in positions 486 and 499 (such as F486L and P499T). Such enhancements due to more favourable binding interactions with residues on the complementary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interface, are however, unlikely to sustain mouse infectivity on their own based on theoretical and experimental evidence to date. Our current understanding thus points to the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants of concern infecting mice, while Delta and  Delta Plus lack a similar biomolecular basis to do so. This paper identifies eleven countries (Brazil, Chile, Djibouti, Haiti, Malawi, Mozambique, Reunion, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela) where targeted local field surveillance of mice is encouraged because they may have come in contact with humans who had the virus with adaptive mutation(s).

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference provides an elegant theoretical framework for understanding the characteristic biases and discrimination thresholds in visual speed perception. However, the framework is difficult to validate due to its flexibility and the fact that suitable constraints on the structure of the sensory uncertainty have been missing. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding not only well explains human visual speed perception but also provides an accurate quantitative account of the tuning characteristics of neurons known for rep-resenting visual speed. Specifically, we found that the population coding accuracy for visual speed in area MT (\"neural prior\") is precisely predicted by the power-law, slow-speed prior extracted from fitting the Bayesian model to psychophysical data (\"behavioral prior\") to the point that the two priors are indistinguishable in a cross-validation model comparison. Our results demonstrate a quantitative validation of the Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding at both the behavioral and neural levels.\n\nSignificance StatementStatistical regularities of the environment play an important role in shaping both neural representations and perceptual behavior. Most previous works addressed these two aspects independently. Here we present a quantitative validation of a theoretical framework that makes joint predictions for neural coding and behavior, based on the assumption that neural representations of sensory information are efficient but also optimally used in generating a percept. Specifically, we demonstrate that the neural tuning characteristics for visual speed in brain area MT are precisely predicted by the statistical prior expectations extracted from psychophysical data. As such, our results provide a normative link between perceptual behavior and the neural representation of sensory information in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Viral superinfection occurs when multiple viral particles subsequently infect the same host. In nature, several viral species are found to have evolved diverse mechanisms to prevent superinfection (superinfection exclusion) but how this strategic choice impacts the fate of mutations in the viral population remains unclear. Using stochastic simulations, we find that genetic drift is suppressed when superinfection occurs, thus facilitating the fixation of beneficial mutations and the removal of deleterious ones. Interestingly, we also find that the competitive (dis)advantage associated with variations in life history parameters is not necessarily captured by the viral growth rate for either infection strategy. Putting these together, we then show that a mutant with superinfection exclusion will easily overtake a superinfecting population even if the latter has a much higher growth rate. Our findings suggest that while superinfection exclusion can negatively impact the long-term adaptation of a viral population, in the short-term it is ultimately a winning strategy.\n\nAuthor summaryViral social behaviour has recently been receiving increasing attention in the context of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of viral populations. One fascinating and still relatively poorly understood example is superinfection or co-infection, which occur when multiple viruses infect the same host. Among bacteriophages, a wide range of mechanisms have been discovered that enable phage to prevent superinfection (superinfection exclusion) even at the cost of using precious resources for this purpose. What is the evolutionary impact of this strategic choice and why do so many phages exhibit this behaviour? Here, we conduct an extensive simulation study of a phage population to address this question. In particular, we investigate the fate of viral mutations arising in an environment with a constant supply of bacterial hosts designed to mimic a \"turbidostat,\" as these are increasingly being used in laboratory evolution experiments. Our results show that allowing superinfection in the long-term yields a population which is more capable of adapting to changes in the environment. However, when in direct competition, mutants capable of preventing superinfection experience a very large advantage over their superinfecting counterparts, even if this ability comes at a significant cost to their growth rate. This indicates that while preventing superinfection can negatively impact the long-term prospects of a viral population, in the short-term it is ultimately a winning strategy.",

    "abstract": "The cone-shaped mature HIV-1 capsid is the main orchestrator of early viral replication. After cytosolic entry, it transports the viral replication complex along microtubules towards the nucleus. While it was initially believed that the reverse transcribed genome is released from the capsid in the cytosol, recent observations indicate that a high amount of capsid protein (CA) remains associated with subviral complexes during import through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Observation of post-entry events via microscopic detection of HIV-1 CA is challenging, since epitope shielding limits immunodetection and the genetic fragility of CA hampers direct labeling approaches. Here, we present a minimally invasive strategy based on genetic code expansion and click chemistry that allows for site-directed fluorescent labeling of HIV-1 CA, while retaining virus morphology and infectivity. Thereby, we could directly visualize virions and subviral complexes using advanced microscopy, including nanoscopy and correlative imaging. Quantification of signal intensities of subviral complexes revealed an amount of CA associated with nuclear complexes in HeLa-derived cells and primary T cells consistent with a complete capsid and showed that treatment with the small molecule inhibitor PF74 did not result in capsid dissociation from nuclear complexes. Cone-shaped objects detected in the nucleus by electron tomography were clearly identified as capsid-derived structures by correlative microscopy. High-resolution imaging revealed dose-dependent clustering of nuclear capsids, suggesting that incoming particles may follow common entry routes.",

Previous studies had demonstrated the presence and potential expression of amidase, an enzyme that can be targeted by repurposed analgesics, in Onchocerca volvulus worms. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin on the motility of adult O. volvulus worms. In total, thirty (30) female O. volvulus worms were exposed to acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin in concentrations of either 5mg/ml, 2.5mg/ml, 1.25mg/ml or 0.63mg/ml control in duplicates. Worm motility was observed and recorded using the WormAssay software and a darkfield imaging apparatus starting on day 2 of incubation and ending on day 8. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin inhibited O. volvulus motility by 2-fold compared to control in the first 24 hours of drug exposure. However, an extended exposure of the worms to these test drugs rather improved the motility of the worms. The study has demonstrated that a 24-hour exposure of O. volvulus worms to the analgesic drugs studied, results in significant inhibition in worm motility compared with the control group, but extended duration of exposure led to an enhancement in motility of the previously immobile worms. This finding supports the idea that aspirin and ibuprofen may have some longevity enhancing properties. Further research on the utility of these analgesics as possible anti-filarial drugs is thus warranted.",

We verified that LSSM can reliably visualize structures of collagen matrices from different origin including bovine, human and rat tail. The quality and intensity of collagen structure images acquired by LSSM did not decline with time. LSSM offers abundant wavelength choice to visualize matrix structures, maximizing combination possibilities with fluorescently-labelled cells, allowing visualizing of long-term ECM-cell interactions in 3D. Interestingly, we observed ultrathin thread-like structures between cells and matrix using LSSM, which were not observed by normal fluorescence microscopy. Transient local alignment of matrix by cell-applied forces can be observed. In summary, LSSM provides a powerful and robust approach to investigate the complex interplay between cells and ECM.",

    "abstract": "DDI1 proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including proteasomal degradation of specific proteins. All DDI1 proteins contain a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a retroviral aspartyl protease (RVP) domain. Some DDI1 proteins also contain a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The three domains confer distinct activities to DDI1 proteins. The presence of RVP domain makes DDI1 a potential target of HIV protease inhibitors, which also block the development of malaria parasites. Hence, we investigated the DDI1 of malaria parasites to identify its roles during parasite development and potential as a therapeutic target. DDI1 proteins of Plasmodium and other Apicomplexan parasites share the UBL-RVP domain architecture, and some also contain the UBA domain. Plasmodium DDI1 is expressed across all the major life cycle stages and is important for parasite survival, as conditional depletion of DDI1 protein in the mouse malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei and the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum compromised parasite development. Infection of mice with DDI1 knock-down P. berghei was self-limiting and protected the recovered mice from subsequent infection with homologous as well as heterologous parasites, indicating potential of DDI1 knock-down parasites as a whole organism vaccine. P. falciparum DDI1 (PfDDI1) is associated with chromatin and DNA-protein crosslinks. PfDDI1-depleted parasites accumulated DNA-protein crosslinks and showed enhanced susceptibility to DNA damaging chemicals, indicating a role of PfDDI1 in removal of DNA-protein crosslinks. Knock-down of PfDDI1 increased susceptibility to the retroviral protease inhibitor lopinavir and antimalarial artemisinin, which suggests that simultaneous inhibition of DDI1 could potentiate antimalarial activity of these drugs. As DDI1 knock-down parasites confer protective immunity and it could be a target of HIV protease inhibitors, Plasmodium DDI1 is a potential therapeutic target for malaria control.",

Using ovarian cancer as a prime example of a heterogeneous tumor disease with complex microenvironment and high recurrence rates, we developed a 3D preclinical ovarian cancer model comprised of patient-derived microtumors (PDM) and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for identification of treatment vulnerabilities and validation of anti-cancer drug efficacy using immunohistochemistry, immune cell phenotyping, functional assays and protein profiling analyses.\n\nMethodsPDM and TILs were isolated from fresh primary ovarian cancer tissue specimen using mechanical disruption and limited enzymatic digestion and were subsequently cultured in suspension in defined media in the absence of serum. The heterogeneous cellular composition of isolated PDM as well as autologous TILs was analyzed by FFPE immunohistochemistry and multi-color flow cytometry, respectively. For in-depth protein profiling of PDM we established Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analyses of >110 total and phospho-proteins. Treatment efficacy in response to chemotherapeutics as well as immunotherapeutic compounds was assessed in PDM and PDM-TIL co-cultures using a functional viability assay in microplate format.\n\nResultsThe enzymatic digestion of primary ovarian cancer tissue and suspension culture in defined serum-free media allowed fast and efficient recovery of patient-derived microtumors (PDM). Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated histopathological comparability of ovarian cancer PDM with corresponding patient tumor tissue. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA)-based analyses of >110 total and phospho-proteins enabled the identification of patient-specific sensitivities to standard, platinum-based therapy and thereby the prediction of potential treatment-responders. Finally, combining PDM and autologous TILs for individual efficacy testing of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment demonstrated the potential for patient-specific enhancement of cytotoxic TIL activity by this therapeutic approach.\n\nConclusion3D patient-derived ovarian cancer microtumors represent a preclinical, ex vivo tumor model that reflects intertumoral heterogeneity and represent the cellular complexity of individual patient tumors. Combining protein pathway analysis and anti-cancer drug efficacy testing of PDM enables drug mode-of-action analyses and therapeutic sensitivity prediction within a clinically relevant time frame after surgery. Follow-up studies in larger cohorts are currently under way to further evaluate the applicability of this platform to support clinical decision-making and personalizing cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Conquering print-sound mappings (e.g., grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules) is vital for developing fluent reading skills. In neuroimaging research, this ability can be indexed by activation differences between audiovisual congruent against incongruent conditions in brain areas such as the left superior temporal cortex. In line with it, individuals with dyslexia have difficulty in tasks requiring print-sound processing, accompanied by a reduced neural integration. However, existing evidence is almost restricted to alphabetic languages. Whether and how multisensory processing of print and sound is impaired in Chinese dyslexia remains underexplored. In this study, we applied a passive audiovisual integration paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the possible dysfunctions in processing character-sound (opaque; semantics can be automatically accessed) and pinyin-sound associations (transparent; no particular meaning can be confirmed) in Chinese dyslexic children. Unexpectedly, the dyslexic group did not show reduced neural integration compared with typically developing readers in either character or pinyin experiment. However, the results revealed atypical correlations between neural integration and different reading abilities in dyslexia. Specifically, while the neural integration in the left inferior frontal cortex in processing character-sound pairs correlated with silent reading comprehension in both children with and without dyslexia, it was associated with morphological awareness (semantic-related) in controls but with rapid naming (phonological-related) in dyslexics. This result indicates Chinese dyslexic children may not use the same grapho-semantic processing strategy as their typical peers do. As for pinyin-sound processing, while a stronger neural integration in the direction of \"congruent > incongruent\" in the left occipito-temporal cortex and bilateral superior temporal cortices was associated with better oral reading fluency in the control group, an opposite pattern was found in dyslexia. This finding may reflect dyslexias dysfunctional recruitment of the regions in grapho-phonological processing, which further impedes character learning.\n\nHighlightsO_LINeurofunctional correlates of print-sound integration in Chinese children with and without dyslexia are investigated.\nC_LIO_LIDyslexic children show atypical relationships between neural audiovisual integration and reading abilities.\nC_LIO_LIChinese children with dyslexia are likely to use inefficient strategies to process characters and pinyin.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of transcription is critical for the survival under cellular stress. Heat shock has provided an excellent model to investigate nascent transcription in stressed cells, but the molecular mechanisms orchestrating RNA synthesis during other types of stress are unknown. We utilized PRO-seq and ChIP-seq to study how Heat Shock Factors, HSF1 and HSF2, coordinate transcription at genes and enhancers upon oxidative stress and heat shock. We show that pause-release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a universal mechanism regulating gene transcription in stressed cells, while enhancers are activated at the level of Pol II recruitment. Moreover, besides functioning as conventional promoter-binding transcription factors, HSF1 and HSF2 bind to stress-induced enhancers to trigger Pol II pause-release from poised gene promoters. Importantly, HSFs act at distinct genes and enhancers in a stress type-specific manner. HSF1 binds to many chaperone genes upon oxidative and heat stress but activates them only in heat-shocked cells. Under oxidative stress, HSF1 and HSF2 trans-activate genes independently of each other, demonstrating, for the first time, that HSF2 is a bona fide transcription factor. Taken together, we show that HSFs function as multi-stress-responsive factors that activate specific genes and enhancers when encountering changes in temperature and redox state.",

All preterm infants had perinatal and/or perinatal risk factors for brain damage. EEG was obtained during phase II of natural nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.

Connectivity was computed by the phase-lag index.\n\nResultsIn healthy full-term infants, EEG interhemispheric connectivity in the different frequency bands followed similar trends with age to those reported in each frequency band: delta connectivity decreased, theta increased at the end of the year, the alpha band showed different trends based on the region studied, and beta interhemispheric connectivity decreased with age. EEG connectivity in preterm infants showed differences from the results of the term group.\n\nDiscussionImportant structural findings may explain the differences observed in EEG connectivity between the term and preterm groups.\n\nConclusionThe study of EEG connectivity during the first year of age provides essential information on normal and abnormal brain development.",

    "abstract": "Cortical asymmetry is a ubiquitous feature of brain organization that is subtly altered in some neurodevelopmental disorders, yet we lack knowledge of how its development proceeds across life in health. Achieving consensus on the precise cortical asymmetries in humans is necessary to uncover the genetic and later influences that shape them, such as age. Here, we delineate population-level asymmetry in cortical thickness and surface area vertex-wise in 7 datasets and chart asymmetry trajectories longitudinally across life (4-89 years; observations = 3937; 70% longitudinal). We find replicable asymmetry interrelationships, heritability maps, and test asymmetry associations in large-scale data. Cortical asymmetry was robust across datasets. Whereas areal asymmetry is predominantly stable across life, thickness asymmetry grows in childhood and peaks in early adulthood. Areal asymmetry correlates phenotypically and genetically in specific regions, and is low-moderately heritable (max h2SNP [~]19%). In contrast, thickness asymmetry is globally interrelated across the cortex in a pattern suggesting highly left-lateralized individuals tend towards left-lateralization also in population-level right-asymmetric regions (and vice versa), and exhibits low or absent heritability. We find less areal asymmetry in the most consistently lateralized region in humans associates with subtly lower cognitive ability, and confirm small handedness and sex effects. Results suggest areal asymmetry is developmentally stable and arises in early life through genetic but mainly subject-specific stochastic effects, whereas childhood developmental growth shapes thickness asymmetry and may lead to directional variability of global thickness lateralization in the population.",

    "abstract": "Individual cells within de novo polarising tubes and cavities must integrate their forming apical domains into a centralised apical membrane initiation site (AMIS). This is necessary to enable organised lumen formation within multi-cellular tissue. Despite the well documented importance of cell division in localising the AMIS, we have found a division-independent mechanism of AMIS localisation that relies instead on Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Our study of de novo polarising mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in 3D suggest that cell-cell adhesion localises apical proteins such as PAR-6 to a centralised AMIS. Unexpectedly, we also found that mESC cell clusters lacking functional E-cadherin still formed a lumen-like cavity in the absence of AMIS localisation but did so at a later stage of development via a  closure mechanism, instead of via hollowing. This work suggests that there are two, interrelated mechanisms of apical polarity localisation: cell adhesion and cell division. Alignment of these mechanisms in space allows for redundancy in the system and ensures the development of a coherent epithelial structure within a growing organ.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn humans, the nc886 locus is a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele. Periconceptional conditions have an effect on the methylation status of nc886, and further, this methylation status is associated with health outcomes in later life, in line with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. Animal models would offer opportunities to study the associations between periconceptional conditions, nc886 methylation status and metabolic phenotypes further. Thus, we set out to investigate the methylation pattern of the nc886 locus in non-human mammals.\n\nDataWe obtained DNA methylation data from the data repository GEO for mammals, whose nc886 gene included all three major parts of nc886 and had sequency similarity of over 80% with the human nc886. Our final sample set consisted of DNA methylation data from humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutangs, baboons, macaques, vervets, marmosets and guinea pigs.\n\nResultsIn human data sets the methylation pattern of nc886 locus followed the expected bimodal distribution, indicative of polymorphic imprinting. In great apes, we identified a unimodal DNA methylation pattern with 50% methylation level in all individuals and in all subspecies. In Old World monkeys, the between individual variation was greater and methylation on average was close to 60%. In guinea pigs the region around the nc886 homologue was non-methylated. Results obtained from the sequence comparison of the CTCF binding sites flanking the nc886 gene support the results on the DNA methylation data.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that unlike in humans, nc886 is not a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele in non-human primates or in guinea pigs, thus implying that animal models are not applicable for nc886 research. The obtained data suggests that the nc886 region may be classically imprinted in great apes, and potentially also in Old World monkeys, but not in guinea pigs.",

    "abstract": "Untargeted metabolomics enables direct quantification of metabolites without apriori knowledge of their identity. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), a popular method to implement untargeted metabolomics, identifies metabolites via combined mass/charge (m/z) and retention time as mass features. Improvements in the sensitivity of mass spectrometers has increased the complexity of data produced, leading to computational obstacles. One outstanding challenge is calling metabolite mass feature peaks rapidly and accurately in large LC-MS datasets (dozens to thousands of samples) in the presence of measurement and other noise. While existing algorithms are useful, they have limitations that become pronounced at scale and lead to false positive metabolite predictions as well as signal dropouts. To overcome some of these shortcomings, biochemists have developed hybrid computational and carbon labeling techniques, such as credentialing. Credentialing can validate metabolite signals, but is laborious and its applicability is limited. We have developed a suite of three computational tools to overcome the challenges of unreliable algorithms and inefficient validation protocols: isolock, autoCredential and anovAlign. Isolock uses isopairs, or metabolite-istopologue pairs, to calculate and correct for mass drift noise across LC-MS runs. autoCredential leverages statistical features of LC-MS data to amplify naturally present 13C isotopologues and validate metabolites through isopairs. This obviates the need to artificially introduce carbon labeling. anovAlign, an anova-derived algorithm, is used to align retention time windows across samples to accurately delineate retention time windows for mass features. Using a large published clinical dataset as well as a plant dataset with biological replicates across time, genotype and treatment, we demonstrate that this suite of tools is more sensitive and reproducible than both an open source metabolomics pipelines, XCMS, and the commercial software progenesis QI. This software suite opens a new era for enhanced accuracy and increased throughput for untargeted metabolomics.",

SEF participation showed significant ethnic diversity. For survey students, the approximate distribution was Asian-32%; Black-11%; Hispanic-20%; White-33%; Other-3%. Comparing the SEF level at which students competed from school to district to region to state levels, we observed that black students made up only 4.5% of the students who participated in SEF beyond the school level, whereas students from other ethnic groups were more equally represented at all levels. The lower percentage of Black students resulted from a combination of lower overall participation in SEF and lower percentage of those students who did participate to advance to SEFs beyond the school level. Students who advanced to SEFs beyond the school level frequently received help from scientists, coaching for the interview, and were not required to participate in SEF. Black students received the least help from scientists, were least likely to receive coaching for the interview, and were most likely to be required to participate in SEF. They also were most likely to receive no help from parents, teachers, or scientists. Asian and Hispanic students (63.8% and 56.8%) indicated a greater interest in careers in science and engineering (S&E) compared to Black and White students (43.7% & 50.7%). In addition to career interest, the most important experiences that correlated with students who indicated that SEF increased their interests in S&E were getting help from the internet, books and magazines; getting help fine tuning the report; and overcoming obstacles by doing more background research, making a timeline, and perseverance. Black students did not report a positive effect of any of these strategies but experienced time pressure as more of an obstacle than did other students. Our findings identify a wide range of student experiences associated with positive SEF outcomes that could be enhanced for all students but especially Black students. More involvement of scientists in helping students who participate in SEFs would be particularly valuable.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary symbioses have the potential to drive transgenerational effects, yet the mechanisms responsible for transmission of heritable plant symbionts are still poorly understood. The leaf symbiosis between Dioscorea sansibarensis and the bacterium Orrella dioscoreae offers an appealing model system to study how heritable bacteria are transmitted to the next generation. Here, we demonstrate that inoculation of apical buds with a bacterial suspension is sufficient to colonize newly-formed leaves and propagules, and to ensure transmission to the next plant generation. Flagellar motility is not required for movement inside the plant, but is important for the colonization of new hosts. Further, stringent tissue-specific regulation of putative symbiotic functions highlight the presence of two distinct subpopulations of bacteria in the leaf gland and at the shoot meristem. We propose that bacteria in the leaf gland dedicate resources to symbiotic functions, while dividing bacteria in the shoot tip ensure successful colonization of meristematic tissue, glands and propagules. Compartmentalization of intra-host populations, together with tissue-specific regulation may serve as a robust mechanism for the maintenance of mutualism in leaf symbiosis.\n\nImportanceSeveral plant species form associations with bacteria in their leaves, called leaf symbiosis. These associations are highly specific, but the mechanisms responsible for symbiont transmission are poorly understood. Using the association between the yam species Dioscorea sansibarensis and Orrella dioscoreae as a model leaf symbiosis, we provide experimental evidence that bacteria are transmitted vertically and distributed to specific leaf structures via association with shoot meristems. Flagellar motility is required for initial infection, but does not contribute to spread within host tissue. We also provide evidence that bacterial subpopulations at the meristem or in the symbiotic leaf gland differentially express key symbiotic genes. We argue that this separation of functional symbiont populations, coupled to tight control over bacterial infection and transmission, explain the evolutionary robustness of leaf symbiosis. These findings may provide insights into how plants may recruit and maintain beneficial symbionts at the leaf surface.",

    "abstract": "Benzoxazinoids are a class of protective and allelopathic plant secondary metabolites, first identified in maize (Zea mays) and subsequently shown to be encoded by a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), the Bx cluster. Data mining of mining 40 high-quality grass genomes identified complete Bx clusters (containing genes Bx1 to Bx5 and Bx8) in three genera (Zea, Echinochloa and Dichanthelium) in the Panicoideae and partial clusters in the Triticeae. The Bx cluster originated from gene duplication of native analogues of Bx genes and chromosomal translocation. An ancient Bx cluster including additional Bx genes (e.g., Bx6) is found in ancestral Panicoideae. The ancient Bx cluster was gained by the Triticeae ancestor via a horizontal transfer (HT) event from the ancestral Panicoideae and later separated into three parts on different chromosomes. Bx6 appears to have been under less constrained selection during evolution of the Panicoideae as evidenced by the fact that was translocated [~]1.31-Mb away from the Bx cluster in Z. mays, moved to other chromosomes in Echinochloa, and even lost in Dichanthelium. Further investigation indicated that intense selection and polyploidization shaped the evolutionary trajectory of the Bx cluster in the grass family. This study provides the first case of HT of BGCs among plants and sheds new insights on the evolution of BGCs.\n\nSignificanceBiosynthetic gene clustering and horizontal gene transfer are two evolutionary inventions for rapid adaption by organisms. Horizontal transfer of a gene cluster has been reported in fungi and bacteria, but not in plants up to now. By mining the genomes of 40 monocot species, we deciphered the organization of Bx gene cluster, a biosynthetic gene cluster for benzoxazinoids in grasses. We found that the Bx cluster was formed by gene duplication of native analogues of individual Bx genes and directional translocation. More importantly, the Bx cluster in Triticeae was inherited from the Panicoideae via horizontal transfer. Compared with the native analogues, Bx clusters in grasses show constrained purifying selection underscoring their significance in environmental adaption.",

    "abstract": "Biased population sex ratios can alter optimal male mating strategies, and allocation to reproductive traits depends on nutrient availability. However, there is little information on how nutrition interacts with sex ratio to influence the evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory traits separately. To address this omission, here we test how male mating success and reproductive investment evolve under varying sex ratios and adult diet in Drosophila melanogaster using an experimental evolution approach. We found that sex ratio and nutrient availability interacted to determine male pre-copulatory performance. Males from female-biased populations were slow to mate when they evolved on a protein-restricted diet. On the other hand, we found direct and non-interacting effects of sex ratio and nutrient availability on post-copulatory success, without interactions between them. Males that evolved on a protein-restricted diet were poor at suppressing female remating. Males that evolved under equal sex ratios fathered more offspring and were better at supressing female remating, relative to males from male-biased or female-biased populations. These results support the idea that sex ratios and nutrition interact to determine the evolution of pre-copulatory mating traits, but independently influence the evolution of post-copulatory traits.",

    "abstract": "In the past two decades genomic data have been widely used to detect historical gene flow between species in a variety of plants and animals. The Tamias quadrivittatus group of North America chipmunks, which originated through a series of rapid speciation events, are known to undergo massive amounts of mitochondrial introgression. Yet in a recent analysis of targeted nuclear loci from the group, no evidence for cross-species introgression was detected, indicating widespread cytonuclear discordance. The study used heuristic methods that analyze summaries of the multilocus sequence data to detect gene flow, which may suffer from low power. Here we use the full likelihood method implemented in the Bayesian program BPP to reanalyze these data. We take a stepwise approach to constructing an introgression model by adding introgression events onto a well-supported binary species tree. The analysis detected robust evidence for multiple ancient introgression events affecting the nuclear genome, with introgression probabilities reaching 65%. We estimate population parameters and highlight the fact that species divergence times may be seriously underestimated if ancient cross-species gene flow is ignored in the analysis. Our analyses highlight the importance of using adequate statistical methods to reach reliable biological conclusions concerning cross-species gene flow.",

It is well known that alcohol consumption leads to significantly increased free radical levels and health risks, which lacks effective treatment method besides alcohol abstinence. Here we compared different SMF settings and found that a downward SMF of [~]0.1 T with magnetic flux of [~]4.5x10-3 Wb could effectively alleviate alcohol-induced liver damage and lipid accumulation, and improve liver function. The inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and oxidative stress were significantly reduced. EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) experiments also confirmed the reduced amount of free radical by SMF treatment. Moreover, the lifespan of heavy alcohol drinking mice was also significantly changed due to the SMF effects on liver cell ROS level, DNA synthesis and liver cell regeneration. Our study shows that moderate SMFs with specific parameters have great promises to be developed into a physical method to reduce alcohol-induced liver damage in the future.",

    "abstract": "Motor units convert the last neural code of movement into muscle forces. The classic view of motor unit control is that the central nervous system sends common synaptic inputs to motoneuron pools and that motoneurons respond in an orderly fashion dictated by the size principle. This view however is in contrast with the large number of dimensions observed in motor cortex which may allow individual and flexible control of motor units. Evidence for flexible control of motor units may be obtained by tracking motor units longitudinally during the performance of tasks with some level of behavioural variability. Here we identified and tracked populations of motor units in the brachioradialis muscle of two macaque monkeys during ten sessions spanning over one month during high force isometric contractions with a broad range of rate of force development (1.8 - 38.6 N{middle dot}m{middle dot}s-1). During the same sessions we recorded intramuscular EMG signals from 16 arm muscles of both limbs and elicited the full recruitment through neural stimulation of the median and deep radial nerves. We found a very stable recruitment order and discharge characteristics of the motor units over sessions and contraction trials. The small deviations from orderly recruitment were observed between motor units with close recruitment thresholds, and only during high rate of force development. Moreover, we also found that one component explained more than ~50% of the motor unit discharge rate variance, and that the remaining components could be described as a time-shifted version of the first, as it could be predicted from the interplay between the size principle of recruitment and one common input. In conclusion, our results show that motoneurons recruitment is determined by the interplay of the size principle and common input and that this recruitment scheme is not violated over time nor by the speed of the contractions.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo introduce a method to create 3D-printed axon-mimetic phantoms with complex fibre orientations to characterize the performance of diffusion MRI models and representations in the presence of orientation dispersion.\n\nMethodsAn extension to an open source 3D printing package was created to 3D print a set of five 3D-printed axon-mimetic (3AM) phantoms with various combinations of bending and crossing fibre orientations. A two-shell diffusion MRI scan of the five phantoms in water was performed at 9.4T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), the ball and stick model, neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI), and Bingham-NODDI were all fit to the resulting diffusion MRI data. A fiducial in each phantom was used to register a ground truth map of that phantoms crossing angles and/or arc radius to the diffusion-weighted images. Metrics from each model and representation were compared to the ground-truth maps, and a quadratic regression model was fit to each combination of output metric and ground-truth metric.\n\nResultsThe mean diffusivity (MD) metric defined by DTI was insensitive to crossing angle, but increased with fibre curvature. Axial diffusivity (AD) decreased sharply with increasing crossing angle. DKIs diffusivity metrics replicated the trends seen in DTI, and its mean kurtosis (MK) metric, decreased with fibre curvature, except in regions with high crossing angles. The estimated stick volume fraction in the ball and stick model decreased with increasing fibre curvature and crossing angle. NODDIs intra-neurite volume fraction was insensitive to crossing angle, and its orientation dispersion index (ODI) was strongly correlated to crossing angle. Bingham-NODDIs intra-neurite volume fraction was also insensitive to crossing angle, while its primary ODI (ODIP) was also strongly correlated to crossing angle and its secondary ODI (ODIS) was insensitive to crossing angle. For both NODDI models, the volume fractions of the extra-neurite and CSF compartments had low reliability with no clear relationship to crossing angle.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that inexpensive 3D-printed axon-mimetic phantoms can be used to investigate the effect of fibre curvature and crossings on diffusion MRI representations and models of diffusion signal. As a proof of concept, the dependence of several representations and models on fibre dispersion/crossing were investigated. As expected, Bingham-NODDI was best able to characterize planar fibre dispersion in the phantoms.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMany neurons in the mammalian central nervous system have complex dendritic arborisations and active dendritic conductances that enable these cells to perform sophisticated computations. How dendritically targeted inhibition affects local dendritic excitability is not fully understood. Here we use computational models of branched dendrites to investigate where GABAergic synapses should be placed to minimise dendritic excitability over time. To do so, we formulate a metric we term the \"Inhibitory Level\" (IL), which quantifies the effectiveness of synaptic inhibition for reducing the depolarising effect of nearby excitatory input. GABAergic synaptic inhibition is dependent on the reversal potential for GABAA receptors (EGABA), which is primarily set by the transmembrane chloride ion (Cl-) concentration gradient. We, therefore, investigated how variable EGABA and dynamic chloride affects dendritic inhibition. We found that the inhibitory effectiveness of dendritic GABAergic synapses combines at an encircled branch junction, \"inhibitory accumulation\". The extent of inhibitory accumulation is dependent on the number of branches and location of synapses but is independent of EGABA. This inhibitory accumulation occurs even for very distally placed inhibitory synapses when they are hyperpolarising - but not when they are shunting. When accounting for Cl- fluxes and dynamics in Cl- concentration, we observed that Cl- loading is detrimental to inhibitory effectiveness. This enabled us to determine the most inhibitory distribution of GABAergic synapses which is close to - but not at - a shared branch junction. This distribution balances a trade-off between a stronger combined inhibitory influence when synapses closely encircle a branch junction with the deleterious effects of increased Cl- loading that occurs when inhibitory synapses are co-located.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to elevated temperatures during embryogenesis can influence the plasticity of tissues in later-life. Despite these long-term changes in plasticity, few differentially expressed genes are ever identified, suggesting that the developmental programming of later-life plasticity may occur through the modulation of other aspects of the transcriptomic architecture, such as gene network function. Here, we use network modelling approaches to demonstrate that warm temperatures during embryonic development (developmental warming) have consistent effects in later-life on the organisation of transcriptomic networks across four diverse species of fishes: Scyliorhinus canicula, Danio rerio, Dicentrarchus labrax, and Gasterosteus aculeatus. The transcriptomes of developmentally warmed fishes are characterised by an increased entropy of their pairwise gene interaction networks, implying a less structured, more  random set of gene interactions. We also show that, in zebrafish subject to developmental warming, the entropy of an individual gene within a network is associated with that genes probability of expression change during temperature acclimation in later-life. However, this association is absent in animals reared under  control conditions. Thus, the thermal environment experienced during embryogenesis can alter transcriptomic organisation in later-life, and these changes may influence an individuals responsiveness to future temperature challenges.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe mosquito Aedes koreicus (Edwards, 1917) is a recent invader on the European continent that was introduced to several new places since its first detection in 2008. Compared to other exotic Aedes mosquitoes with public health significance that invaded Europe during the last decades, this species biology, behavior, and dispersal patterns were poorly investigated to date.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsTo understand the species population relationships and dispersal patterns within Europe, a fragment of the COI gene was sequenced from 130 mosquitoes, collected from five countries where the species has been introduced and/or established. Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing techniques were combined to generate the first complete nuclear and mitochondrial genomic sequences of Ae. koreicus from the European region. The complete genome of Ae. koreicus is 879 Mb. COI haplotype analyses identified five major groups (altogether 31 different haplotypes) and revealed a large-scale dispersal pattern between European Ae. koreicus populations. Continuous admixture of populations from Belgium, Italy, and Hungary was highlighted, additionally, haplotype diversity and clustering clearly indicate a separation of German sequences from other populations, pointing to an independent introduction of Ae. koreicus to Europe. Finally, a genetic expansion signal was identified, suggesting the species might be present in more locations than currently detected.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results highlight the importance of genetic research of invasive mosquitoes to understand general dispersal patterns, reveal main dispersal routes and form the baseline of future mitigation actions. The first complete genomic sequence also provides a significant leap in the general understanding of this species, opening the possibility for future genome-related studies, such as the detection of  Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers. Considering its public health importance, it is crucial to further investigate the species population genetic dynamic, including a larger sampling and additional genomic markers.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the present context of globalization and changing environment, the rapid spread of Invasive Mosquito Species (IMS) across Europe represents a serious public health threat because some species are competent vectors for several pathogens. A better knowledge of the IMS population relationships, demographic trends, and dispersal patterns can help the relevant authorities mitigating further spread. Aedes koreicus is an IMS that invaded the continent and has been expanding its geographic range over the last decade. In the present study, one of the most popular DNA marker (COI) was used to investigate the pan-European haplotype diversity and phylogenetic relatedness within and between Ae. koreicus populations. Also, the first complete mitochondrial genome and draft nuclear genome of Ae. koreicus were generated using combined high-throughput sequencing techniques (Oxford Nanopore, Illumina). This provides a significant leap in the general understanding of this species and opens the possibility for future genomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Telomere maintenance is crucial for cancer progression1-5. Anti-tumor immune response, on the other hand, is important for prognosis in cancer6-10. How telomeres affect anti-tumor immunity however is poorly understood. Here, we observed significant variation in cancer cell telomeres within the tumor microenvironment (TME) across cancer types. Infiltration of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAM) was sensitive to cancer cell telomeres. Using breast cancer tissue (>90 patients), tumor-derived organoids, cancer cells and xenograft tumors with either long or short telomeres we show interleukin-1 signalling is telomere-sensitive. Mechanistically, non-telomeric TRF2 binding at the IL-1-receptor-1 (IL1R1) promoter was telomere-dependent; enhanced TRF2 binding in case of short telomeres directly recruited the histone-acetyl-transferase p300; and, consequent H3K27 acetylation activated IL1R1. This enhanced IL-signalling, which induced secretion of the cytokine IL-1-beta resulting in increased TAM infiltration in tumors with shorter telomeres. M2-type macrophage infiltration was significantly reduced in presence of the receptor antagonist IL1RA, and IL1R1-knockout compromised TRF2-induced IL-1 activation, supporting specificity of the TRF2-IL1R1 axis in telomere-dependent TAM infiltration. Together these reveal a heretofore unknown function of telomeres in immunosuppression within the TME implicating telomeres as a key factor in the often-reported variation in patient response to immunotherapy.",

The single-cell transcriptomes of carcinoid tumor cells reflected intertumoral heterogeneity associated with clinicopathological features, such as tumor necrosis and proliferation index. The immune microenvironment was specifically enriched in noninflammatory monocyte-derived myeloid cells. Tumor-associated endothelial cells were characterized by distinct gene expression profiles. A spectrum of vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes predominated the stromal microenvironment. We found a small proportion of myofibroblasts exhibiting features reminiscent of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Stromal and immune cells exhibited potential paracrine interactions which may shape the microenvironment via NOTCH, VEGF, TGF{beta} and JAK/STAT signaling. Moreover, single-cell gene signatures of pericytes and myofibroblasts demonstrated prognostic value in bulk gene expression data.\n\nHere, we provide first comprehensive insights into the cellular composition and single-cell gene expression profiles in lung carcinoids, demonstrating the non-inflammatory and vessel-rich nature of their tumor microenvironment, and outlining relevant intercellular interactions which could serve as future therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most malignant primary brain tumor with significant heterogeneity and a limited number of effective therapeutic options. Many investigational targeted therapies have failed in clinical trials, but it remains unclear if this results from insensitivity to therapy or poor drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier. Using well-established EGFR-amplified patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines, we investigated this question using an EGFR-directed therapy. With only bioluminescence imaging, we used a mathematical model to quantify the heterogeneous treatment response across the three PDX lines (GBM6, GBM12, GBM39). Our model estimated the primary cause of intracranial treatment response for each of the lines, and these findings were validated with parallel experimental efforts. This mathematical modeling approach can be used as a useful complementary tool that can be widely applied to many more PDX lines. This has the potential to further inform experimental efforts and reduce the cost and time necessary to make experimental conclusions.\n\nAuthor summaryGlioblastoma is a deadly brain cancer that is difficult to treat. New therapies often fail to surpass the current standard of care during clinical trials. This can be attributed to both the vast heterogeneity of the disease and the blood-brain barrier, which may or may not be disrupted in various regions of tumors. Thus, while some cancer cells may develop insensitivity in the presence of a drug due to heterogeneity, other tumor areas are simply not exposed to the drug. Being able to understand to what extent each of these is driving clinical trial results in individuals may be key to advancing novel therapies. To address this challenge, we used mathematical modeling to study the differences between three patient-derived tumors in mice. With our unique approach, we identified the reason for treatment failure in each patient tumor. These results were validated through rigorous and time-consuming experiments, but our mathematical modeling approach allows for a cheaper, quicker, and widely applicable way to come to similar conclusions.",

This paper provides an overview of the course structure, showing how the constituent elements have been designed and refined over successive iterations of the course. We detail how FSFE students: 1. Work closely with discipline specialists to develop a small group project that tests an hypothesis to answer a genuine scientific question in the field; 2. Learn critical skills of data management and communication; and 3. Analyse, interpret and present their results in the format of a scientific symposium. This process is repeated in an iterative  cognitive apprenticeship model, supported by a series of workshops that name and explicitly instruct the students in  hard and  soft skills critical relevant for research and other careers. FSFE students develop a coherent and nuanced understanding of how to approach and execute ecological studies. The sophisticated knowledge and ecological research skills that they develop during the course is demonstrated through high quality presentations and peer-reviewed publications in an open-access, student-led journal.

    "abstract": "Action potential (AP) shape is a critical electrophysiological parameter, in particular because it strongly modulates neurotransmitter release. AP shape is also used to distinguish neuronal populations, as it greatly varies between neuronal types. For instance, AP duration ranges from hundreds of microseconds in cerebellar granule cells to 2-3 milliseconds in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. While most of this variation seems to arise from differences in the subtypes of voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels expressed, a few studies suggested that dendritic morphology may also affect AP shape. However, AP duration also displays significant variability in a same neuronal type, while the determinants of these variations are poorly known. Using electrophysiological recordings, morphological reconstructions and realistic Hodgkin-Huxley modeling, we investigated the relationships between dendritic morphology and AP shape in SNc DA neurons. In this neuronal type where the axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), the duration of the somatic AP could be predicted from a linear combination of the complexities of the ABD and the non-ABDs. Dendrotomy simulation and experiments showed that these correlations arise from the causal influence of dendritic topology on AP duration, due in particular to a high density of sodium channels in the somato-dendritic compartment. In addition, dendritic morphology also modulated AP back-propagation efficiency in response to barrages of EPSCs in the ABD. In line with previous findings, these results demonstrate that dendritic morphology plays a major role in defining the electrophysiological properties of SNc DA neurons and their cell-to-cell variations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAction potential (AP) shape is a critical electrophysiological parameter, in particular because it strongly modulates neurotransmitter release. AP shape (e.g. duration) greatly varies between neuronal types but also within a same neuronal type. While differences in ion channel expression seem to explain most of AP shape variation across cell types, the determinants of cell-to-cell variations in a same neuronal type are mostly unknown. We used electrophysiological recordings, neuronal reconstruction and modeling to show that, due to the presence of sodium channels in the somato-dendritic compartment, a large part of cell-to-cell variations in somatic AP duration in substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons is explained by variations in dendritic topology.",

    "abstract": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) is composed of functionally distinct sub-populations of GABAergic neurons which form a neural network responsible for synchronizing most physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals. To date, little is known regarding which aspects of SCN rhythmicity are generated by individual SCN neurons, and which aspects result from neuronal interaction within a network. Here, we utilize in vivo miniaturized microscopy to measure fluorescent GCaMP-reported calcium dynamics in AVP-expressing neurons in the intact SCN of awake, behaving mice. We report that SCN AVP neurons exhibit periodic, slow calcium waves which we demonstrate, using in vivo electrical recordings, likely reflect burst-firing. Further, we observe substantial heterogeneity of function in that AVP neurons exhibit unstable rhythms, and relatively weak rhythmicity at the population level. Network analysis reveals that correlated cellular behavior, or coherence, among neuron pairs also exhibited stochastic rhythms with about 33% of pairs rhythmic at any time. Unlike single-cell variables, coherence exhibited a strong rhythm at the population level with time of maximal coherence among AVP neuronal pairs at CT/ZT 6 and 9, coinciding with the timing of maximal neuronal activity for the SCN as a whole. These results demonstrate robust circadian variation in the coordination between stochastically rhythmic neurons and that interactions between AVP neurons in the SCN may be more influential than single-cell activity in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that cells in this circuit, like those in many other circuits imaged in vivo, exhibit profound heterogenicity of function over time and space.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work is the first to employ two novel in vivo recording techniques, miniaturized calcium microscopy and optogentically-targeted single unit activity recording, to examine the rhythmic behavior of AVP expressing neurons both at the individual neuronal and network level. These results suggest that while AVP neurons are important for organismal rhythmicity, individual cellular rhythms are unstable and diverse. However, we observed correlated activity among these neurons which appears more reliably rhythmic, suggesting that emergent network properties of the SCN may be more relevant for organismal rhythmicity than individual neuronal characteristics.",

We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations, and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels, and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence. Two prioritized genes, CREBRF and RRBP1, show convergent evidence across functional datasets supporting their roles in lipid biology.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum regulates nonmotor behavior, but the routes by which it exerts its influence are not well characterized. Here we report a necessary role for the posterior cerebellum in guiding a reversal learning task, acting through a network of diencephalic and neocortical structures. After chemogenetic inhibition of Purkinje cells in lobule VI or crus I, mice could learn a water Y-maze task but were impaired in their ability to reverse their initial choice. To map targets of perturbation, we imaged c-Fos activation in cleared whole brains using light-sheet microscopy. Reversal learning activated diencephalic regions and associative neocortical regions. Distinctive subsets of structures were altered by perturbation of lobule VI (including thalamus and habenula) and crus I (including hypothalamus and prelimbic/orbital cortex), and both perturbations influenced anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortex. To identify functional networks, we used correlated variation in c-Fos activation within each test group. Lobule VI inactivation weakened within-thalamus correlations, while crus I inactivation divided neocortical activity into well-separated sensorimotor and associative subnetworks. In both groups, high-throughput automated analysis of complex whole-body movement revealed deficiencies in across-day adaptation to an open field environment. Neither perturbation affected gait, within-day open-field adaptation, or location preference. Taken together, these experiments reveal brainwide systems for cerebellar influence that can affect multiple flexible responses.\n\nSignificance statementThe cerebellum, a part of all vertebrate brains, provides feedback to the rest of the brain on a split-second basis in response to unexpected events. The consequent changes can range from minute adjustments in movement to broad changes in behavior. In mice, we investigated cerebellar regions that help guide flexible behavior. Inactivation of these regions prevented mice from responding flexibly to a changing Y-shaped maze. We used light-sheet microscopy of c-fos protein expression to map brainwide effects of different stages of learning and cerebellar inactivation. Inactivation caused changes in thalamocortical activity that were similar in pattern, but opposite in sign, from normal learning. Lobule VI inactivation weakened thalamic functional networks, while crus I inactivation divided sensorimotor from associative neocortical networks. The same inactivation also impaired multiday adaptation to an open arena, as tracked using machine vision. Our work shows how the cerebellums influence over flexible response can be mediated by a widespread brain network.",

    "abstract": "GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are key orchestrators of neuronal activity and several GABAAR variants have been linked to genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and epilepsies. Here, we report two variants (Met263Lys, Leu267Ile) in the predominant GABAAR 1 subunit gene (GABRA1) that increase apparent receptor affinity for GABA and confer spontaneous receptor activity. These gain-of-function features are unusual because GABAAR variants are traditionally thought to cause seizures by reducing inhibitory neurotransmission. Both Met263Lys and Leu267Ile increased tonic and spontaneous GABAergic conductances in neurons revealed by competitive inhibition and channel block of GABAARs. Significantly, 1-subunit variant expression in hippocampal neurons also reduced dendritic spine density. Our results indicate that elevated GABAergic signalling can precipitate genetic epilepsies and NDDs. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis may involve the de-compartmentalisation of excitatory inputs due to the removal of dendritic spines. This aberrant structural plasticity can be reversed by the naturally-occurring, therapeutically-tractable, inhibitory neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulphate.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it remains unclear to what extent gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions influence complex traits in humans. The magnitude of genetic interactions in complex traits has been difficult to quantify because GWAS are generally underpowered to detect individual interactions of small effect. Here, we develop a method to test for genetic interactions that aggregates information across all trait-associated loci. Specifically, we test whether SNPs in regions of European ancestry shared between European American and admixed African American individuals have the same causal effect sizes. We hypothesize that in African Americans, the presence of genetic interactions will drive the causal effect sizes of SNPs in regions of European ancestry to be more similar to those of SNPs in regions of African ancestry. We apply our method to two traits: gene expression in 296 African Americans and 482 European Americans in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 74K African Americans and 296K European Americans in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). We find significant evidence for genetic interactions in our analysis of gene expression; for LDL-C, we observe a similar point estimate although this is not significant, likely due to lower statistical power. These results suggest that gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions modify the effect sizes of causal variants in human complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a tumour suppressor gene that inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Mutations in TSC1 lead to a rare complex disorder of the same name, in which up to 50% of patients present with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a highly prevalent, early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviours, although the type and severity of symptoms show wide variability across individuals. Amongst different brain areas proposed to play a role in the development of ASD, the cerebellum is commonly reported to be altered, and cerebellar-specific deletion of Tsc1 in mice is sufficient to induce an ASD-like phenotype. Given that the mTOR pathway is crucial for proper cell replication and migration, this suggests that dysregulation of this pathway, particularly during critical phases of cerebellar development, could contribute to the establishment of ASD.\n\nHere, we used a mouse model of TSC to investigate gene and protein expression during embryonic and early postnatal periods of cerebellar development. We found that, at E18 and P7, mRNA levels of the cerebellar inhibitory interneuron marker Pax2 were dysregulated. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of mTOR pathway-related genes and downstream phosphorylation of S6. Differential gene correlation analysis revealed dynamic changes in correlated gene pairs across development, with an overall loss of correlation between mTOR- and cerebellar-related genes in Tsc1 mutants compared to controls. We corroborated the genetic findings by characterizing the mTOR pathway and cerebellar development on protein and cellular levels with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. We found that Pax2-expressing cells were hypertrophic at E18 while, at P7, their number was increased and maturation into parvalbumin-expressing cells delayed. Our findings indicate that E18 and P7 are crucial time points in cerebellar development in mice that are particularly susceptible to mTOR pathway dysregulation.\n\nManuscript contribution to the fieldASD is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, however little is known about the shared mechanisms underlying its aetiology. At the anatomical level, the cerebellum has been identified as one of the key structures involved in the development of ASD, whereas at the molecular level, mutations in the mTOR signalling pathway, essential for cell growth and proliferation, carry a high genetic risk for this disorder. We used a haploinsufficient tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) mouse model to investigate the effects of mTOR overactivation in the developing cerebellum. Tsc1 inhibits the mTOR pathway, and mice with cerebellar-specific deletion of Tsc1 have been shown to harbour an ASD-like phenotype. We found that Pax2 expression in the cerebellum is dysregulated at prenatal and early postnatal time points, leading to a delayed maturation of inhibitory interneurons. Our findings indicate that mTOR overactivity in the cerebellum selectively affects the development of cerebellar interneurons. This finding is in line with other studies, which found decreased numbers of inhibitory interneurons in other models of ASD. Therefore, deficits in the maturation of the inhibitory signalling could be one of the mechanisms integrating high-risk mutations that underlie ASD aetiology.",

    "abstract": "The identification of viral mutations that confer escape from antibodies is crucial for understanding the interplay between immunity and viral evolution. We describe a molecular dynamics (MD) based approach that scales well to a desktop computer with a high-end modern graphics processor and enables the user to identify protein sites that are prone to vaccine escape in a viral antigen. We first implement our MD pipeline to employ site-wise calculation of Kullback-Leibler divergence in atom fluctuation over replicate sets of short-term MD production runs thus enabling a statistical comparison of the rapid motion of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in both the presence and absence of three well-known neutralizing antibodies. Using this simple comparative method applied to motions of viral proteins, we successfully identified in silico all previously empirically confirmed sites of escape in influenza HA, predetermined via selection experiments and neutralization assays. Upon the validation of our computational approach, we then surveyed potential hot spot residues in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence of COVOX-222 and S2H97 antibodies. We identified many single sites in the antigen-antibody interface that are similarly prone to potential antibody escape and that match many of the known sites of mutations arising in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In the omicron variant, we find only minimal adaptive evolutionary shifts in the functional binding profiles of both antibodies. In summary, we provide a fast and accurate computational method to monitor hot spots of functional evolution in antibody binding footprints.",

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolic dysregulation is a consequence of COVID-19 infection that is a key determinant of disease severity. To understand the mechanisms underlying these cellular changes, we performed high-dimensional immune cell profiling of PBMCs from COVID-19-infected patients, in combination with single cell transcriptomic analysis of COVID-19 BALFs. Hypoxia, a hallmark of COVID-19 ARDS, was found to elicit a global metabolic reprogramming in effector lymphocytes. In response to oxygen and nutrient-deprived microenvironments, these cells shift from aerobic respiration to increase their dependence on anaerobic processes including glycolysis, mitophagy, and glutaminolysis to fulfill their bioenergetic demands. We also demonstrate metabolic dysregulation of ciliated lung epithelial cells is linked to significant increase of proinflammatory cytokine secretion and upregulation of HLA class 1 machinery. Augmented HLA class-1 antigen stimulation by epithelial cells leads to cellular exhaustion of metabolically dysregulated CD8 and NK cells, impairing their memory cell differentiation. Unsupervised clustering techniques revealed multiple distinct, differentially abundant CD8 and NK memory cell states that are marked by high glycolytic flux, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular exhaustion, further highlighting the connection between disrupted metabolism and impaired memory cell function in COVID-19. Our findings provide novel insight on how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects host immunometabolism and anti-viral response during COVID-19.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=85 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471421v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18bff7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@31f46borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5ad50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1577a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIHypoxia and anaerobic glycolysis drive CD8, NK, NKT dysfunction\nC_LIO_LIHypoxia and anaerobic glycolysis impair memory differentiation in CD8 and NK cells\nC_LIO_LIHypoxia and anaerobic glycolysis cause mitochondrial dysfunction in CD8, NK, NKT cells\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Chlorine is abundant in cells and biomolecules, yet the biology of chlorine oxidation and reduction is poorly understood. Some bacteria encode the enzyme chlorite dismutase (Cld), which detoxifies chlorite (CIO2-) by converting it to chloride (Cl-) and molecular oxygen (O2). Cld is highly specific for chlorite and aside from low hydrogen peroxide activity has no known alternative substrate. Here, we reasoned that because chlorite is an intermediate oxidation state of chlorine, Cld can be used as a biomarker for oxidized chlorine species in microorganisms and microbial habitats. Cld was abundant in metagenomes from soils and freshwater to water treatment systems. About 5% of bacterial and archaeal genera contain an organism encoding Cld in its genome, and within some genera Cld is nearly conserved. Cld has been subjected to extensive horizontal gene transfer, suggesting selection by chlorite is episodic yet strong. Cld was also used as a biomarker to predict genes related to chlorine redox chemistry. Genes found to have a genetic association with Cld include known genes for responding to reactive chlorine species and uncharacterized genes for transporters, regulatory elements, and putative oxidoreductases that present targets for future research. Cld was repeatedly co-located in genomes with genes for enzymes that can inadvertently reduce perchlorate (CIO4-) or chlorate (CIO3-), confirming that in nature (per)chlorate reduction does not only occur in specialized anaerobic respiratory metabolisms. The presence of Cld in genomes of obligate aerobes without such enzymes suggested that chlorite, like hypochlorous acid (HOCl), might be formed by oxidative processes within natural habitats. In summary, the comparative genomics of Cld has provided an atlas for a deeper understanding of chlorine oxidation and reduction reactions that are an underrecognized feature of biology.",

    "abstract": "Amphotericin B is increasingly used in treatment of leishmaniasis. Here, fourteen independent lines of Leishmania mexicana and one L. infantum line were selected for resistance to either amphotericin B or the related polyene antimicrobial, nystatin. Sterol profiling revealed that, in each line, the predominant ergostane-type sterol of wild-type cells was replaced by other sterol species. Broadly, two different profiles emerged among the resistant lines. Whole genome sequencing then showed that these distinct profiles were due either to mutations in the sterol methyl transferase (C24SMT) gene locus or the sterol C5 desaturase (C5DS) gene. In three lines an additional deletion of the miltefosine transporter was found. Differences in sensitivity to amphotericin B were apparent, depending on whether cells were grown in HOMEM, supplemented with foetal bovine serum, or a serum free defined medium (DM). These differences appeared to relate to the presence of lipids in the former. Metabolomic analysis after exposure to AmB showed that a large increase in glucose flux via the pentose phosphate pathway preceded cell death in cells sustained in HOMEM but not DM, indicating the oxidative stress was more significantly induced under HOMEM conditions. Several of the lines were tested for ability to infect macrophages and replicate as amastigote forms, alongside their ability to establish infections in mice. While several lines showed reduced virulence, at least one AmB resistant line displayed heightened virulence in mice whilst retaining its resistance phenotype, emphasising the risks of resistance emerging to this critical drug.",

    "abstract": "A human monoclonal antibody panel (PD4, PD5, PD7, SC23 and SC29) was isolated from the B cells of convalescent patients and used to examine the S protein in SARS-CoV-2- infected cells. While all five antibodies bound conformational-specific epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, only PD5, PD7, and SC23 were able to bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine the S protein RBD in cells infected with the Singapore isolates SARS-CoV-2/0334 and SARS-CoV-2/1302. The RBD-binders exhibited a distinct cytoplasmic staining pattern that was primarily localised within the Golgi complex and was distinct from the diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern exhibited by the non-RBD binders (PD4 and SC29). These data indicated that the S protein adopted a conformation in the Golgi complex that enabled the RBD recognition by the RBD-binders. The RBD-binders also recognised the uncleaved S protein indicating that S protein cleavage was not required for RBD recognition. Electron microscopy indicated high levels of cell-associated virus particles, and multiple cycle virus infection using RBD-binder staining provided evidence for direct cell-to-cell transmission for both isolates. Although similar levels of RBD-binder staining was demonstrated for each isolate, the SARS-CoV-2/1302 exhibited slower rates of cell-to-cell transmission. These data suggest that a conformational change in the S protein occurs during its transit through the Golgi complex that enables RBD recognition by the RBD-binders, and suggests that these antibodies can be used to monitor S protein RBD formation during the early stages of infection.\n\nImportanceThe SARS CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the attachment of SARS CoV-2 to the host cell. This interaction plays an essential role in initiating virus infection and the S protein RBD is therefore a focus of therapeutic and vaccine interventions. However, new virus variants have emerged with altered biological properties in the RBD that can potentially negate these interventions. Therefore an improved understanding of the biological properties of the RBD in virus-infected cells may offer future therapeutic strategies to mitigate SARS CoV-2 infection. We used physiologically relevant antibodies that were isolated from the B cells of convalescent COVID19 patients to monitor the RBD in cells infected with SARS CoV-2 clinical isolates. These immunological reagents specifically recognise the correctly folded RBD and were used to monitor the appearance of the RBD in SARS CoV-2-infected cells and identified the site where the RDB first appears.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus from the Coronaviridae family and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we explored the previously reported SARS-CoV-2 structural membrane protein (M) interaction with human Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA). The M protein is responsible for maintaining virion shape, and PCNA is a marker of DNA damage which is essential for DNA replication and repair. We validated the M PCNA interaction through immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence co-localization, and a PLA assay. In cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or transfected with M protein, using immunofluorescence and cell fractioning, we documented a reallocation of PCNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the increase of PCNA and {gamma}H2AX (another DNA damage marker) expression. We also observed an increase of PCNA and {gamma}H2AX expression in the lung of a COVID-19 patient by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the inhibition of PCNA translocation by PCNA I1 and Verdinexor led to a reduction of plaque formation in an in vitro assay. We, therefore, propose that the transport of PCNA to the cytoplasm and its association with M could be a virus strategy to manipulate cell functions and may be considered a target for COVID-19 therapy.",

    "abstract": "The TonB system of Gram-negative bacteria uses the protonmotive force of the cytoplasmic membrane to energize active transport of large or scarce nutrients across the outer membrane by means of customized beta-barrels known as TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs). The lumen of each TBDT is occluded by an amino-terminal domain, called the cork, which must be displaced for transport of nutrients or translocation of the large protein toxins that parasitize the system. A complex of cytoplasmic membrane proteins consisting of TonB, ExbB and ExbD harnesses the protonmotive force that TonB transmits to the TBDT. The specifics of this energy transformation are a source of continuing interest. The amino terminal domain of a TBDT contains a region called the TonB box, that is essential for the reception of energy from TonB. This domain is the only identified site of in vivo interaction between the TBDT and TonB, occurring through a non-essential region centered on TonB residue Q160. Because TonB binds to TBDTs whether or not it is active or even intact, the mechanism and extent of cork movement in vivo has been challenging to discover. In this study, we used in vivo disulfide crosslinking between eight engineered Cys residues in Escherichia coli TonB and 42 Cys substitutions in the TBDT FepA, including the TonB box, to identify novel sites of interaction in vivo. The TonB Cys substitutions in the core of an essential carboxy terminal amphipathic helix (residues 199-216) were compared to TonB Q160C interactions. Functionality of the in vivo interactions was established when the presence of the inactive TonB H20A mutation inhibited them. A previously unknown functional interaction between the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic helix and the FepA TonB box was identified. Interaction of Q160C with the FepA TonB box appeared to be less functionally important. The two different parts of TonB also differed in their interactions with the FepA cork and barrel turns. While the TonB amphipathic helix Cys residues interacted only with Cys residues on the periplasmic face of the FepA cork, TonB Q160C interacted with buried Cys substitutions within the FepA cork, the first such interactions seen with any TBDT. Both sets of interactions required active TonB. Taken together, these data suggest a model where the amphipathic helix binds to the TonB box, causing the mechanically weak domain of the FepA cork to dip sufficiently into the periplasmic space for interaction with the TonB Q160 region, which is an interaction that does not occur if the TonB box is deleted. The TonB amphipathic helix also interacted with periplasmic turns between FepA {beta}-strands in vivo supporting a surveillance mechanism where TonB searched for TBDTs on the periplasmic face of the outer membrane.",

YfiH is a PG-editing factor whose absence causes misincorporation of L-Ser instead of L-Ala into peptide stems; but its mechanistic function is unknown. Here we report the crystal structures of substrate-bound and product-bound YfiH, showing that YfiH is a cytoplasmic amidase that controls the incorporation of the correct amino acid to the nucleotide precursors by preferentially cleaving the nucleotide precursor byproduct UDP-MurNAc-L-Ser.

    "abstract": "It has recently been shown that CFIm25, a canonical mRNA 3 processing factor, could play a variety of physiological roles through its molecular function in the regulation of mRNA alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing approach in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for CFIm25, and obtained three gene knockdown/mutant cell lines. CFIm25 gene editing resulted in higher proliferation rate and impaired differentiation potential for hESCs, with these effects likely to be directly regulated by the target genes, including the pluripotency factor rex1. Mechanistically, we unexpected found that perturbation in CFIm25 gene expression did not significantly affect cellular mRNA 3 processing efficiency and APA profile. Rather, we provided evidences that CFIm25 may impact RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy at the body of transcribed genes, and promote the expression level of a group of transcripts associated with cellular proliferation and/or differentiation. Further study indicated that CFIm25 association with LEO1, an RNAPII associated factor, might contribute to the effect. Taken together, these results reveal novel mechanisms underlying CFIm25s modulation in determination of cell fate, and provide evidence that the process of mammalian gene transcription may be regulated by an mRNA 3 processing factor.",

The simplest sitespecific recombination systems will recombine any two cognate sites regardless of context. Other systems have evolved elaborate mechanisms, often sensing DNA topology, to ensure that only one of multiple possible recombination products is produced. The closely-related resolvases from the Tn3 and {gamma}{delta} transposons have historically served as paradigms for the regulation of recombinase activity by DNA topology. However, despite many proposals, models of the multi-subunit protein-DNA complex (termed the synaptosome) that enforces this regulation have been unsatisfying due to a lack of experimental constraints and incomplete concordance with experimental data. Here we present new structural and biochemical data that lead to a new, detailed model of the Tn3 synaptosome, and discuss how it harnesses DNA topology to regulate the enzymatic activity of the recombinase.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Spike is a key protein that mediates viral entry into cells and elicits antibody responses. Its importance in infection, diagnostics, and vaccinations has created a large demand for purified Spike for clinical and research applications. Spike is difficult to express, prompting modifications to the protein and expression platforms to improve yields. Alternatively, Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) is commonly expressed with higher titers, though it has lower sensitivity in serological assays. Here, we improve transient Spike expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We demonstrate that Spike titers increase significantly over the expression period, maximizing at 14 mg/L at day 7. In comparison, RBD titers peak at 54 mg/L at day 3. Next, we develop 8 Spike truncations (T1-T8) in pursuit of a truncation with high expression and antibody binding. The truncations T1 and T4 express at 130 mg/L and 73 mg/L, respectively, which are higher than our RBD titers. Purified proteins were evaluated for binding to antibodies raised against full-length Spike. T1 has similar sensitivity as Spike against a monoclonal antibody and even outperforms Spike for a polyclonal antibody. These results suggest T1 is a promising Spike alternative for use in various applications.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-COV2 Omicron variant has sparked global concern due to the possibility of enhanced transmissibility and escape from vaccines and therapeutics. In this study, we describe the mutational landscape of the Omicron variant using amino acid interaction (AAI) networks. AAI network analysis is particularly well suited for interrogating the impact of constellations of mutations as occur on Omicron that may function in an epistatic manner. Our analyses suggest that as compared to previous variants of concern, the Omicron variant has increased antibody escape breadth due to mutations in class 3 and 4 antibody epitopes as well as increased escape depth due to accumulated mutations in class 1 antibody epitopes. We note certain RBD mutations that might further enhance Omicrons escape, and in particular advise careful surveillance of two subclades bearing R346S/K mutations with relevance for certain therapeutic antibodies. Further, AAI network analysis suggests that the function of certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies may be disrupted by Omicron mutations as a result of the cumulative indirect perturbations to the epitope surface properties, despite point-mutation analyses suggesting these antibodies are tolerant of the set of Omicron mutations in isolation. Finally, for several Omicron mutations that do not appear to contribute meaningfully to antibody escape, we find evidence for a plausible role in enhanced transmissibility via disruption of RBD-down conformational stability at the RBD-RBD interface.",

    "abstract": "Drugs targeting the G protein-coupled -opioid receptor (OR) are the most effective analgesics available but are also associated with fatal respiratory depression. While some partial opioid agonists appear to be safer than full agonists, the signaling pathways responsible for respiratory depression have yet to be elucidated. Here we investigated the structural and mechanistic basis of action of lofentanil (LFT) and mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (MP), two OR agonists with different safety profiles. LFT, one of the most potent and lethal opioids, and MP, a derivative from the kratom plant with reduced respiratory depression in animal studies at equianalgesic doses, exhibited markedly different signaling efficacy profiles for G protein subtype activation and recruitment of {beta}-arrestins. Cryo-EM structures of the OR-Gi1 complex with MP (2.5[A]) and LFT (3.2[A]) revealed that the two ligands engage distinct sub-pockets, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed additional differences in the binding site that propagate to the intracellular side of the receptor where G proteins and {beta}-arrestins bind. While MP favors the precise G protein-bound active state observed in the cryo-EM structures, LFT favors a distinct active state. These results highlight how drugs engaging different parts of the OR orthosteric pocket can lead to distinct signaling outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The chemical modification of RNA bases represents a ubiquitous activity that spans all domains of life. Pseudouridylation is the most common RNA modification and is observed within tRNA, rRNA, ncRNA and mRNAs. Pseudouridine synthase or  PUS enzymes include those that rely on guide RNA molecules and others that function as  stand-alone enzymes. Among the latter, several have been shown to modify mRNA transcripts. Although recent studies have defined the structural requirements for RNA to act as a PUS target, the mechanisms by which PUS1 recognizes these target sequences in mRNA are not well understood. Here we describe the crystal structure of yeast PUS1 bound to an RNA target that we identified as being a hot spot for PUS1-interaction within a model mRNA at 2.4 [A] resolution. The enzyme recognizes and binds both strands in a helical base-paired RNA duplex, and thus guides the RNA containing the target uridine to the active site for subsequent modification of the transcript. The study also allows us to show the divergence of related PUS1 enzymes and their corresponding RNA target specificities, and to speculate on the basis by which PUS1 binds and modifies mRNA or tRNA substrates.",

    "abstract": "The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination on pregnancy and fertility has become a major topic of public interest. We investigated two of the most widely propagated claims to determine 1) whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccination of mice during early pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of birth defects or growth abnormalities, and 2) whether COVID-19 mRNA-vaccinated human volunteers exhibit elevated levels of antibodies to the human placental protein syncytin-1. Using a mouse model, we found that intramuscular COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during early pregnancy at gestational age E7.5 did not lead to differences in fetal size by crown-rump length or weight at term, nor did we observe any gross birth defects. In contrast, injection of the TLR3 agonist and double-stranded RNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, or poly(I:C), impacted growth in utero leading to reduced fetal size. No overt maternal illness following either vaccination or poly(I:C) exposure was observed. We also found that term fetuses from vaccinated murine pregnancies exhibit high circulating levels of anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 consistent with maternal antibody status, indicating transplacental transfer. Finally, we did not detect increased levels of circulating anti-syncytin-1 antibodies in a cohort of COVID-19 vaccinated adults compared to unvaccinated adults by ELISA. Our findings contradict popular claims associating COVID-19 mRNA vaccination with infertility and adverse neonatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The rise in wildfire frequency and severity across the globe has increased interest in secondary succession. However, despite the role of soil microbial communities in controlling biogeochemical cycling and their role in the regeneration of post-fire vegetation, the lack of measurements immediately post-fire and at high temporal resolution has limited understanding of microbial secondary succession. To fill this knowledge gap, we sampled soils at 17, 25, 34, 67, 95, 131, 187, 286, and 376 days after a southern California wildfire in fire-adapted chaparral shrublands. We assessed bacterial and fungal biomass with qPCR of 16S and 18S and richness and composition with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S and ITS2 amplicons. Fire severely reduced bacterial biomass by 47%, bacterial richness by 46%, fungal biomass by 86%, and fungal richness by 68%. The burned bacterial and fungal communities experienced rapid succession, with 5-6 compositional turnover periods. Analogous to plants, turnover was driven by \"fire-loving\" pyrophilous microbes, many of which have been previously found in forests worldwide and changed markedly in abundance over time. Fungal secondary succession was initiated by the Basidiomycete yeast Geminibasidium, which traded off against the filamentous Ascomycetes Pyronema, Aspergillus, and Penicillium. For bacteria, the Proteobacteria Massilia dominated all year, but the Firmicute Bacillus and Proteobacteria Noviherbaspirillum increased in abundance over time. Our high-resolution temporal sampling allowed us to capture post-fire microbial secondary successional dynamics and suggest that putative tradeoffs in thermotolerance, colonization, and competition among dominant pyrophilous microbes control microbial succession with possible implications for ecosystem function.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses initiate infection in the gastrointestinal tract, and sex is often a biological variable that impacts pathogenesis. Previous data suggest that sex hormones can influence intestinal replication of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family. However, the specific sex hormone(s) that regulate intestinal CVB3 replication is poorly understood. To determine if testosterone promotes intestinal CVB3 replication, we orally inoculated male and female Ifnar-/- mice that were treated with either placebo or testosterone-filled capsules. Following oral inoculation, we found that testosterone-treated male and female mice shed significantly more CVB3 in the feces than placebo-treated mice indicating that testosterone enhances intestinal replication. Similarly, testosterone enhanced viral dissemination in both sexes as we observed higher viral loads in peripheral tissues following infection. Further, male mice treated with testosterone also had a higher mortality rate than testosterone-depleted male mice. Finally, we observed that testosterone significantly affected the immune response to CVB3. We found that testosterone broadly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines while decreasing the number of splenic B cells and dendritic cells following CVB3 infection. Moreover, while testosterone did not affect the early CD4 T cell response to CVB3, testosterone reduced the activation of CD8 T cells. These data indicate that testosterone can promote intestinal CVB3 replication and dissemination while impacting the subsequent viral immune response.\n\nImportanceBiological sex plays a significant role in the outcome of various infections and diseases. The impact of sex hormones on intestinal replication and dissemination of Coxsackievirus B3 remains poorly understood. Using an oral inoculation model, we found that testosterone enhances CVB3 shedding and dissemination in male and female mice. Further, testosterone can alter the immune response to CVB3. This work highlights the role of testosterone in CVB3 pathogenesis and suggests that sex hormones can impact the replication and dissemination of enteric viruses.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of multi-gene expression is one of the key challenges of metabolic engineering for the development of cell factories. Constraints on translation initiation and early ribosome kinetics of mRNA are imposed by features of the 5UTR in combination with the start of the gene, referred to as the \"gene ramp\", such as rare codons and mRNA secondary structures. These features strongly influence translation yield and protein quality by regulating ribosome distribution on mRNA strands. The utilization of genetic expression sequences, such as promoters and 5UTRs in combination with different target genes leads to a wide variety of gene ramp compositions with irregular translation rates leading to unpredictable levels of protein yield and quality. Here, we present the Standard Intein Gene Expression Ramps (SIGER) system for controlling protein expression. The SIGER system makes use of inteins to decouple the translation initiation features from the gene of a target protein. We generated sequence-specific gene expression sequences for two inteins (DnaB and DnaX) that display defined levels of protein expression. Additionally, we used inteins that possess the ability to release the C-terminal fusion protein in vivo to avoid impairment of protein functionality by the fused intein. Overall, our results show that SIGER systems are unique tools to mitigate the undesirable effects of gene ramp variation and to control the relative ratios of enzymes involved in molecular pathways. As a proof of concept of the potential of the system, we also used a SIGER system to express two difficult-to-produce proteins, GumM and CBM73.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471673v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c759acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d03c87org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135d6f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b48eac_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSugarcane hemicellulosic material is a compelling source of usually neglected xylose that could figure as feedstock to produce chemical building blocks of high economic value, such as xylitol. In this context, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains typically used in the Brazilian bioethanol industry are a robust chassis for genetic engineering, given their robustness towards harsh operational conditions and outstanding fermentation performance. Nevertheless, there are no reports on the use of these strains for xylitol production using sugarcane hydrolysate.\n\nRESULTSPotential single-guided RNA off-targets were analyzed in two preeminent industrial strains (PE-2 and SA-1), providing a database of 5-NGG 20 nt sequences, and guidelines for the fast and cost-effective CRISPR-editing of such strains. After genomic integration of a NADPH-preferring xylose reductase (XR), FMYX (SA-1 ho{Delta}::xyl1) and CENPKX (CEN.PK-122 ho{Delta}::xyl1) were tested in varying cultivation conditions for xylitol productivity to infer influence of the genetic background. Near-theoretical yields were achieved for all strains, however the industrial consistently outperformed the laboratory strain. Batch fermentation of raw sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate with remaining solid particles represented a challenge for xylose metabolization and 3.65 {+/-} 0.16 g/L xylitol titre was achieved by FMYX. Finally, quantification of NADPH - cofactor implied in XR activity - revealed that FMYX has 33% more available cofactors than CENPKX.\n\nCONCLUSIONSAlthough widely used in several S. cerevisiae strains, this is the first report of CRISPR-Cas9 editing major yeast of the Brazilian bioethanol industry. Fermentative assays of xylose consumption revealed that NADPH availability is closely related to mutant strains performance. We also pioneer the use of sugarcane bagasse as a substrate for xylitol production. Finally, we demonstrate how industrial background SA-1 is a compelling chassis for the second-generation industry, given its inhibitor tolerance and better redox environment that may favor production of reduced sugars.",

    "abstract": "Quiescent leukemic cells survive chemotherapy, with translation changes. Our data reveal that FXR1, a protein amplified in several aggressive cancers, increases in quiescent and chemo- treated leukemic cells, and promotes chemosurvival. This suggests undiscovered roles for this RNA- and ribosome-associated protein in chemosurvival. FXR1 depletion decreases translation and ribosome subunits, with altered rRNAs, snoRNAs, and ribosomal proteins (RPs). We find that FXR1 binds factors that promote ribosome gene transcription and bind snoRNAs. Ribosome changes increased in FXR1-overexpressing cells, including increased snoRNAs and RPLP0/uL10, activate eIF2 kinases. Accordingly, phospho-eIF2 increases, enabling non- canonical translation of survival and immune regulators in FXR1-overexpressing cells. Overriding these with inhibitors reduces chemosurvival. Thus, increased FXR1 in quiescent or chemo-treated leukemic cells, alters ribosomes that trigger stress signals to re-direct translation for chemosurvival.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryFXR1 alters ribosomes in G0, which induce stress signals to elicit noncanonical translation for AML drug and immune survival.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most mutagenic form of DNA damage, and play a significant role in cancer biology, neurodegeneration and aging. However, studying DSB-induced mutagenesis is currently limited by the tools available for mapping these mutations. Here, we describe iMUT-seq, a technique that profiles DSB-induced mutations at high-sensitivity and single-nucleotide resolution around endogenous DSBs spread across the genome. By depleting 20 different DSB-repair factors we defined their mutational signatures in detail, revealing remarkable insights into the mechanisms of DSB-induced mutagenesis. We find that homologous-recombination (HR) is mutagenic in nature, displaying high levels of base substitutions and mononucleotide deletions due to DNA-polymerase errors, but simultaneously reduced translocation events, suggesting the primary role of HR is the specific suppression of genomic rearrangements. The results presented here offer new fundamental insights into DSB-induced mutagenesis and have significant implications for our understanding of cancer biology and the development of DDR-targeting chemotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 8/9 helicase is a AAA+ complex involved in DNA replication-associated repair. Despite high sequence homology to the MCM2-7 helicase, an active role for MCM8/9 has remained elusive. We interrogated fork progression in cells lacking MCM8 or 9 and find there is a functional partitioning. Loss of MCM8 or 9 slows overall replication speed and increases markers of genomic damage and fork instability, further compounded upon treatment with hydroxyurea. MCM8/9 acts upstream and antagonizes the recruitment of BRCA1 in nontreated conditions. However, upon treatment with fork stalling agents, MCM9 recruits Rad51 to protect and remodel persistently stalled forks. The helicase function of MCM8/9 aids in normal replication fork progression, but upon excessive stalling, MCM8/9 directs additional stabilizers to protect forks from degradation. This evidence defines novel multifunctional roles for MCM8/9 in promoting normal replication fork progression and promoting genome integrity following stress.",

    "abstract": "The intimate association between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial membranes at ER-mitochondria contact sites serves as a platform for several critical cellular processes, in particular lipid synthesis. Enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis are enriched at contacts and membrane lipid composition at contacts is distinct relative to surrounding membranes. How contacts are remodeled and the subsequent biological consequences of altered contacts such as perturbed lipid metabolism remains poorly understood. Here we show that the p97 AAA-ATPase and its ER-tethered ubiquitin-X domain adaptor 8 (UBXD8) regulate the prevalence of ER-mitochondria contacts. The p97-UBXD8 complex localizes to contacts and loss of this complex increases contacts in a manner that is dependent on p97 catalytic activity. Quantitative proteomics of purified contacts demonstrates alterations in proteins regulating lipid metabolism upon loss of UBXD8. Furthermore, lipidomics studies indicate significant changes in distinct lipid species in UBXD8 knockout cells. We show that loss of p97-UBXD8 results in perturbed contacts due to an increase in membrane lipid saturation via SREBP1 and the lipid desaturase SCD1. Aberrant contacts in p97-UBXD8 loss of function cells can be rescued by supplementation with unsaturated fatty acids or overexpression of SCD1. Perturbation of contacts and inherent lipid synthesis is emerging as a hallmark to a variety of human disorders such as neurodegeneration. Notably, we find that the SREBP1-SCD1 pathway is negatively impacted in the brains of mice with p97 mutations that cause neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that contacts are exquisitely sensitive to alterations to membrane lipid composition and saturation in a manner that is dependent on p97-UBXD8.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTriatoma infestans is the main vector of Chagas disease in the Southern Cone. The resistance to pyrethroid insecticides developed by populations of this species impairs the effectiveness of vector control campaigns in wide regions of Argentina. The study of the global transcriptomic response to pyrethroid insecticides is important to deepen the knowledge about detoxification in triatomines.\n\nMethodology and findingsWe used RNA-Seq to explore the early transcriptomic response of T. infestans after intoxication with deltamethrin. We were able to assemble a complete transcriptome of this vector and found evidence of differentially expressed genes belonging to diverse families such as chemosensory and odorant-binding proteins, ABC transporters and heat-shock proteins. Moreover, genes related to transcription and translation, energetic metabolism and cuticle rearrangements were also modulated. Finally, we characterized the repertoire of previously uncharacterized detoxification-related gene families in T. infestans and Rhodnius prolixus.\n\nConclusions and significanceOur work contributes to the understanding of the detoxification response in vectors of Chagas disease. Given the absence of genomic information from T. infestans, the analysis presented here constitutes a resource for molecular and physiological studies in this species. The results increase the knowledge on detoxification processes in vectors of Chagas disease, and provide relevant information to explore new potential insecticide resistance mechanisms in these insects.\n\nAuthor summaryChagas disease affects millions of people worldwide. In the Southern Cone, the development of pyrethroid resistant populations from T. infestans is related to vector persistence and affects the efficiency of vector control campaigns. Several studies have explored the causes of insecticide resistance in T. infestans populations. However, the global transcriptomic response after insecticide treatment has not been analyzed in this species so far. In this study, we obtained transcriptomic information which allowed us to characterize important gene families despite the absence of genomic information. Furthermore, we performed a quantitative analysis of gene expression after deltamethrin intoxication. The results provided here increase the knowledge on detoxification processes in vectors of Chagas disease, which is essential for the design of new vector control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Human Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA-p21 (LincRNA-p21) is a regulatory noncoding RNA that plays an important role in promoting apoptosis. LincRNA-p21 is also critical in down-regulating many p53 target genes through its interaction with a p53 repressive complex. The interaction between LincRNA-p21 and the repressive complex is likely dependent on the RNA tertiary structure. Previous studies have determined the two-dimensional secondary structures of the sense and antisense human LincRNA-p21 AluSx1 IRs using SHAPE. However, there were no insights into its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, we in vitro transcribed the sense and antisense regions of LincRNA-p21 AluSx1 Inverted Repeats (IRs) and performed analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, light scattering, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies. Based on these studies, we determined low-resolution, three-dimensional structures of sense and antisense LincRNA-p21. By adapting previously known two-dimensional information, we calculated their sense and antisense high-resolution models and determined that they agree with the low-resolution structures determined using SAXS. Thus, our integrated approach provides insights into the structure of LincRNA-p21 Alu IRs. Our study also offers a viable pipeline for combining the secondary structure information with biophysical and computational studies to obtain high-resolution atomistic models for long noncoding RNAs.",

    "abstract": "The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arthropod-borne viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. A novel approach to mitigate arboviral infections is to generate mosquitoes refractory to infection by overexpressing antiviral effector molecules. Such an approach requires a mechanism to spread these antiviral effectors through a population, for example, by using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive (GD) systems. Critical to the design of a single-locus autonomous GD is that the selected genomic locus be amenable to both GD and appropriate expression of the antiviral effector. In our study, we used reverse engineering to target two intergenic genomic loci, which had previously shown to be highly permissive for antiviral effector gene expression, and we further investigated the use of three promoters (nanos, {beta}2-tubulin, or zpg) for Cas9 expression. We then quantified the accrual of insertions or deletions (indels) after single generation crossings, measured maternal effects, and assessed fitness costs associated with the various transgenic lines to model the rate of GD fixation. Overall, MGDrivE modeling suggested that when an autonomous GD is placed into an intergenic locus, the GD system will eventually be blocked by the accrual of GD blocking resistance alleles and ultimately be lost in the population. Moreover, while genomic locus and promoter selection were critically important for the initial establishment of the autonomous GD, it was the fitness of the GD line that most strongly influenced the persistence of the GD in the simulated population. As such, we propose that when autonomous CRISPR/Cas9 based GD systems are anchored in an intergenic locus, they temporarily result in a strong population replacement effect, but as GD-blocking indels accrue, the GD becomes exhausted due to the fixation of CRISPR resistance alleles.\n\nSignificance statementFor the purpose of population replacement, CRISPR/Cas9 based gene drives (GD) have been developed in Anopheles spp. and split GDs have been developed in Ae. aegypti. In our study, we developed autonomous GD in Ae. aegypti and positioned the drives in intergenic loci ideal for the expression of antiviral effector genes. Our results suggest that when the GD is placed into an intergenic locus, there is rapid introgression of the GD resulting in a transient population replacement followed by loss of the drive as resistance alleles accrue. Fitness of the transgenic lines and maternal deposition of CRISPR/Cas9 components were the major contributing factors affecting the perseverance of the GD in our population models.",

A dynamic model of the core components of the ABA signaling pathway was built using ordinary differential equations to understand the connectivity. Parameter values of protein-protein interactions and enzymatic reactions in the model were implemented from the data obtained by previously conducted experiments. On the other hand, parameter values of gene expression and translation were determined by comparing the kinetics of gene expression in the model to those of ABA-induced RD29A (response to desiccation 29A) in actual plants. Based on the analyses of the optimized model, we hypothesized that the translation rate of PP2C (protein phosphatase type 2C) is downregulated by ABA to increase the ABRE (ABA-responsive element) promoter activity. The hypotheses were preliminarily supported by newly conducted experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that carry a luciferase expression cassette driven by the RD29A promoter (RD29A::LUC). The model suggests that identifying a mechanism that alters PP2C translation rate would be one of the next research frontiers in the ABA signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a devastating disease of progressive heterotopic bone formation for which effective treatments are currently unavailable. FOP is caused by dominant gain-of-function mutations in the receptor ACVR1 (also known as ALK2), which render the receptor inappropriately responsive to activin ligands. In previous studies, we developed a genetic mouse model of FOP that recapitulates most clinical aspects of the disease. In this model, genetic loss of the wild-type Acvr1 allele profoundly exacerbated heterotopic ossification, suggesting the hypothesis that the stoichiometry of wild-type and mutant receptors dictates disease severity. Here, we tested this model by producing FOP mice that conditionally over-express human wild-type ACVR1. Injury-induced heterotopic ossification (HO) was completely blocked in FOP mice when expression of both the mutant and wild-type receptor were targeted to Tie2-positive cells, which includes fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Perinatal lethality of Acvr1R206H/+ mice was rescued by constitutive ACVR1 over-expression and these mice survived to adulthood at predicted Mendelian frequencies. Constitutive over-expression of ACVR1 also provided protection from spontaneous HO, and the incidence and severity of injury-induced HO in these mice was dramatically reduced. Analysis of pSMAD1/5/8 signaling both in cultured cells and in vivo indicates that ACVR1 over-expression functions cell-autonomously by reducing osteogenic signaling in response to activin A. Manipulating the stoichiometry of FOP-causing and wild-type ACVR1 receptors may provide the foundation for novel therapeutic strategies to treat this devastating disease.",

Our findings provide insights into structural modification caused by the mutations in the Omicrons receptor-binding domain and look into the effects on interaction with the hosts neutralising antibodies CR3022, B38, CB6, P2B-2F6, and REGN, as well as ACE2R using an in silico approach. We have employed secondary structure prediction, structural superimposition, protein disorderness, molecular docking, and MD simulation to investigate host-pathogen interactions, immune evasion, and transmissibility caused by mutations in the RBD region of the spike protein of the Omicron variant and compared it to the Delta variants (AY.1, AY.2, & AY.3) and wild type. Computational analysis revealed that the Omicron variant has a higher binding affinity for the human ACE2 receptor than the wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2 strains), but lower than the Delta AY.3 strain. MD simulation and docking analysis suggest that the omicron and Delta AY.3 were found to have relatively unstable and compact RBD structures and hampered interactions with antibodies more than wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2), which may lead to relatively more pathogenicity and antibody escape. In addition, we observed lower binding affinity of Omicron for human monoclonal antibodies (CR3022, B38, CB6, and P2B2F6) when compared to wild and Delta (AY.1 & AY.2). However, the binding affinity of Omicron RBD variants for CR3022, B38, and P2B2F6 antibodies is lower as compared to Delta AY.3, which might promote immune evasion and reinfection and needs further experimental investigation.",
