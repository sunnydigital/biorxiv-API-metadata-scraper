    "abstract": "Development of automated analysis tools for \"single ion channel\" recording is hampered by the lack of available training data. For machine learning based tools, very large training sets are necessary with sample-by-sample point labelled data (e.g., 1 sample point every 100microsecond). In an experimental context, such data are labelled with human supervision, and whilst this is feasible for simple experimental analysis, it is infeasible to generate the enormous datasets that would be necessary for a big data approach using hand crafting. In this work we aimed to develop methods to generate simulated ion channel data that is free from assumptions and prior knowledge of noise and underlying hidden Markov models.\n\nWe successfully leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to build an end-to-end pipeline for generating an unlimited amount of labelled training data from a small annotated ion channel \"seed\" record, and this needs no prior knowledge of theoretical dynamical ion channel properties. Our method utilises 2D CNNs to maintain the synchronised temporal relationship between the raw and idealised record. We demonstrate the applicability of the method with 5 different data sources and show authenticity with t-SNE and UMAP projection comparisons between real and synthetic data. The model would be easily extendable to other time series data requiring parallel labelling, such as labelled ECG signals or raw nanopore sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTumour-cell detachment is a critical early event in the metastatic cascade. However, the role of the cells mechanical properties in detachment and migration is not well understood. This exploratory study aimed to assess how intracellular stiffness changes these processes.\n\nMethodsMDA-MB-231 cells were embedded as 10,000-cell spheroids in 2 and 4 mg/ml collagen matrices. Intracellular stiffness was assessed with mitochondria tracking microrheology of cells that migrated distances equivalent to four and six times the cell diameter (dC) from the spheroid and compared to cells at the spheroid surface (0dC), representing medium, high and no migration, respectively.\n\nResults and discussionThe mitochondrial mean square displacement and intracellular stiffness decreased during detachment and migration for both collagen concentrations (i.e. rigidities). The mean square displacement of 4dC and 6dC cells was similar, whereas cell stiffness was lower for 4dC than for 6dC cells. With increasing matrix rigidity, the intracellular stiffness decreased for 0dC cells and did not change for 4dC and 6dC cells. It is proposed that decreased cell stiffness drives detachment and migration and increased matrix rigidity physically hinders migration, and cells need to become softer or remodel the environment to migrate. The independence of the stiffness of migrated cells from matrix rigidity suggests that cells remodel their environment through matrix proteins cleavage to migrate.\n\nConclusionsThe study revealed the collective effects of enhanced migratory conditions and increased matrix rigidity on the mechanical properties of the cells. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor {beta} and the role of cell volume on detachment and migration in matrices with varying pore sizes are proposed targets for further studies on metastatic cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Learning-related changes in brain activity are thought to underlie adaptive behaviors1,2. For instance, the learning of a reward site by rodents requires the development of an over-representation of that location in the hippocampus3-6. However, how this learning-related change occurs remains unknown. Here we recorded hippocampal CA1 population activity as mice learned a reward location on a linear treadmill. Physiological and pharmacological evidence suggests that the adaptive over-representation required behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP)7. BTSP is known to be driven by dendritic voltage signals that we hypothesized were initiated by input from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3). Accordingly, the CA1 over-representation was largely removed by optogenetic inhibition of EC3 activity. Recordings from EC3 neurons revealed an activity pattern that could provide an instructive signal directing BTSP to generate the over-representation. Consistent with this function, exposure to a second environment possessing a prominent reward-predictive cue resulted in both EC3 activity and CA1 place field density that were more elevated at the cue than the reward. These data indicate that learning-related changes in the hippocampus are produced by synaptic plasticity directed by an instructive signal from the EC3 that appears to be specifically adapted to the behaviorally relevant features of the environment.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian brain has an enormous demand for energy, which is thought to impose strong selective pressure by which the neurons evolve in ways that ensure robust function at minimal energy cost. However, which principles drive the ion channel distributions in the dendrites to implement different neuronal functions is yet unclear. Here we found that an energy-efficient generation of dendritic calcium action potentials in cortical pyramidal neurons requires a low expression of slow inactivating potassium channels. We demonstrate that this relationship between energy cost and neuronal function is independent of the dendritic morphology and the expression patterns of other ion channels that implement additional perisomatic and dendritic functions. Moreover, we found that calcium action potentials can arise from a wide spectrum of ion channel expression patterns, including configurations with high potassium channel densities in the dendrites. These configurations can account equally well for the characteristic intrinsic physiology of the pyramidal neurons. However, only configurations with low potassium channel densities in the distal dendrites are observed empirically. Thus, our findings indicate that cortical neurons do not utilize all theoretically possible ways to implement their functions, but instead select those optimized for energy-efficient active dendritic computations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding recovery of consciousness and elucidating its underlying mechanism is believed to be crucial in the field of basic neuroscience and medicine. Ideas such as the global neuronal workspace and the mesocircuit theory hypothesize that failure of recovery in conscious states coincide with loss of connectivity between subcortical and frontoparietal areas, a loss of the repertoire of functional networks states and metastable brain activation. We adopted a time-resolved functional connectivity framework to explore these ideas and assessed the repertoire of functional network states as a potential marker of consciousness and its potential ability to tell apart patients in the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). In addition, prediction of these functional network states by underlying hidden spatial patterns in the anatomical network, i.e. so-called eigenmodes, were supplemented as potential markers. By analysing time-resolved functional connectivity from fMRI data, we demonstrated a reduction of metastability and functional network repertoire in UWS compared to MCS patients. This was expressed in terms of diminished dwell times and loss of nonstationarity in the default mode network and fronto-parietal subcortical network in UWS compared to MCS patients. We further demonstrated that these findings co-occurred with a loss of dynamic interplay between structural eigenmodes and emerging time-resolved functional connectivity in UWS. These results are, amongst others, in support of the global neuronal workspace theory and the mesocircuit hypothesis, underpinning the role of time-resolved thalamo-cortical connections and metastability in the recovery of consciousness.",

    "abstract": "The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) has become a symbol of the threat to biodiversity from climate change. Understanding polar bear evolutionary history may provide insights into apex carnivore responses and prospects during periods of extreme environmental perturbations. In recent years, genomic studies have examined bear speciation and population history, including evidence for ancient admixture between polar bears and brown bears (Ursus arctos). Here, we extend our earlier studies of a 130,000-115,000-year-old polar bear from the Svalbard Archipelago using a 10X coverage genome sequence and ten new genomes of polar and brown bears from contemporary zones of overlap in northern Alaska. We demonstrate a dramatic decline in effective population size for this ancient polar bears lineage, followed by a modest increase just before its demise. A slightly higher genetic diversity in the ancient polar bear suggests a severe genetic erosion over a prolonged bottleneck in modern polar bears. Statistical fitting of data to alternative admixture graph scenarios favors at least one ancient introgression event from brown bears into the ancestor of polar bears, possibly dating back over 150,000 years. Gene flow was likely bidirectional, but allelic transfer from brown into polar bear is the strongest detected signal, which contrasts with other published works. These findings may have implications for our understanding of climate change impacts: polar bears, a specialist Arctic lineage, may not only have undergone severe genetic bottlenecks, but also been the recipient of generalist, boreal genetic variants from brown bear during critical phases of Northern Hemisphere glacial oscillations.\n\nSignificanceInterspecific hybridization is a widespread phenomenon, but measuring its extent, directionality, and adaptive importance remains challenging. Ancient genomes, however, can help illuminate the history of modern organisms. Here, we present a genome retrieved from a 130,000-115,000-year-old polar bear and perform genome analyses of modern polar and brown bears throughout their geographic range. We find that the principal direction of ancient allele sharing was from brown bear into polar bear, although gene flow between them has likely been bidirectional. This inverts the current paradigm of unidirectional gene flow from polar into brown bear, and it suggests that polar bears were recipients of external genetic variation prior to their extensive population decline.",

Here, in NEUROG2-induced human neurons, we identified 31 risk SNPs in 26 schizophrenia (SZ) risk loci that displayed allele-specific open chromatin (ASoC) and were likely to be functional. Editing the strongest ASoC SNP rs2027349 near vacuolar protein sorting 45 homolog (VPS45) altered the expression of VPS45, lncRNA AC244033.2, and a distal gene, C1orf54, in human neurons. Notably, the global gene expression changes in neurons were enriched for SZ risk and correlated with post-mortem brain gene expression signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders. Neurons carrying the risk allele exhibited increased dendritic complexity, synaptic puncta density, and hyperactivity, which were reversed by knocking-down distinct cis-regulated genes (VPS45, AC244033.2, or C1orf54), suggesting a phenotypic contribution from all three genes. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis of knockdown cells suggested a non-additive effects of these genes. Our study reveals a compound effect of multiple genes at a single SZ locus on synaptic development and function, providing a mechanistic link between a non-coding SZ risk variant and disease-related cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of non-rapid eye movement sleep is the coordinated interplay of slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. Traditionally, a cortico-thalamo-cortical loop is suggested to coordinate these rhythms: neocortically-generated SOs trigger spindles in the thalamus that are projected back to neocortex. Here, we used intrathalamic recordings from human epilepsy patients to test this canonical interplay. We show that SOs in the anterior thalamus precede neocortical SOs (peak -50 ms), whereas concurrently-recorded SOs in the mediodorsal thalamus are led by neocortical SOs (peak +50 ms). Sleep spindles, detected in both thalamic nuclei, preceded their neocortical counterparts (peak -100 ms) and were initiated during early phases of thalamic SOs. Our findings indicate an active role of the anterior thalamus in organizing sleep rhythms in the neocortex and highlight the functional diversity of thalamic nuclei in humans. The thalamic coordination of sleep oscillations could have broad implications for the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation.",

The T cell receptor (TCR), a heterodimer of one  and one {beta} chain, is a promising target, with the complete TCR repertoire reflecting the T cells present in an individual. To this end, we developed Tseek, an unbiased and accurate method for profiling the TCR repertoire by sequencing the TCR  and {beta} chains and developing a suite of tools for repertoire analysis. An added advantage is the ability to non-invasively analyze T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Tseek and the analytical suite were used to explore the T cell response to both the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (n=9) and the seasonal inactivated Influenza vaccine (n=5) at several time points. Neutralizing antibody titers were also measured in the covid vaccine samples. The COVID-19 vaccine elicited a broad T cell response involving multiple expanded clones, whereas the Influenza vaccine elicited a narrower response involving fewer clones. Many distinct T cell clones responded at each time point, over a month, providing temporal details lacking in the antibody measurements, especially before the antibodies are detectable. In individuals recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the first vaccine dose elicited a robust T cell response, while the second dose elicited a comparatively weaker response, indicating a saturation of the response. The physical symptoms experienced by the recipients immediately following the vaccinations were not indicative of the TCR/antibody responses. The TCR responses broadly presaged the antibody responses. We also found that the TCR repertoire acts as an individual fingerprint: donors of blood samples taken years apart could be identified solely based upon their TCR repertoire, hinting at other surprising uses the TCR repertoire may have. These results demonstrate the promise of TCR repertoire sequencing as an early and sensitive measure of the adaptive immune response to vaccination, which can help improve immunogen selection and optimize vaccine dosage and spacing between doses.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in the development of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies for Ebola virus disease, treatment options remain limited. Moreover, management and containment of Ebola virus outbreaks is often hindered by the remote nature of the locations in which the outbreaks originate. Small-molecule compounds offer the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, transport and store, making them an interesting modality for the development of novel therapeutics against Ebola virus disease. Furthermore, the repurposing of small-molecule compounds, previously developed for alternative applications, can aid in reducing the time needed to bring potential therapeutics from bench to bedside. For this purpose, the Medicines for Malaria Venture provides collections of previously developed small-molecule compounds for screening against other infectious diseases. In this study, we used biologically contained Ebola virus to screen over 4,200 small-molecule drugs and drug-like compounds provided by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (i.e., the Pandemic Response Box and the COVID Box) and the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery (CD3, KU Leuven, Belgium). In addition to confirming known Ebola virus inhibitors, illustrating the validity of our screening assays, we identified eight novel selective Ebola virus inhibitors. Although the inhibitory potential of these compounds remains to be validated in vivo, they represent interesting compounds for the study of potential interventions against Ebola virus disease and might serve as a basis for the development of new therapeutics.",

While susceptibility, initiation, and execution of ferroptosis have been linked to reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism, imbalances in iron-redox homeostasis, and aberrant mitochondrial respiration, the detailed mechanisms of ferroptosis are still insufficiently well understood.\n\nMethods and ResultsHere we show that diminished proteasome function is a new mechanistic feature of ferroptosis. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-2, like-1 (NFE2L1) protects from ferroptosis by sustaining proteasomal activity. In cellular systems, loss of NFE2L1 reduced cellular viability after the induction of both chemically and genetically induced ferroptosis, which was linked to the regulation of proteasomal activity under these conditions. Importantly, this was reproduced in a Sedaghatian-type Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia (SSMD) patient-derived cell line carrying mutated glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), a critical regulator of ferroptosis. Also, reduced proteasomal activity was associated with ferroptosis in Gpx4-deficient mice. In a mouse model for genetic Nfe2l1 deficiency, we observed brown adipose tissue (BAT) involution, hyperubiquitination of ferroptosis regulators, including the GPX4 pathway, and other hallmarks of ferroptosis.\n\nConclusionOur data highlight the relevance of the NFE2L1-proteasome pathway in ferroptosis. Manipulation of NFE2L1 activity might enhance ferroptosis-inducing cancer therapies as well as protect from aberrant ferroptosis in neurodegeneration, general metabolism, and beyond.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nHighlightsO_LIProteasome function is diminished during ferroptosis\nC_LIO_LINFE2L1-mediated proteasomal activity protects from ferroptosis\nC_LIO_LIThe ubiquitination of the GPX4-glutathione pathway is implicated in Nfe2l1 deficiency\nC_LIO_LINFE2L1 deficiency in brown fat is associated with hallmarks of ferroptosis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the highly transmissible etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has become a global scientific and public health challenge since December 2019. Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally raising concern about prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Early detection and in depth analysis of the emerging variants allowing pre-emptive alert and mitigation efforts are thus of paramount importance.\n\nHere we present ClusTRace, a novel bioinformatic pipeline for a fast and scalable analysis of sequence clusters or clades in large viral phylogenies. ClusTRace offers several high level functionalities including outlier filtering, aligning, phylogenetic tree reconstruction, cluster or clade extraction, variant calling, visualization and reporting. ClusTRace was developed as an aid for COVID-19 transmission chain tracing in Finland and the main emphasis has been on fast and unsupervised screening of phylogenies for markers of super-spreading events and other features of concern, such as high rates of cluster growth and/or accumulation of novel mutations.\n\nAvailabilityAll code is freely available from https://bitbucket.org/plyusnin/clustrace/",

    "abstract": "We reconstitute a phosphotyrosine-mediated protein condensation phase transition of the [~]200 residue cytoplasmic tail of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the adaptor protein, Grb2, on a membrane surface. The phase transition depends on phosphorylation of the EGFR tail, which recruits Grb2, and the dimerization of Grb2, which provides the crosslinking element for condensation with EGFR. The Grb2 Y160 residue plays a structurally critical role in dimer formation, and phosphorylation or mutation of Y160 prevents EGFR:Grb2 condensation. By extending the reconstitution experiment to include the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, and its substrate Ras, we further find that EGFR condensation controls the ability of SOS to activate Ras. These results identify an EGFR:Grb2 protein condensation phase transition as a regulator of signal propagation from EGFR to the MAPK pathway.",

AGA58 is gram-positive, catalase-negative and appears as short-rods under light-microscope. The AGA58 chromosome composed of a single linear chromosome of 2,294,535 bp that is predicted to carry 2151 coding sequences, including 45 tRNA genes, 4 rRNA operons. Genome has a GC content of 36.9% includes 45 pseudogenes, 32 transposases and one intact-prophage. AGA58 is micro-anaerobic owing to shorter doubling time and faster growth rate achieved compared microaerofilic condition. It carries flagellar biosynthesis protein-encoding genes predicting motile behavior. AGA58 is an obligatory homofermentative where hexose sugars such as galactose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine, maltose, trehalose are fermented to lactate thru glycolysis and no acid production from pentose sugars achieved due to lack of key enzyme namely phosphoketolase in pentose phosphate pathway. Carbohydrate fermentation tests showed AGA58 cannot ferment pentoses which was also confirmed in silico. Putative pyruvate metabolism revealed formate, malate, oxaloacetate, acetate, acetaldehyde, acetoin and lactate forms from pyruvate. AGA58 predicted to carry bacteriocin genes for type A2 lantipeptide, Blp family class II bacteriocins showing antimicrobial potential of this bacterium which can be linked to antagonism tests that AGA58 can inhibit E. coli O157:H7, S.

I37R-CFTR function was characterised using intestinal current measurements (ICM) in rectal biopsies, forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) in intestinal organoids and short circuit current measurements (Isc) in organoid-derived monolayers from an individual with I37R/F508del CFTR genotype. We demonstrated that the I37R-CFTR mutation results in a residual function defect amenable to treatment with potentiators and type III, but not to type I, correctors. Molecular dynamics of I37R-CFTR using an extended model of the phosphorylated, ATP-bound human CFTR identified an altered lasso motif conformation which results in an unfavourable strengthening of the interactions between the lasso motif, the regulatory (R) domain and the transmembrane domain two (TMD2). In conclusion, structural and functional characterisation of the I37R-CFTR mutation increases understanding of CFTR channel regulation and provides a potential pathway to access CFTR modulator treatments for individuals with CF caused by ultra-rare CFTR mutations.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination controls numerous cellular processes, and its deregulation is associated to many pathologies. The Nse1 subunit in the Smc5/6 complex contains a RING domain with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and essential functions in genome integrity. However, Nse1-dependent ubiquitin targets remain largely unknown. Here, we use label-free quantitative proteomics to analyse the nuclear ubiquitinome of nse1-C274A RING mutant cells. Our results show that Nse1 impacts on the ubiquitination of several proteins involved in DNA damage tolerance, ribosome biogenesis and metabolism that, importantly, extend beyond canonical functions of the Smc5/6 complex in chromosome disjunction. In addition, our analysis uncovers an unexpected connection between Nse1 and RNA polymerase I (RNAP I) ubiquitination. Specifically, Nse1 and the Smc5/6 complex promote the ubiquitination of K408 and K410 in the clamp domain of Rpa190, a modification that induces its degradation in response to blocks in transcriptional elongation. We propose that this mechanism contributes to Smc5/6-dependent segregation of the rDNA array, the locus transcribed by RNAP I.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria adapt to different energetic demands reshaping their proteome. Mitochondrial proteases are emerging as key regulators of these adaptive processes. Here, we use a multi-proteomic approach to demonstrate regulation of the m-AAA protease AFG3L2 by the mitochondrial proton gradient, coupling mitochondrial protein turnover to the energetic status of mitochondria. We identify TMBIM5 (previously also known as GHITM or MICS1) as a Ca2+/H+ exchanger in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which binds to and inhibits the m-AAA protease. TMBIM5 ensures cell survival and respiration, allowing Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria and limiting mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Persistent hyperpolarization, however, triggers degradation of TMBIM5 and activation of the m-AAA protease. The m-AAA protease broadly remodels the mitochondrial proteome and mediates the proteolytic breakdown of respiratory complex I to confine ROS production and oxidative damage in hyperpolarized mitochondria. TMBIM5 thus integrates mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and the energetic status of mitochondria with protein turnover rates to reshape the mitochondrial proteome and adjust the cellular metabolism.",

    "abstract": "First recognized 35 years ago, glycine is known to protect cells against plasma membrane rupture from diverse types of tissue injury. This robust and widely observed effect has been speculated to target a late downstream process common to multiple modes of tissue injury. The molecular target of glycine cytoprotection, however, remains entirely elusive. We hypothesized that glycine targets ninjurin-1 (NINJ1), a newly identified executioner of plasma membrane rupture in pyroptosis, necrosis, and post-apoptotic cell death. NINJ1 is thought to cluster within the plasma membrane to cause cell rupture. Here, we first demonstrate that NINJ1 knockout functionally and morphologically phenocopies glycine cytoprotection in mouse and human macrophages stimulated to undergo lytic cell death. Next, we show that glycine treatment prevents NINJ1 clustering thereby preserving cellular integrity. By identifying NINJ1 as a glycine target, our data help resolve a long-standing mechanism of glycine cytoprotection. This new understanding will inform the development of cell preservation strategies to counter pathologic lytic cell death pathways.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471765v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9c3d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e903f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1018498org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a819b9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SummaryGlycine is known to protect cells against plasma membrane rupture from diverse types of tissue injury by an unknown mechanism.

    "abstract": "Grain Amaranth, Amaranthus hypochondriacus L., is an emerging arable crop cultivated worldwide. One way to obtain resources from the crop, other than grain, is to grow Amaranths in the dry season and harvest only the leaves. In this environmental condition the response of an Amaranth agroecosystem to the presence of natural and semi-natural habitats or other crops has not been studied yet. We analysed the response of (1) Amaranth morphometry and (2) alpha and beta diversity of beetles to the nearness of adjacent vegetation and natural habitats (such as deciduous forest) at the small-holder conditions. Our results showed that A. hypochondriacus crop plants responded positively to the presence of an ecotone (adjacent vegetation) and the natural habitat (deciduous forest), i.e., A. hypochondriacus plants grew bigger in the section nearest to adjacent vegetation, which was a pattern consistent in time. Moreover, for beetles (considered as a bioindicator group), richness was different amongst the study areas and negatively followed the gradient of perturbation. These results suggest that Amaranth crop is sensitive to the presence of natural and semi-natural habitats but not to other crops in the dry season. In addition, beetles match the response of Amaranth plants. This is the first time that this type of data is recorded in grain Amaranth agroecosystem and it will help to understand the interaction amongst grain Amaranth agroecosystems, biodiversity, and natural adjacent vegetation to boost ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Soil microbial communities play a pivotal role in regulating ecosystem functioning1 but they are increasingly threatened by human-driven perturbations, including climate extremes, which are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change2. It has been demonstrated that soil microbial communities are sensitive to climate extremes, such as drought3,4, and that effects can be long-lasting5,6. However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning the response of soil microbial communities to increases in the intensity and frequency of climate extremes, and their potential to trigger transitions to alternative, and potentially deleterious, taxonomic and functional states7. Here we demonstrate that extreme, frequent drought induces a shift to an alternative soil microbial state characterised by strongly altered bacterial and fungal community structure of reduced complexity and functionality. Moreover, we found that this drought-induced alternative microbial state persisted after returning soil to its previous moisture status. However, bacterial communities were able to adapt by increasing their growth capacity, despite being of reduced diversity. Abrupt transitions to alternative states are well documented in aquatic and terrestrial plant communities in response to human-induced perturbations, including climate extremes8,9. Our results provide experimental evidence that such transitions also occur in soil microbial communities in response to extreme drought with potentially deleterious consequences for soil health.",

Although much has been learned about their physiology and their Madagascar ecology and phylogeny, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing to profile 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs and tissues opportunistically procured from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration, and expert cell annotation, we defined and biologically organized over 750 mouse lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. These include cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and the developmental programs for spermatogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other adult tissues. We also described dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types and subtypes. We globally compared cell type expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explored primate cell type evolution by comparing mouse lemur cell profiles to those of the homologous cells in human and mouse. This revealed cell type specific patterns of primate cell specialization even within a single tissue compartment, as well as many cell types for which lemur provides a better human model than mouse. The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this primate model organism, and establishes a general approach for other emerging model organisms.",

In the past decade, various approaches to EV surface modification for targeting specific cells or tissues have been proposed, including genetic engineering of parental cells or postproduction EV engineering. However, due to technical limitations, targeting moieties of engineered EVs have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we report the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) EV reporter, PalmReNL-based dual-reporter platform for characterizing the cellular uptake of tumor homing peptide (THP)-engineered EVs, targeting PDL1, uPAR, or EGFR proteins expressed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, simultaneously by bioluminescence measurement and fluorescence microscopy. Bioluminescence analysis of cellular EV uptake revealed the highest binding efficiency of uPAR-targeted EVs, whereas PDL1-targeted EVs showed slower cellular uptake. EVs engineered with two known EGFR-binding peptides via lipid nanoprobes did not increase cellular uptake, indicating that designs of EGFR-binding peptide conjugation to the EV surface are critical for functional EV engineering. Fluorescence analysis of cellular EV uptake allowed us to track individual PalmReNL-EVs bearing THPs in recipient cells. These results demonstrate that the PalmReNL-based EV assay platform can be a foundation for high-throughput screening of tumor-targeted EVs.",

NPM1 mutations cause the aberrant accumulation of mutant NPM1 (NPM1c) in the cytoplasm of leukemic cells, that is mediated by the nuclear exporter Exportin-1 (XPO1).

However, the XPO1 inhibitor Selinexor administered once or twice/week in early-phase clinical trials did not translate into clinical benefit for NPM1-mutated AML patients. Here, we demonstrate that this dosing strategy results in only temporary disruption of the XPO1-NPM1c interaction and transient HOX genes downregulation, limiting the efficacy of Selinexor in the context of NPM1-mutated AML. Since second-generation XPO1 inhibitors can be administered more frequently, we compared intermittent (twice/week) versus prolonged (5 days/week) XPO1 inhibition in NPM1-mutated AML models. Integrating in vitro and in vivo data, we show that only prolonged XPO1 inhibition results in stable HOX downregulation, cell differentiation and remarkable anti-leukemic activity. This study lays the groundwork for the accurate design of clinical trials with second-generation XPO1 inhibitors in NPM1-mutated AML.",

Recent developments in artificial intelligence have enhanced the early steps of de novo drug design and compound optimization.

Our model, called pqsar2cpd, is based on the activity of compounds across multiple assays obtained via pQSAR (profile-quantitative structure-activity relationships). We applied pqsar2cpd to Chagas disease and designed a novel molecule that was experimentally confirmed to inhibit growth of parasites in vitro at low micromolar concentrations.

    "abstract": "The eIF2 initiation complex is central to maintaining a functional translation machinery. Extreme stress such as life-threatening sepsis exposes vulnerabilities in this tightly regulated system, resulting in an imbalance between the opposing actions of kinases and phosphatases on the main regulatory subunit eIF2. Here, we report that translation shutdown is a hallmark of established sepsis-induced kidney injury brought about by excessive eIF2 phosphorylation and sustained by blunted expression of the counterregulatory phosphatase subunit Ppp1r15a. We determined that the blunted Ppp1r15a expression persists because of the presence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF). Overcoming this barrier with genetic approaches enabled the derepression of Ppp1r15a, salvaged translation and improved kidney function in an endotoxemia model. We also found that the loss of this uORF has broad effects on the composition and phosphorylation status of the immunopeptidome that extended beyond the eIF2 axis. Collectively, our findings define the breath and potency of the highly conserved Ppp1r15a uORF and provide a paradigm for the design of uORF-based translation rheostat strategies. The ability to accurately control the dynamics of translation during sepsis will open new paths for the development of therapies at codon level precision.",

    "abstract": "Food restriction (FR) enhances the sensitivity to cardiopulmonary reflexes and 1- adrenoreceptors in the female, despite hypotension. The effect of male FR on cardiopulmonary and systemic vascular function is not well understood. This study examines the effects of FR on cardiopulmonary, isolated mesenteric arterial function and potential underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that FR decreased eNOS activity in mesenteric arteries. Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) control (n=30), (2) 20 percent of food reduction (FR20, n=30), and (3) 40 percent of food reduction (FR40, n=30) for five weeks. Non-invasive blood pressure was measured twice a week. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was measured using isolated/perfused lungs in rats. The isolated vascular reactivity was assessed in double-wire myograph. After five weeks, food restricted rats exhibited a lower mean arterial pressure and heart rate, however, only FR40 groups exhibited statistically significant differences. The basal tone of PAP and various vasoconstrictors did not show significant differences in pulmonary circulation between each group. We observed that food restriction were enhanced the sensitivity (EC50) in response to 1-adrenoreceptors (phenylephrine, PhE)-induced vasoconstriction, but not to serotonin, U46619, and high K+ in the mesenteric arteries. FR reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation via decreased function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the mesenteric arteries. PhE-mediated vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries was eliminated in the presence of eNOS inhibitor (L-NAME). In addition, incubation with NOX2/4 inhibitors (apocynin, GKT137831, VAS2870) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger inhibitor (Tiron) were eliminated the differences of PhE-mediated vasoconstriction but not to cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) in the mesenteric artery. Augmentation of 1-adrenergic mediated contraction via inhibition of eNOS-NO pathway by increased activation of ROS through NOX2/4 in response to FR. Reduced eNOS-NO signaling might be a pathophysiological counterbalance to prevent hypovolemic shock in response to FR.",

Here, we used trophoblasts as a model for cell fusion and demonstrated that Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid channel TRPV4 is critical for TMEM16F activation and subsequent human trophoblast fusion. GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 specific agonist, robustly activates TMEM16F in trophoblasts. Patch-clamp electrophysiology demonstrated that TRPV4 and TMEM16F are functionally coupled within Ca2+ microdomains in human trophoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of TRPV4 hindered TMEM16F activation and subsequent trophoblast syncytialization.

    "abstract": "Regulation of firing rate homeostasis constitutes a fundamental property of central neural circuits. While intracellular Ca2+ has long been hypothesized to be a feedback control signal, the molecular machinery enabling network-wide homeostatic response remains largely unknown. Here we show that deletion of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), a well-known regulator of neurodevelopment and ageing, limits firing rate homeostasis in response to inactivity, without altering the baseline firing rate distribution. Disruption of both synaptic and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity contributed to deficient firing rate homeostatic response. At the cellular level, a fraction of IGF1Rs was localized in mitochondria with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUc). IGF1R deletion suppressed spike burst-evoked mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitoCa2+) by weakening mitochondria-to-cytosol Ca2+ coupling. MCUc overexpression in IGF1R-deficient neurons rescued the deficits in spike-to-mitoCa2+ coupling and firing rate homeostasis. Our findings highlight IGF1R as a key regulator of the integrated homeostatic response by tuning mitochondrial temporal filtering. Decline in mitochondrial reliability for burst transfer may drive dysregulation of firing rate homeostasis in ageing and brain disorders associated with aberrant IGF1R / MCUc signaling.",

    "abstract": "The endosymbiosis between most corals and their photosynthetic dinoflagellate partners begins early in the host life history, when corals are larvae or juvenile polyps. The capacity of coral larvae to buffer climate-induced stress while in the process of symbiont acquisition could come with physiological trade-offs that alter larval behavior, development, settlement and survivorship. Here we examined the joint effects of thermal stress and symbiosis onset on colonization dynamics, survival, metamorphosis and host gene expression of Acropora digitifera larvae. We found that thermal stress decreased symbiont colonization of hosts by 50% and symbiont density by 98.5% over two weeks. Temperature and colonization also influenced larval survival and metamorphosis in an additive manner, where colonized larvae fared worse or prematurely metamorphosed more often than non-colonized larvae under thermal stress. Transcriptomic responses to colonization and thermal stress treatments were largely independent, while the interaction of these treatments revealed contrasting expression profiles of genes that function in the stress response, immunity, inflammation and cell cycle regulation. The combined treatment either canceled or lowered the magnitude of expression of heat-stress responsive genes in the presence of symbionts, revealing a physiological cost to acquiring symbionts at the larval stage with elevated temperatures. In addition, host immune suppression, a hallmark of symbiosis onset under ambient temperature, turned to immune activation under heat stress. Thus, by integrating the physical environment and biotic pressures that mediate pre-settlement event in corals, our results suggest that colonization may hinder larval survival and recruitment creating isolated, genetically similar populations under projected climate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenomic analyses have boosted our understanding of the evolutionary trajectories of all living forms by providing continuous improvements to the tree of life1-5. Within this tree, fungi represent an ancient eukaryote group6, having diverged from the animals [~]1.35 billion years ago7. Estimates of the number of extant species range between 1.5 and 3.8 million8,9. Recent reclassifications and the discovery of the deep-branching Sanchytriomycota lineage10 have brought the number of proposed phyla to 2011; 21 if the Microsporidia are included12-14. Uncovering how the diverse and globally distributed fungi are related to each other is fundamental for understanding how their lifestyles, morphologies, and metabolic capacities evolved. To date, many of the proposed relationships among the phyla remain controversial and no phylogenomic study has examined the entire fungal tree using a taxonomically comprehensive data set and suitable models of evolution. We assembled and curated a 299-protein data set with a taxon sampling broad enough to encompass all recognised fungal diversity with available data, but selective enough to run computationally intensive analyses using best-fitting models. Using a range of reconstruction methods, we were able to resolve many contested nodes, such as a sister-relationship of Chytridiomyceta to all other non-Opisthosporidia fungi (with Chytridiomycota being sister to Monoblepharomycota + Neocallimastigomycota), a branching of Blastocladiomycota + Sanchytriomycota after the Chytridiomyceta but before other non-Opisthosporidia fungi, and a branching of Glomeromycota as sister to the Dikarya. Our most up-to-date fungal tree of life will serve as a springboard for future investigations on the evolution of fungi.",

Whereas the molecular basis for viral budding has been studied extensively, investigation of its spatiotemporal characteristics has been limited by the small dimensions (< 100 nm) of HIV particles and the fast kinetics of the process (a few minutes from bud formation to virion release). Here we applied ultra-fast atomic force microscopy to achieve real-time visualization of individual HIV-1 budding events from wildtype (WT) cell lines as well as from mutated lines lacking vacuolar protein sorting-4 (VPS4) or visceral adipose tissue-1 protein (VTA1). Using single-particle analysis, we show that HIV-1 bud formation follows two kinetic pathways (fast and slow) with each composed of three distinct phases (growth, stationary, decay). Notably, approximately 30% of events did not result in viral release and were characterized by the formation of short (rather than tall) particles that slowly decayed back into the cell membrane. These non-productive events became more abundant in VPS4 knockout cell lines. Strikingly, the absence of VPS4B, rather than VPS4A, increased the production of short viral particles, suggesting a role for VPS4B in earlier stages of HIV-1 budding than traditionally thought.",

We show that HSC numbers increased by 2-fold when multipotent and lineage-restricted progenitors failed to respond to CXCL12 produced by MSPCs and ECs. HSCs were qualitatively normal, and HSC expansion only occurred when early hematopoietic progenitors but not differentiated hematopoietic cells lacked CXCR4. Furthermore, the MSPC and EC transcriptomic heterogeneity was remarkably stable, suggesting that it is impervious to dramatic changes in hematopoietic progenitor interactions. Instead, HSC expansion was caused by increased availability of membrane-bound stem cell factor (mSCF) on MSPCs and ECs due to reduced consumption by cKit-expressing hematopoietic progenitors. These studies revealed an intricate homeostatic balance between HSCs and proximal hematopoietic progenitors regulated by cell competition for limited amounts of mSCF.",
