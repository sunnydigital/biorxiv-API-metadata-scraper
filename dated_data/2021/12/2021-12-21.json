    "abstract": "Disentangling the mechanisms underlying spatial distribution of genetic variation into those due to environment or physical barriers from mere geographic distance is challenging in complex landscapes. The Andean uplift represents one of the most heterogeneous habitats where these questions remain unexplored as multiple mechanisms might interact, confounding their relative roles. We explore this broad question in the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes, a species distributed across the Andes Mountains using nuclear microsatellite markers and mtCOI gene sequences. We investigate spatial genetic divergence across the Western range of Northern Andes in Colombia by testing the relative role of alternative scenarios of population divergence, including geographic distance (IBD), climatic conditions (IBE), and physical barriers due to the Andes Mountains (IBB). Our results reveal substantial genetic differentiation among A. cephalotes populations for both types of markers, but only nuclear divergence followed a hierarchical pattern with multiple models of genetic divergence imposed by the Western range. Model selection showed that IBD, IBE (temperature and precipitation), and IBB (Andes mountains) models, often proposed as individual drivers of genetic divergence, interact, and explain up to 33% of genetic divergence in A. cephalotes. IBE models remained significant after accounting for IBD, suggesting that environmental factors play a more prominent role when compared to IBB. These factors in combination with idiosyncratic dispersal patterns of ants appear to determine hierarchical patterns of gene flow. This study enriches our understanding of the forces shaping population divergence in complex habitat landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The recent increase in openly available ancient human DNA samples allows for new, large-scale meta analysis applications. Trans-generational past human mobility is one of the key aspects that ancient genomics can contribute to, since changes in ancestry - unlike cultural changes seen in the archaeological record - necessarily reflect movements of people. Here we present a new algorithm to quantify past human mobility from large ancient genomic datasets. The key idea of the method is for each individual to compare a hypothetical genetic \"origin\" point with its actual burial point in space. This is achieved by first creating an interpolated ancestry field through space and time based on Multidimensional scaling and Gaussian process regression, and then using this field to map the ancient individuals into space according to their genetic profile. We apply this new algorithm to a dataset of 3191 aDNA samples with genome-wide data from Western Eurasia in the last 10,000 years and derive a diachronic measure of mobility for subregions in Western, Central, Southern and Eastern Europe. For regions and periods with sufficient data coverage, our mobility estimates show general concordance with previous results, but also reveal new signals of movements beyond the well-known key events.\n\nSignificance StatementAncient human DNA (aDNA) extracted from archaeological contexts (e.g. burials) allows to reconstruct past population movements. Relevant methods work by calculating proportions of shared ancestry among individuals or groups in order to answer specific, regional research questions. Here, we propose a largescale algorithm to quantify human mobility through time and space using bulk aDNA data. The algorithm has two core components: i) Interpolation of the spatio-temporal distribution of genetic ancestry to obtain a continuous ancestry information field and ii) estimation of the spatial origin of each input sample by projecting its ancestry into this field. We apply this to thousands of published genomic samples in the last 10,000 years to trace diachronic mobility patterns across Western Eurasia.",

    "abstract": "The ability to correlate the functional relationship between microbial communities and their environment is critical to understanding microbial ecology. There is emerging knowledge on island biogeography of microbes but how island characteristics influence functions of microbial community remain elusive. Here, we explored soil mycobiomes from nine islands adjacent to Taiwan using ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Geographical distances and island size were positively correlated to dissimilarity in mycobiomes, and we identified 56 zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) that were ubiquitously present across all islands, and as few as five Mortierella zOTUs dominate more than half of mycobiomes. Correlation network analyses revealed that seven of the 45 hub species were part of the ubiquitous zOTUs belonging to Mortierella, Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Clonostachys and Staphylotrichum. We sequenced and annotated the genomes of seven Mortierella isolates, and comparative predictions of KEGG orthologues using PICRUSt2 database updated with new genomes increased sequence reads coverage by 62.9% at the genus level. In addition, genes associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms were differentially abundant between islands which remained undetected in the original database. Predicted functional pathways were similar across islands despite their geographical separation, difference in differentially abundant genes and composition. Our approach demonstrated the incorporation of the key taxa genomic data can improve functional gene prediction results and can be readily applied to investigate other niches of interests.",

    "abstract": "Several neuromuscular impairments, such as weakness (hemiparesis), occur after an individual has a stroke, and these impairments primarily affect one side of the body more than the other. Predictive musculoskeletal modeling presents an opportunity to investigate how a specific impairment affects gait performance post-stroke. Therefore, our aim was to use to predictive simulation to quantify the spatiotemporal asymmetries and changes to metabolic cost that emerge when muscle strength is unilaterally reduced. We also determined how forced spatiotemporal symmetry affects metabolic cost. We modified a 2-D musculoskeletal model by uniformly reducing the peak isometric muscle force in all left-limb muscles. We then solved optimal control simulations of walking across a range of speeds by minimizing the sum of the cubed muscle excitations across all muscles. Lastly, we ran additional optimizations to test if reducing spatiotemporal asymmetry would result in an increase in metabolic cost. Our results showed that the magnitude and direction of effort-optimal spatiotemporal asymmetries depends on both the gait speed and level of weakness. Also, the optimal metabolic cost of transport was 1.25 m/s for the symmetrical and 20% weakness models but slower (1.00 m/s) for the 40% and 60% weakness models, suggesting that hemiparesis can account for a portion of the slower gait speed seen in people post-stroke. Adding spatiotemporal asymmetry to the cost function resulted in small increases (~4%) in metabolic cost. Overall, our results indicate that spatiotemporal asymmetry may be optimal for people post-stroke, who have asymmetrical neuromuscular impairments. Additionally, the effect of speed and level of weakness on spatiotemporal asymmetry may explain the well-known heterogenous distribution of spatiotemporal asymmetries observed in the clinic. Future work could extend our results by testing the effects of other impairments on optimal gait strategies, and therefore build a more comprehensive understanding of the gait patterns in people post-stroke.\n\nAuthor SummaryA stroke causes damage to the brain. This typically results in several changes to the nervous and muscular (neuromuscular) system that change how people post-stroke tend to walk and perform other tasks. Individuals post-stroke tend to walk with an asymmetrical motion and expend more energy while walking than other age-matched individuals. We still do not understand how each specific change to the neuromuscular system is linked with changes in walking patterns, in part because it is difficult to test one individual change at a time in people. Instead, we can use a mathematical model of the musculoskeletal system that represents the individual changes to the muscular system that occur in people post-stroke. In this study, we modeled how a common change in people post-stroke (muscle weakness) can impact walking patterns. We found that the level of weakness and the walking speed affect the asymmetrical walking patterns of our models, but do not change the total energy cost. Overall, our study is one step towards better understanding how neuromuscular changes in people post-stroke affects walking patterns. This knowledge could be applied to identify rehabilitation strategies that are most likely to improve walking in people post-stroke.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA cell exhibits a variety of responses to internal and external cues. These responses are possible, in part, due to the presence of an elaborate gene regulatory network (GRN) in every single cell. In the past twenty years, many groups worked on reconstructing the topological structure of GRNs from large-scale gene expression data using a variety of inference algorithms. Insights gained about participating players in GRNs may ultimately lead to therapeutic benefits. Mutual information (MI) is a widely used metric within this inference/reconstruction pipeline as it can detect any correlation (linear and non-linear) between any number of variables (n-dimensions). However, the use of MI with continuous data (for example, normalized fluorescence intensity measurement of gene expression levels) is sensitive to data size, correlation strength and underlying distributions, and often requires laborious and, at times, ad hoc optimization.\n\nResultsIn this work, we first show that estimating MI of a bi- and tri-variate Gaussian distribution using k-nearest neighbor (kNN) MI estimation results in significant error reduction as compared to commonly used methods based on fixed binning. Second, we demonstrate that implementing the MI-based kNN Kraskov-Stoogbauer-Grassberger (KSG) algorithm leads to a significant improvement in GRN reconstruction for popular inference algorithms, such as Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR). Finally, through extensive in-silico benchmarking we show that a new inference algorithm CMIA (Conditional Mutual Information Augmentation), inspired by CLR, in combination with the KSG-MI estimator, outperforms commonly used methods.\n\nConclusionsUsing three canonical datasets containing 15 synthetic networks, the newly developed method for GRN reconstruction - which combines CMIA, and the KSG-MI estimator - achieves an improvement of 20-35% in precision-recall measures over the current gold standard in the field. This new method will enable researchers to discover new gene interactions or choose gene candidates for experimental validations.",

This research demonstrates how the use of Feature-Based Molecular Networking in combination with public spectral libraries, further expanded with an \"In-house\" library of metabolite spectra, improved the non-trivial annotation of metabolites occurring in human urine samples following bilberry and blueberry intake. Following this approach, 65 berry-related and human endogenous metabolites were annotated, increasing the annotation coverage by 72% compared to conventional annotation approaches. Furthermore, the structures of 15 additional metabolites were hypothesized by spectral analysis. Then, by leveraging the MzMine quantitative information, several molecular families of phase II (e.g., glucuronidated phenolics) and phase I (e.g., phenylpropionic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid molecular scaffolds) metabolism were identified by correlation analysis of postprandial kinetics, and the dietary impact of endogenous and exogenous metabolites following bilberry-blueberry intake was estimated.",

    "abstract": "When two influenza viruses co-infect the same cell, they can exchange genome segments in a process known as reassortment. Reassortment is an important source of genetic diversity and is known to have been involved in the emergence of most pandemic influenza strains. However, because of the difficulty in identifying reassortments events from viral sequence data, little is known about its role in the evolution of the seasonal influenza viruses. Here we introduce TreeKnit, a method that infers ancestral reassortment graphs (ARG) from two segment trees. It is based on topological differences between trees, and proceeds in a greedy fashion by finding regions that are compatible in the two trees. Using simulated genealogies with reassortments, we show that TreeKnit performs well in a wide range of settings and that it is as accurate as a more principled bayesian method, while being orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we show that it is possible to use the inferred ARG to better resolve segment trees and to construct more informative visualizations of reassortments.",

    "abstract": "Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis with a global distribution, also known as \"rose gardeners disease\". Brazil is experiencing a rapid spread of the zoonotic transmission of of Sporothrix brasiliensis, the main etiological agent of this disease in this country, affecting domestic felines. Cost-effective interventions need to be developed to control this emergent public health problem. To allow for the comparison of alternative control strategies, we propose in this paper, a mathematical model representing the transmission of S. brasiliensis among cats, stratified by age and sex. Analytical properties of the model are derived and simulations show possible strategies for reducing the endemic levels of the disease in the cat population, with a positive impact on human health. The scenarios included mass treatment of infected cats and mass implementation of contact reduction practices, such as neutering. The results indicate that mass treatment can reduce substantially the disease prevalence, and this effect is potentialized when combined with neutering or other contact-reduction interventions. On the other hand, contact-reduction methods alone are not sufficient to reduce prevalence.\n\nAuthor summarySporotrichosis, as a neglected tropical mycosis, has in domestic cats a very important reservoir for Sporothrix sp., its pathogen. Infected cats can easily transmit the fungus to other cats and also to humans by means of scratching and biting.\n\nHere we propose a mathematical model incorporating all forms of transmission of Sporothrix within a cat population, taking into account age and sex-related behavioral differences which can affect the transmission dynamics.\n\nThe model also includes a treated compartment, which facilitates the exploration of pharmacological interventions to reduce the prevalence of the disease. We derive the next-generation matrix for the model, which allows the calculation of the diseases basic reproduction number under different scenarios.\n\nUsing the model, we explore different control scenarios involving treatment of the disease, but also the contribution of neutering of cats to the reduction of transmission through changes induced by neutering, of the cats social interactions.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMinION, a third-generation sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, is a portable device that can provide long nucleotide read data in real-time. It primarily aims to deduce the makeup of nucleotide sequences from the ionic current signals generated when passing DNA/RNA fragments through nanopores charged with a voltage difference. To determine the nucleotides from the measured signals, a translation process known as basecalling is required. However, compared to NGS basecallers, the calling accuracy of MinION still needs to be improved.\n\nIn this work, a simple but powerful neural network architecture called MSRCall is proposed. MSRCall comprises a multi-scale structure, recurrent layers, a fusion block, and a CTC decoder. To better identify both short-range and long-range dependencies, the recurrent layer is redesigned to capture various time-scale features with a multi-scale structure. The results show that MSRCall outperforms other basecallers in terms of both read and consensus accuracies.",

    "abstract": "Clustering analysis is widely utilized in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discover cell heterogeneity and cell states. While many clustering methods have been developed for scRNA-seq analysis, most of these methods require to provide the number of clusters. However, it is not easy to know the exact number of cell types in advance, and experienced determination is not always reliable. Here, we have developed ADClust, an automatic deep embedding clustering method for scRNA-seq data, which can accurately cluster cells without requiring a predefined number of clusters. Specifically, ADClust first obtains low-dimensional representation through pre-trained autoencoder, and uses the representations to cluster cells into initial micro-clusters. The clusters are then compared in between by a statistical test, and similar micro-clusters are merged into larger clusters. According to the clustering, cell representations are updated so that each cell will be pulled toward centres of its assigned cluster and similar clusters, while cells are separated to keep distances between clusters. This is accomplished through jointly optimizing the carefully designed clustering and autoencoder loss functions. This merging process continues until convergence. ADClust was tested on eleven real scRNA-seq datasets, and shown to outperform existing methods in terms of both clustering performance and the accuracy on the number of the determined clusters. More importantly, our model provides high speed and scalability for large datasets.",

In melanoma, whether cells in the microenvironment can endow such competence remains unclear. Using a combination of zebrafish transgenesis coupled with human tissues, we demonstrate that GABAergic signaling between keratinocytes and melanocytes promotes melanoma initiation by BRAFV600E. GABA is synthesized in melanoma cells, which then acts on GABA-A receptors on keratinocytes. Electron microscopy demonstrates synapse-like structures between keratinocytes and melanoma cells, and multi-electrode array analysis shows that GABA acts to inhibit electrical activity in melanoma/keratinocyte co-cultures. Genetic and pharmacologic perturbation of GABA synthesis abrogates melanoma initiation in vivo. These data suggest that electrical activity across the skin microenvironment determines the ability of oncogenes to initiate melanoma.",

Our result discerns that group three POTE paralogs (POTEE, POTEF, POTEI, POTEJ, and POTEKP (a pseudogene)) exhibits significant variation among other members could be because of their Adaptive Divergence. Furthermore, our molecular docking studies on POTE protein revealed the highest binding affinity with NCI-approved anticancer compounds. Additionally, POTEE, POTEF, POTEI, and POTEJ were subject to an explicit molecular dynamic simulation for 50ns. MM-GBSA and other essential electrostatics were calculated that showcased that only POTEE and POTEF have absolute binding affinities with minimum energy exploitation. Thus, this studys outcomes are expected to drive cancer research to successful utilization of POTE genes family as a new biomarker, which could pave the way for the discovery of new therapies.",

Dogs are a robust model for invasive UC as tumor development and progression is similar in humans and dogs. Recent studies on urine microbiota in humans revealed alterations in microbial diversity and composition in individuals with UC; however, the potential role of microbiota in UC has yet to be elucidated. Dogs could be valuable models for this research, but microbial alterations in dogs with UC have not been evaluated.\n\nObjectiveThe objective of this this pilot study was to compare the urine and fecal microbiota of dogs with UC (n = 7) and age-, sex-, and breed-matched healthy controls (n = 7).\n\nMethodsDNA was extracted from mid-stream free-catch urine and fecal samples using Qiagen Bacteremia and PowerFecal kits, respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed followed by sequence processing and analyses (QIIME 2 and R).\n\nResultsCanine urine and fecal samples were dominated by taxa similar to those found in humans. Significantly decreased microbial diversity (Kruskal-Wallis: Shannon, p = 0.048) and altered bacterial composition were observed in the urine but not feces of dogs with UC (PERMANOVA: Unweighted UniFrac, p = 0.011). The relative abundances of Fusobacterium was also increased, although not significantly, in the urine and feces of dogs with UC.\n\nConclusionThis study characterizes urine and fecal microbiota in dogs with UC, and it provides a foundation for future work exploring host-microbe dynamics in UC carcinogenesis, prognosis, and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The human endometrium experiences repetitive cycles of tissue wounding characterised by piecemeal shedding of the surface epithelium and rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis. In this study we used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic lines of mice to investigate whether epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium have their origins in one or more of the mesenchymal cell types present in the stromal compartment of the endometrium. Using scRNAseq we identified a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. To confirm our hypothesis we used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts (PDGFRa+) and stromal perivascular cells (NG2/CSPG4+). We demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons both to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response (Ashermans syndrome, endometriosis) as well as other mucosal tissues which have a variable response to wounding.\n\nHighlightsO_LISingle cell RNA sequencing identified a population of PDGFR{beta}+ mesenchymal cells with a unique transcriptomic signature that arises in response to induction of a menses-like wound\nC_LIO_LIThe repair-specific mesenchymal cells express genes considered specific to both mesenchymal and epithelial lineages indicative of an intermediate phenotype and a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET)\nC_LIO_LIin silico trajectory analysis revealed that repair-specific cells originate from the fibroblast cell clusters, were distinct from perivascular cells, and had a predicted trans-differentiation trajectory towards definitive epithelial cells\nC_LIO_LIin vivo lineage tracing in adult mice provides definitive evidence that PDGFR+ endometrial fibroblasts, and not NG2+ perivascular cells, undergo MET and can become incorporated into the luminal epithelium of the post repair tissue\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Aims/hypothesisBeta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the production of toxic amyloid peptides and is highly expressed in the brain, but also to a lesser extent in major peripheral organs such as muscle and liver. In contrast, BACE2 is mainly expressed in peripheral tissues and is enriched in pancreatic beta cells, where it regulates beta- cell function and mass. Previous reports demonstrated that loss of BACE1 function decreases body weight, protects against diet-induced obesity and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice, whereas mice lacking Bace2 exhibit reduced blood glucose levels, improved intraperitoneal glucose tolerance and increased beta-cell mass. Impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes and have been implicated in Alzheimers disease. Therefore, we tested the contribution of the individual BACE isoforms to those metabolic phenotypes by placing Bace1 knockout (KO), Bace2 KO, Bace1/2 double knockout (dKO) and wild-type (WT) mice on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD) for 16 weeks.\n\nMethodsBace1 KO (n = 18), Bace2 KO (n = 18), Bace1/2 dKO (n = 18) and WT C57BL/6N mice (n = 54) were fed a HFD for 16 weeks (age 9-25 weeks). Body composition was measured before initiation of the HFD and after 11 weeks of HFD. Oral glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were performed after 12 and 13 weeks of HFD, respectively, and full blood chemistry was analyzed after 16 weeks of HFD. The effects of subchronic BACE1/2 inhibition were assessed by administration of 10 mg/kg/day of the dual BACE1/2 inhibitor MBi-3 in a HFD fed to C57BL/6N mice for 3 weeks.\n\nResultsBace1 KO and Bace1/2 dKO mice showed decreased body weight and improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance vs. WT mice. Conversely, Bace2 KO mice did not show any significant differences in body weight, glucose tolerance or insulin resistance under our experimental conditions. Finally, subchronic MBi-3-mediated BACE1/2 inhibition in mice in conjunction with a HFD resulted in a modest improvement of glucose tolerance.\n\nConclusions/interpretationOur data indicate that lack of BACE1 - but not BACE2 - function contributes mainly to the metabolic phenotypic changes observed in Bace1/2 dKO mice, suggesting that inhibition of BACE1 has the greater role (vs. BACE2) in any potential improvements in metabolic homeostasis.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIInsulin resistance may develop in the brains of patients with Alzheimers disease (83/85 characters)\nC_LIO_LIBACE1 and BACE2 may play a role in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (80/85 characters)\nC_LIO_LIBody weight in mice decreased with Bace1 KO and Bace1/2 KO but not Bace2 KO alone (83/85 characters)\nC_LIO_LIBace1 and Bace1/2, but not Bace2, KO improved glucose tolerance/insulin resistance (84/85 characters)\nC_LIO_LIImproved metabolic homeostasis may follow loss of BACE1 rather than BACE 2 activity (85/85 characters)\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mosquito vectors transmit numerous pathogens, but large gaps remain in our understanding of their physiology. To facilitate future explorations of mosquito biology, with specific attention to the major vector Aedes aegypti, we have created Aegypti-Atlas (http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/), an online resource hosting RNAseq profiles of Ae. Aegypti body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, gut, Malpighian tubules, and ovaries), gut regions (crop, proventriculus, anterior and posterior midgut, and hindgut), and a time course of blood meal digestion in the gut. Using Aegypti-Atlas, we provide new insights into the regionalization of gut function, blood feeding response, and immune defenses. We find that the anterior and posterior regions of the mosquito midgut possess clearly delineated digestive specializations which are preserved in the blood-fed state. Blood feeding initiates the sequential transcriptional induction and repression/depletion of multiple cohorts of peptidases throughout blood meal digestion. With respect to defense, immune signaling components, but not recognition or effector molecules, show enrichment in ovaries. Basal expression of antimicrobial peptides is dominated by two genes, holotricin and gambicin, that are expressed in the carcass and the digestive tissues, respectively, in a near mutually exclusive manner. In the midgut, gambicin and other immune effector genes are almost exclusively expressed in the anterior regions, while the posterior midgut exhibits the hallmarks of immune tolerance. Finally, in a cross-species comparison between the midguts of Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, we observe that regional digestive and immune specializations are closely conserved, indicating that our data may yield inferences that are broadly relevant to multiple mosquito vector species. We further demonstrate that the expression of orthologous genes is highly correlated, with the exception of a  species signature comprising a small number of highly/disparately expressed genes. With this work, we show the potential of Aegypti-Atlas to unlock a more complete understanding of mosquito biology.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulators of general stress response (GSR) reprogram expression of selected genes to transduce informational signals into cellular events, ultimately manifested in plants ability to cope with environmental challenges. Identification of the core GSR regulatory proteins will uncover the principal modules and their mode of action in the establishment of adaptive responses. To define the GSR regulatory components, we employed a yeast-one-hybrid assay to identify the protein(s) that binds to the previously established functional GSR motif, coined Rapid Stress Response Element (RSRE). This led to the isolation of ORA47 (octadecanoid-responsive AP2/ERF-domain transcription factor 47), a Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) inducible protein. Subsequently, the ORA47 transcriptional activity was confirmed using RSRE-driven Luciferase (LUC) activity assay performed in the ORA47 loss- and gain-of-function lines introgressed into the 4xRSRE::Luc background. In addition, the prime contribution of CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR3 (CAMTA3) protein in induction of RSRE was reaffirmed by genetic studies. Moreover, exogenous application of MeJA led to enhanced levels of ORA47 and CAMTA3 transcripts, and the induction of RSRE::LUC activity. Metabolic analyses illustrated the reciprocal functional inputs of ORA47 and CAMTA3 in increasing JA levels. Lastly, transient assays identified JASMONATE ZIM-domain1 (JAZ1) as a repressor of RSRE::LUC activity.\n\nCollectively, the report provides a fresh insight into the initial mechanistic features of transducing the informational signals into adaptive responses in part via the complex functional interplay between JA biosynthesis/signaling cascade and the transcriptional reprogramming necessary for potentiation of GSR, while offering a window into the role of intraorganellar communication in the establishment of adaptive responses.\n\nSignificanceThe work unmasks the initial mechanistic features of adaptive responses that include tight cooperativity between JA biosynthesis and signaling cascade and the nuclear transcriptional machinery comprised of two activators (CAMTA3 and ORA47) and a suppressor JAZ1). The work further identifies CAMTA3 as a functional link between JA signaling and activation of a general stress transcriptional hub.",

Recent efforts have allowed advances in the understanding of the interactions and genetic mechanisms underlying this dynamic pattern. However, the main role of the patA and hetF genes are yet to be clarified; in particular, the patA mutant forms heterocysts almost exclusively in the terminal cells of the filament. In this work, we investigate the function of these genes and provide a theoretical model that explains how they interact within the broader genetic network, reproducing their knock-out phenotypes in several genetic backgrounds, including a nearly uniform concentration of HetR along the filament for the patA mutant. Our results suggest a role of hetF and patA in a post-transcriptional modification of HetR which is essential for its regulatory function. In addition, the existence of molecular leakage out of the filament in its boundary cells is enough to explain the preferential appearance of terminal heterocysts, without any need for a distinct regulatory pathway.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding multicellular pattern formation is key for the study of both natural and synthetic developmental processes. Arguably one of the simplest model systems for this is the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena, that in conditions of nitrogen deprivation undergoes a dynamical differentiation process that differentiates roughly one in every ten cells into nitrogen-fixing heterocysts, in a quasi-regular pattern that is maintained as the filament keeps growing. One of the most characteristic mutations affecting this process forms heterocysts mostly constrained to the terminal cells of the filament. We have used experimental observations to propose a mathematical model of heterocyst differentiation able to reproduce this striking phenotype. The model extends our understanding of the regulations in this pattern-forming system and makes several predictions on molecular interactions. Importantly, a key aspect is the boundary condition at the filaments ends: inhibitors of differentiation should be able to leak out of the filament, or otherwise the terminal cells would not differentiate. This highlights, in a very clear example, the importance of considering physical constraints in developmental processes.",

    "abstract": "In many organisms, dietary restriction (DR) leads to lifespan extension through the activation of cell protection and pro-longevity gene expression programs. In the nematode C. elegans, the DAF-16 transcription factor is a key aging regulator that governs the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and undergoes translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of cells when animals are exposed to food limitation. In this work, we assess the endogenous activity of DAF-16 under various DR regimes by coupling CRISPR/Cas9-enabled fluorescent tagging of DAF-16 with quantitative image analysis and machine learning. Our results indicate that lifelong DAF-16 endogenous activity is a robust predictor of mean lifespan in C. elegans, and it accounts for 78% of the lifespan variability induced by DR. We found that this lifespan-extending mechanism occurs mainly in the intestine and neurons, and that DR drives DAF-16 activity in unexpected locations such as the germline and intestinal nucleoli.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells feature a resting membrane potential (Vm) that is depolarized compared to normal cells, and express active ionic conductances, which factor directly in their pathophysiological behavior. Despite similarities to  excitable tissues, relatively little is known about cancer cell Vm dynamics. With high-throughput, cellular-resolution Vm imaging, we characterized Vm fluctuations of hundreds of human triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and compared to non-cancerous breast epithelial MCF-10A cells. By quantifying their Dynamic Electrical Signatures (DESs) through an unsupervised machine-learning protocol, we identified four classes ranging from \"noisy\" to \"blinking/waving\". The Vm of MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited spontaneous, transient hyperpolarizations that were inhibited by the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin. The Vm of MCF-10A cells was comparatively static, but fluctuations increased following treatment with transforming growth factor-{beta}1, a canonical inducer of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These data suggest that the ability to generate Vm fluctuations is acquired during transformation and may participate in oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "RationaleIntracranial scanning ultrasound combined with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS+MB) has been shown to transiently open the blood-brain barrier and reduce amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) pathology in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD). This has been accomplished, at least in part, through the activation of microglial cells; however, their response to the SUS treatment is only incompletely understood.\n\nMethodsWild-type (WT) and APP23 mice were subjected to SUS+MB, using non-SUS+MB-treated mice as sham controls. After 48 hours, the APP23 mice were injected with methoxy-XO4 to label A{beta} aggregates, followed by microglial isolation into XO4+ and XO4- populations using flow cytometry. Both XO4+ and XO4- cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and their transcriptome was analyzed through a bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nResultsThe transcriptomic analysis of the microglial cells revealed a clear segregation depending on genotype (AD model versus WT mice), as well as treatment (SUS+MB versus sham) and A{beta} internalization (XO4+ versus XO4- microglia). Differential gene expression analysis detected 278 genes that were significantly changed by SUS+MB in the XO4+ cells (248 up/30 down) and 242 in XO- cells (225 up/17 down). Not surprisingly given previous findings of increased phagocytosis of plaques following SUS+MB, the pathway analysis highlighted that the treatment induced an enrichment in genes related to the phagosome pathway in XO4+ microglia; however, when comparing SUS+MB to sham, the analysis revealed an enrichment in genes involved in the cell cycle in both the XO4+ and XO4- microglial population.\n\nConclusionOur data provide a comprehensive analysis of microglia in an AD mouse model subjected to ultrasound treatment as a function of A{beta} internalization, one of the defining hallmarks of AD. Several differentially expressed genes are highlighted, pointing to an ultrasound-induced activation of cell cycle mechanisms in microglial cells isolated from APP23 mice treated with SUS+MB.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473590v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ae94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a48d22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2dcb9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92dfb2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we employ HD-EEG polysomnography in three age-groups between 12 to 20 years of age, with an equal distribution between the two genders, and analyse the adolescent developmental pattern of the four major parameters of slow and fast sleep spindles. Most of our findings corroborate those very few previous studies that also make a distinction between slow and fast spindles in their developmental analysis. We find spindle frequency increasing with age, although spindle density change is not obvious in our study. We confirm the declining tendencies for amplitude and duration, although within narrower, more specific age-windows than previously. Spindle frequency seems to be higher in females in the oldest age-group. Based on the pattern of our findings, we suggest that HD-EEG, specifically targeting slow and fast spindle ranges and relatively narrow age-ranges would advance the understanding of both adolescent development and the functional relevance of sleep spindles in general.",

    "abstract": "To date, there is a consensus that there are at least two neuronal populations in the non-human primate (NHP) external globus pallidus (GPe): the low- and high-frequency discharge (LFD and HFD) neurons. Nevertheless, almost all NHP physiological studies have neglected the functional importance of LFD neurons. This study examined the discharge features of these two GPe neuronal subpopulations recorded in four NHPs engaged in a classical conditioning task with cues predicting reward, neutral and aversive outcomes. The results show that LFD neurons tended to burst, encoded the salience of behavioral cues, and exhibited correlated spiking activity. By contrast, the HFD neurons tended to pause, encoded cue valence, and exhibited uncorrelated spiking activity. Overall, these findings point to the dichotomic organization of the NHP GPe which is likely to be critical to the implementation of normal basal ganglia functions and computations.",

    "abstract": "Interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) has been observed during social interactions and involves various factors, such as familiarity with the partner and type of social activity. A previous study has shown that face-to-face interactions in pairs of strangers increase IBS. However, it is unclear whether this can be observed when the nature of the interacting partners is different. Herein, we aimed to extend these findings to pairs of acquaintances. Neural activity in the frontal and temporal regions was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. Participants played an ultimatum game that required virtual economic exchange in two experimental settings: the face-to-face and face-blocked conditions. Random pair analysis confirmed whether IBS was induced by social interaction. Contrary to the aforementioned study, our results did not show any cooperative behavior or task-induced IBS increase. Conversely, the random pair analysis results revealed that the pair-specific IBS was significant only in the task condition at the left and right superior frontal, middle frontal, orbital superior frontal, right superior temporal, precentral, and postcentral gyri. Our results revealed that face-to-face interaction in acquainted pairs did not increase IBS and supported the idea that IBS is affected by \"with whom we interact and how.\"",

    "abstract": "A major limitation of large-scale neuronal recordings is the difficulty in locating homologous neurons in different subjects, referred to as the \"correspondence\" issue. This issue stems, at least in part, from the lack of a unique feature that unequivocally identifies each neuron. One promising approach to this problem is the functional neurocartography framework developed by Frady et al. (2016), in which neurons are identified by a semisupervised machine learning algorithm using a combination of multiple selected features. Here, the framework was adapted to the buccal ganglia of Aplysia. Multiple features were derived from neuronal activity during motor pattern generation, responses to peripheral nerve stimulation, and the spatial properties of each cell. The feature set was optimized based on its potential usefulness in discriminating neurons from each other, and then used to match putatively homologous neurons across subjects with the functional neurocartography software. An alternative matching method based on a cyclic matching algorithm was also developed, which allows for unsupervised extraction of groups of neurons and automated selection of high-quality matches. This improvement enabled unsupervised implementation of the machine learning algorithm, thereby enhancing scalability of the analysis. This study paves the way for investigating the roles of both well-characterized and previously uncharacterized neurons in Aplysia, and helps to adapt the neurocartography framework to other systems.",

    "abstract": "The primary role of microglia in the maintenance of brain homeostasis is to respond to disturbances in the microenvironment. In this study, we cultured murine neonatal microglia and activated them with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and benzoyl ATP (bzATP) to characterize changes in the transcriptome in response to various in vivo stimuli caused by pathogens, injury, or toxins. Activation by bzATP, an agonist of purinergic receptors, induces a transient wave of transcriptional changes. However, a long-lasting transcriptional profile affecting thousands of genes occurs only following a combination of bzATP and LPS. This profile is dominated by a coordinated induction of cytokines (e.g., IL1- and IL1-{beta}), chemokines, and their direct regulators. Many of these inflammatory-related genes are up-regulated by several orders of magnitude. We identified the TNF- and NF-{kappa}B pathways as the principal hubs for signaling of interleukin and chemokine induction in this cell system. We propose that primary microglia under controlled activation paradigms can be used for testing reagents that could attenuate their activated state. Such a microglial system could serve as a model for changes occurring in the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nHighlight points* Primary murine microglia cultures release cytokines following activation with bzATP and LPS\n* The wave of changes in gene expression by bzATP is transient.\n* bzATP+LPS causes a transcription program dominated by the induction of interleukins and chemokines.",

    "abstract": "During infection the host relies on pattern-recognition receptors to sense invading fungal pathogens to launch immune defense mechanisms. While fungal recognition and immune effector responses are organ and cell type specific, during disseminated candidiasis myeloid cells exacerbate collateral tissue damage. However, the complex interplay between protective antifungal immunity and immunopathology remains incompletely understood. The {beta}-glucan receptor ephrin type-A 2 receptor (EphA2) is required to initiate mucosal inflammatory responses during oral Candida infection. Here we report that Epha2 promotes renal immunopathology during disseminated candidiasis. EphA2 deficiency leads to reduced renal inflammation and injury. Comprehensive analyses reveal that EphA2 limits IL-23 secretion in dendritic cells, while IL-23 signaling prevents ferroptotic myeloid cell death during infection. Further, ferroptosis aggravates inflammation during infection, while at the same time reducing the fungal killing capacity of macrophages. Thus, we identify ferroptotic cell death as a critical pathway of Candida-mediated renal immunopathology that opens a new avenue to tackle Candida infection and inflammation.",

A splenic MAIT subset has a transcriptome similar to circulating lymphocytes, and in mice these also are found in recent thymic emigrants, suggesting partially mature cells emigrate from the thymus. Human MAIT cells are predominantly MAIT1 cells, but have a different metabolism from their mouse counterparts with increased fatty acid uptake and storage.

    "abstract": "The study and manipulation of T cell receptors (TCRs) is central to multiple fields across basic and translational immunology research. Produced by V(D)J recombination, TCRs are often only recorded in the literature and data repositories as a combination of their V and J gene symbols, plus their hypervariable CDR3 amino acid sequence. However, numerous applications require full-length coding nucleotide sequences. Here we present Stitchr, a software tool developed to specifically address this limitation. Given minimal V/J/CDR3 information, Stitchr produces complete coding sequences representing a fully spliced TCR cDNA. Due to its modular design, Stitchr can be used for TCR engineering using either published germline or novel/modified variable and constant region sequences. Sequences produced by Stitchr were validated by synthesizing and transducing TCR sequences into Jurkat cells, recapitulating the expected antigen specificity of the parental TCR. Using a companion script, Thimble, we demonstrate that Stitchr can process a million TCRs in under ten minutes using a standard desktop personal computer. By systemizing the production and modification of TCR sequences, we propose that Stitchr will increase the speed, repeatability, and reproducibility of TCR research. Stitchr is available on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) therapy is a new approach to treat RA. Studies evaluating anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs per RA severity are scarce. Our primary objective was to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, change in cytokine levels and cartilage regeneration of two different MSC preparations delivered through two different routes of administration in three RA stages: mild, moderate and severe.\n\nMethodsHuman-derived umbilical cord tissue MSCs (hUCT-MSCs) and human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs) delivered via intra-plantar and intravenous routes were tested in Freunds adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. Arthritis severity was based on the arthritis score (<3=mild, 3=moderate and 4=severe). Assessments included changes in arthritis scoring, paw swelling, haematology parameters, biomarkers (TNF and IL-10) and histopathology analysis.\n\nResultsMSC treatment significantly reduced arthritis scores in all treatment groups. IL-10 levels increased 30 days after treatment with (IP)hUCT-MSCs (P=0.0241), (IV)hUCT-MSCs (P=0.0095) and (IP)hBM-MSCs (P=0.0002). TNF- levels reduced compared to positive control at 30 days: (IP)hUCT-MSCs (P=0.0060), (IV)hUCT-MSCs (P=0.0003), (IP)hBM-MSCs (P=0.0005), (IV)hBM-MSCs (P<0.0001) and continued through 30-60 days. Microscopic examination showed regenerative changes in animal joints treated with both intra-plantar or intravenous MSCs. Arthritis scores reduced in all RA severity groups while benefits (changes in IL-10 and TNF-alpha) were more pronounced in moderate and severe RA. Haematology parameters remained similar among all animal groups at baseline, 30 days and 60 days indicating safety of MSCs.\n\nConclusionTreatment with hUCT MSCs and hBM MSCs were safe, well-tolerated and effectively reduced joint inflammation, synovial cellularity and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in CFA-induced RA rat model.",

    "abstract": "In many regions fire regimes are changing due to anthropogenic factors. Understanding the responses of species to fire can help to develop predictive models and inform fire management decisions. Spiders are a diverse and ubiquitous group and can offer important insights into the impacts of fire on invertebrates and whether these depend on environmental factors, phylogenetic history, or functional traits. We conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses of data from studies investigating the impacts of fire on spiders. We investigated whether fire affects spider abundance or presence and whether ecologically relevant traits or site-specific factors influence species responses to fire. Although difficult to make broad generalisations about the impacts of fire due to variation in site- and fire-specific factors, we find evidence that short fire intervals may be a threat to some spiders, and that fire affects abundance and species compositions in forests relative to other vegetation types. Orb and sheet web weavers were also more likely to be absent after fire than ambush hunters, ground hunters, and other hunters suggesting functional traits may affect responses. Finally, we show that analyses of published data can be used to detect broad scale patterns and provide an alternative to traditional meta-analytical approaches.",

    "abstract": "Background selection (BGS), the effect that purifying selection exerts on sites linked to deleterious alleles, is expected to be ubiquitous across eukaryotic genomes. The effects of BGS reflect the interplay of the rates and fitness effects of deleterious mutations with recombination. A fundamental assumption of BGS models is that recombination rates are invariant over time. However, in some lineages recombination rates evolve rapidly, violating this central assumption. Here, we investigate how recombination rate evolution affects genetic variation under BGS. We show that recombination rate evolution modifies the effects of BGS in a manner similar to a localised change in the effective population size, potentially leading to an underestimation of the genome-wide effects of selection. Furthermore, we find evidence that recombination rate evolution in the ancestors of modern house mice may have impacted inferences of the genome-wide effects of selection in that species.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito borne viruses such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and Chikungunya cause millions of infections every year. These viruses are mostly transmitted by two urban-adapted mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, that appear to be more permissive to arbovirus infections compared to closely related species, although mechanistic understanding remains unknown. Aedes mosquitoes may have evolved specialized antiviral mechanisms that potentially contribute to the low impact of viral infection. Recently, we reported the identification of an Aedes specific double-stranded RNA binding protein (dsRBP), named Loqs2, that is involved in the control of infection by dengue and Zika viruses in Ae. aegypti. Loqs2 interacts with two important co-factors of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, Loquacious (Loqs) and R2D2, and seems to be a strong regulator of the antiviral defense. However, the origin and evolution of loqs2 remains unclear. Here, we describe that loqs2 likely originated from two independent duplications of the first dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) of loquacious that occurred before the radiation of the Aedes Stegomyia subgenus. After its origin, our analyses suggest that loqs2 evolved by relaxed positive selection towards neofunctionalization. In fact, loqs2 is evolving at a faster pace compared to other RNAi components such as loquacious, r2d2 and Dicer-2 in Aedes mosquitoes. Unlike loquacious, transcriptomic analysis showed that loqs2 expression is tightly regulated, almost restricted to reproductive tissues in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Transgenic mosquitoes engineered to ubiquitously express loqs2 show massive dysregulation of stress response genes and undergo developmental arrest at larval stages. Overall, our results uncover the possible origin and neofunctionalization of a novel antiviral gene, loqs2, in Aedes mosquitoes that ultimately may contribute to their effectiveness as vectors for arboviruses.",

    "abstract": "As failure rates for traditional antimicrobial therapies escalate, recent focus has shifted to evolution-based therapies to slow resistance. Collateral sensitivity-the increased susceptibility to one drug associated with evolved resistance to a different drug-offers a potentially exploitable evolutionary constraint, but the manner in which collateral effects emerge over time is not well understood. Here, we use laboratory evolution in the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis to phenotypically characterize collateral profiles through evolutionary time. Specifically, we measure collateral profiles for 400 strain-antibiotic combinations over the course of 4 evolutionary time points as strains are selected in increasing concentrations of antibiotic. We find that at a global level-when results from all drugs are combined-collateral resistance dominates during early phases of adaptation, when resistance to the selecting drug is lower, while collateral sensitivity becomes increasingly likely with further selection. At the level of individual populations, however, the trends are idiosyncratic; for example, the frequency of collateral sensitivity to ceftriaxone increases over time in isolates selected by linezolid but decreases is isolates selected by ciprofloxacin. Finally, we show experimentally how dynamic collateral sensitivity relationships can lead to time-dependent dosing windows that depend on finely timed switching between drugs.",

    "abstract": "The spatial structure of natural populations is key to many of their evolutionary processes. Formal theories analysing the interplay between natural selection and spatial structure have mostly focused on populations divided into distinct, non-overlapping groups. Most populations, however, are not structured in this way, but rather (self-)organise into dynamic patterns unfolding at various spatial scales. Here, we present a mathematical framework that quantifies how patterns and processes at different spatial scales contribute to natural selection in such populations. To that end, we define the Local Selection Differential (LSD): a measure of the selection acting on a trait within a given local environment. Based on the LSD, natural selection in a population can be decomposed into two parts: the contribution of local selection, acting within local environments, and the contribution of interlocal selection, acting among them. Varying the size of the local environments subsequently allows one to measure the contribution of each length scale. To illustrate the use of this new multiscale selection framework, we apply it to two simulation models of the evolution of traits known to be affected by spatial population structure: altruism and pathogen transmissibility. In both models, the spatial decomposition of selection reveals that local and interlocal selection can have opposite signs, thus providing a mathematically rigorous underpinning to intuitive explanations of how processes at different spatial scales may compete. It furthermore identifies which length scales--and hence which patterns--are relevant for natural selection. The multiscale selection framework can thus be used to address complex questions on evolution in spatially structured populations.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to Neonectria ditissima, the fungus causing European canker in apple, was studied in a multiparental population of apple scions using several phenotyping methods. The studied population consists of individuals from multiple families connected through a common pedigree. The degree of disease of each individual in the population was assessed in three experiments: artificial inoculations of detached dormant shoots, potted trees in a glasshouse and in a replicated field experiment. The genetic basis of the differences in disease was studied using a pedigree-based analysis (PBA). Three quantitative trait loci (QTL), on linkage groups (LG) 6, 8 and 10 were identified in more than one of the phenotyping strategies. An additional four QTL, on LG 2, 5, 15 and 16 were only identified in the field experiment. The QTL on LG2 and 16 were further validated in a biparental population. QTL effect sizes were small to moderate with 4.3 to 19 % of variance explained by a single QTL. A subsequent analysis of QTL haplotypes revealed a dynamic response to this disease, in which the estimated effect of a haplotype varied over the field time-points. Two groups of QTL-haplotypes could be distinguished, one that displayed increased effect and one with a constant effect across time-points. These results suggest that there are different modes of control of N. ditissima in the early stages of infection compared to later time-points of disease development. It also shows that multiple QTL will need to be considered to improve resistance to European canker in apple breeding germplasm.",

Analysis may be conducted on related individuals from families, or on samples of unrelated individuals from a population. For allelically heterogeneous traits, population-based linkage analysis can be more powerful than genotypic-association analysis. Here, we focus on linkage analysis in a population sample, but use sequences rather than individuals as our unit of observation. Earlier investigations of sequence-based linkage mapping relied on known sequence relatedness, whereas we infer relatedness from the sequence data. We propose two ways to associate similarity in relatedness of sequences with similarity in their trait values and compare the resulting linkage methods to two genotypic-association methods. We also introduce a procedure to label case sequences as potential carriers or non-carriers of causal variants after an association has been found. This post-hoc labeling of case sequences is based on inferred relatedness to other case sequences. Our simulation results indicate that methods based on sequence-relatedness improve localization and perform as well as genotypic-association methods for detecting rare causal variants. Sequence-based linkage analysis therefore has potential to fine-map allelically heterogeneous disease traits.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHuman ancient DNA (aDNA) studies have surged in recent years, revolutionizing the study of the human past. Typically, aDNA is preserved poorly, making such data prone to contamination from other human DNA. Therefore, it is important to rule out substantial contamination before proceeding to downstream analysis. As most aDNA samples can only be sequenced to low coverages (<1x average depth), computational methods that can robustly estimate contamination in the low coverage regime are needed. However, the ultra low-coverage regime (0.1x and below) remains a challenging task for existing approaches.\n\nResultsWe present a new method to estimate contamination in aDNA for male individuals. It utilizes a Li&Stephens haplotype copying model for haploid X chromosomes, with mismatches modelled as genotyping error or contamination. We assessed an implementation of this new approach, hapCon, on simulated and down-sampled empirical aDNA data. Our results demonstrate that hapCon outperforms a commonly used tool for estimating male X contamination (ANGSD), with substantially lower variance and narrower confidence intervals, especially in the low coverage regime. We found that hapCon provides useful contamination estimates for coverages as low as 0.1x for SNP capture data (1240k) and 0.02x for whole genome sequencing data (WGS), substantially extending the coverage limit of previous male X chromosome based contamination estimation methods.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationA implementation of our software (hapCON) using Python and C has been deposited at https://github.com/hyl317/hapROH. We make hapCon available as part of a python package (hapROH), which is available at the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/hapROH) and can be installed via pip. The documentation provides example use cases as blueprints for custom applications (https://haproh.readthedocs.io).",

Next, from the currently known interactions of relevant proteins, we build a Protein-Protein interaction network and,localising the network cartography analysis, we identify 184 hub genes. We find that different hub types play different, and meaningful, biological roles. Finally, we perform Gene ontology enrichment analysis, and we find that these hubs are involved in immune system processes, including response to TGF-{beta} and LPS, as well as mitochondrial functioning, supporting previous theories about ME/CFS. We also show that dopaminergic signalling may potentially contribute to immune pathology in ME/CFS, suggesting a possible interplay with Long Covid. Our results demonstrate the potentiality of network analysis in shedding light on the epigenetic contribution to the immune dysregulation of ME/CFS.",

We show in this work that HGT Autoencoder can be used to accurately recapitulate the proteinmolecule interactions set and propose novel relationships in inductive settings that are grounded in biological and functional information extracted from the graph.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionarily related sequences provide information for the protein structure and function. Multiple sequence alignment, which includes homolog searching from large databases and sequence alignment, is efficient to dig out the information and assist protein structure and function prediction, whose efficiency has been proved by AlphaFold. Despite the existing tools for multiple sequence alignment, searching homologs from the entire UniProt is still time-consuming. Considering the success of AlphaFold, foreseeably, large-scale multiple sequence alignments against massive databases will be a trend in the field. It is very desirable to accelerate this step. Here, we propose a novel method, fastMSA, to improve the speed significantly. Our idea is orthogonal to all the previous accelerating methods. Taking advantage of the protein language model based on BERT, we propose a novel dual encoder architecture that can embed the protein sequences into a low-dimension space and filter the unrelated sequences efficiently before running BLAST. Extensive experimental results suggest that we can recall most of the homologs with a 34-fold speed-up. Moreover, our method is compatible with the downstream tasks, such as structure prediction using AlphaFold. Using multiple sequence alignments generated from our method, we have little performance compromise on the protein structure prediction with much less running time. fastMSA will effectively assist protein sequence, structure, and function analysis based on homologs and multiple sequence alignment.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a debilitating form of dementia with a high prevalence in the global population and a large burden on the community and health care systems. ADs complex pathobiology consists of extracellular {beta}-amyloid deposition and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau. Comprehensive mutational analyses can generate a wealth of knowledge about protein properties and enable crucial insights into molecular mechanisms of disease. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) has enabled multiplexed measurement of mutational effects on protein properties, including kinematics and self-organization, with unprecedented resolution. However, potential bottlenecks of DMS characterization include experimental design, data quality, and the depth of mutational coverage. Here, we apply Deep Learning to comprehensively model the mutational effect of the AD-associated peptide A{beta}42 on aggregation-related biochemical traits from DMS measurements. Among tested neural network architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are found to be the most cost-effective models with robust high performance even under insufficiently-sampled DMS studies. While sequence features are essential for satisfactory prediction from neural networks, geometric-structural features further enhance the prediction performance. Notably, we demonstrate how mechanistic insights into phenotype may be extracted from the neural networks themselves suitably designed. This methodological benefit is particularly relevant for biochemical systems displaying a strong coupling between structure and phenotype such as the conformation of A{beta}42 aggregate and nucleation, as shown here using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) developed from the protein atomic structure input. In addition to accurate imputation of missing values (which here ranged up to 55% of all phenotype values at key residues), the mutationally-defined nucleation phenotype generated from a GCN shows improved resolution for identifying known disease-causing mutations relative to the original DMS phenotype. Our study suggests that neural network derived sequence-phenotype mapping can be exploited not only to provide direct support for protein engineering or genome editing but also to facilitate therapeutic design with the gained perspectives from biological modeling.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, super-resolution microscopy has seen a tremendous development in speed and resolution, but for most of its methods, there exists a remarkable gap between lateral and axial resolution. Similar to conventional optical microscopy, the axial resolution is by a factor three to five worse than the lateral resolution. One recently developed method to close this gap is metal-induced energy transfer (MIET) imaging which achieves an axial resolution down to nanometers. It exploits the distance dependent quenching of fluorescence when a fluorescent molecule is brought close to a metal surface. In the present manuscript, we combine the extreme axial resolution of MIET imaging with the extraordinary lateral resolution of single-molecule localization microscopy, in particular with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). This combination allows us to achieve isotropic three-dimensional super-resolution imaging of sub-cellular structures. Moreover, we employed spectral demixing for implementing dualcolor MIET-dSTORM that allows us to image and co-localize, in three dimensions, two different cellular structures simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "While genetic tumor heterogeneity has long been recognized, recent work has revealed significant variation among cancer cells at the epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Profiling tumors at the single-cell level in individual cancer types has shown that transcriptional heterogeneity is organized into cancer cell states, implying that diverse cell states may represent stable and functional units with complementary roles in tumor maintenance and progression. However, it remains unclear to what extent these states span tumor types, constituting general features of cancer. Furthermore, the role of cancer cell states in tumor progression and their specific interactions with cells of the tumor microenvironment remain to be elucidated. Here, we perform a pan-cancer single-cell RNA-Seq analysis across 15 cancer types and identify a catalog of 16 gene modules whose expression defines recurrent cancer cell states, including  stress,  interferon response,  epithelial-mesenchymal transition,  metal response,  basal and  ciliated. Using mouse models, we find that induction of the interferon response module varies by tumor location and is diminished upon elimination of lymphocytes. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic analysis further links the interferon response in cancer cells to T cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Our work provides a framework for studying how cancer cell states interact with the tumor microenvironment to form organized systems capable of immune evasion, drug resistance, and metastasis.",

However, it remains unclear how dopamine neuron-related novelty responses influence behavior. Here, we characterized dynamics of novelty exploration using multi-point tracking (DeepLabCut) and behavioral segmentation (MoSeq). Novelty elicits a characteristic sequence of behavior, starting with investigatory approach and culminating in object engagement or avoidance. Dopamine in the tail of striatum (TS) suppresses engagement, and dopamine responses were predictive of individual variability in behavior. Behavioral dynamics and individual variability were explained by a novel reinforcement learning (RL) model of threat prediction, in which behavior arises from a novelty-induced initial threat prediction (akin to \"shaping bonus\"), and a threat prediction that is learned through dopamine-mediated threat prediction errors. These results uncover an algorithmic similarity between reward- and threat-related dopamine sub-systems.\n\nHighlightsO_LINovelty-induced behaviors are analyzed using modern machine-learning methods\nC_LIO_LINovelty induces risk assessment which develops into engagement or avoidance\nC_LIO_LIDopamine in the tail of striatum correlates with individual behavioral variability\nC_LIO_LIReinforcement learning with shaping bonus and uncertainty explains the data\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Currently little is known about the roles of neuronal primary cilia in postnatal neurodevelopment. Here we show that primary cilia of principal neurons in the cerebral cortex do not fully arise until the postnatal stage. Neuronal primary cilia undergo marked changes in morphology and orientation postnatally, concurrent with principal cell positioning. Primary cilia of early- and late-born hippocampal principal neurons display opposite orientations, while primary cilia of both early and late-born neocortical principal neurons point toward one direction. In contrast, astrocytes and interneurons in the hippocampus, and neurons in nucleated brain regions do not display specific cilia directionality. Guided by the clue of cilia directionality, we discovered that principal neurons in the hippocampal CA1, subiculum, postsubiculum, and neocortex undergo a previously unnoticed, slow but substantial \"reverse migration\" for postnatal positioning and proper lamination. Further, selective disruption of primary cilia function in the forebrain using Ift88 or Arl13b conditional knockout mice leads to cortical expansion, altered cortical lamination, or gyrification in the retrosplenial cortex that is formed by reverse migration. Collectively, this work has identified reverse migration as a novel fundamental process for principal cell positioning that helps shape lamination and gyrification in the cerebral cortex, and primary cilia orientation indicates the direction of reverse migration of principal neurons.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPrimary cilia of early- and late-born CA1 neurons display opposite orientations, while primary cilia of neocortical principal neurons generally point towards one direction (the pial surface).\nC_LIO_LIPrincipal neurons in the CA1 superficial sublayer, subiculum, postsubiculum, and neocortex undergo a reverse migration for postnatal cell positioning that refines cerebral cortical lamination.\nC_LIO_LIPrimary cilia orientation indicates the direction of reverse migration of principal neurons in the cerebral cortex.\nC_LIO_LISelective ablation of primary cilia in the forebrain leads to cortical expansion, altered lamination, and gyrification that is formed by the reverse migration of principal neurons.\nC_LIO_LIArl13b modulates the ciliation and postnatal positioning of hippocampal principal neurons.\nC_LI",
