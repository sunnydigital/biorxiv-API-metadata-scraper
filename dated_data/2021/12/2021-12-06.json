    "abstract": "This paper presents a generalisable method for the calibration of fluorescence readings on microplate readers, in order to convert arbitrary fluorescence units into absolute units. FPCountR relies on the generation of bespoke fluorescent protein (FP) calibrants, assays to determine protein concentration and activity, and a corresponding analytical workflow. We systematically characterise the assay protocols for accuracy, sensitivity and simplicity, and describe a novel  ECmax assay that outperforms the others and even enables accurate calibration without requiring the purification of FPs. To obtain cellular protein concentrations, we consider methods for the conversion of optical density to either cell counts or alternatively to cell volumes, as well as examining how cells can interfere with protein counting via fluorescence quenching, which we quantify and correct for the first time. Calibration across different instruments, disparate filter sets and mismatched gains is demonstrated to yield equivalent results. It also reveals that mCherry absorption at 600nm does not confound cell density measurements unless expressed to over 100,000 proteins per cell. FPCountR is presented as pair of open access tools (protocol and R package) to enable the community to use this method, and ultimately to facilitate the quantitative characterisation of synthetic microbial circuits.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering rely on computational search tools for predictions of novel biosynthetic pathways to industrially important compounds, many of which are derived from aromatic amino acids. Pathway search tools vary in their scope of covered reactions and compounds, as well as in metrics for ranking and evaluation. In this work, we present a new computational resource called ARBRE: Aromatic compounds RetroBiosynthesis Repository and Explorer. It consists of a comprehensive biochemical reaction network centered around aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and a computational toolbox for navigating this network. ARBRE encompasses over 28000 known and 100000 novel reactions predicted with generalized enzymatic reactions rules and over 70000 compounds, of which 22000 are known to biochemical databases and 48000 only to PubChem. Over 1,000 molecules that were solely part of the PubChem database before and were previously impossible to integrate into a biochemical network are included into the ARBRE reaction network by assigning enzymatic reactions. ARBRE can be applied for pathway search, enzyme annotation, pathway ranking, visualization, and network expansion around known biochemical pathways to predict valuable compound derivations. In line with the standards of open science, we have made the toolbox freely available to the scientific community at http://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/arbre/. We envision that ARBRE will provide the community with a new computational toolbox and comprehensive search tool to predict and rank pathways towards industrially important aromatic compounds.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnopheles stephensi, an invasive malaria vector, has been reported to have three biological forms identifiable mainly based on the number of ridges present on the eggs floats. Recently, the first intron of the odorant-binding protein-1 (AsteObp1) has been introduced as a molecular marker for the identification of these forms, and based on this marker, the presence of three putative sibling species (designated as species A, B and C) has been proposed. However, there is no data on the association of proposed markers with biological form or putative species on field populations.\n\nMethodsField collected and laboratory-reared An. stephensi were characterized for biological forms based on the number of ridges on the egg s float. DNA sequencing of the partial AsteObp1 gene of An. stephensi individuals were performed by Sangers method, either directly or after cloning with a plasmid vector. Additionally, AsteObp1 sequences of various laboratory lines of An. stephensi were retrieved from a public sequence database.\n\nResultsAsteObp1 intron-1 in Indian An. stephensi populations are highly polymorphic with the presence of more than 13 haplotypes exhibiting nucleotides as well as length-polymorphism (90-to-121 bp). No specific haplotype or a group of closely related haplotypes of intron-1 was found associated with any biological form identified morphologically. High heterozygosity for this marker with a low inbreeding coefficient in field and laboratory populations indicates that this marker is not suitable for the delimitation of putative sibling species, at least in Indian populations.\n\nConclusionsAsteObp1 cannot serve as a marker for identifying biological forms of An. stephensi or putative sibling species in Indian populations.",

Here we present Tailer, a bioinformatic pipeline in two parts that allows for robust quantification and analysis of tail information from next generation sequencing experiments that preserve RNA 3 end information. The first part of Tailer, Tailer-Processing, uses genome annotation or reference FASTA gene sequences to quantify RNA 3 ends from SAM-formatted alignment files or FASTQ sequence read files produced from sequencing experiments. The second part, Tailer-Analysis, uses the output of Tailer-Processing to identify statistically significant RNA targets of trimming and tailing and create graphs for data exploration. We apply Tailer to RNA 3 end sequencing experiments from three published studies and find that it accurately and reproducibly recapitulates key findings. Thus, Tailer should be a useful and easily accessible tool to globally investigate tailing dynamics of non-polyadenylated RNAs and conditions that perturb them.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged exposure to hypoxia causes structural remodeling and sustained contraction of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Both pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation and migration contribute to the vascular remodeling. We previously showed that the protein expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a membrane water channel protein, is elevated in PASMCs during following in vivo or in vitro exposure to hypoxia. Studies in other cell types suggest that AQP1 is a direct transcriptional target of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1. Moreover, we and others have shown that an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) is a hallmark of hypoxic exposure in PASMCs. Thus, we wanted to determine whether HIF regulates AQP1 in PASMCs and, if so, whether the process occurred via transcriptional regulation or was Ca2+-dependent. PASMCs were exposed to hypoxia, incubated with DMOG, which inhibits HIF protein degradation or infected with constitutively active forms of HIF-1 or HIF-2. Hypoxia, DMOG and HIF1/2 produced a time-dependent increase in AQP1 protein, but not mRNA. Interestingly, incubation with increasing HIF1/2a levels and DMOG increased [Ca2+]i in PASMCs, and this elevation was prevented by the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel inhibitor, verapamil (VER) and nonselective cation channel inhibitor SKF96365 (SKF). VER and SKF also blocked upregulation of AQP1 protein by DMOG or HIF1/2, but had no effect on expression of GLUT1, a canonical HIF transcriptional target. Silencing of AQP1 abrogated increases in PASMC migration and proliferation induced by HIF1/2, suggesting induction of AQP1 protein by HIF1/2 has a functional outcome in these cells. Thus, our results show that contrary to reports in other cell types, in PASMCs, AQP1 does not appear to be a direct target for HIF transcriptional regulation. Instead, AQP1 protein may be upregulated by a mechanism involving HIF-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i.",

Their core components, Cas9 and guide RNA (gRNA), can either be linked within a single cassette (full gene drive, fGD) or provided in two separate elements (split gene drive, sGD) wherein the gRNA-bearing element drives in the presence of an independent static source of Cas9. We previously designed a system engineered to turn split into full gene drives. Here, we provide experimental proof-of-principle for such a convertible system inserted at the spo11 locus, which is recoded to restore gene function. In multigenerational cage studies, the reconstituted spo11 fGD cassette initially drives with slower kinetics than the unlinked sGD element (using the same Mendelian vasa-Cas9 source), but eventually reaches a similar level of final introgression. Different kinetic behaviors may result from transient fitness costs associated with individuals co-inheriting Cas9 and gRNA transgenes during the drive process.",

    "abstract": "During activation, T cells undergo extensive changes in gene expression which shape the properties of cells to exert their effector function. Therefore, understanding the genetic regulation of gene expression during T cell activation provides essential insights into how genetic variants influence the response to infections and immune diseases. We generated a single-cell map of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) across a T cell activation time-course. We profiled 655,349 CD4+ naive and memory T cells, capturing transcriptional states of unstimulated cells and three time points of cell activation in 119 healthy individuals. We identified 38 cell clusters, including stable clusters such as central and effector memory T cells and transient clusters that were only present at individual time points of activation, such as interferon-responding cells. We mapped eQTLs using a T cell activation trajectory and identified 6,407 eQTL genes, of which a third (2,265 genes) were dynamically regulated during T cell activation. We integrated this information with GWAS variants for immune-mediated diseases and observed 127 colocalizations, with significant enrichment in dynamic eQTLs. Immune disease loci colocalized with genes that are involved in the regulation of T cell activation, and genes with similar functions tended to be perturbed in the same direction by disease risk alleles. Our results emphasize the importance of mapping context-specific gene expression regulation, provide insights into the mechanisms of genetic susceptibility of immune diseases, and help prioritize new therapeutic targets.",

The carboxyl terminal 153 residues of TDP-43 are of low sequence complexity and allow for self-association of the protein in a manner leading to its phase separation from an aqueous environment. These interactions assist TDP-43 in forming cytoplasmic RNA granules involved in the transport of mRNA for localized translation. Self-association of the TDP-43 low complexity (LC) domain is facilitated by a region of twenty five residues that are of extreme evolutionary conservation. The molecular basis for self-adherence of the protein through this region has been illuminated by a combination of structural and biochemical studies, allowing definition of a morphologically specific cross-{beta} structure predicted to be weakly assembled by main chain hydrogen bonds.

These autosomal dominant mutations can be idiosyncratic in their recurrent appearance at the same amino acid. Here we report studies of recurrent mutations in proline residues located within low complexity (LC) domains associated with the neurofilament light chain protein, the microtubule-associated tau protein, and the heterogeneous nuclear RNPA2 protein. All such mutations manifest their effects by directing formation of variant proteins endowed with the addition of a single, main chain hydrogen bond specified by the variant amino acid replacing proline. Here we show that methylation of the peptide backbone nitrogen atom associated with these variant amino acids eliminates the aberrant hydrogen bond and restores normal protein function.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR antiviral defense systems such as the well-known DNA-targeting Cas9- and the more complex RNA-targeting type III systems are widespread in bacteria and archea 1, 2. The type III systems can orchestrate a complex antiviral response that is initiated by the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) upon foreign RNA recognition 3-5. These second messenger molecules bind to the CARF (CRISPR associated Rossmann-fold) domains of dedicated effector proteins that are often DNAses, RNAses, or putative transcription factors 6. The activated effectors interfere with cellular pathways of the host, inducing cell death or a dormant state of the cell that is better suited to avoid propagation of the viral attack 7, 8. Among a large set of proteins that were predicted to be linked to the type III systems 9, 10, the CRISPR-Lon protein caught our attention. The protein was predicted to be an integral membrane protein containing a SAVED-instead of a CARF-domain as well as a Lon protease effector domain. Here, we report the crystal structure of CRISPR-Lon. The protein is a soluble monomer and indeed contains a SAVED domain that accommodates cA4. Further, we show that CRISPR-Lon forms a stable complex with the 34 kDa CRISPR-T protein. Upon activation by cA4, CRISPR-Lon specifically cleaves CRISRP-T, releasing CRISPR-T23, a 23 kDa fragment that is structurally very similar to MazF toxins and is likely a sequence specific nuclease. Our results describe the first cOA activated proteolytic enzyme and provide the first example of a SAVED domain connected to a type III CRISPR defense system. The use of a protease as a means to unleash a fast response against a threat has intriguing parallels to eukaryotic innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Viral vaccines can lose their efficacy as the genomes of targeted viruses rapidly evolve, resulting in new variants that may evade vaccine-induced immunity. This process is apparent in the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants which have the potential to undermine vaccination efforts and cause further outbreaks. Predictive vaccinology points to a future of pandemic preparedness in which vaccines can be developed preemptively based in part on predictive models of viral evolution. Thus, modeling the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein evolution could have value for mRNA vaccine development. Traditionally, in silico sequence evolution has been modeled discretely, while there has been limited investigation into continuous models. Here we present the Viral Predictor for mRNA Evolution (VPRE), an open-source software tool which learns from mutational patterns in viral proteins and models their most statistically likely evolutionary trajectories. We trained a variational autoencoder with real-time and simulated SARS-CoV-2 genome data from Australia to encode discrete spike protein sequences into continuous numerical variables. To simulate evolution along a phylogenetic path, we trained a Gaussian process model with the numerical variables to project spike protein evolution up to five months in advance. Our predictions mapped primarily to a sequence that differed by a single amino acid from the most reported spike protein in Australia within the prediction timeframe, indicating the utility of deep learning and continuous latent spaces for modeling viral protein evolution. VPRE can be readily adapted to investigate and predict the evolution of viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 in temporal, geographic, and lineage-specific pathways.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) constitutes the follicular basal lamina and is also present between follicular cells. Remodeling of the ECM is believed to be a key event in follicular development, especially follicular selection, and plays important roles in cell migration, survival, and steroidogenesis. miR-199-3p is differentially expressed in the goose follicular granulosa layer during follicular selection and is reported to play a primary role in inhibiting cell migration and invasion. Nevertheless, the effect of miR-199-3p on ovarian follicles and its role in follicular cellular migration are not understood. In this study, we demonstrated by qRT-PCR that miR-199-3p was differentially expressed in the granulosa layer from goose ovarian follicles before and after follicular selection. Additionally, we found that miR-199-3p overexpression could significantly suppress cell viability and migration, as well as elevate both the concentration of progesterone and the expression of key progesterone production genes in cultured granulosa cells (GCs) from goose pre-hierarchical follicles. Furthermore, using dual-fluorescence reporter experiments on 293T cells, we confirmed that miR-199-3p downregulated the expression of the ECM gene ITGB8 by directly targeting its mRNA three prime untranslated region (3' UTR). Finally, we found that miR-199-3p overexpression in the GCs of goose pre-hierarchical follicles inhibited the expression of two ECM-related genes (MMP9 and MMP15) yet promoted the expression of another two ECM-related genes (COL4A1 and LAMA1). Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-199-3p participates in granulosa cell migration, viability, and steroidogenesis in goose ovarian follicles before selection by targeting ITGB8 and modulating other ECM-related genes. These data highlight the key roles of miR-199-3p in follicular cell migration, viability, and steroidogenesis by regulating ECM-related genes and thus contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying follicle selection in birds.",

    "abstract": "High throughput sequencing has enabled the interrogation of the transcriptomic landscape of glucagon-secreting alpha cells, insulin-secreting beta cells, and somatostatin-secreting delta cells. These approaches have furthered our understanding of expression patterns that define healthy or diseased islet cell types and helped explicate some of the intricacies between major islet cell crosstalk and glucose regulation. All three endocrine cell types derive from a common pancreatic progenitor, yet alpha and beta cells have partially opposing functions, and delta cells modulate and control insulin and glucagon release. While gene signatures that define and maintain cellular identity have been widely explored, the underlying epigenetic components are incompletely characterized and understood. Chromatin accessibility and remodeling is a dynamic attribute that plays a critical role to determine and maintain cellular identity. Here, we compare and contrast the chromatin landscape between mouse alpha, beta, and delta cells using ATAC-Seq to evaluate the significant differences in chromatin accessibility. The similarities and differences in chromatin accessibility between these related islet endocrine cells help define their fate in support of their distinct functional roles. We identify patterns that suggest that both alpha and delta cells are poised, but repressed, from becoming beta-like. We also identify patterns in differentially enriched chromatin that have transcription factor motifs preferentially associated with different regions of the genome. Finally, we identify and visualize both novel and previously discovered common endocrine- and cell specific- enhancer regions across differentially enriched chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Cockroach species Periplaneta americana and Blatella germanica potentially survive in locations close to human activity. Besides spoiling food material, cockroaches also transfer pathogens of different diseases among human. Since the insecticides have been used extensively to control cockroaches, information on their insecticide susceptibility and toxicity at cellular level may be crucial. In the study, deltamethrin toxicity as well as the deltamethrin-mediated cytomorphological changes in brain, ovary and midgut of the two important cockroach species has been assessed. Different concentrations [0.00025% (0.0025mg/ml), 0.0025% (0.025mg/ml), 0.025 (0.25mg/ml), 0.25% (2.5mg/ml), 0.5% (5mg/ml), 1% (10mg/ml)] of deltamethrin in acetone were used to expose test species in WHO bottle assay. Knockdown was recorded after 5 min interval while delayed mortality was observed after 24 hr. Brain, ovary and gut were dissected post 1 hr exposure and 24 hr holding (for 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% concentration), and tissues were processed for microscopic analysis. Deltamethrin exposed cockroaches and dissected tissues were used to estimate deltamethrin using HPLC. At 0.00025% (lowest concentration), the percentage knock-down observed was 66.7% for P. americana and 80% B. germanica respectively (R2= 0.78; p=0.0001) in 1 hr. KDT50 value was found to be 8.7 min (95% CI: 7.3-10.2), while KDT99 was 20.7 min (95% CI: 16.0-35.7) in P. americana at 1% concentration. Whereas, the KDT50 and KDT99 values for B. germanica were 7.4 min (95% CI: 5.4-9.1) and 27.4 min (95% CI: 18.2-80.0) at similar concentration. LD50 and LD95 values (for 60 min standard exposure) were 0.0006 % (95% CI: 0.00-0.001) and 0.034% (95% CI: 0.013-0.49) respectively for P. americana, while these values were 0.0005 (95% CI: 0.00-0.001) and 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.23) for B. germanica. Exposure to 1% deltamethrin induced considerable toxic effect in the epithelial cells in the midgut. HPLC estimated 0.21{+/-}0.05 mg (95% CI - 0.18-0.25; CoV 23.9%) deltamethrin in P. americana post 1% exposure. Even short term exposure of low concentration of synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin displayed immediate knockdown and delayed mortality in both the test species. Considerable histological damage was observed in both the insects at 1% exposure. In India, resistance to deltamethrin may have been reported among different insects due its extensive use, however the formulations such as insecticide paints, attractant baits etc. developed using deltamethrin as active ingredient could be useful in cockroach control operations.",

    "abstract": "Consumers views and concerns about the welfare of farm animals may play an important role in their decision to consume dairy, meat and/or plants as their primary protein source. As animals are killed prematurely in both dairy and beef industries, it is important to quantify and compare welfare compromise in these two sectors before the point of death. Seventy world-leading bovine welfare experts based in 23 countries, were asked to evaluate the likelihood of a bovine to experience 12 states of potential welfare concern, inspired by the Welfare Quality(R) protocol. The evaluation focused on the most common beef and dairy production systems in the experts country, and was carried out separately for dairy/beef calves raised for red-meat, dairy/beef calves raised for veal, dairy/beef calves raised as replacement, and for dairy/beef cows. The results show experts rated the overall likelihood of a negative welfare state (i.e. welfare risk) to be higher in animals from dairy herds than from beef herds, for all animal categories, regardless of whether they were used to produce milk, red-meat or veal. These findings suggest that consuming food products derived from common dairy production systems (dairy or meat), may be more harmful to the welfare of animals than consuming products derived from common beef production systems (i.e. from animals solely raised for their meat). Raising awareness about the linkage between dairy and meat production, and the toll of milk production on the welfare state of animals in the dairy industry, may encourage a more sustainable and responsible food consumption.",

    "abstract": "Protein S-palmitoylation, the addition of a long-chain fatty acid to target proteins, is among the most frequent reversible protein modification in Metazoa, affecting subcellular protein localization, trafficking and protein-protein interactions. S-palmitoylated proteins are abundant in the neuronal system and are associated with neuronal diseases and cancer. Despite the importance of this post-translational modification, it has not been thoroughly studied in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nHere we present the palmitoylome of Drosophila S2R+ cells, comprising 198 proteins, an estimated 3.5% of expressed genes in these cells. Comparison of orthologs between mammals and Drosophila suggests that S-palmitoylated proteins are more conserved between these distant phyla than non-S-palmitoylated proteins. To identify putative client proteins and interaction partners of the DHHC family of protein acyl-transferases (PATs) we established DHHC-BioID, a proximity biotinylation-based method. In S2R+ cells ectopic expression of the DHHC-PAT dHip14-BioID in combination with Snap24 or an interaction-deficient Snap24- mutant, as a negative control, resulted in biotinylation of Snap24 but not the Snap24-mutant. DHHC-BioID in S2R+ cells using 10 different DHHC-PATs as bait identified 520 putative DHHC-PAT interaction partners of which 48 were S-palmitoylated and are therefore putative DHHC-PAT client proteins. Comparison of putative client protein/DHHC-PAT combinations indicates that CG8314, CG5196, CG5880 and Patsas have a preference for transmembrane proteins, while S-palmitoylated proteins with the Hip14-interaction motif are most enriched by DHHC-BioID variants of approximated and dHip14. Finally, we show that BioID is active in larval and adult Drosophila and that dHip14-BioID rescues dHip14 mutant flies, indicating that DHHC-BioID is non-toxic.\n\nIn summary we provide the first systematic analysis of a Drosophila palmitoylome. We show that DHHC-BioID is sensitive and specific enough to identify DHHC-PAT client proteins and provide DHHC-PAT assignment for ca. 25% of the S2R+ cell palmitoylome, providing a valuable resource. In addition, we establish DHHC-BioID as a useful concept for the identification of tissue-specific DHHC-PAT interactomes in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence and intensity of parasitism can have different fitness costs between sexes, and across species and developmental stages. This variation could arise because of species specific sexual and developmental differences in body condition, immunity, and resistance. Theory predicts that the prevalence of parasitism will be greater in individuals with poor body condition and the intensity of parasitism will be greater in individuals with larger body size. These predictions have been tested and verified in vertebrates. In insects, however, contradictory evidence has been found in different taxa. Here, we tested these predictions on two species of Agriocnemis (Agriocnemis femina and Agriocnemis pygmaea) damselflies, which are parasitized by Arrenurus water mite ectoparasites. We measured body weight, total body length, abdomen area and thorax area of non-parasitized damselflies and found body condition varied between males and females, between immature females and mature females and between A. femina and A. pygmaea. Then, we calculated the parasite prevalence, i.e., the frequency of parasitism and intensity, i.e., the number of parasites per infected damselfly in eleven natural populations of both species. In line to our predictions, we observed greater prevalence in immature females than mature females but found no difference in parasite prevalence between males and females. Furthermore, we found that parasite load was higher in females than males and in immature females than mature females. Our result also showed that the frequency and intensity of parasitism varied between the two studied species, being higher in A. pygmaea than A. femina. Our study provides evidence that parasitism impacts sexes, developmental stages and species differentially and suggests that variation may occur due to sex, developmental stage, and species-specific resistance and tolerance mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs; Batten disease) are fatal, mainly childhood, inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases. Sheep affected with a CLN6 form display progressive regionally defined glial activation and subsequent neurodegeneration, indicating that neuroinflammation may be causative of pathogenesis. In this study, aggregation chimeras were generated from homozygous unaffected normal and CLN6 affected sheep embryos, resulting in seven chimeric animals with varied proportions of normal to affected cells. These sheep were classified as affected-like, recovering-like or normal-like, based on their cell-genotype ratios and their clinical and neuropathological profiles.\n\nNeuropathological examination of the affected-like animals revealed intense glial activation, prominent storage body accumulation and severe neurodegeneration within all cortical brain regions, along with vision loss and decreasing intracranial volumes and cortical thicknesses consistent with ovine CLN6 disease. In contrast, intercellular communication affecting pathology was evident at both the gross and histological level in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras, resulting in a lack of glial activation and rare storage body accumulation in only a few cells. Initial intracranial volumes of the recovering-like chimeras were below normal but progressively recovered to about normal by two years of age. All had normal cortical thicknesses, and none went blind. Extended neurogenesis was evident in the brains of all the chimeras.\n\nThis study indicates that although CLN6 is a membrane bound protein, the consequent defect is not cell intrinsic. The lack of glial activation and inflammatory responses in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras indicate that newly generated cells are borne into a microenvironment conducive to maturation and survival.",

    "abstract": "Frameshift and nonsense DNA variants represent the commonest causes of monogenic inherited diseases. They usually generate premature termination codon (PTC)-containing RNA transcripts that produce truncated proteins in recombinant systems, but endogenously are subject to nonsense mediated decay. To examine native consequences of these variants, we derived cells from pre-genotyped patients. Blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) were established from individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) due to a heterozygous nonsense variant in ACVRL1, ENG or SMAD4 that each encode an endothelial cell-expressed protein mediating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/ transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta} signalling. RNA sequencing alignments to PTC alleles varied from 8-23% of expected, and differed between same-donor replicates. Differential gene expression analyses were validated by single cell qRT-PCR, and identification of changes in wider, disease-specific BMP/TGF-{beta} pathway components. However, the most differentially expressed genes clustered to disease-independent terms for post translational protein modification (isopeptide bond; ubiquitin-like conjugation). They were the only terms meeting Benjamini significance after clustering Bonferroni-ranked, differentially expressed genes from the 5,013 meeting 10% intraassay coefficients of variation, and significance was robust to normalisation methods. Optimised pulse chase experiments supported perturbed wildtype protein maturation, but no PTC-truncated protein was identified. Unexpectedly, BOEC cultures with highest PTC persistence were discriminated in unsupervised hierarchical clustering of low GINI coefficient  invariant housekeeper genes, and patterns were compatible with higher cellular stress. The findings support a model whereby PTCs are more of a burden in stressed cells, and lead us to conclude that overlooked and varying PTC burdens contribute to biological variability.",
