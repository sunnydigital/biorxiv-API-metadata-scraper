    "abstract": "A qualitative mathematical model of the notion of immunocompetence is developed, based on the formalism of Memory Evolutive Systems (MES), from which, immunocompetence is defined as an emergent structure of a higher order arising from the signal networks that are established between effector cells and molecules of the immune response in the presence of a given antigen. In addition, a possible mechanism of functorial nature is proposed, which may explain how immunocompetence is achieved in an organism endowed with innate and adaptive components of its immune system. Finally, a practical method to measure the immunocompetence status is established, using elements of the theory of small random graphs and taking into account the characteristics of the immune networks, established through transcriptional studies, of patients with severe COVID-19 and healthy patients, assuming that both types of patients were vaccinated with an effective biological against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) induces strong antibody and T cell responses. Although considered to be localized in the cytosol, we readily detect N on the surface of live cells. N released by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells or N-expressing transfected cells binds to neighboring cells by electrostatic high-affinity binding to heparan sulfate and heparin, but not other sulfated glycosaminoglycans. N binds with high affinity to 11 human chemokines, including CXCL12{beta}, whose chemotaxis of leukocytes is inhibited by N from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS CoV. Anti-N Abs bound to the surface of N expressing cells activate Fc receptor-expressing cells. Our findings indicate that cell surface N manipulates innate immunity by sequestering chemokines and can be targeted by Fc expressing innate immune cells. This, in combination with its conserved antigenicity among human CoVs, advances its candidacy for vaccines that induce cross-reactive B and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human CoVs, including novel zoonotic strains.",

    "abstract": "Global changes in response to human encroachment into natural habitats and carbon emissions are driving the biodiversity extinction crisis and increasing disease emergence risk. Host distributions are one critical component to identify areas at risk of spillover, and bats act as reservoirs of diverse viruses. We developed a reproducible ecological niche modelling pipeline for bat hosts of SARS-like viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), given that since SARS-CoV-2 emergence several closely-related viruses have been discovered and sarbecovirus-host interactions have gained attention. We assess sampling biases and model bats current distributions based on climate and landscape relationships and project future scenarios. The most important predictors of species distribution were temperature seasonality and cave availability. We identified concentrated host hotspots in Myanmar and projected range contractions for most species by 2100. Our projections indicate hotspots will shift east in Southeast Asia in >2 {degrees}C hotter locations in a fossil-fueled development future. Hotspot shifts have implications for conservation and public health, as loss of population connectivity can lead to local extinctions, and remaining hotspots may concentrate near human populations.",

    "abstract": "There is enormous ongoing interest in characterizing the binding properties of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant of Concern (VOC) (B.1.1.529), which continues to spread towards potential dominance worldwide. To aid these studies, based on the wealth of available structural information about several SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and a modeling pipeline we have previously developed for tracking the ongoing global evolution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we provide a set of computed structural models (henceforth models) of the Omicron VOC receptor-binding domain (omRBD) bound to its corresponding receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE2) and a variety of therapeutic entities, including neutralizing and therapeutic antibodies targeting previously-detected viral strains. We generated bound omRBD models using both experimentally-determined structures in the PDB as well as machine learningbased structure predictions as starting points. Examination of ACE2-bound omRBD models reveals an interdigitated multi-residue interaction network formed by omRBD-specific substituted residues (R493, S496, Y501, R498) and ACE2 residues at the interface, which was not present in the original Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. Emergence of this interaction network suggests optimization of a key region of the binding interface, and positive cooperativity among various sites of residue substitutions in omRBD mediating ACE2 binding. Examination of neutralizing antibody complexes for Barnes Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies modeled with omRBD highlights an overall loss of interfacial interactions (with gain of new interactions in rare cases) mediated by substituted residues. Many of these substitutions have previously been found to independently dampen or even ablate antibody binding, and perhaps mediate antibody-mediated neutralization escape (e.g., K417N). We observe little compensation of corresponding interaction loss at interfaces when potential escape substitutions occur in combination. A few selected antibodies (e.g., Barnes Class 3 S309), however, feature largely unaltered or modestly affected protein-protein interfaces. While we stress that only qualitative insights can be obtained directly from our models at this time, we anticipate that they can provide starting points for more detailed and quantitative computational characterization, and, if needed, redesign of monoclonal antibodies for targeting the Omicron VOC Spike protein. In the broader context, the computational pipeline we developed provides a framework for rapidly and efficiently generating retrospective and prospective models for other novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 bound to entities of virological and therapeutic interest, in the setting of a global pandemic.",

    "abstract": "2-5-Oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) is one of the key enzymes driving the innate immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 infection whose activity has been related to COVID-19 severity. In particular, OAS1 is a sensor of endogenous RNA that triggers the 2-5 oligoadenylate/RNase L pathway in response to viral infections, ultimately activating the RNA-Lyase which cleaves endogenous and exogenous RNA impeding the viral maturation. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, OAS1 is responsible for the recognition of viral RNA and has been shown to possess a particularly high sensitivity for the 5-untranslated (5-UTR) RNA region, which is organized in a double-strand stem loop motif (SLA). Since the structure of the nucleic acid/protein complex has not been resolved, here we report its structure obtained by molecular modeling, including enhanced sampling approaches. We also pinpoint that the SL1 region enhances the interaction network with the enzyme, promoting specific hydrogen bonds, absent in normal double strand RNA fragments, hence rationalizing the high affinity for OAS1.",

    "abstract": "The three types of interferon (IFN) have roles in antimicrobial immunity and inflammation that must be properly balanced to maintain tissue homeostasis. For example, IFNs are elevated in the context of inflammatory bowel disease and may synergize with inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) to promote tissue damage. Prior studies suggest that in mouse intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), type III IFNs are preferentially produced during viral infections and are less cytotoxic than type I IFN. Here, we generated human IEC organoid lines from biopsies of ileum, ascending colon, and sigmoid colon of three healthy subjects to establish the baseline responses of normal human IECs to types I, II, and III IFN. We found that all IFN types elicited responses that were qualitatively consistent across intestinal biopsy sites. However, IFN types differed in magnitude of STAT1 phosphorylation and identity of genes in their downstream transcriptional programs. Specifically, there was a core transcriptional module shared by IFN types, but types I and II IFN stimulated unique transcriptional modules beyond this core gene signature. The transcriptional modules of type I and II IFN included pro-apoptotic genes, and expression of these genes correlated with potentiation of TNF cytotoxicity. These data define the response profiles of healthy human IEC organoids across IFN types, and suggest that cytotoxic effects mediated by TNF in inflamed tissues may be amplified by a simultaneous high-magnitude IFN response.",

    "abstract": "B lymphocyte development has two DNA recombination processes: V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin (Igh) gene variable region and class switching of the Igh constant regions from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE. V(D)J recombination is required for successful maturation of B cells from pro-B to pre-B to immature-B and then to mature B cells in the bone marrow. CSR occurs outside of the bone marrow when mature B cells migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes. Both V(D)J recombination and CSR depend on an open chromatin state that makes DNA accessible to specific enzymes, recombination activating gene (RAG), and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Acetyltransferases GCN5 and PCAF possess redundant functions acetylating histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9). Here, we generated a mouse model that lacks both GCN5 and PCAF in B cells. We found that double-deficient mice possess low levels of mature B cells in the bone marrow and peripheral organs, an accumulation of pro-B cells in bone marrow, and reduced CSR levels. We conclude that both GCN5 and PCAF are required for B cell development in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Conformational variation in catalytic residues can be captured as alternative snapshots in enzyme crystal structures. Addressing the question of whether active site flexibility is an intrinsic and essential property of enzymes for catalysis, we present a comprehensive study on the 3D variation of active sites of 925 enzyme families, using explicit catalytic residue annotations from the Mechanism and Catalytic Site Atlas and structural data from the Protein Data Bank. Through weighted pairwise superposition of the functional atoms of active sites, we captured structural variability at single-residue level and examined the geometrical changes as ligands bind or as mutations occur. We demonstrate that catalytic centres of enzymes can be inherently rigid or flexible to various degrees according to the function they perform, and structural variability most often involves a subset of the catalytic residues, usually those not directly involved in the formation or cleavage of bonds. Moreover, data suggest that 2/3 of active sites are flexible, and in half of those, flexibility is only observed in the side chain. The goal of this work is to characterise our current knowledge of the extent of flexibility at the heart of catalysis and ultimately place our findings in the context of the evolution of catalysis as enzymes evolve new functions and bind different substrates.",

Massive sequencing data require highly efficient bioinformatics tools to complete read alignment and variant calling as the fundamental analysis. Multiple software and hardware acceleration strategies have been developed to boost the analysis speed. This study comprehensively evaluated the germline variant calling of a GPU-based acceleration tool, BaseNumber, using WGS datasets from several sources, including gold-standard samples from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) project and the Golden Standard of China Genome (GSCG) project, resequenced GSCG samples, and 100 in-house samples from the China Deafness Genetics Consortium (CDGC) project. Sequencing data were analyzed on the GPU server using BaseNumber, the variant calling outputs of which were compared to the reference VCF or the results generated by the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) + Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) pipeline on a generic CPU server. BaseNumber demonstrated high precision (99.32%) and recall (99.86%) rates in variant calls compared to the standard reference. The variant calling outputs of the BaseNumber and GATK pipelines were very similar, with a mean F1 of 99.69%. Additionally, BaseNumber took only 23 minutes on average to analyze a 48X WGS sample, which was 215.33 times shorter than the GATK workflow. The GPU-based BaseNumber provides a highly accurate and ultrafast variant calling capability, significantly improving the WGS analysis efficiency and facilitating time-sensitive tests, such as clinical WGS genetic diagnosis, and sheds light on the GPU-based acceleration of other omics data analyses.",

This phenotypic switching need not be stochastic, however, but could also be in response to environmental factors, both biotic and abiotic. Here, motivated by the bacterial persistence phenotype, we explore the ecological effects of such responsive switching by analyzing phenotypic switching in response to competing species. We show that the stability of microbial communities with responsive switching differs generically from that of communities with stochastic switching only. To understand the mechanisms by which responsive switching stabilizes coexistence, we go on to analyze simple two-species models. Combining exact results and numerical simulations, we extend the classical stability results for the competition of two species without phenotypic variation to the case in which one species switches, stochastically and responsively, between two phenotypes. In particular, we show that responsive switching can stabilize coexistence even when stochastic switching on its own does not affect the stability of the community.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the design principles of regulatory networks driving cellular decision-making has fundamental implications in mapping and eventually controlling cell-fate decisions. Despite being complex, these regulatory networks often only give rise to a few phenotypes. Previously, we identified two \"teams\" of nodes in a small cell lung cancer regulatory network that constrained the phenotypic repertoire and aligned strongly with the dominant phenotypes obtained from network simulations (Chauhan et al., 2021). However, it remained elusive whether these \"teams\" exist in other networks, and how do they shape the phenotypic landscape. Here, we demonstrate that five different networks of varying sizes governing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity comprised of two \"teams\" of players - one comprised of canonical drivers of epithelial phenotype and the other containing the mesenchymal inducers. These \"teams\" are specific to the topology of these regulatory networks and orchestrate a bimodal phenotypic landscape with the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes being more frequent and dynamically robust to perturbations, relative to the intermediary/hybrid epithelial/ mesenchymal ones. Our analysis reveals that network topology alone can contain information about corresponding phenotypic distributions, thus obviating the need to simulate them. We propose \"teams\" of nodes as a network design principle that can drive cell-fate canalization in diverse decision-making processes.",

    "abstract": "During development reelin sets the pace of neocortical neurogenesis enabling in turn newborn neurons to migrate, but whether and, if so, how reelin signaling affects the adult neurogenic niches remains uncertain. We show that reelin signaling, resulting in Dab1 phosphorylation, occurs in the ependymal-subependymal zone (EZ/SEZ) of the lateral ventricles where, along with its associated rostral migratory stream (RMS), the highest density of functional ApoER2 accumulates. Mice deficient for reelin, ApoER2 or Dab1 exhibit enlarged ventricles and dysplastic RMS. Moreover, while the conditional ablation of Dab1 in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) enlarges the ventricles and impairs neuroblasts clearance from the SEZ, the transgenic misexpression of reelin in NPCs of reelin-deficient mice normalizes the ventricular lumen and the density of ependymal cilia, ameliorating in turn neuroblasts migration; consistently, intraventricular infusion of reelin reroutes neuroblasts. These results demonstrate that reelin signaling persists sustaining the germinal niche of the lateral ventricles and influencing neuroblasts migration in the adult brain.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are tissue resident cells in the lungs derived from the fetal liver that maintain lung homeostasis and respond to inhaled stimuli. While the importance of AMs is undisputed, they remain refractory to standard experimental approaches and high-throughput functional genetics as they are challenging to isolate and rapidly lose AM properties in standard culture. This limitation hinders our understanding of key regulatory mechanisms that control AM maintenance and function. Here, we describe the development of a new model, fetal liver-derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), which maintains cellular morphologies, expression profiles, and functional mechanisms similar to murine AMs. FLAMs combine treatment with two key cytokines for AM maintenance, GM-CSF and TGF{beta}. We leveraged the long-term stability of FLAMs to develop functional genetic tools using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing. Targeted editing confirmed the role of AM-specific gene Marco and the IL-1 receptor Il1r1 in modulating the AM response to crystalline silica. Furthermore, a genome-wide knockout library using FLAMs identified novel genes required for surface expression of the AM marker Siglec-F, most notably those related to the peroxisome. Taken together, our results suggest that FLAMs are a stable, self-replicating model of AM function that enables previously impossible global genetic approaches to define the underlying mechanisms of AM maintenance and function.",

Further, the high number of mutations in the viral spike-protein raised concerns that the virus might evade antibodies induced by infection or vaccination. Here, we report that the Omicron spike was resistant against most therapeutic antibodies but remained susceptible to inhibition by Sotrovimab. Similarly, the Omicron spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent or BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals with 10- to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron spike by antibodies induced upon heterologous ChAdOx1/BNT162b2-vaccination or vaccination with three doses of BNT162b2 was more efficient, but the Omicron spike still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta spike. These findings indicate that most therapeutic antibodies will be ineffective against the Omicron variant and that double immunization with BNT162b2 might not adequately protect against severe disease induced by this variant.",

Several models were proposed to explain its inhibitory function, but quantitative measurement is needed for model evaluation and refinement. We report a broadly applicable live-cell method for calibrated dose-response characterization of the nuclear transport alteration by a protein of interest. Using this method, we found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is ~15 times more potent than SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 in inhibiting bidirectional nuclear transport, due to differences in the NUP98-binding C-terminal region that is required for the inhibition. The N-terminal region promotes membrane binding and was required for activity, but could be replaced by constructs which forced oligomerization in solution. Based on these data, we propose that the hydrophobic N-terminal region drives oligomerization of ORF6 to multivalently cross-link the FG domains of NUP98 at the nuclear pore complex, and this multivalent binding inhibits bidirectional transport.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton is key to establish axon-dendrite polarity. Dendrites are characterized by the presence of minus-end out microtubules, however the mechanisms that organize these microtubules minus-end out is still poorly understood. Here, we characterized the role of two microtubule minus-end related proteins in this process in Caenorhabditis elegans, the microtubule minus-end stabilizing protein CAMSAP (PTRN-1) and a NINEIN homologue (NOCA-2). We found that CAMSAP and NINEIN function in parallel to mediate microtubule organization in dendrites. During dendrite outgrowth, RAB-11 positive vesicles localized to the dendrite tip function as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) to nucleate microtubules. In the absence of either CAMSAP or NINEIN, we observed a low penetrance MTOC vesicles mis-localization to the cell body, and a nearly fully penetrant phenotype in double mutant animals. This suggests that both proteins are important for localizing the MTOC vesicles to the growing dendrite tip to organize microtubules minus-end out. Whereas NINEIN localizes to the MTOC vesicles where it is important for the recruitment of the microtubule nucleator {gamma}-tubulin, CAMSAP localizes around the MTOC vesicles and is co-translocated forward with the MTOC vesicles upon dendritic growth. Together, these results indicate that microtubule nucleation from the MTOC vesicles and microtubule stabilization are both important to localize the MTOC vesicles distally to organize dendritic microtubules minus-end out.",

    "abstract": "Animal products may play a role in developing and spreading antimicrobial resistance in several ways. On the one hand, residues of antibiotics not adequately used in animal farming can enter the human body via food. But resistant bacteria may also be present in animal products, which can transfer the antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) to the bacteria in the consumers body by horizontal gene transfer. As previous studies have shown that fermented foods have a meaningful ARG content, it is indicated that such genes may also be present in silage used as mass feed in the cattle sector. In our study, we aspired to answer what ARGs occur in silage and what mobility characteristics they have? For this purpose, we have analyzed bioinformatically 52 freely available deep sequenced silage samples from shotgun metagenome next-generation sequencing. A total of 17 perfect matched ARGs occurred 55 times in the samples. More than half of these ARGs are mobile because they can be linked to integrative mobile genetic elements, prophages or plasmids. Our results point to a neglected but substantial ARG source in the food chain.",

Several major variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and posed challenges in controlling the pandemic. The recently occurred Omicron variant raised serious concerns about reducing the efficacy of vaccines and neutralization antibodies due to its vast mutations. We have modelled the complex structure of the human ACE2 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Omicron Spike protein (S-protein), and conducted atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding interactions. The analysis shows that the Omicron RBD binds more strongly to the human ACE2 protein than the original strain. The mutations at the ACE2-RBD interface enhance the tight binding by increasing hydrogen bonding interaction and enlarging buried solvent accessible surface area.",

The emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants of concern (VoC) and evidence that existing vaccines that were designed to protect from the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 may have reduced potency for protection from infection against these VoC is driving continued development of second generation vaccines that can protect against multiple VoC. In this report, we evaluated an alphavirus-based replicating RNA vaccine expressing Spike proteins from the original SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strain and recent VoCs delivered in vivo via a lipid inorganic nanoparticle. Vaccination of both mice and Syrian Golden hamsters showed that vaccination induced potent neutralizing titers against each homologous VoC but reduced neutralization against heterologous challenges. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with homologous SARS-CoV2 variants exhibited complete protection from infection. In addition, vaccinated hamsters challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited significantly reduced shedding of infectious virus. Our data demonstrate that this vaccine platform elicits significant protective immunity against SARS-CoV2 variants and supports continued development of this platform.",

While it is appreciated that an exaggerated inflammatory response is associated with barrier dysfunction, the triggers of this pathology are unclear. Here, we report that cell-intrinsic interactions between the Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and epithelial/endothelial cells are sufficient to trigger barrier dysfunction in vitro and vascular leak in vivo, independently of viral replication and the ACE2 receptor. We identify an S-triggered transcriptional response associated with extracellular matrix reorganization and TGF-{beta} signaling. Using genetic knockouts and specific inhibitors, we demonstrate that glycosaminoglycans, integrins, and the TGF-{beta} signaling axis are required for S-mediated barrier dysfunction. Our findings suggest that S interactions with barrier cells are a contributing factor to COVID-19 disease severity and offer mechanistic insight into SARS-CoV-2 triggered vascular leak, providing a starting point for development of therapies targeting COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

The use of artificial caterpillars to mimic actual prey availability is generally seen as a standard approach to compare the activity and diversity of predators along environmental gradients. Yet, even with standardized material and procedures, biases may still affect data from multiple observers with different expertise. We used pictures of artificial caterpillars with or without various predation marks, in an online survey that was targeted for the participants of the project, to evaluate the reliability of predation marks identification made by non-scientists and by scientists with and without previous experience in predation mark identification. Pictures of artificial caterpillars displayed typical marks left by birds, mammals and arthropods, as well as non-predation marks ( false positive). 357 respondents scanned 7140 pictures of these pictures. Self-declared scientists were more confident and accurate in their observations than non-scientists, but the differences in correct identifications among scientists and non-scientists were low. Self-declared scientists with previous experience were also more accurate than scientists without previous experience, while there were no differences in self-confidence among scientists with and without previous experience. Accuracy in predation mark identification did not differ among types of predators, but respondents were more keen to identify marks left by birds or mammals than arthropods. Our results have practical implications for the design of multi-observer projects relying on artificial caterpillars as a proxy to assess predation intensity, in particular in the context of citizen science.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 is a major concern given their potential impact on the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus as well as the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Here, we predict the mutability of all positions in SARS-CoV-2 protein domains to forecast the appearance of unseen variants. Using sequence data from other coronaviruses, pre-existing to SARS-CoV-2, we build statistical models that do not only capture amino-acid conservation but more complex patterns resulting from epistasis. We show that these models are notably superior to conservation profiles in estimating the already observable SARS-CoV-2 variability. In the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, we observe that the predicted mutability correlates well with experimental measures of protein stability and that both are reliable mutability predictors (ROC AUC ~0.8). Most interestingly, we observe an increasing agreement between our model and the observed variability as more data become available over time, proving the anticipatory capacity of our model. When combined with data concerning the immune response, our approach identifies positions where current variants of concern are highly overrepresented. These results could assist studies on viral evolution, future viral outbreaks and, in particular, guide the exploration and anticipation of potentially harmful future SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nSignificance statementDuring the COVID pandemic, new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and spread, some being of major concern due to their increased infectivity or their capacity to reduce vaccine efficiency. Anticipating new mutations, which might give rise to new variants, would be of great interest. Here we construct sequence models predicting how mutable SARS-CoV-2 positions are, using a single SARS-CoV-2 sequence and databases of other coronaviruses. Predictions are tested against available mutagenesis data and the observed variability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Interestingly, our predictions agree increasingly with observations, as more SARS-CoV-2 sequences become available. Combining predictions with immunological data, we find a clear overrepresentation of mutations in current variants of concern. The approach may become relevant for potential outbreaks of future viral diseases.",

Ninety-seven miRNAs of questionable authenticity (frequently known repeat elements) were identified from the miRBase dataset across the newly described regions of the human genome. These 97 represent only 51 miRNA families due to paralogy of highly similar miRNAs such as 24 members of the hsa-mir-548 family. Altogether, this data strongly supports our having identified widely expressed bona fide miRNAs in the human genome and move us further toward the completion of human miRNA discovery.",

Personalized in vitro breast cancer models can be used for high throughput testing and ranking of therapeutic strategies to normalize the aberrant microenvironment in a patient-specific manner. Here, tumoroids assembled from patient-derived cells cultured in microphysiological systems including perfusable microvasculature reproduce key aspects of stromal and vascular dysfunction. Increased hyaluronic acid and collagen deposition, loss of vascular glycocalyx and reduced perfusion, and elevated interstitial fluid pressure in the models result in impaired drug distribution to tumor cells. We demonstrate the application of these personalized models as tools to rank molecular therapies for the normalization of the tumoroid microenvironment and to discover new therapeutic targets such as IL8 and CD44, which may ultimately improve drug efficacy in breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPolygenic risk score (PRS) analyses are now routinely applied in biomedical research, with great hope that they will aid in our understanding of disease aetiology and contribute to personalized medicine. The continued growth of multi-cohort genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and large-scale biobank projects has provided researchers with a wealth of GWAS summary statistics and individual-level data suitable for performing PRS analyses. However, as the size of these studies increase, the risk of inter-cohort sample overlap and close relatedness increases. Ideally sample overlap would be identified and removed directly, but this is typically not possible due to privacy laws or consent agreements. This sample overlap, whether known or not, is a major problem in PRS analyses because it can lead to inflation of type 1 error and, thus, erroneous conclusions in published work.\n\nResultsHere, for the first time, we report the scale of the sample overlap problem for PRS analyses by generating known sample overlap across sub-samples of the UK Biobank data, which we then use to produce GWAS and target data to mimic the effects of inter-cohort sample overlap. We demonstrate that inter-cohort overlap results in a significant and often substantial inflation in the observed PRS-trait association, coefficient of determination (R2) and false-positive rate. This inflation can be high even when the absolute number of overlapping individuals is small if this makes up a notable fraction of the target sample. We develop and introduce EraSOR (Erase Sample Overlap and Relatedness), a software for adjusting inflation in PRS prediction and association statistics in the presence of sample overlap or close relatedness between the GWAS and target samples. A key component of the EraSOR approach is inference of the degree of sample overlap from the intercept of a bivariate LD score regression applied to the GWAS and target data, making it powered in settings where both have sample sizes over 1,000 individuals. Through extensive benchmarking using UK Biobank and HapGen2 simulated genotype-phenotype data, we demonstrate that PRSs calculated using EraSOR-adjusted GWAS summary statistics are robust to inter-cohort overlap in a wide range of realistic scenarios and are even robust to high levels of residual genetic and environmental stratification.\n\nConclusionThe results of all PRS analyses for which sample overlap cannot be definitively ruled out should be considered with caution given high type 1 error observed in the presence of even low overlap between base and target cohorts. Given the strong performance of EraSOR in eliminating inflation caused by sample overlap in PRS studies with large (>5k) target samples, we recommend that EraSOR be used in all future such PRS studies to mitigate the potential effects of inter-cohort overlap and close relatedness.",

Here we report a novel acoustic camera system, USVCAM, which enables simpler and faster USV localization and assignment. The system comprises recently developed USV segmentation algorithms with a modification for overlapping vocalizations that results in high accuracy. Using USVCAM, we analyzed USV communications in a conventional home cage, and demonstrated novel vocal interactions in female ICR mice under a resident-intruder paradigm.

We hypothesized that repeated mTBI (rmTBI) would change the microstructure of cranial bones, without gross skull fractures. To address this, young adult female Piebald Viral Glaxo rats received sham, 1x, 2x or 3x closed-head mTBIs delivered at 24h intervals, using a weight-drop device custom built for reproducible impact. Skull bones were collected at 2 or 10 weeks after the final injury/sham procedure, imaged by micro computed tomography and analyzed at predetermined regions of interest. In the interparietal bone, proximal to the injury site, modest increases in bone thickness was observed at 2 weeks, particularly following 3x mTBI. By 10 weeks, 2x mTBI induced a robust increase in the volume and thickness of the interparietal bone, alongside a corresponding decrease in the volume of marrow cavities in the diploe region. In contrast, neither parietal nor frontal skull samples were affected by rmTBI. Our findings demonstrate time- and location-dependent effects of rmTBI on cranial bone structure, highlighting a need to consider microstructural alterations to cranial bone when assessing the consequences of rmTBI.",

From the viewpoint of machine learning, the learning system predicts the observation and updates the prediction based on prediction error, a process known as  predictive coding. Here, we modeled the population dynamics of T cells by adopting the concept of predictive coding; helper and regulatory T cells predict the antigen amount and excessive immune response, respectively. Their prediction error signals, possibly via cytokines, induce their differentiation to memory T cells. Through numerical simulations, we found that the immune system identifies antigen risks depending on the concentration and input rapidness of the antigen. Further, our model reproduced history-dependent discrimination, as in allergy onset and subsequent therapy. Together, this study provided a novel framework to improve our understanding of how the immune system adaptively learns the risks of diverse antigens.",

They are naturally occurring and by-products of anthropogenic activity. Sydney Harbour Estuary (Sydney, Australia), is heavily contaminated with PCDD/F. Analysis of sediment cores revealed that the contamination source in Homebush Bay continues to have one of the highest levels of PCDD/F contamination in the world (5207 pg WHO-TEQ g-1) with >50% of the toxicity attributed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) the most toxic and concerning of the PCDD/F congeners. Comparison of congener profiles at the contamination source with surrounding bays and historical data provided evidence for the attenuation of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and other congeners at the source. This finding was supported by the detection of di-, mono- and unchlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin. Microbial community analysis of sediments by 16S amplicon sequencing revealed an abundance of lineages from the class Dehalococcoidia (up to 15% of the community), including the genus Dehalobium (up to 0.5%). Anaerobic seawater enrichment cultures using perchloroethene as a more amenable growth substrate enriched only the Dehalobium population by more than six-fold. The enrichment culture then proved capable of reductively dechlorinating 2,3,7,8-TCDD to 2,3,7-TCDD and octachlorodibenzo-p-dibenzodioxin to hepta and hexa congeners. This work is the first to show microbial reductive dehalogenation of 2,3,7,8-TCDD with a bacterium from outside the Dehalococcoides genus, and one of only a few that demonstrates PCDD/F degradation in a marine environment.",

    "abstract": "During infection with dengue viruses (DENVs), the lipid landscape within host cells is significantly altered to assemble membrane platforms that support viral replication and particle assembly. Fatty acyl-CoAs are key intermediates in the biosynthesis of complex lipids that form these membranes. They also function as key signaling lipids in the cell. Here, we carried out loss of function studies on acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs), a family of enzymes that hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and coenzyme A, to understand their influence on the lifecycle of DENVs. Loss of function of the type I ACOTs 1 (cytoplasmic) and 2 (mitochondrial) together significantly increased DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) viral replication and infectious particle release. However, isolated knockdown of mitochondrial ACOT2 significantly decreased DENV2 protein translation, genome replication, and infectious virus release. Furthermore, loss of ACOT7 function, a mitochondrial type II ACOT, similarly suppressed DENV2. As ACOT1 and ACOT2 are splice variants, these data suggest that location (cytosol and mitochondria, respectively) rather than function of these proteins may account for the differences in DENV2 infection phenotype. Additionally, loss of mitochondrial ACOT2 and ACOT7 expression also altered the expression of several ACOTs located in multiple organelle compartments within the cell highlighting a complex relationship between ACOTs in the DENV2 virus lifecycle.",

Given the essential role of the microbiome in human gut health, analysis of microbiome changes associated with microscopic colitis could provide insights into the development of the disease.\n\nMETHODSWe enrolled patients who underwent colonoscopy for diarrhea. An experienced pathologist classified patients as having microscopic colitis (n=52) or controls (n=153). Research biopsies were taken from the ascending and descending colon, and the microbiome was characterized with Illumina sequencing. We analyzed the associations between microscopic colitis and microbiome with a series of increasingly complex models adjusted for a range of demographic and health factors.\n\nRESULTSWe found that alpha-diversity was significantly lower in microscopic colitis cases compared to controls in the descending colon microbiome. In the descending colon, a series of models that adjusted for an increasing number of co-variates found taxa significantly associated with microscopic colitis, including Proteobacteria that was enriched in cases and Collinsella enriched in controls. While the alpha-diversity and taxa were not significantly associated with microscopic colitis in the ascending colon microbiome, the inference p-values based on ascending and descending microbiomes were highly correlated.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur study demonstrates an altered microbiome in microscopic colitis cases compared to controls. Because both the cases and controls had diarrhea, we have identified candidate taxa that could be mechanistically responsible for the development of microscopic colitis independent of changes to the microbial community caused by diarrhea.\n\nSignificance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIMicroscopic colitis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea.

    "abstract": "Subterranean habitats are generally very stable environments, and as such evolutionary transitions of organisms from surface to subterranean lifestyles may cause considerable shifts in physiology, particularly with respect to thermal tolerance. In this study we compared responses to heat shock at the molecular level in a geographically widespread, surface-dwelling water beetle to a congeneric subterranean species restricted to a single aquifer (Dytiscidae: Hydroporinae). The obligate subterranean beetle Paroster macrosturtensis is known to have a lower thermal tolerance compared to surface lineages (CTmax 38{degrees}C cf. 42-46 {degrees}C), but the genetic basis of this physiological difference has not been characterized. We experimentally manipulated the thermal environment of 24 individuals to demonstrate that both species can mount a heat shock response at high temperatures (35{degrees}C), as determined by comparative transcriptomics. However, genes involved in these responses differ between species and a far greater number were differentially expressed in the surface taxon, suggesting it can mount a more robust heat shock response; these data may underpin its higher thermal tolerance compared to subterranean relatives. In contrast, the subterranean species examined not only differentially expressed fewer genes in response to increasing temperatures, but also in the presence of the experimental setup employed here alone. Our results suggest P. macrosturtensis may be comparatively poorly equipped to respond to both thermally induced stress and environmental disturbances more broadly. The molecular findings presented here have conservation implications for P. macrosturtensis and contribute to a growing narrative concerning weakened thermal tolerances in obligate subterranean organisms at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "The regulation mechanism of small-for-size syndrome remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to analyze the molecular profiles following extended hepatectomy and identify the therapeutic target. Major hepatectomy and extended hepatectomy were performed in the rat model, and the remnant livers were obtained dynamically for the high-throughput transcriptome analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to explore the expression patterns of DEGs. As result, WGCNA identified 10 distinct gene co-expression modules according to the correlation between module eigengene and different postoperative time-points. The magenta module (gene count: 289) and the lightcyan module (gene count: 484) were found positively correlated with major hepatectomy instead of extended hepatectomy. In the lightcyan module, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) was selected and found the down-regulation in the remnant liver following extended (marginal) hepatectomy in rats and humans. Besides, administration of PPAR agonist attenuated hepatic inflammation injury while PPAR antagonist increased liver inflammation injury after extended hepatectomy in rats, marked by the significantly changed aminotransferases, tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-6 levels in the plasm, and histological Suzuki criteria. Consequently, DEGs and their molecular profiles after extended hepatectomy were identified, and PPAR might be a potential therapy target for small-for-size syndrome.",

    "abstract": "DNA nanostructures are one of potential candidates for drug carriers due to their good biocompatibility and non-specificity in vivo. A reliable prediction about mechanical properties of artificial DNA structures is desirable to improve the efficiency of DNA drug carriers, however there is only a handful of information on mechanical functionalities of DNA nanotubes (DNTs). This paper focuses on quantifying the multiscale correlations among DNT deformation, packaging conditions and surrounding factors to tune mechanical properties of DNTs. By combining WLC statistical mechanics model, Parsegians mesoscopic liquid crystal model and Eulers continuum beam theory, we developed a multiscale DNA-frame model; then theoretically characterize the initial packed states of DNTs for the first time, and reveal the diversity mechanism in mechanical properties of DNTs induced by interchain interactions and initial packed states. Moreover, the study of parameters, such as packaging conditions and environmental factors, provides a potential control strategy for tuning mechanical properties of DNTs. These conclusions provide a theoretical basis for accurately controlling the property and deformation of DNT in various DNT dynamic devices, such as DNA nanocarriers.",

    "abstract": "Misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is associated with the development of fatal neurodegenerative diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Metal ions appear to play a crucial role in the protein misfolding, and metal imbalance may be part of TSE pathologies. PrPC is a combined Cu(II) and Zn(II) metal binding protein, where the main metal binding site is located in the octarepeat (OR) region. Here, we used biophysical methods to characterize Cu(II) and Zn(II) binding to the isolated OR region. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy data suggest that the OR domain binds up to four Cu(II) ions or two Zn(II) ions. Upon metal binding, the OR region seems to adopt a transient antiparallel {beta}-sheet hairpin structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy data indicates that under neutral conditions, the OR region can bind both Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, whereas under acidic conditions it binds only Cu(II) ions. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that binding of both metal ions to the OR region results in formation of {beta}-hairpin structures. As formation of {beta}-sheet structures is a first step towards amyloid formation, we propose that high concentrations of either Cu(II) or Zn(II) ions may have a pro-amyloid effect in TSEs.",

    "abstract": "Animal genomes are folded into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) by CTCF and cohesin, but whether these loops are stable or dynamic is unknown. Here, we directly visualize chromatin looping at the Fbn2 TAD in mouse embryonic stem cells using super-resolution live-cell imaging and quantify looping dynamics by Bayesian inference. Our results are consistent with cohesin-mediated loop extrusion in cells, and with CTCF both stopping and stabilizing cohesin. Surprisingly, the Fbn2 loop is both rare and dynamic, with a looped fraction of ~3-6.5% and a median loop lifetime of ~10-30 minutes. Instead of a stable loop, our results establish a highly dynamic view of TADs and loops where the Fbn2 TAD exists predominantly in a partially extruded conformation. This dynamic and quantitative view of TADs may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their functions.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic materials are integral components of consumable and durable goods and are indispensable in the modern world. Polyesters are the most versatile bulk- and specialty-polymers but their production is not sustainable and their fate at end-of-life is of great concern. Bioplastics are highly regarded alternatives but often fall behind conventional synthetic plastics due to shortcomings in material properties and commercial competitiveness. This has limited the success of sustainable replacements at global market scale. Enabling production of bioplastics with superior properties from waste-derived feedstocks could change that. To this end, we created a synthetic entry into the metabolic pathway of bio-polyester synthesis of Cupriavidus necator H16 by means of heterologous hydroxyacyl-CoA transferase and mutant PHA synthase. The resulting microbial cell factories produced a range of aliphatic and aromatic biopolyesters and enabled co-polymerization of a range of hydroxy carboxylates, including a hydroxyphenylic and a hydroxyfuranoic acid, for the first time incorporating aromatic rings in the backbone of biological polyesters. These diverse polymers were then characterized in terms of their physical properties. The resulting polymers were structurally analogous to synthetic polyesters like PET, PEF and other polyarylates. In a further advance, the transgenic strain was cultivated in a bio-electrochemical system under autotrophic conditions, enabling synthesis of aromatic bio-polyesters from in-situ generated O2, while assimilating CO2. Follow-up elementary flux-mode analysis established the feasibility of de novo production of twenty different polyesters from five different carbon- and energy-sources. This comprehensive study opens the door to sustainable bio-production of various high-performance thermoplastics and thermosets.\n\nSignificance statementBiomaterials can facilitate the transition of chemical industry to a carbon-neutral and circular economy and prevent the accumulation of greenhouse gases and plastic waste in the natural environment by developing bio-replacements for existing fossil carbon-based plastics along with end-of-life strategies. Accomplished via the genetic engineering of a microbial cell factory that assimilates carbon dioxide, this work demonstrates the first biocatalytic polymerization of aromatic building blocks and their incorporation into the backbone of a bio-polyester. Employing a bio-electrochemical system for cultivation of the microbes, oxyhydrogen is formed and consumed in-situ, thus avoiding explosive gasmixtures. The obtained aromatic polyesters are structural analogs to synthetic bulk- and high-performance polymers such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PEF (polyethylene furanoate).\n\nHighlights- First demonstration of bio-polyarylates - microbial polyesters with aromatic rings in the backbone\n- Production of novel PHAs from CO2 and H2+O2 achieved in-situ in a bio-electrochemical system\n- Expression-level of PHA synthase and molecular weight of polyesters is inversely correlated\n- In silico design and pathway analysis of bio-polyesters from low-cost carbon-feedstocks",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe development of personalized neoantigen-based therapeutic cancer vaccines relies on computational algorithm-based pipelines. One of the critical issues in the pipeline is obtaining higher positive predictive value (PPV) performance, i.e., how many are immunogenic when selecting the top 5 to 20 candidate neoepitopes for the vaccination. We attempted to test the PPV of a neoepitope prediction algorithm Neopepsee.\n\nMethodsSix breast cancer patients and patient-derived xenografts from three lung cancer patients and their paired peripheral blood samples were subjected to whole-exome and RNA sequencing. Neoantigen was predicted using two different algorithms (Neopepsee and pVACseq). Response of induced memory T cells to neopeptide candidates was evaluated by IFN-{gamma} Enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) assays of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from three HLA-matched donors. Positive ELISpot response to a candidate peptide in at least 2 of 3 donor PBMC was regarded as an immunogenic response.\n\nResultsNeopepsee predicted 159 HLA-A matched neoepitope candidates out of 898 somatic mutations in nine patients (six breast and three lung cancer patients), whereas pVACseq predicted 84 HLA-A matched candidates. A total of 26 neopeptide candidates overlapped between the two predicted candidate pools. Among the candidates, 28 (20%, 28/ 137) and 15 (20%, 15/ 75) were positive by ELISpot assay, respectively. Among 26 overlapped candidates, 20 could be tested, and 7 of them (35%) were validated by ELISpot. Neopepsee identified at least one neoepitope in 7 of 9 patients (range 0-6), compared to 6 by pVACseq (range 0-5).\n\nConclusionAs suggested by Tumor Neoantigen Selection Alliance (TESLA), our results demonstrate low PPV of individual prediction models as well as the complementary nature of the Neopepsee and pVACseq and may help design neoepitope targeted cancer vaccines. Our data contribute a significant addition to the database of tested neoepitope candidates that can be utilized to further train and improve the prediction algorithms.",

    "abstract": "T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells are key drivers of antibodies that protect from malaria. However, little is known regarding the host and parasite factors that influence Tfh and functional antibody development. Here, we use samples from a large cross-sectional study of children residing in an area of high malaria transmission in Uganda to characterize Tfh cells and functional antibodies to multiple parasites stages. We identify a dramatic re-distribution of the Tfh cell compartment with age that is independent of malaria exposure, with Th2-Tfh cells predominating in early childhood, while Th1-Tfh cell gradually increase to adult levels over the first decade of life. Functional antibody acquisition is age-dependent and hierarchical acquired based on parasite stage, with merozoite responses followed by sporozoite and gametocyte antibodies. Antibodies were boosted in children with current infection, and were higher in females. The children with the very highest antibody levels had increased Tfh cell activation and proliferation, consistent with a key role of Tfh cells in antibody development. Together, these data reveal a complex relationship between the circulating Tfh compartment, antibody development and protection from malaria.",

    "abstract": "The regulation and production of secondary metabolites during biofilm growth of Burkholderia spp. is not well understood. To learn more about the crucial role and regulatory control of cryptic molecules produced during biofilm growth, we disrupted c-di-GMP signaling in Burkholderia pseudomallei, a soil-borne bacterial saprophyte and the etiologic agent of melioidosis. Our approach to these studies combined transcriptional profiling with genetic deletions that targeted key c-di-GMP regulatory components to characterize responses to changes in temperature. Mutational analyses and conditional expression studies of c-di-GMP genes demonstrates their contribution to phenotypes such as biofilm formation, colony morphology, motility, and expression of secondary metabolite biosynthesis when grown as a biofilm at different temperatures. RNA-seq analysis was performed at varying temperatures in a {Delta}II2523 mutant background that is responsive to temperature alterations resulting in hypo- and hyper-biofilm forming phenotypes. Differential regulation of genes was observed for polysaccharide biosynthesis, secretion systems, and nonribosomal peptide and polyketide synthase (NRPS/PKS) clusters in response to temperature changes. Deletion mutations of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) clusters 2, 11, 14 (syrbactin), and 15 (malleipeptin) in wild-type and {Delta}II2523 backgrounds also reveals the contribution of these BGCs to biofilm formation and colony morphology in addition to inhibition of Bacillus subtilis and Rhizoctonia solani. Our findings suggest that II2523 impacts the regulation of genes that contribute to biofilm formation and competition.\n\nCharacterization of cryptic BGCs under differing environmental conditions will allow for a better understanding of the role of secondary metabolites in the context of biofilm formation and microbe-microbe interactions.\n\nImportanceBurkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacterium residing in the environment that switches to a pathogenic lifestyle during infection of a wide range of hosts. The environmental cues that serve as the stimulus to trigger this change are largely unknown. However, it is well established that the cellular level of c-di-GMP, a secondary signal messenger, controls the switch from growth as planktonic cells to growth as a biofilm. Disrupting the signaling mediated by c-di-GMP allows for a better understanding of the regulation and the contribution of the surface associated and secreted molecules that contribute to the various lifestyles of this organism. The genome of B. pseudomallei also encodes cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters predicted to encode small molecules that potentially contribute to growth as a biofilm, adaptation, and interactions with other organisms. A better understanding of the regulation of these molecules is crucial to understanding how this versatile pathogen alters its lifestyle.",

In Bacillus subtilis, loss of all Class A Penicillin-Binding Proteins (aPBPs) which function in peptidoglycan synthesis is conditionally lethal. Here we show that this lethality is associated with an alteration of the lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and the accumulation of the major autolysin LytE in the cell wall. Our analysis provides further evidence that the length and abundance of LTA acts to regulate the cellular level and activity of autolytic enzymes, specifically LytE. Importantly, we identify a novel function for the aminoacyl-phosphatidylglycerol synthase MprF in the modulation of LTA biosynthesis in B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. This finding has implications for our understanding of antimicrobial resistance (particularly daptomycin) in clinically relevant bacteria and the involvement of MprF in the virulence of pathogens, such as methicillin resistant S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "An approach relying on nano-cavity confinement is developed in this paper for the sizing of nanoscale particles and single biomolecules in solution. The approach, termed nano-cavity diffusional sizing (NDS), measures particle residence times within fluidic nano-cavities to determine their hydrodynamic radii. Using theoretical modeling and simulation, we show that the residence time of particles within nano-cavities above a critical timescale depends on the diffusion coefficient of the particle, which allows estimation of the particles size. We demonstrate this approach experimentally through measurement of particle residence times within nano-fluidic cavities using single-molecule confocal microscopy. Our data show that the residence times scale linearly with the sizes of nanoscale colloids, protein aggregates and single DNA oligonucleotides. NDS thus constitutes a new single molecule optofluidic approach that allows rapid and quantitative sizing of nanoscale particles for potential application in nanobiotechnology, biophysics, and clinical diagnostics.\n\nTable of content graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472369v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15abf7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2180dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1290f57org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ae2087_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We find no association between R-genes with seed weight, oil or protein content, and we find no correlation between yield and the number of RLK, RLP genes, or the total number of genes. These results suggest that recent yield improvement in soybean may be partially associated with the selective loss of NLR genes. Three quarters of soybean NLR genes do not show presence/absence variation, limiting the ability to select for their absence, and so the deletion or disabling of select NLR genes may support future yield improvement.",

If it is clear that this task falls to the immune cells, recent work shows that neurons can also detect microbes, although the molecules and mechanisms involved are less characterized. In Drosophila, detection of bacteria-derived peptidoglycan by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) of the PGRP family expressed in immune cells, triggers NF-{kappa}B/IMD dependent signaling. We show here that one PGRP protein, called PGRP-LB, is expressed in some probosciss bitter taste neurons. In vivo calcium imaging reveals that the PGRP/IMD pathway is cell-autonomously required in these neurons to transduce the PGN signal. We finally show that NF-{kappa}B/IMD pathway activation in bitter neurons influences fly behavior. This demonstrates that flies use the same bacterial elicitor and signaling module to sense bacterial presence via the peripheral nervous system and trigger an anti-bacterial response in immune-competent cells.",

These studies must account for the molecular and functional diversity among astrocytes in different regions of the brain and spinal cord. It is essential that the most pathologically-relevant astrocyte preparations are used when investigating non-cell autonomous mechanisms of either upper or lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS. In this context, the main aim of this study was to establish conditions enabling rapid and robust generation of physiologically-relevant ventral spinal cord-like astrocytes that would provide an enhanced experimental model for the study of lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Neural progenitor cells with validated caudal and ventral features were derived from human iPSCs and differentiated into astrocytes, which were then characterized by examining morphology, markers of ventral spinal cord astrocytes, spontaneous and induced calcium transients, and astrogliosis markers. Efficient and streamlined generation of human iPSC-derived astrocytes with molecular and biological properties similar to physiological astrocytes in the ventral spinal cord was achieved. These induced astrocytes express markers of mature ventral spinal cord astrocytes, exhibit spontaneous and ATP-induced calcium transients, and lack signs of overt activation. Human iPSC- derived astrocytes with ventral spinal features offer advantages over more generic astrocyte preparations for the study of both ventral spinal cord astrocyte biology and the involvement of astrocytes in mechanisms of lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii) is a fungal pathogen that once caused an outbreak of cryptococcosis on Vancouver Island, and had spread worldwide, while few data were available in China. In this study, seven clinical isolates of C. gattii VGII were collected from 19 hospitals, Multi-locus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed, and combined with published data for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing, phenotypic analysis, and in vivo virulence studies were performed, subsequently, histopathological analysis of lung tissue was performed. C.gattii VGII infected patients were mainly immunocompetent male, and most of them had symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. MLST results showed that isolates from china exhibited high genetic diversity, and sequence type (ST) 7 was the major ST among the isolates. Some clinical isolates showed a close phylogenetic relationship with strains from Australia and South America. All clinical isolates did not show resistance to antifungal drugs. In addition, there was no correlation between virulence factors (temperature, melanin production, and capsule size) and virulence while in vivo experiments showed significant differences in virulence among strains. Lung fungal burden and damage to lung tissue correlated with virulence, and degree of damage to lung tissue in mice may highlight differences in virulence. Our work seeks to provide useful data for molecular epidemiology, antifungal susceptibility, and virulence differences of C. gattii VGII in China.\n\nAuthor SummaryCryptococcus gattii is one of the life-threatening fungal pathogens that can infect immunocompetent individuals. C.gattii can be invaded through the respiratory tract and can be spread to the brain, causing meningoencephalitis and even death. In 1999, an outbreak of C. gattii VGII occurred on Vancouver Island in Canada and spread in the Pacific Northwest region, which attracted more attention. Compared with other nations, the data of C gattii VGII in China was limited. To better understand the molecular epidemiology and microbiological characteristics of C.gattii VGII isolates from China, Bioinformatics analysis and in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed for clinical strains. Multi-locus Sequence Typing and whole-genome sequencing reveal the genetic diversity of the isolates and genetic relationships with isolates from other countries. We also investigated the antifungal drug susceptibility and virulence differences of the isolates. The authors expect that our work can provide useful data for the prevention and control of C. gattii VGII in China and to draw attention to C. gattii.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus that can undergo both productive and latent infection in neurons. ICP0 is an HSV-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase crucial for productive infection and reactivation from latency. However, its targets have not been systematically investigated in neuronal cells. After confirming the importance of ICP0 in HSV-1 neuronal replication using an ICP0-null virus, we identified many ICP0-interacting proteins in infected neuronal and non-neuronal cells by mass-spectrometry-based interactome analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays validated ICP0 interactions with ACOT8, C1QBP, OTUD4, SNX9 and VIM in both Neuro-2a and 293T cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that SNX9 restricted replication of the ICP0-null but not wild-type virus in Neuro-2a cells. Ubiquitinome analysis by immunoprecipitating the trypsin digested ubiquitin reminant followed by mass spectrometry identified numerous candidate ubiquitination substrates of ICP0 in infected Neuro-2a cells, among which OTUD4 and VIM were novel substrates confirmed to be ubiquitinated by transfected ICP0 in Neuro-2a cells despite no evidence of their degradation by ICP0. Expression of OTUD4 was induced independently of ICP0 during HSV-1 infection. Overexpressed OTUD4 enhanced type I interferon expression during infection with the ICP0-null but not wild-type virus. In summary, by combining two proteomic approaches followed by confirmatory and functional experiments, we identified and validated multiple novel targets of ICP0 in neuronal cells, and revealed potential restrictive activities of SNX9 and OTUD4 as well as ICP0-dependent antagonism of these activities.\n\nAuthor SummaryHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes latent infection in neurons. ICP0 is known for its critical role in antagonizing cellular restrictive functions thereby initiating productive infection. It has been demonstrated to be important for both acute infection and reactivation from latency in neurons. However, little is known about its targets in neuronal cells. Here we combined two proteomic approaches, interactome and ubiquitinome analyses, to integratively identify interaction partners and substrates of ICP0 in HSV-1 infected neuronal cells. The results identified many novel targets as well as confirming previously reported ones. We also further validated some of the binding interactions and ubiquitin modifications. Functional studies revealed that the ICP0-interacting protein SNX9 restricted HSV-1 replication and the ICP0 substrate OTUD4 was induced to enhance type I interferon expression during HSV-1 neuronal infection. Moreover, the activities of these proteins appeared to be antagonized by ICP0-dependent mechanisms. This study provided comprehensive insight into ICP0 targets in neuronal cells and might prompt further investigation into the newly identified targets of ICP0.",

    "abstract": "New antibiotics are needed against multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens that have compromised global health systems. Antimicrobial peptides are generally considered promising lead candidates for the next generation of antibiotics but have not fulfilled this expectation. Here we demonstrate activity of a cationic amphipathic undecapeptide (ChIP; Charge change Independent Peptide) against a wide panel of multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Importantly, the antimicrobial activity of ChIP is independent of the surface charge changes that confer colistin resistance through modification of Lipid A, while decreased activity of ChIP correlates with GlcN1 tri-acylation of Lipid A. In an in vivo peritonitis mouse model ChIP displays excellent activity against both colistin sensitive and resistant Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii strains.\n\nAuthor SummaryAntimicrobial peptides hold promise as novel treatment options for diseases caused by multidrug resistant bacteria. Here we present evidence that the ChIP peptide, comprised of 11 D-amino acids, is active against a variety of Gram-negative bacteria that ranks high on the WHO list of critically important pathogens. ChIP initially interacts with the Gram-negative outer membrane, independent of its surface charge, followed by entry into the periplasm and permeabilization of the inner membrane, leading to bacterial cell death. Detailed analyses of the outer membrane indicate that the acylation pattern of lipopolysaccharides plays an important role for ChIP activity. In a mouse infection model, ChIP display excellent activity in reducing bacterial numbers for both Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Importantly, ChIP is highly efficient against bacteria resistant to colistin, an antibiotic normally considered as a last resort treatment of infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Mating type (MAT) loci are the most important and significant regulators of sexual reproduction and development in ascomycetous fungi. Usually, they encode two transcription factors (TFs), named MAT1-1-1 or MAT1-2-1. Mating-type strains carry only one of the two TF genes, which control expression of pheromone and pheromone receptor genes, involved in the cell-cell recognition process. The present work presents the crystallization for the alpha1 (1) domain of MAT1-1-1 from the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (AfMAT1-1-1). Crystals were obtained for the complex between a polypeptide containing the 1 domain and DNA carrying the AfMAT1-1-1 recognition sequence. A streak seeding technique was applied to improve native crystal quality, resulting in diffraction data to 3.2 [A] resolution. Further, highly redundant data sets were collected from the crystals of selenomethionine-substituted AfMAT1-1-1 with a maximum resolution of 3.2 [A]. This is the first report of structural studies on the 1 domain MAT regulator involved in the mating of ascomycetes.\n\nSynopsisAn optimized purification and crystallization protocol together with initial X-ray datasets are described for this mating type transcription factor from human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.",

Lebanese rivers that lead to the Mediterranean Sea were sampled at estuaries sites, under high anthropogenic pressure, in spring 2017 and winter 2018 to study seasonal variation of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Methods: A combined approach using culture techniques and high throughput qPCR identified hotspots for antimicrobial resistance and anthropogenic pressure in particular locations along the Lebanese coast. Results: Multi-resistant Gram-negative (Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas spp) and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens were isolated. A high abundance of certain ARGs (vanB, blaBIC-1, blaGES, tetM, and mcr-1) was detected in 5 Lebanese estuaries. The relative abundance of ARGs was highest in winter and areas with high anthropogenic activities and population growth with an influx of refugees. Conclusion: Qualitative analysis of ARB and the analysis of the Lebanese estuaries resistome revealed critical levels of contamination with pathogenic bacteria and provided significant information about the spread of ARGs in anthropogenically impacted estuaries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) represent an alarming threat as they show altered biological behavior and may escape vaccination effectiveness. Some exhibit increased pathogenicity and transmissibility compared to the original wild type WUHAN (Hu-1). Broad-spectrum antivirals could complement and further enhance preventive benefits achieved through SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns\n\nMethodsThe anti-coronavirus activity of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce(R) extract, EF) against (i) VOCs B1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351.1 (beta), P.1 (gamma), B1.617.2 (delta), AV.1 (Scottish) and B1.525 (eta), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-pseudotyped viral particles and reference strain OC43 as well as (iii) wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (Hu-1) were analyzed. Molecular dynamics (MD) were applied to study interaction of Echinaceas phytochemical markers with known pharmacological viral and host cell targets.\n\nResultsEF extract broadly inhibited propagation of all investigated SARS-CoV-2 VOCs as well as entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles at EC50s ranging from 3.62 to 12.03 {micro}g/ml. Preventive addition of 20 {micro}g/ml EF to epithelial cells significantly reduced sequential infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Hu-1) as well as with the common human strain OC43. MD analyses showed constant binding affinities to Hu-1, B1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B1.617.2-typic S protein variants for alkylamides, caftaric acidand feruoyl-tartaric acid in EF extract. They further indicated that the EF extract could possibly interact with TMPRSS-2, a serine protease required for virus endocytosis.\n\nConclusionsEF extract demonstrated stable antiviral activity across 6 tested VOCs, which is likely due to the constant affinity of the contained phytochemical marker substances to all spike variants. A possible interaction of EF with TMPRSS-2 partially would explain cell protective benefits of the extract by inhibition of endocytosis. EF may therefore offer a supportive addition to vaccination endeavors in the control of existing and future SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations.",

The other model proposes that the two proteins function separately. Studying the C. elegans Regnase-1 ortholog, REGE-1, we have uncovered a functional relationship between REGE-1 and the nematode counterpart of Roquin-1, RLE-1. While REGE-1 and RLE-1 associate with mRNA independently of each other, both proteins are essential for mRNA silencing.

Besides, many viruses can employ the nucleolus or nucleolar proteins to promote different steps of their life cycle such as replication, transcription and assembly. While adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) capsids have previously been reported to enter the host cell nucleus and accumulate in the nucleolus, both the role of the nucleolus in AAV2 infection, and the viral uncoating mechanism remain elusive. In all prior studies on AAV uncoating, viral capsids and viral genomes were not directly correlated on the single cell level, at least not in absence of a helper virus. To elucidate the properties of the nucleolus during AAV2 infection and to assess viral uncoating on a single cell level, we combined immunofluorescence analysis for detection of intact AAV2 capsids and capsid proteins with fluorescence in situ hybridization for detection of AAV2 genomes. The results of our experiments provide evidence that uncoating of AAV2 particles occurs in a stepwise process that is completed in the nucleolus and supported by alteration of the nucleolar structure.\n\nAuthor SummaryAdeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids have been reported to enter the host cell nucleus and accumulate in the nucleolus.

    "abstract": "Base editors (BEs) have opened new avenues for the treatment of genetic diseases. However, advances in delivery approaches are needed to enable disease targeting of a broad range of tissues and cell types. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors remain one of the most promising delivery vehicles for gene therapies. Currently, most BE/guide combinations and their promoters exceed the packaging limit (~5 kb) of AAVs. Dual-AAV delivery strategies often require high viral doses that impose safety concerns. In this study, we engineered an adenine base editor using a compact Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis (Nme2Cas9). Compared to the well-characterized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9-containing ABEs, Nme2-ABE possesses a distinct PAM (N4CC) and editing window, exhibits fewer off-target effects, and can efficiently install therapeutically relevant mutations in both human and mouse genomes. Importantly, we show that in vivo delivery of Nme2-ABE and its guide RNA by a single-AAV vector can efficiently edit mouse genomic loci and revert the disease mutation and phenotype in an adult mouse model of tyrosinemia. We anticipate that Nme2-ABE, by virtue of its compact size and broad targeting range, will enable a range of therapeutic applications with improved safety and efficacy due in part to packaging in a single-vector system.",

In this study, we investigated whether pre-treatment of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with NB-O3 can enhance specific immune responses and improve efficacy of immersion vaccination against Streptococcus agalactiae. Spleen and head kidney of fish in the vaccinated groups showed a substantial upregulation in expression levels of three immunoglobulin classes(IgM, IgD, and IgT) compared with the unvaccinated control groups. At day 21 post-immunization, the relative expression was greatest (approx. 3.2 to 4.1 folds). Both systemic and mucosal IgM antibodies were elicited in vaccinated groups. As the result, the cumulative survival rate of the vaccinated groups was found to be higher than that of the unvaccinated groups, with a relative percent survival (RPS) ranging from 52.9-70.5%. However, fish in the vaccinated groups that received pre-treatment with NB-O3, bacterial antigen uptakes, expression levels of IgM, IgD, and IgT, as well as the specific-IgM antibody levels and percent survival, were all slightly or significantly higher than that of the vaccinated group without pre-treatment with NB-O3.

Targeted sequencing identified a SIRT6 allele containing two linked substitutions (N308K/A313S) as enriched in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) centenarians as compared to AJ control individuals. Characterization of this SIRT6 (centSIRT6) allele demonstrated it to be a stronger suppressor of LINE1 retrotransposons, confer enhanced stimulation of DNA double strand break repair, and more robust cancer cell killing compared to the wild type. Surprisingly, centSIRT6 displayed weaker deacetylase activity, but stronger mADPr activity, over a range of NAD+ concentrations and substrates. Additionally, centSIRT6 displayed a stronger interaction with Lamin A/C (LMNA), which correlated with enhanced ribosylation of LMNA. Our results suggest that enhanced SIRT6 function contributes to human longevity by improving genome maintenance via increased mADPr activity and enhanced interaction with LMNA.",

    "abstract": "Myofibrils are long intracellular cables specific to muscles, composed mainly of actin and myosin filaments. The actin and myosin filaments are organized into repeated units called sarcomeres, which form the myofibril cables. Muscle contraction is achieved by the simultaneous shortening of sarcomeres and for a highly coordinated contraction to occur all sarcomeres should have the same size. Muscles have evolved a variety of ways to ensure sarcomere homogeneity, one example being the controlled oligomerization of Zasp proteins that sets the diameter of the myofibril. To understand how Zasp proteins effect myofibril growth, we looked for Zasp-binding proteins at the Z-disc. We found that the E1 subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is recruited to the Z-disc by Zasp52 and is required to sustain myofibril growth. By making specific mutants, we show that its enzymatic activity is important for myofibril growth, and that the other two subunits of the complex are also required for myofibril formation. Using super resolution microscopy, we revealed the overall organization of the complex at the Z-disc. Then, using metabolomic analysis, we uncovered an amino acid balance defect affecting protein synthesis, that we also confirmed by genetic tools. In summary, we show that Zasp controls the local amino acid pool responsible for myofibril growth by recruiting the OGDH complex to the Z-disc.",

    "abstract": "The myoepithelial cell compartment of the murine postnatal mammary gland is generated from basal cap cells in the terminal end bud and maintained by self-renewal. Transdifferentiation to the luminal lineage does not normally occur but can be induced by DNA damage, luminal cell death or transplantation into a recipient mammary fat pad. Myoepithelial cells cultivated in vitro can also transdifferentiate towards the luminal lineage. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms and gene regulatory networks underlying this plasticity. Using a transgenic mouse (Tg11.5kb-GFP) that marks cap cells with GFP, we discovered that mature myoepithelial cells placed in culture begin to express GFP within [~]24 hrs and later express the Keratin 8 (K8) luminal marker. Cell tracking showed that most K8+ cells arose from GFP+ cells, suggesting that myoepithelial cells de-differentiate towards a progenitor state before changing lineage. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing pure GFP+ cap cells with mature myoepithelial cells, identified multiple transcription factors that iRegulon predicted might regulate the myoepithelial to cap cell transition. Knockout of one of these genes, Regulatory Factor 3 (Rfx3), significantly reduced the population of GFP+ cells and increased differentiation to the K8+ luminal lineage. Rfx3 knockout also reduced mammosphere growth and mammary gland regeneration efficiency in a transplantation assay, but had no effect on proliferation in vitro. Together, these data support a key role for Rfx3 in the stabilization of the mammary basal cell lineages.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been associated with two distinct motor disorders, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (CMT) and centronuclear myopathy (CNM). The majority of these mutations are clustered in the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) which engage in intramolecular interactions that suppress dynamin self-assembly and GTPase activation. CNM mutations in the PHD interferes with these intramolecular interactions, thereby blocking the formation of the auto-inhibited state. CMT mutations are located primarily on the opposite surface of the PHD, which is specialized for lipid PIP2 binding. It has been speculated that the distinct locations and interactions of residues mutated in CMT and CNM explain why each set of mutations cause either one disease or the other, despite their close proximity within the PHD sequence. We show that at least one CMT-causing mutant, lacking residues 555DEE557 ({Delta}DEE), displays this inability to undergo auto-inhibition as observed in CNM-linked mutants. This {Delta}DEE deletion mutant induces the formation of abnormally large cytoplasmic inclusions similar to those observed for CNM-linked mutant R369W. We also found substantially reduced migration from the membrane of the {Delta}DEE deletion mutant. These findings call into question the molecular mechanism currently believed to underlie the absence of pathogenic overlap between DNM2-dependent CMT and CNM.",

    "abstract": "Cellular systems are known to exhibit some of the fastest movements in biology - but little is known as to how single cells can dissipate this energy rapidly and adapt to such large accelerations without disrupting internal architecture. To address this, we investigate Spirostomum ambiguum - a giant cell (1-4 mm in length) well-known to exhibit ultrafast contractions (50% of body length) within 5 msec with a peak acceleration of 15g. Utilizing transmitted electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal imaging, we discover a novel association of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and vacuoles throughout the cell - forming a contiguous fenestrated membrane architecture that topologically entangles these two organelles. A nearly uniform inter-organelle spacing of 60 nm is observed between RER and vacuoles, closely packing the entire cell. Inspired by the entangled organelle structure, we study the mechanical properties of entangled deformable particles using a vertex-based model, with all simulation parameters matching 10 dimensionless numbers to ensure dynamic similarity. We demonstrate how entangled deformable particles respond to external loads by an increased viscosity against squeezing and help preserve spatial relationships. Because this enhanced damping arises from the entanglement of two networks incurring a strain-induced jamming transition at subcritical volume fractions, which is demonstrated through the spatial correlation of velocity direction, we term this phenomenon \"topological damping\". Our findings suggest a new mechanical role of RER-vacuolar meshwork as a metamaterial capable of damping an ultra-fast contraction event.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how single-cell organisms with extreme motility can decelerate or dissipate energy, as they lack connective tissues. Our study discovered a novel entangled rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)-vacuolar meshwork architecture in Spirostomum ambiguum, an ultrafast giant cell that can contract itself with 15g accelerations. We demonstrate through an entangled deformable particle model that the entangled architecture increases the squeeze-flow viscosity of particle systems and helps dampen the motion, a phenomenon we called \"topological damping\". For biologists, our study suggests the mechanical role of RER through topological constraints on nearby organelles. For physicists, we point out a new way to create a system with strain-induced jamming. For engineers, we present a novel architecture that can provide braking functions.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination has been deeply characterized in a few model species only, notably in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, most members of the ZMM pathway that implements meiotic crossover interference in S. cerevisiae have been lost in Lachancea yeast species after the divergence of Lachancea kluyveri from the rest of the clade. This suggests major differences in the control of crossover distribution. After investigating meiosis in L. kluyveri, we determined the meiotic recombination landscape of Lachancea waltii and identified several characteristics that should help understand better the underlying mechanisms. Such characteristics include systematic regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in L. waltii hybrids, compatible with dysregulated Spo11-mediated DNA double strand breaks (DSB) independently of meiosis. They include a higher recombination rate in L. waltii than in L. kluyveri despite the lack of multiple ZMM pro-crossover factors. L. waltii exhibits an elevated frequency of zero-crossover bivalents as L. kluyveri but opposite to S. cerevisiae. L. waltii gene conversion tracts lengths are comparable to those observed in S. cerevisiae and shorter than in L. kluyveri despite the lack of Mlh2, a factor limiting conversion tracts size in S. cerevisiae. L. waltii recombination hotspots are not shared with either S. cerevisiae or L. kluyveri, showing that meiotic recombination hotspots can evolve at a rather limited evolutionary scale within budding yeasts. Finally, in line with the loss of several ZMM genes, we found only residual crossover interference in L. waltii likely coming from the modest interference existing between recombination precursors.\n\nSignificance statementStudying non-model species is relevant to understand better biological processes by shedding light on their evolutionary variations. Here we chose the non-model budding yeast Lachancea waltii to study meiotic recombination. In sexually reproducing organisms, meiotic recombination shuffles parental genetic combinations notably by crossovers that cluster in hotspots at the population level. We found remarkable variations compared to both the canonical Saccharomyces cerevisiae model and another close relative Lachancea kluyveri. Such variations notably include the loss in L. waltii of a layer of regulation of crossover distribution that is otherwise conserved in budding yeasts and mammals. They also include the lack of conservation of crossover hotspots across the Lachancea species while crossover hotspots are remarkably stable across the Saccharomyces species.\n\nHighlights- Extensive LOH events in L. waltii intraspecific hybrids\n- No conservation of the recombination hotspots across the Lachancea genus\n- Reduced but not suppressed crossover interference in the absence of the ZMM pathway\n- Similar gene conversion tract lengths in L. waltii, S. cerevisiae, and L. kluyveri despite the lack of MLH2 in L. waltii",

    "abstract": "Hypertranscription facilitates biosynthetically demanding cellular state transitions through global upregulation of the nascent transcriptome. Despite its potential widespread relevance, documented examples of hypertranscription remain few and limited predominantly to early development. This limitation is in large part due to the fact that modern sequencing approaches, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), generally assume similar levels of transcriptional output per cell. Here, we use molecule counting and spike-in normalization to develop absolute scaling of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Absolute scaling enables an estimation of total transcript abundances per cell, which we validate in embryonic stem cell (ESC) and germline data and apply to adult mouse organs at steady-state or during regeneration. The results reveal a remarkable dynamic range in transcriptional output among adult cell types. We find that many different multipotent stem and progenitor cell populations are in a state of hypertranscription, including in the hematopoietic system, intestine and skin. Hypertranscription marks cells with multilineage potential in adult organs, is redeployed in conditions of tissue injury, and can precede by 1-2 days bursts of proliferation during regeneration. In addition to the association between hypertranscription and the stem/progenitor cell state, we dissect the relationship between transcriptional output and cell cycle, ploidy and secretory behavior. Our analyses reveal a common set of molecular pathways associated with hypertranscription across adult organs, including chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis and translation. Our findings introduce an approach towards maximizing single-cell RNA-seq profiling. By applying this methodology across a diverse collection of cell states and contexts, we put forth hypertranscription as a general and dynamic cellular program that is pervasively employed during development, organ maintenance and regeneration.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTAbsolute scaling of single-cell transcriptomic data reveals highly dynamic global levels of transcription across adult cell lineages",

Dimethyl fumarate, an ester from the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate, is approved as a drug for the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis, and its anti-angiogenic activity has been reported in vitro and in vivo. However, it is not known whether dimethyl fumarate is able to modulate endothelial cell metabolism, considered an essential feature for the angiogenic switch. By means of different experimental approximations, including proteomics, isotope tracing and metabolomics experimental approaches, in this work we studied the possible role of dimethyl fumarate in endothelial cell energetic metabolism. We demonstrate for the first time that dimethyl fumarate promotes glycolysis and diminishes cell respiration, which could be a consequence of a down-regulation of serine and glycine synthesis through inhibition of PHGDH activity in endothelial cells. This new target can open a new field of study regarding the mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate.",

Biochemical gradients are formed through hydrogel-based scaffolds by free diffusion from a source to a sink chamber. To confirm the establishment of spatiotemporally controlled gradients, we employ light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and in-silico modelling. The ISC niche biochemical gradients coming from the stroma and applied along the villus axis lead to the in vivo-like compartmentalization of the proliferative and differentiated cells, while changing the composition and concentration of the biochemical factors affects the cellular organization along the villus axis. This novel 3D in vitro intestinal model derived from organoids recapitulates both the villus-like architecture and the gradients of ISC biochemical factors, thus opening the possibility to study in vitro the nature of such gradients and the resulting cellular response.",

The main purpose of the current study is to search for noninvasive medical therapies for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), for which there is currently no effective drug therapy. Network medicine represents a cutting-edge technology, as analysis and modeling of disease networks can provide critical clues regarding the etiology of specific diseases and which therapeutics may be effective. Here, we proposed a novel algorithm to quantify disease relations based on a large accumulated microRNA-disease association dataset and then built a disease network that covered 15 disease classes and included 304 diseases. Analysis revealed a number of patterns for these diseases; for example, diseases tended to be clustered and coherent in the network. Surprisingly, we found that AAA showed the strongest similarity with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, both of which are autoimmune diseases, suggesting that AAA could be one type of autoimmune disease in etiology. Based on this observation, we further hypothesized that drugs for autoimmune disease could be repurposed for the prevention and therapy of AAA. Finally, animal experiments confirmed that methotrexate, a drug for autoimmune disease, was able to prevent the formation and inhibit the development of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal form of intracranial tumor. One of the obstacles to treat GBM is the blood-brain barrier which limit the transportation of drugs into the tumor site. Here, based on our previous study on metabolitin (MTL) and osteocalcin, we generated a molecular drug delivery system that consisted of metabolitin and small molecules such as fluorescent dye or peptide drugs for diagnosis and treatment. And we designed a GBM diagnostic probe (MTL-ICG) and therapeutic peptide drug (MTL-NBD) that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In a NIR animal live imaging system, we found MTL-ICG can penetrate cross BBB and label the GBM site. The in vitro experiment showed that MTL-NBD had inhibitory effect on GBM cell line (U87-MG). Besides, after orthotopic transplantation of GBM into mouse cortex, treatment of MTL-NBD intravenously showed inhibition trend, which were similar with the effect of NBD, a known anti-tumor polypeptide drug. In addition, we found the GPR158, the receptor of osteocalcin, was also high expressed in grafting site. Taken together, these findings suggest that MTL is a promising cell penetrating peptide targeting GPR158 in GBM, which provide a novel delivery tool for GBM.",

    "abstract": "Expression of the fusion oncoprotein EWS/FLI causes Ewing sarcoma, an aggressive pediatric tumor characterized by widespread epigenetic deregulation. These epigenetic changes are targeted by novel lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) inhibitors, which are currently in early phase clinical trials. Single agent targeted therapy often induces resistance, and successful clinical development requires knowledge of resistance mechanisms, enabling the design of effective combination strategies. Here, we used a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen to identify genes whose knockout (KO) conferred resistance to the LSD1 inhibitor SP- 2509 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Multiple genes required for mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes III and IV function were hits in our screen. We validated this finding using genetic and chemical approaches including CRISPR KO, ETC inhibitors, and mitochondrial depletion. Further global transcriptional profiling revealed that altered complex III/IV function disrupted the oncogenic program mediated by EWS/FLI and LSD1 and blunted the transcriptomic response to SP-2509. These findings demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction modulates SP-2509 efficacy and suggest that new therapeutic strategies combining LSD1 with agents which prevent mitochondrial dysfunction may benefit patients with this aggressive malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depends on the coordinated action of protein disulfide isomerases and ER oxidoreductins (EROs). Strict dependence of ERO activity on molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor implies that oxidative protein folding and other ER processes are severely compromised under hypoxia. While many key players involved in oxidative protein folding are known, our understanding of how redox homeostasis in the ER is maintained and how EROs, the Cys residues of nascent proteins, and the luminal glutathione redox buffer interact is limited. Here, we isolated viable ero1 ero2 double mutants largely deficient in ERO activity, which rendered the mutants highly sensitive to reductive stress and hypoxia. To elucidate the specific redox dynamics in the ER lumen in vivo, we expressed the glutathione redox potential (EGSH) sensor Grx1-roGFP2iL-HDEL with a midpoint potential of -240 mV in the ER of Arabidopsis plants. We found EGSH values of -241 mV in wild-type plants, which is less oxidizing than previously estimated. In the ero1 ero2 mutants, luminal EGSH was reduced further to -253 mV. Recovery to reductive ER stress, as induced by acute exposure to dithiothreitol, was delayed in ero1 ero2 mutants. The characteristic signature of EGSH dynamics in the ER lumen triggered by hypoxia was affected in the ero1 ero2 mutant reflecting a disrupted balance of reductive and oxidizing inputs, including nascent polypeptides and glutathione entry. The ER redox dynamics can now be dissected in vivo, revealing a central role of EROs as major redox integrators to promote luminal redox homeostasis.\n\nOne sentence summaryDynamic monitoring the ER luminal glutathione redox potential highlights the role of EROs in defining redox conditions and the interplay between different redox inputs during hypoxia and reductive stress.",

Alterations in protein translation have been implicated in the development and progression of a wide range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntingtons disease (HD). We examined the architecture of polysomes in their native brain context by performing 3D electron tomography of striatal tissue from the zQ175 knock-in mouse model of HD. Results revealed progressive remodelling towards a more compacted polysomal architecture, an effect that coincided with the emergence and progression of HD related symptoms. This aberrant architecture is compatible with ribosome stalling phenomena. In fact, we also detected an increase in the striatal expression of the stalling relief factor EIF5A2. Polysomal sedimentation gradients showed a significant increase in the accumulation of free 40S ribosomal subunits in zQ175 striatal samples. Together, these findings indicate that changes in the architecture of the protein synthesis machinery may underlie translational alterations associated with HD, thus opening new avenues for understanding the progression of this disease.",

To test this hypothesis, we used Indian leopards, one of the popular zoo animals, as a model system to understand effects of active (interacting) and passive (noninteracting) enrichment elements on stress hormone levels of captive individuals. We included three enrichment categories, category  A (having both active: large size cage, and passive: controlled temperature, playback of forest sounds and sound proof glasses to filter visitors noise, enrichment elements), category  B (active enrichment type I, small size cage with air coolers), and category C (active enrichment type II, medium size cage without air coolers) for the leopards (n=14) housed in two Indian zoos. We standardized a non-invasive method to measure fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels in captive leopards. The standardized fGCM assay was further validated by analysing samples from free-ranging leopards, as well. The fGCM levels (Mean{+/-}SE) were 10.45{+/-}2.01 and 0.95{+/-}0.003g/g dry wt of feces in captive and free-ranging leopards, respectively. Our results demonstrated that fGCM levels of leopards in categories B and C were significantly (P<0.05) different from each other, thus, indicating cage size (an active enrichment element) as an important factor in influencing the physiology of the sampled animals. Overall, the findings of the study will contribute towards informing policies for management of the Indian leopards.",

    "abstract": "Biologging tags are a key enabling tool for investigating cetacean behavior and locomotion in their natural habitat. Identifying and then parameterizing gait from movement sensor data is critical for these investigations. But how best to characterize gait from tag data remains an open question. Further, the location and orientation of the tag on an animal in the field are variable and can change multiple times during deployment. As a result, the relative orientation of the tag with respect to (wrt) the animal must be determined before a wide variety of further analyses. Currently, custom scripts that involve specific manual heuristics methods tend to be used in the literature. These methods require a level of knowledge and experience that can affect the reliability and repeatability of the analysis. The authors of this work argue that an animals gait is composed of a sequence of body poses observed by the tag, demonstrating a specific spatial pattern in the data that can be utilized for different purposes. This work presents an automated data processing pipeline (and software) that takes advantage of the common characteristics of pose and gait of the animal to 1) Identify time instances associated with occurrences of relative motion between the tag and animal; 2) Identify the relative orientation of tag wrt the animals body for a given data segment; and 3) Extract gait parameters that are invariant to pose and tag orientation. The authors included biologging tag data from bottlenose dolphins, humpback whales, and beluga whales in this work to validate and demonstrate the approach. Results show that the average relative orientation error of the tag wrt the dolphins body after processing was within 11 degrees in roll, pitch, and yaw directions. The average precision and recall for identifying relative tag motion were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Examples of the resulting pose and gait analysis demonstrate the potential of this approach to enhance studies that use tag data to investigate movement and behavior. MATLAB source code and data presented in the paper were made available to the public (https://github.com/ding-z/cetacean-pose-gait-analysis.git), with suggestions related to tag data processing practices provided in this paper. The proposed analysis approach will facilitate the use of biologging tags to study cetacean locomotion and behavior.",

The activation of proliferation by 10 g/mL PTX was also supported by the increase of cMyc-MAX heterodimer and {beta}-catenin-TCF1 complex in double IP-HPLC. 10 g/mL PTX enhanced FAS-mediated apoptosis but diminished p53-mediated apoptosis, and downregulated many angiogenesis proteins (angiogenin, VEGF-A, and FLT4), but upregulated HIF1, VEGFR2, and CMG2 reactively. Whereas, 300 g/mL PTX consistently decreased proliferation, epigenetic modification, RAS and NFkB signaling, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, but increased apoptosis, ER stress, and fibrosis compared to 10 g/mL PTX. These data suggest PTX has different biological effect on RWA 264.7 cells depending on the concentration of 10 g/mL and 300 g/mL PTX. The low dose 10 g/mL PTX enhanced RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, particularly, it stimulated neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, innate immunity, and cell-mediated immunity, but attenuated ER stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and chronic inflammation, while the high dose 300 g/mL PTX was found to alleviate the 10 g/mL PTX-induced biological effects, resulted in the suppression of RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, and inflammation.",

Using a model of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in 5TGM1 myeloma cells, we demonstrate that ablation of the glucose transporter gene Slc2a1 abrogates radioactive glucose uptake but has no effect on the magnitude or kinetics of 2NBDG import. Extracellular 2NBDG, but not NBD-fructose was transported by plasma cells into the cytoplasm suggesting specific activity that is unlinked to glucose import and that of chemically similar compounds. RNA-Seq analysis of primary plasma cells and the 5TGM1 myeloma cell line revealed expression of other candidate glucose transporters. Yet, deletion of these transporters individually or in combination with one another also had no impact on 2NBDG uptake. Ablation of the genes in the Slc29 and Slc35 families of nucleoside and nucleoside sugar transporters as well as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family also failed to impact 2NBDG import. Thus, cellular uptake of 2NBDG is promoted by an unknown mechanism and is not a faithful indicator of glucose transport.",

From these, we generated 298 high-coverage microbial genome assemblies, which we annotated for open reading frames and phylogenetic placement. These genomes increase the gene catalog and phylogenetic breadth of the mouse microbiota, adding 135 novel species with the greatest increase in diversity to the Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae families. This new diversity also improves the read mapping rate, taxonomic classifier performance, and gene detection rate of mouse stool metagenomes.

An effective therapy for SCD is fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction by pharmacologic agents such as hydroxyurea, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for this purpose. Therefore, the goal of our study was to determine whether salubrinal (SAL), a selective protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor, induces HbF expression through the stress-signaling pathway by activation of p-eIF2 and ATF4 trans-activation in the {gamma}-globin gene promoter. Sickle erythroid progenitors treated with 24{micro}M SAL increased F-cells levels 1.4-fold (p=0.021) and produced an 80% decrease in reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis showed SAL enhanced HbF protein by 1.6-fold (p=0.0441), along with dose-dependent increases of p-eIF2 and ATF4 levels. Subsequent treatment of SCD mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of SAL (5mg/kg) produced peak plasma concentrations at 6 hours. Chronic treatments of SCD mice with SAL mediated a 2.3-fold increase in F-cells (p=0.0013) and decreased sickle erythrocytes supporting in vivo HbF induction.",

Here we report for the first time the isolation and characterization of rMSCs derived from an animal belonging to a natural rabbit population within the species native region. New rMSC lines were isolated from different tissues: oral mucosa (rOM-MSC), dermal skin (rDS-MSC), subcutaneous adipose tissue (rSCA-MSC), ovarian adipose tissue (rOA-MSC), oviduct (rO-MSC), and mammary gland (rMG-MSC). The six rMSC lines showed plastic adhesion with fibroblast-like morphology and were all shown to be positive for CD44 and CD29 expression (characteristic markers of MSCs), and negative for CD34 or CD45 expression. In terms of pluripotency features, all rMSC lines expressed NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2. Furthermore, all rMSC lines cultured under osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic conditions showed differentiation capacity. In conclusion, this study describes the isolation and characterization of new rabbit cell lines from different tissue origins, with a clear mesenchymal pattern. We show that rMSC do not exhibit differences in terms of morphological features, expression of the cell surface, and intracellular markers of pluripotency and in vitro differentiation capacities, attributable to their tissue of origin.",

    "abstract": "Cells adapt their metabolism to physiological stimuli, and metabolic heterogeneity exists between cell types, within tissues, and subcellular compartments. The liver plays an essential role in maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis and is structurally defined by metabolic zones. These zones are well-understood on the transcriptomic level, but have not been comprehensively characterized on the metabolomic level. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be used to map hundreds of metabolites directly from a tissue section, offering an important advance to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in tissues compared to extraction-based metabolomics methods that analyze tissue metabolite profiles in bulk. We established a workflow for the preparation of tissue specimens for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI and achieved broad coverage of central carbon, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism pathways. We used this approach to visualize the effect of nutrient stress and excess on liver metabolism. Our data revealed a highly organized metabolic compartmentalization in livers, which becomes disrupted under nutrient stress conditions. Fasting caused changes in glucose metabolism and increased the levels of fatty acids in the circulation. In contrast, a prolonged high-fat diet (HFD) caused lipid accumulation within liver tissues with clear zonal patterns. Fatty livers had higher levels of purine and pentose phosphate related metabolites, which generates reducing equivalents to counteract oxidative stress. This MALDI MSI approach allowed the visualization of liver metabolic compartmentalization at high resolution and can be applied more broadly to yield new insights into metabolic heterogeneity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We show that mitochondria from the kidney of mice (MKM), rat brain (RBM), and heart (RHM) oxidize long-chain fatty acids at high rates in all metabolic states only in the presence of any other mitochondrial metabolites: succinate, glutamate, or pyruvate. All supporting substrates increased several folds the respiration rates in State 4 and State 3. The stimulations of the State 3 respiration with palmitoyl-carnitine + malate oxidation (100%) were: with succinate in MKM 340%, RBM 370%, and RHM 340%; with glutamate - MKM 200%, RBM 270%, and RHM 270%; and with pyruvate - MKM 150%, RBM 260%, and RHM 280%. The increases in O2 consumption in State 4 were due to increased leakage of electrons to produce superoxide radicals (O2*). Earlier, we have shown that the brain and heart mitochondria possess a strong intrinsic inhibition of succinate oxidation to prevent the excessive O2* production at diminished functional loads. We show that kidney mitochondria lack the intrinsic inhibition of SDH. The new methodology to study {beta}-oxidation of LCFAs opens the opportunity to study energy metabolism under normal and pathological conditions, particularly in the organs that utilize LCFAs as the main energy source.",

    "abstract": "There are not many descriptions of the muscle morphology of marsupials, despite the fact that they should show diversity according to the adaptation and dispersal to a variety of environments. Most of the previous studies regarding the gross anatomy of marsupials were conducted in the 1800 - 1900s, and many issues still remain that need to be reexamined. For instance, the muscle identification had been performed based only on their attachments and thus, muscle descriptions are often inconsistent among the studies. These classic studies often do not include figures or photographs, so the discrepancies in the descriptions of the muscles could only be verified by performing the muscle identification again with a more reliable method. This problem can be solved by performing muscle identification by innervation. This method, which focuses on the ontogenic origin of the muscle as opposed to the attachment site, is prone to individual and interspecies variation and is a common technique in recent anatomical research. This technique is more reliable than previous methods and is suitable for comparison with other taxa (i.e., eutherians). In this study, we first conducted muscle identification based on innervation in the gluteal and posterior thighs of koalas in order to reorganize the anatomical knowledge of marsupials. This is because the gluteus and posterior thighs of koalas are the areas where previous studies have been particularly inconsistent. We dissected five individual koalas and clarified discrepancies in previous studies, as well as investigated the unique muscle morphology and their function in koalas. Specifically, the koalas gluteal muscle group is suitable for abduction, while the posterior thigh muscles are particularly suitable for flexion. In the future, we will update the anatomical findings of marsupials in the same way to clarify the adaptive dissipation process of marsupials, as well as to contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary morphology of mammals.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is transmitted by droplet and contact infection. SARS-CoV-2 that adheres to environmental surfaces remains infectious for several days. We herein attempted to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus adhering to an environmental surface by spraying aerosolized hypochlorous acid solution and hydrogen peroxide solution in the form of Dry Fog (fog that does not wet objects even if touched). SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus were dried on plastic plates and placed into a test chamber for inactivation by the Dry Fog spraying of disinfectants. The results obtained showed that Dry Fog spraying inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in time- and exposed disinfectant amount-dependent manners. SARS-CoV-2 was more resistant to the virucidal effects of aerosolized hypochlorous acid solution and hydrogen peroxide solution than influenza A virus; therefore, higher concentrations of spray solutions were required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 than influenza A virus. The present results provide important information for the development of a strategy that inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus on environmental surfaces by spatial spraying.",
