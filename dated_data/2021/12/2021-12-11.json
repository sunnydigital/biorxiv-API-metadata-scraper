    "abstract": "Available animal models for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) show limited similarities with the human disease and have no predictive value in screening for effective intervention therapies. Heat-inactivated bacteria instilled in the ductal compartment of the pancreas in healthy rats rapidly cause periductal inflammation and accumulation of mainly granulocytes and monocytes in the exocrine pancreas and in the peri-islet area mimicking the acute pancreatic inflammation in subjects with recent onset T1D. After three weeks, the triggered exocrine inflammation had vanished and pancreases showed normal morphology. However, a distinct accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within and adjacent to affected islets was found in one third of the rats, mimicking the pathognomonic insulitis in T1D. As in human T1D, the insulitis affected a fraction of all islets and was observed only in certain lobes of the pancreases. The presented animal model for T1D will allow detailed mechanistic studies to unravel a previously unknown interplay between bacteria-activated innate immunity and an acquired cellular immunity forming the immunopathological events described in humans at different stages of T1D.\n\nSummary StatementThe results presented signify a previously unknown decisive bridge between innate immunity and formation of the pathognomonic immunopathological events described in subjects with recent onset T1D.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntestinal atresia (IA) is a congenital gut obstruction caused by the absence of gut opening. Genetic factors are assumed to be critical for the development of IA, in addition to accidental vascular insufficiency or mechanical strangulation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying IA remains poorly understood.\n\nResultsIn this study, to better understand such a mechanism, we isolated a mutant of Oryzias latipes (the Japanese rice fish known as medaka) generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, in which IA develops during embryogenesis. Positional cloning identified a nonsense mutation in the myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (mypt1) gene. Consistent with known Mypt1 function, the active form of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), which is essential for actomyosin contraction, and F-actin were ectopically accumulated in the intestinal epithelium of mutant embryos, whereas cell motility, proliferation and cell death were not substantially affected. Corresponding to the accumulation site of F-actin/active MRLC, the intestinal epithelium architecture was disordered. Importantly, blebbistatin, a non-muscle myosin inhibitor, attenuated the development of IA in the mutant.\n\nConclusionsCytoskeletal contraction governed by mypt1 regulates the integrity of the embryonic intestinal epithelium. This study provides new insight into our understanding of the mechanism of IA development in humans.\n\nBullet PointsO_LIMedaka mypt1 mutants display intestinal atresia.\nC_LIO_LIThe level of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain was higher in mypt1 mutant embryos than in wild-type embryos.\nC_LIO_LIThe levels of F-actin appeared elevated in the intestinal epithelium of mypt1 mutants.\nC_LIO_LIBlebbistatin, an inhibitor of non-muscle myosin II, rescued intestinal atresia in mypt1 mutant embryos.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microbial pathogens can rapidly adapt to changing environments such as the application of pesticides or host resistance. Copy number variations (CNV) are a major source of adaptive genetic variation for recent adaptation. Here, we analyze how a major fungal pathogen of barley, Rhynchosporium commune, has adapted to host environment, fungicide and temperature challenges. We screen the genomes of 126 isolates sampled across a worldwide set of populations and identify a total of 7879 gene duplications and 116 gene deletions. Most gene duplications result from segmental chromosomal duplications. We find that genes showing recent gains or losses are enriched in functions related to host exploitation (i.e. effectors and cell wall degrading enzymes). We perform a phylogeny-informed genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identify 191 copy-number variants associated with different pathogenesis and temperature related traits, including a large segmental duplication of CYP51A that has contributed to the emergence of azole resistance. Additionally, we use a genome-wide SNP dataset to replicate the GWAS and contrast it with the CNV-focused analysis. We find that frequencies of adaptive CNV alleles show high variation among populations for traits under strong selection such as fungicide resistance. In contrast, adaptive CNV alleles underpinning temperature adaptation tend to be near fixation. Finally, we show that transposable elements are important drivers of recent gene copy-number variation. Loci showing signatures of recent positive selection are enriched in miniature inverted repeat transposons. Our findings show how extensive segmental duplications create the raw material for recent adaptation in global populations of a fungal pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogenic viruses are endemic among human populations and can cause a broad variety of diseases, some potentially leading to devastating pandemics. How virus populations maintain diversity and what selective pressures drive population turnover, is not thoroughly understood. We conducted a large-scale phylodynamic analysis of 27 human pathogenic RNA viruses spanning diverse life history traits in search of unifying trends that shape virus evolution. For most virus species, we identify multiple, co-circulating lineages with low turnover rates. These lineages appear to be largely noncompeting and likely occupy semi-independent epidemiological niches that are not regionally or seasonally defined. Typically, intra-lineage mutational signatures are similar to inter-lineage signatures. The principal exception are members of the family Picornaviridae, for which mutations in capsid protein genes are primarily lineage-defining. The persistence of virus lineages appears to stem from limited outbreaks within small communities so that only a minor fraction of the global susceptible population is infected at any time. As disparate communities become increasingly connected through globalization, interaction and competition between lineages might increase as well, which could result in changing selective pressures and increased diversification and/or pathogenicity. Thus, in addition to zoonotic events, ongoing surveillance of familiar, endemic viruses appears to merit global attention with respect to the prevention or mitigation of future pandemics.\n\nSignificanceNumerous pathogenic viruses are endemic in humans and cause a broad variety of diseases, but what is their potential of causing new pandemics? We show that most human pathogenic RNA viruses form multiple, co-circulating lineages with low turnover rates.

    "abstract": "With the growing amount and diversity of intermediate omics data complementary to genomics (e.g., DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein abundance), there is a need to develop methods to incorporate intermediate omics data into conventional genomic evaluation. The omics data helps decode the multiple layers of regulation from genotypes to phenotypes, thus forms a connected multi-layer network naturally. We developed a new method named NN-LMM to model the multiple layers of regulation from genotypes to intermediate omics features, then to phenotypes, by extending conventional linear mixed models (\"LMM\") to multi-layer artificial neural networks (\"NN\"). NN-LMM incorporates intermediate omics features by adding middle layers between genotypes and phenotypes. Linear mixed models (e.g., pedigree-based BLUP, GBLUP, Bayesian Alphabet, single-step GBLUP, or single-step Bayesian Alphabet) can be used to sample marker effects or genetic values on intermediate omics features, and activation functions in neural networks are used to capture the nonlinear relationships between intermediate omics features and phenotypes. NN-LMM had significantly better prediction performance than the recently proposed single-step approach for genomic prediction with intermediate omics data. Compared to the single-step approach, NN-LMM can handle various patterns of missing omics measures, and allows nonlinear relationships between intermediate omics features and phenotypes. NN-LMM has been implemented in an open-source package called \"JWAS\".",

    "abstract": "NADK2 encodes the mitochondrial isoform of NAD Kinase, which phosphorylates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Rare recessive mutations in human NADK2 are associated with a syndromic neurological mitochondrial disease that includes metabolic changes such as hyperlysinemia and 2,4 dienoyl CoA reductase (DECR) deficiency. However, the full pathophysiology resulting from NADK2 deficiency is not known. Here we describe two chemically-induced mouse mutations in Nadk2, S326L and S330P, which cause a severe neuromuscular disease and shorten lifespan. The S330P allele was characterized in detail and shown to have marked denervation of neuromuscular junctions by 5 weeks of age and muscle atrophy by 11 weeks of age. Cerebellar Purkinje cells also showed progressive degeneration in this model. Transcriptome profiling on brain and muscle was performed at early and late disease stages. In addition, metabolomic profiling was performed on brain, muscle, liver, and spinal cord at the same ages. Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses identified hyperlysinemia, DECR deficiency, and generalized metabolic dysfunction in Nadk2 mutant mice, indicating relevance to the human disease. We compared findings from the Nadk model to equivalent RNAseq and metabolomic datasets from a mouse model of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, caused by recessive mutations in Pla2g6. This enabled us to identify disrupted biological processes that are common between these mouse models of neurological disease, such as translation, and those processes that are gene-specific such as glycolysis and acetylcholine binding. These findings improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of both Nadk2 and Pla2g6 mutations, as well as pathways common to neuromuscular/neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Snodgrassella is a Betaproteobacteria genus found in the gut of honeybees (Apis spp.) and bumblebees (Bombus spp). It is part of a conserved microbiome that is composed of few core phylotypes and is essential for bee health and metabolism. Phylogenomic analyses using whole genome sequences of 75 Snodgrassella strains from 4 species of honey bees and 14 species of bumblebees showed that these strains formed a monophyletic lineage within the Neisseriaceae family, that Snodgrassella isolates from Asian honeybees diverged early on from the other species in their evolution, that isolates from honeybees and bumblebees were well separated and that this genus consists of at least seven species. We propose to formally name two new Snodgrassella species that were isolated from bumblebees, i.e. Snodgrassella gandavensis sp. nov. and Snodgrassella communis sp. nov. Possible evolutionary scenarios for 107 species or group specific genes revealed very limited evidence for horizontal gene transfer. Functional analyses revealed the importance of small proteins, defense mechanisms, amino acid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism and carbohydrate transport and metabolism among these 107 specific genes.\n\nImportanceThe microbiome of honeybees (Apis spp.) and bumblebees (Bombus spp.) is highly conserved and represented by few phylotypes. This simplicity in taxon composition makes the bees microbiome an emergent model organism for the study of gut microbial communities. Since the description of the Snodgrassella genus, which was isolated from the gut of honeybees and bumblebees in 2013, a single species, i.e. Snodgrassella alvi, has been named. Here we demonstrate that this genus is actually composed of at least seven species, two of them (Snodgrassella gandavensis sp. nov. and Snodgrassella communis sp. nov.) being formally described in the present publication. We also report the presence of 107 genes specific to Snodgrassella species, showing notably the importance of small proteins and defense mechanisms in this genus.\n\nData summaryO_LICornet L and Vandamme P, European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), Project accession: PRJEB47378\nC_LIO_LICornet L and Vandamme P, European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), Reads accessions: SAMEA9570070 - SAMEA9570078\nC_LIO_LICornet L and Vandamme P, European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), Genome accessions: GCA_914768015, GCA_914768025, GCA_914768035, GCA_914768045, GCA_914768055, GCA_914768065, GCA_914768075, GCA_914768085, GCA_914768095.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers regulate the DNA accessibility required of virtually all nuclear processes. Biochemical studies have provided insight into remodeler action at the nucleosome level, but how these findings translate to activity on chromatin fibers in vitro and in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we present a massively multiplex single-molecule platform allowing high-resolution mapping of nucleosomes on fibers assembled on mammalian genomic sequences. We apply this method to distinguish between competing models for chromatin remodeling by the essential ISWI ATPase SNF2h: linker-length-dependent dynamic positioning versus fixed-linker-length static clamping. Our single-fiber data demonstrate that SNF2h operates as a density-dependent, length-sensing chromatin remodeler whose ability to decrease or increase DNA accessibility depends on single-fiber nucleosome density. In vivo, this activity manifests as different regulatory modes across epigenomic domains: at canonically-defined heterochromatin, SNF2h generates evenly-spaced nucleosome arrays of multiple nucleosome repeat lengths; at SNF2h-dependent accessible sites, SNF2h slides nucleosomes to increase accessibility of motifs for the essential transcription factor CTCF. Overall, our generalizable approach provides molecularly-precise views of the processes that shape nuclear physiology. Concurrently, our data illustrate how a mammalian chromatin remodeling enzyme can effectively sense nucleosome density to induce diametrically-opposed regulatory effects within the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Alphaviruses (family Togaviridae) are a diverse group of positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) viruses that are transmitted by arthropods and are the causative agent of several significant human and veterinary diseases. Interferon (IFN)-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are a family of RNA-binding IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that are highly upregulated following viral infection, and have been identified as potential restrictors of alphaviruses. The mechanism by which IFIT1 restricts RNA viruses is dependent on self and non-self-discrimination of RNA, and alphaviruses evade this recognition via their 5UTR. However, the role of IFIT2 during alphavirus replication and the mechanism of viral replication inhibition is unclear. In this study, we identify IFIT2 as a restriction factor for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and show that IFIT2 binds the 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of the virus. We investigated the potential role of variability in the 3UTR of the virus affecting IFIT2 antiviral activity by studying infection with VEEV. Comparison of recombinant VEEV clones containing 3UTR sequences derived from epizootic and enzootic isolates exhibited differential sensitivity to IFIT2 restriction in vitro infection studies, suggesting that the alphavirus 3UTR sequence may function in part to evade IFIT2 restriction. In vitro binding assays demonstrate that IFIT2 binds to the VEEV 3UTR, however in contrast to previous studies VEEV restriction did not appear to be dependent on the ability of IFIT2 to inhibit translation of viral RNA, suggesting a novel mechanism of IFIT2 restriction. Our study demonstrates that IFIT2 is a restriction factor for alphaviruses and variability in the 3UTR of VEEV can modulate viral restriction by IFIT2. Ongoing studies are exploring the biological consequences of IFIT2-VEEV RNA interaction in viral pathogenesis and defining sequence and structural features of RNAs that regulate IFIT2 recognition.",

Moreover, disruptions in the capacity to differentiate between noxious and innocuous stimuli can result in neuropathic pain. Drosophila larval Class III (CIII) neurons are peripheral noxious cold nociceptors and gentle touch mechanosensors; high levels of activation drive cold-evoked contraction (CT) behavior, while low levels of activation result in a suite of touch-associated behaviors. However, it is unknown what molecular factors underlie CIII multimodality. Here, we show that the TMEM16/anoctamins subdued and white walker (wwk; CG15270) are required for cold-evoked CT, but not for touch-associated behavior, indicating a conserved role for anoctamins in nociception. We also evidence that CIII neurons make use of atypical depolarizing chloride currents to encode cold, and that overexpression of ncc69--a fly homologue of NKCC1--results in phenotypes consistent with neuropathic sensitization, including behavioral hypersensitization and spontaneous nociceptor activity, making Drosophila CIII neurons a candidate system for future studies of the basic mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain.",
