    "abstract": "The recognition that individual GPCRs can activate multiple signaling pathways has raised the possibility of developing drugs selectively targeting therapeutically relevant ones. This requires tools to determine which G proteins and {beta}arrestins are activated by a given receptor. Here, we present a set of BRET sensors monitoring the activation of the 12 G protein subtypes based on the translocation of their effectors to the plasma membrane (EMTA). Unlike most of the existing detection systems, EMTA does not require modification of receptors or G proteins (except for Gs). EMTA was found to be suitable for the detection of constitutive activity, inverse agonism, biased signaling and polypharmacology. Profiling of 100 therapeutically relevant human GPCRs resulted in 1,500 pathway-specific concentration-response curves and revealed a great diversity of coupling profiles ranging from exquisite selectivity to broad promiscuity. Overall, this work describes unique resources for studying the complexities underlying GPCR signaling and pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Cell division requires dramatic reorganization of the cell cortex that is primarily driven by the actomyosin network. We previously reported that Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) enriches at the cell surface during mitosis which is required for building up the full mitotic rounding pressure. Here we showed that PCDH7 gets palmitoylated and interacts with the palmitoyltransferase, ZDHHC5. Both PCDH7 and ZDHHC5 co-localize at the mitotic cell surface, and they translocate to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. PCDH7s localization depends on palmitoylation activity of ZDHHC5. Loss of expression of PCDH7 impairs active RhoA and phospho-myosin levels at the cleavage furrow and increases the rate of multinucleated cells. This work uncovers a palmitoylation-dependent translocation mechanism for PCDH7 and attributes a regulatory role to contributing actomyosin activity during cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "The development of perinatal brain connectivity underpins motor, cognitive and behavioural abilities in later life. Diffusion MRI allows the characterisation of subtle inter-individual differences in structural brain connectivity. Individual brain connectivity maps (connectomes) are by nature high in dimensionality and are complex to interpret. Machine learning methods are a powerful tool to uncover properties of the connectome which are not readily visible, and can give us clues as to how and why individual developmental trajectories differ.\n\nIn this manuscript we used Deep Neural Networks and Random Forests to predict demographic and neurodevelopmental characteristics from neonatal structural connectomes in a large sample of babies (n = 524) from the developing Human Connectome Project. We achieved an accurate prediction of post menstrual age (PMA) at scan in term-born infants (Mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.72 weeks, r = 0.83 and p<0.001). We also achieved good accuracy when predicting gestational age at birth in a cohort of term and preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age (MAE = 2.21 weeks, r = 0.82, p<0.001). We subsequently used sensitivity analysis to obtain feature relevance from our prediction models, with the most important connections for prediction of PMA and GA found to be predominantly thalamocortical. From our models of PMA at scan for infants born at term, we computed a brain maturation index (predicted age minus actual age) of individual preterm neonates and found a significant correlation between this index and motor outcome at 18 months corrected age. Our results demonstrate the applicability of machine learning techniques in analyses of the neonatal connectome, and suggest that a neural substrate for later developmental outcome is detectable at term equivalent age.",

    "abstract": "Intraviral protein-protein interactions are crucial for replication, pathogenicity, and viral assembly. Among these, virus assembly is a critical step as it regulates the arrangements of viral structural proteins and helps in the encapsulation of genomic material. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins play an essential role in the self-rearrangement, RNA encapsulation, and mature virus particle formation. In SARS-CoV, the membrane protein interacts with the envelope and spike protein in Endoplasmic Reticulum Golgi Intermediate Complex (ERGIC) to form an assembly in the lipid bilayer, followed by membrane-ribonucleoprotein (nucleocapsid) interaction. In this study, we tried to understand the interaction of membrane proteins interaction with envelope, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins using protein-protein docking. Further, simulation studies performed up to 100 ns to examine the stability of protein-protein complexes of Membrane-Envelope, Membrane-Spike, and Membrane-Nucleocapsid. Prime MM-GBSA showed high binding energy calculations than the docked complex. The interactions identified in our study will be of great importance, as it provides valuable insight into the protein-protein complex, which could be the potential drug targets for future studies.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas universe continues to expand. The type II CRISPR-Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) is the most widely used for genome editing due to its high efficiency in cells and organisms. However, concentrating on a single CRISPR-Cas system imposes limits on target selection and multiplexed genome engineering. We hypothesized that CRISPR-Cas systems originating from different bacterial species could operate simultaneously and independently due to their distinct single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) or CRISPR-RNAs (crRNAs), and protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). Additionally, we hypothesized that CRISPR-Cas activity in zebrafish could be regulated through the expression of inhibitory anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins. Here, we use a simple mutagenesis approach to demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas systems from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9), Streptococcus aureus (SauCas9), Lachnospiraceae bacterium (LbaCas12a, previously known as LbCpf1), are orthogonal systems capable of operating simultaneously in zebrafish. CRISPR systems from Acidaminococcus sp. (AspCas12a, previously known as AsCpf1) and Neisseria meningitidis (Nme2Cas9) were also active in embryos. We implemented multichannel CRISPR recording using three CRISPR systems and show that LbaCas12a may provide superior information density compared to previous methods. We also demonstrate that type II Acrs (anti-CRISPRs) are effective inhibitors of SpyCas9 in zebrafish. Our results indicate that at least five CRISPR-Cas systems and two anti-CRISPR proteins are functional in zebrafish embryos. These orthogonal CRISPR-Cas systems and Acr proteins will enable combinatorial and intersectional strategies for spatiotemporal control of genome editing and genetic recording in animals.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus from the Coronaviridae family (genus Betacoronavirus), which has been established as causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the largest among known RNA viruses, comprising of at least 26 known protein-coding loci. Studies thus far have outlined the coding capacity of the positive-sense strand of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which can be used directly for protein translation. However, it has been recently shown that transcribed negative-sense viral RNA intermediates that arise during viral genome replication from positive-sense viruses can also code for proteins. No studies have yet explored the potential for negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA intermediates to contain protein coding-loci. Thus, using sequence and structure-based bioinformatics methodologies, we have investigated the presence and validity of putative negative-sense ORFs (nsORFs) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nine nsORFs were discovered to contain strong eukaryotic translation initiation signals and high codon adaptability scores, and several of the nsORFs were predicted to interact with RNA-binding proteins. Evolutionary conservation analyses indicated that some of the nsORFs are deeply conserved among related coronaviruses. Three-dimensional protein modelling revealed the presence of higher order folding among all putative SARS-CoV-2 nsORFs, and subsequent structural mimicry analyses suggest similarity of the nsORFs to DNA/RNA-binding proteins and proteins involved in immune signaling pathways. Altogether, these results suggest the potential existence of still undescribed SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which may play an important role in the viral lifecycle and COVID-19 pathogenesis.\n\nContactpetr.pecinka@osu.cz; tlb20@cam.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "Typical adults read remarkably quickly. Such fast reading is facilitated by brain processes that are sensitive to both word frequency and contextual constraints. It is debated as to whether these attributes have additive or interactive effects on language processing in the brain. We investigated this issue by analysing existing magnetoencephalography data from 99 participants reading intact and scrambled sentences. Using a cross-validated model comparison scheme, we found that lexical frequency predicted the word-by-word elicited MEG signal in a widespread cortical network, irrespective of sentential context. In contrast, index (ordinal word position) was more strongly encoded in sentence words, in left front-temporal areas. This confirms that frequency influences word processing independently of predictability, and that contextual constraints affect word-by-word brain responses. With a conservative multiple comparisons correction, only the interaction between lexical frequency and surprisal survived, in anterior temporal and frontal cortex, and not between lexical frequency and entropy, nor between lexical frequency and index. However, interestingly, the uncorrected index*frequency interaction revealed an effect in left frontal and temporal cortex that reversed in time and space for intact compared to scrambled sentences. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that, in sentences, lexical frequency and predictability may independently influence early (<150ms) and late stages of word processing, but also interact during late stages of word processing (>150-250ms), thus helping to converge previous contradictory eye-tracking and electrophysiological literature. Current neuro-cognitive models of reading would benefit from accounting for these differing effects of lexical frequency and predictability on different stages of word processing.",

    "abstract": "Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a massive health crisis across the globe, with some genetic variants gaining enhanced infectivity and competitive fitness, and thus significantly aggravating the global health concern. In this regard, the recent SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant, B.1.1.7 lineage, reported from the United Kingdom (UK), is of great significance in that it contains several mutations that increase its infection and transmission rates as evident from clinical reports. Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) has been shown to possess an increased affinity for ACE2, although the basis for this is not entirely clear yet. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interfacial interaction of the N501Y mutant S1-RBD with ACE2 compared to the wild type S1-RBD. Additionally, we find that the N501Y mutant S1-RBD displays altered dynamics that likely aids in its enhanced interaction with ACE2. By elucidating a mechanistic basis for the increased affinity of the N501Y mutant S1-RBD for ACE2, we believe that the results presented here will aid in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 including designing drugs targeting the ACE2-S1-RBD interaction.\n\nSignificanceThe emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the UK in December 2020 has further aggravated the COVID-19 pandemic due to an increased ability of the variant to infect human hosts, likely due to mutations in the viral S1 spike protein including the N501Y S1-RBD mutation that is located at the interface of S1-RBD and ACE2, the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Given its location at the interface, N501Y S1-RBD mutation can therefore potentially alter the interfacial interaction. Multiple, all-atom, explicit solvent MD simulations of the ACE2-S1-RBD complex carried here indicated a more stable interaction between the N501Y mutant S1-RBD and ACE2 through stabilizing interfacial interactions of residues at one end of the interface that are either sequentially or physically near the mutation site. These mechanistic details will aid in better understanding the mechanism by which the alpha variant has increased infectivity as well as in designing better therapeutics including ACE2-S1 spike protein inhibitors that will, in turn, help thwarting the current and future pandemic.\n\nHighlightsO_LIN501 in the wild type SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD forms unsustained hydrogen bonds with residues in the ACE2, namely Y41 and K353\nC_LIO_LIY501 in the N501Y mutant SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD is not capable of forming substantial hydrogen bonds with ACE2 within the time span of the current simulation\nC_LIO_LIEvidence from analyzing the simulation results suggests that Y501 of S1-RBD could form other types of non-covalent interactions with ACE2, such as van der Waals interactions\nC_LIO_LIN501Y S1-RBD mutation stabilizes the position of interfacial residues neighboring to the mutation site, as well as other non-interfacial residues that are distant from the mutation site\nC_LIO_LIThese altered dynamics results in more stable interaction of S1-RBD with ACE2 which could be the main reason underlying the reported enhanced affinity of S1-RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant (UK B.1.1.7 lineage) to ACE2\nC_LI",

However, existing databases and search tools do not make it easy to scan for equivalent variants, namely \"matching variants\" (MatchVars) between humans and other organisms. Therefore, we developed an integrated search engine called ConVarT (http://www.convart.org/) for matching variants between humans, mice, and C. elegans. ConVarT incorporates annotations (including phenotypic and pathogenic) into variants, and these previously unexploited phenotypic MatchVars from mice and C. elegans can give clues about the functional consequence of human genetic variants. Our analysis shows that many phenotypic variants in different genes from mice and C. elegans, so far, have no counterparts in humans, and thus, can be useful resources when evaluating a relationship between a new human mutation and a disease.",

Twenty older females (OF; mean age 68.4, SD 4.1 years) and eighteen young females (YF; mean age 22.3, SD 1.7 years) were asked to walk straight for 100 meters at their preferred speed, while wearing inertial sensors on heels and lower back. We calculated spatiotemporal measures, foot and trunk acceleration characteristics and their variability, as well as trunk stability using the local divergence exponent (LDE). Two-way analysis of variance (including the factors foot and age), Students t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare statistical differences of measures between groups. Cohens d effects were calculated for each variable. Foot maximum vertical acceleration and amplitude, trunk-foot vertical acceleration attenuation, as well as their variability were significantly smaller in OF than in YF. In contrast, trunk mediolateral acceleration amplitude, maximum vertical acceleration, and amplitude, as well as their variability were significantly larger in OF than in YF. Moreover, OF showed lower stability (i.e., higher LDE values) in mediolateral acceleration, mediolateral and vertical angular velocity of the trunk. Even though we measured healthy older females, these participants showed lower vertical foot accelerations with higher vertical trunk acceleration, lower trunk-foot vertical acceleration attenuation, less gait stability, and more variability of the trunk, and hence, were more likely to fall. These findings suggest that instrumented gait measurements may help for early detection of changes or impairments in gait performance, even before this can be observed by clinical eye or gait speed.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are host-encoded antibiotics that combat invading pathogens. These genes commonly encode multiple products as post-translationally cleaved polypeptides. Recent studies have highlighted roles for AMPs in neurological contexts suggesting functions for these defence molecules beyond infection. During our immune study characterizing the antimicrobial peptide gene Baramicin, we recovered multiple Baramicin paralogs in Drosophila melanogaster and other species, united by their N-terminal IM24 domain. Not all paralogs were immune-induced. Here, through careful dissection of the Baramicin familys evolutionary history, we find that these non-immune paralogs result from repeated events of duplication and subsequent truncation of the coding sequence from an immune-inducible ancestor. These truncations leave only the IM24 domain as the prominent gene product. Surprisingly, using mutation and targeted gene silencing we demonstrate that two such genes are adapted for function in neural contexts in D. melanogaster. We also show enrichment in the head for independent Baramicin genes in other species. The Baramicin evolutionary history reveals that the IM24 Baramicin domain is not strictly useful in an immune context. We thus provide a case study for how an AMP-encoding gene might play dual roles in both immune and non-immune processes via its multiple peptide products. We reflect on these findings to highlight a blind spot in the way researchers approach AMP research in in vivo contexts.\n\nSignificance statementAntimicrobial peptides are immune proteins recently implicated in neurological roles. To date little attention has been paid to the contributions of different gene products in this function. Here we show that an antimicrobial peptide gene encodes multiple products with either immune-specific or neurological roles.",

Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how preexisting articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this \"scientific infrastructure\" facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Lastly, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the shifting landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 vaccine development.\n\nConclusionsUnderstanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its \"citizen encyclopedists\", it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts.",

    "abstract": "Computational tools for integrative analyses of diverse single-cell experiments are facing formidable new challenges including dramatic increases in data scale, sample heterogeneity, and the need to informatively cross-reference new data with foundational datasets. Here, we present SCALEX, a deep-learning method that integrates single-cell data by projecting cells into a batch-invariant, common cell-embedding space in a truly online manner (i.e., without retraining the model). SCALEX substantially outperforms online iNMF and other state-of-the-art non-online integration methods on benchmark single-cell datasets of diverse modalities, (e.g., scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq), especially for datasets with partial overlaps, accurately aligning similar cell populations while retaining true biological differences. We showcase SCALEXs advantages by constructing continuously expandable single-cell atlases for human, mouse, and COVID-19 patients, each assembled from diverse data sources and growing with every new data. The online data integration capacity and superior performance makes SCALEX particularly appropriate for large-scale single-cell applications to build-upon previously hard-won scientific insights.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli strains are responsible for a majority of human extra-intestinal infections, resulting in huge direct medical and social costs. We had previously shown that HlyF encoded by a large virulence plasmid harbored by pathogenic E. coli is not a hemolysin but a cytoplasmic enzyme leading to the overproduction of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Here, we show that these specific OMVs inhibit the autophagic flux by impairing the autophagosome - lysosome fusion, thus preventing the formation of acidic autophagolysosome and autophagosome clearance. Furthermore, HlyF-associated OMVs are more prone to activate the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Since autophagy and inflammation are crucial in the hosts response to infection especially during sepsis, our findings reveal an unsuspected role of OMVs in the crosstalk between bacteria and their host, highlighting the fact that these extracellular vesicles have exacerbated pathogenic properties.",

Machine learning narrows the gap through predictions from expert-designed input features leveraging information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) that is resource expensive to generate. Here, we showcased using embeddings from protein language models (pLMs) for competitive localization prediction without MSAs. Our lightweight deep neural network architecture used a softmax weighted aggregation mechanism with linear complexity in sequence length referred to as light attention (LA). The method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ten localization classes by about eight percentage points (Q10). So far, this might be the highest improvement of just embeddings over MSAs. Our new test set highlighted the limits of standard static data sets: while inviting new models, they might not suffice to claim improvements over the SOTA.\n\nAvailabilityOnline predictions are available at http://embed.protein.properties.

However, they are poorly studied in the divergent eukaryotic pathogens- Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of malaria, which manifest atypical aspects of cell division and plasticity of morphology throughout the lifecycle in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. Here we describe a genome-wide screen of Plasmodium kinesins, revealing diverse subcellular locations and functions in spindle assembly, axoneme formation and cell morphology. Surprisingly, only kinesin-13 is essential for growth in the mammalian host while the other eight kinesins are required during the proliferative and invasive stages of parasite transmission through the mosquito vector. In-depth analyses of kinesin-13 and kinesin-20 revealed functions in microtubule dynamics during apical cell polarity formation, spindle assembly, and axoneme biogenesis. These findings help us to understand the importance of microtubule motors and may be exploited to discover new therapeutic interventions against malaria.",

In instances where a suitable antibody is not available, it is common to graft synthetic tags onto target protein sequences and allowing the use of commercially available antibodies for affinity purification. A common approach is through FLAG-Tag co-immunoprecipitation. To allow the selective elution of protein complexes, competitive displacement using a large molar excess of the tag peptides is often carried out. Yet, this creates downstream challenges for the mass spectrometry analysis due to the presence of large quantities of these peptides. Here, we demonstrate that Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS), a gas phase ion separation device prior to mass spectrometry analysis can be applied to FLAG-Tag co-immunoprecipitation experiment to increase the depth of protein coverage. By excluding these abundant tag peptides, we were able to observe deeper coverage of interacting proteins and as a result, deeper biological insights, without the need for additional sample handling or altering sample preparation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Kv2 voltage-gated potassium channels are modulated by AMIGO neuronal adhesion proteins. Here, we identify steps in the conductance activation pathway of Kv2.1 channels that are modulated by AMIGO1 using voltage clamp recordings and spectroscopy of heterologously expressed Kv2.1 and AMIGO1 in mammalian cell lines. AMIGO1 speeds early voltage sensor movements and shifts the gating charge-voltage relationship to more negative voltages. The gating charge-voltage relationship indicates that AMIGO1 exerts a larger energetic effect on voltage sensor movement than apparent from the midpoint of the conductance-voltage relationship. When voltage sensors are detained at rest by voltage sensor toxins, AMIGO1 has a greater impact on the conductance-voltage relationship. Fluorescence measurements from voltage sensor toxins bound to Kv2.1 indicate that with AMIGO1, the voltage sensors enter their earliest resting conformation, yet this conformation is less stable upon voltage stimulation. We conclude that AMIGO1 modulates the Kv2.1 conductance activation pathway by destabilizing the earliest resting state of the voltage sensors.\n\nStatement of SignificanceKv2 potassium channels activate a potassium conductance that shapes neuronal action potentials. The AMIGO family of adhesion proteins modulate activation of Kv2 conductances, yet, which activation steps are modified is unknown. This study finds that AMIGO1 destabilizes the earliest resting conformation of the Kv2.1 voltage sensors to promote activation of channel conductance.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of protein complexes, i.e. sets of proteins assembling into a single larger physical entity, is important, as such assemblies play many essential roles in cells such as gene regulation. From networks of protein-protein interactions, potential protein complexes can be identified computationally through the application of community detection methods, which flag groups of entities interacting with each other in certain patterns. Most community detection algorithms tend to be unsupervised and assume that communities are dense network subgraphs, which is not always true, as protein complexes can exhibit diverse network topologies. The few existing supervised machine learning methods are serial and can potentially be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability by using better-suited machine learning models and parallel algorithms. Here, we present Super.Complex, a distributed, supervised AutoML-based pipeline for overlapping community detection in weighted networks. We also propose three new evaluation measures for the outstanding issue of comparing sets of learned and known communities satisfactorily. Super.Complex learns a community fitness function from known communities using an AutoML method and applies this fitness function to detect new communities. A heuristic local search algorithm finds maximally scoring communities, and a parallel implementation can be run on a computer cluster for scaling to large networks. On a yeast protein-interaction network, Super.Complex outperforms 6 other supervised and 4 unsupervised methods. Application of Super.Complex to a human protein-interaction network with ~8k nodes and ~60k edges yields 1,028 protein complexes, with 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus, with 111 uncharacterized proteins present in 103 learned complexes. Super.Complex is generalizable with the ability to improve results by incorporating domain-specific features. Learned community characteristics can also be transferred from existing applications to detect communities in a new application with no known communities.

To help contribute to the understanding of crucial knowledge and to further generate new hypotheses relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and human protein interactions, we make use of the information abundant Biomine probabilistic database and extend the experimentally identified SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in silico. We generate an extended network by integrating information from the Biomine database, the PPI network, and other experimentally validated results. To generate novel hypotheses, we focus on the high-connectivity sub-communities that overlap most with the integrated experimentally validated results in the extended network. Therefore, we propose a new data analysis pipeline that can efficiently compute core decomposition on the extended network and identify dense subgraphs. We then evaluate the identified dense subgraph and the generated hypotheses in three contexts: literature validation for uncovered virus targeting genes and proteins, gene function enrichment analysis on subgraphs, and literature support on drug repurposing for identified tissues and diseases related to COVID-19. The majority types of the generated hypotheses are proteins with their encoding genes and we rank them by sorting their connections to the integrated experimentally validated nodes. In addition, we compile a comprehensive list of novel genes, and proteins potentially related to COVID-19, as well as novel diseases which might be comorbidities. Together with the generated hypotheses, our results provide novel knowledge relevant to COVID-19 for further validation.",

Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated the neural mechanisms involved in binding at the syntax level, in a task where contributions from semantics were minimized. Participants were auditorily presented with minimal sentences that required binding (pronoun and pseudo-verb with the corresponding morphological inflection; \"she grushes\") and pseudo-verb wordlists that did not require binding (\"cugged grushes\"). Relative to no binding, we found that syntactic binding was associated with a modulation in alpha band (8-12 Hz) activity in left-lateralized language regions. First, we observed a significantly smaller increase in alpha power around the presentation of the target word (\"grushes\") that required binding (-0.05s to 0.1s), which we suggest reflects an expectation of binding to occur. Second, during binding of the target word (0.15s to 0.25s), we observed significantly decreased alpha phase-locking between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left middle/inferior temporal cortex, which we suggest reflects alpha-driven cortical disinhibition serving to strengthen communication within the syntax composition neural network.

We find that both sensory tuning and developmental sequence are organizing principles of vestibular topography. Patterned rostrocaudal innervation from hair cells to afferents creates an anatomically inferred directional tuning map in the utricular ganglion, forming segregated pathways for rostral and caudal tilt. Furthermore, the mediolateral axis of the ganglion is linked to both developmental sequence and neuronal temporal dynamics. Early-born pathways carrying phasic information preferentially excite fast escape circuits, whereas later-born pathways carrying tonic signals excite slower postural and oculomotor circuits. These results demonstrate that vestibular circuits are organized by tuning direction and dynamics, aligning them with downstream motor circuits and behaviors.",

The rearrangements tend to occur in 3D spatially proximal and chromatin-accessible regions. Enormous numbers of rearrangements by SCRaMbLE provide a driving force to potentiate directed genome evolution, and investigation of the rearrangement landscape offers mechanistic insights into the dynamics of genome evolution.",

TC90s were marked by an immunophenotype resembling adult naked mole-rat common myeloid progenitors (CMP) with mature neutrophilic Thy1.1-antigen levels and showed a clear differentiation bias and transcriptome signature towards myelopoiesis. TC90s overexpressed both CXCL12 and its alternative receptor CXCR7, thereby abrogating their homing capacity and produced multiple secreted matrix components related to neonatal bone marrow niche formation. We hypothesize that the TC90 cell population protects newborns during the critical transition at birth and shortly beyond by boosting a supply of innate immune cells.

This paper further develops a model from Toney (2013) to estimate microscopic rate constants from steady-state data for a set of reversible, four-step reactions. This paper uses the Bayesian modeling software Stan, and demonstrates the benefits of Bayesian data analysis in the estimation of these rate constants. In contrast to the optimization methods employed often in the estimation of kinetic constants, a Bayesian treatment is more equipped to estimate the uncertainties of each parameter; sampling from the posterior distribution using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo immediately gives parameter estimates as mean or median of the posterior, and also confidence intervals that express the uncertainty of each parameter.",

    "abstract": "Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) is an important freshwater fisheries resource and popular recreational fishing species in Japan, lives for only one year, and has a single breeding season. To supplement increased recreational fishing demand for this species, huge numbers of wild-born landlocked juveniles have been translocated from Lake Biwa into most Japanese rivers for more than 100 generations. Hatchery-reared juveniles born from captive-reared parents for more than 30 generations have also been extensively released. Previous studies have reported that landlocked and amphidromous forms of Ayu easily hybridise, but survival of landlocked larvae could be very low in seawater, leading to a general consensus among scientists, hatchery managers, and commercial and recreational fishers that the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu is very low, or even 0 in translocated rivers. Despite this, limited information exists regarding the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu in translocated rivers, and no study has evaluated the effects of translocation on population structure. Demonstrating that hybridisation occurs between the two forms is central to future management and conservation of this specie. To address this issue, a comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and three published genetic data sets are analysed. Analyses provide strong evidence for very high gene flow between populations, but population structure has been retained in several regions, and several populations are nested. Allele frequencies are similar in amphidromous and landlocked forms. Genetic diversity is homogeneous in amphidromous populations. Bayesian admixture analysis infers widespread introgression in Japanese rivers, with a mean introgression proportion of 24 {+/-} 8%. Maximum likelihood admixture graphs detect two migration events from Lake Biwa to anadromous populations. Analyses consistently indicate that hybridisation between translocated landlocked juveniles and native amphidromous Ayu occurs throughout Japanese rivers.",

    "abstract": "The UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene family is responsible for the transfer of glucuronic acid to exogenous and endogenous chemicals. Based on the highly diversified number of genes, the mammalian UGT1A and UGT2B subfamily genes are believed to be involved in the conjugation reactions of xenobiotic metabolism. However, it is speculated that the UGT2 family genes are not involved in the xenobiotic metabolism of avian species due to the less diverse number of genes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the evolutionary history of mammalian UGT1 and UGT2 family genes and determine when the diversification of UGT2B genes occurred. We also attempted to identify the main factors responsible for the diversification of UGT genes and the effect of the selection pressure on the structure of the UGT isozymes. By examining the genomic information and feeding habits of 67 species representing each mammalian family, we discovered that the UGT2B genes emerged in the Eutheria on or after Cretaceous period and that their number were higher in plant-eating mammals (herbivore or omnivore) than in carnivorous mammals. We also found that the UGT2B genes in some herbivorous mammals underwent positive selection. In contrast, the diversity of the UGT1 family genes was inherited from the common ancestor of birds and mammals. Furthermore, by predicting 3D structure of UGT enzymes, estimating selection pressure on amino acid sites, and performing molecular dynamics simulations, we showed that UGT2B and some UGT2A isozymes, which have increasing gene numbers in each mammalian species, have in common that a portion of the -helix loosens to form a hinge-like structure, that the amino acid site at which the -helix loosens is under positive selection, and that the -helix loosening increases the fluctuations of the UGT2B proteins. Thus, our findings suggest that the emergence of angiosperms (flowering plants) and the occurrence of \"animal-plant warfare\" influenced the evolution of this gene family involved in the xenobiotic metabolism of eutherians. Furthermore, future research investigating the marsupials and birds that do not possess UGT2B genes is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the metabolism of chemical substances in these species.",

Genome sizes of several species in the genus Diabrotica were estimated using flow cytometry along with that of Acalymma vittatum as an outgroup. Genome sizes ranged between 1.56 - 1.64 gigabase pairs (Gb) and between 2.26-2.59 Gb, respectively, for the Diabrotica subgroups fucata and virgifera; the Acalymma vittatum genome size was around 1.65 Gb. This result indicated that a substantial increase in genome size occurred in the ancestor of the virgifera group. Further analysis of fucata group and virgifera group genome sequencing reads indicated that the genome size difference between the Diabrotica subgroups could be attributed to a higher content of transposable elements, mostly miniature inverted-transposable elements (MITEs) and gypsy-like long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe eukaryotic parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes millions of malarial infections annually while drug resistance to common antimalarials is further confounding eradication efforts. Translation is an attractive therapeutic target that will benefit from a deeper mechanistic understanding. As the rate limiting step of translation, initiation is a primary driver of translational efficiency. It is a complex process regulated by both cis and trans acting factors, providing numerous potential targets. Relative to model organisms and humans, P. falciparum mRNAs feature unusual 5 untranslated regions suggesting cis-acting sequence complexity in this parasite may act to tune levels of protein synthesis through their effects on translational efficiency.\n\nMethodsHere, we deployed in vitro translation to compare the role of cis-acting regulatory sequences in P. falciparum and humans. Using parasite mRNAs with high or low translational efficiency, the presence, position, and termination status of upstream \"AUG\"s, in addition to the base composition of the 5 untranslated regions, were characterized.\n\nResultsThe density of upstream \"AUG\"s differed significantly among the most and least efficiently translated genes in P. falciparum, as did the average \"GC\" content of the 5 untranslated regions. Using exemplars from highly translated and poorly translated mRNAs, multiple putative upstream elements were interrogated for impact on translational efficiency. Upstream \"AUG\"s were found to repress translation to varying degrees, depending on their position and context, while combinations of upstream \"AUG\"s had nonadditive effects. The base composition of the 5 untranslated regions also impacted translation, but to a lesser degree. Surprisingly, the effects of cis-acting sequences were remarkably conserved between P. falciparum and humans.\n\nConclusionWhile translational regulation is inherently complex, this work contributes toward a more comprehensive understanding of parasite and human translational regulation by examining the impact of discrete cis-acting features, acting alone or in context.",

    "abstract": "Receptors, transporters and ion channels are important targets for therapy development in neurological diseases including Alzheime[r]s disease, Parkinso[n]s disease, epilepsy, schizophrenia and major depression. Several receptors and ion channels identified by next generation sequencing may be involved in disease initiation and progression but their mechanistic role in pathogenesis is often poorly understood. Gene editing and in vivo imaging approaches will help to identify the molecular and functional role of these targets and the consequence of their regional dysfunction on whole brain level. Here, we combine CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing with in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the direct link between genes, molecules, and the brain connectome. The extensive knowledge of the Slc18a2 gene encoding the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), involved in the storage and release of dopamine, makes it an excellent target for studying the gene networks relationships while structurally preserving neuronal integrity and function. We edited the Slc18a2 in the substantia nigra pars compacta of adult rats and used in vivo molecular imaging besides behavioral, histological, and biochemical assessments to characterize the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated VMAT2 knockdown. Simultaneous PET/fMRI was performed to investigate molecular and functional brain alterations. We found that stage-specific adaptations of brain functional connectivity follow the selective impairment of presynaptic dopamine storage and release. Our study reveals that recruiting different brain networks is an early response to the dopaminergic dysfunction preceding neuronal cell loss. Our combinatorial approach is a novel tool to investigate the impact of specific genes on brain molecular and functional dynamics which will help to develop tailored therapies for normalizing brain function. The method can easily be transferred to higher-order species allowing for a direct comparison of the molecular imaging findings.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies of complex disorders such as autism and intellectual disability (ID) are often based on enrichment of individual rare variants or their aggregate burden in affected individuals compared to controls. However, these studies overlook the influence of combinations of rare variants that may not be deleterious on their own due to statistical challenges resulting from rarity and combinatorial explosion when enumerating variant combinations, limiting our ability to study oligogenic basis for these disorders. We present a framework that combines the apriori algorithm and statistical inference to identify specific combinations of mutated genes associated with complex phenotypes. Our approach overcomes computational barriers and exhaustively evaluates variant combinations to identify non-additive relationships between simultaneously mutated genes. Using this approach, we analyzed 6,189 individuals with autism and identified 718 combinations significantly associated with ID, and carriers of these combinations showed lower IQ than expected in an independent cohort of 1,878 individuals. These combinations were enriched for nervous system genes such as NIN and NGF, showed complex inheritance patterns, and were depleted in unaffected siblings. We found that an affected individual can carry many oligogenic combinations, each contributing to the same phenotype or distinct phenotypes at varying effect sizes. We also used this framework to identify combinations associated with multiple comorbid phenotypes, including mutations of COL28A1 and MFSD2B for ID and schizophrenia and ABCA4, DNAH10 and MC1R for ID and anxiety/depression. Our framework identifies a key component of missing heritability and provides a novel paradigm to untangle the genetic architecture of complex disorders.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWhile rare mutations in single genes or their collective burden partially explain the genetic basis for complex disorders, the role of specific combinations of rare variants is not completely understood. This is because combinations of rare variants are rarer and evaluating all possible combinations would result in a combinatorial explosion, creating difficulties for statistical and computational analysis. We developed a data mining approach that overcomes these limitations to precisely quantify the influence of combinations of two or more mutated genes on a specific clinical feature or multiple co-occurring features. Our framework provides a new paradigm for dissecting the genetic causes of complex disorders and provides an impetus for its utility in clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a social and economic impact worldwide, and vaccination is an efficient strategy for diminishing those damages. New adjuvant formulations are required for the high vaccine demands, especially adjuvant formulations that induce a Th1 phenotype. Herein we assess a vaccination strategy using a combination of Alum and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) adjuvants plus the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a prefusion trimeric conformation by an intradermal (ID) route. We found high levels of IgG anti-spike antibodies in the serum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by neutralization assay, after one or two boosts. By evaluating the production of IgG subtypes, as expected, we found that formulations containing Poly(I:C) induced IgG2a whereas Alum did not. The combination of these two adjuvants induced high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2a. In addition, cellular immune responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing interferon-gamma were equivalent, demonstrating that the Alum + Poly(I:C) combination supported a Th1 profile. Based on the high neutralizing titers, we evaluated B cells in the germinal centers, which are specific for receptor-binding domain (RBD) and spike, and observed that more positive B cells were induced upon the Alum + Poly(I:C) combination. Moreover, these B cells produced antibodies against both RBD and non-RBD sites. We also studied the impact of this vaccination preparation (spike protein with Alum + Poly(I:C)) in the lungs of mice challenged with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. We found a production of IgG, but not IgA, and a reduction in neutrophil recruitment in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice, suggesting that our immunization scheme reduced lung inflammation. Altogether, our data suggest that Alum and Poly(I:C) together is a possible adjuvant combination for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by the intradermal route.",

Much of our comprehension of size regulation derives from models such as budding and fission yeast, but even for these morphologically stereotypical cells, assessment of cell volume has relied on proxies and extrapolations from two-dimensional measurements. Recently, the fluorescence exclusion method (FXm) was developed to evaluate the size of mammalian cells, but whether it could be applied to smaller cells remained unknown. Using specifically designed microfluidic chips and an improved data analysis pipeline, we show here that FXm reliably detects subtle difference in the volume of fission yeast cells, even for those with altered shapes. Moreover, it allows for the monitoring of dynamic volume changes at the single-cell level with high time resolution. Collectively, our work reveals how coupling FXm with yeast genetics will bring new insights into the complex biology of cell growth.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTFluorescence exclusion provides a unique method to accurately measure the volume of yeast cells at both the population and single-cell levels.",

    "abstract": "Macrodomains are a class of conserved ADP-ribosylhydrolases expressed by viruses of pandemic concern, including coronaviruses and alphaviruses. Viral macrodomains are critical for replication and virus-induced pathogenesis; therefore, these enzymes are a promising target for antiviral therapy. However, no potent or selective viral macrodomain inhibitors currently exist, in part due to the lack of a high-throughput assay for this class of enzymes. Here, we developed a high-throughput ADP-ribosylhydrolase assay using the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain Mac1. We performed a pilot screen which identified dasatinib and dihydralazine as ADP-ribosylhydrolase inhibitors. Importantly, dasatinib does not inhibit MacroD2, the closest Mac1 homolog in humans. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying selective inhibitors based on ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity, paving the way for screening large compound libraries to identify improved macrodomain inhibitors and explore their potential as antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and future viral threats.",

Tumor organoids have been developed to study tumor evolution1-4, and while GSCs can form organoids for glioblastoma multiforme, our understanding of their intrinsic immune, metabolic, genetic, and molecular programs is limited. To address this, we deeply characterized GSC-derived GBM organoids using a modified protocol (GBMOsm) from several patient-derived GSCs and found they develop into complex 3D tissues with unique self-organization, cancerous metabolic states, and burdensome genetic landscapes. We discovered that GBMOsc recapitulate the presence of two important cell populations thought to drive GBM progression, SATB2+ and HOPX+ progenitors. Despite being devoid of immune cells, transcriptomic analysis across GBMOsc revealed an immune-like molecular program, enriched in cytokine, antigen presentation and processing, T-cell receptor inhibitors, and interferon genes. We determined that SATB2+ and HOPX+ populations contribute to this immune and interferon landscape in GBM in vivo and GBMOsm. Our work deepens our understanding of the intrinsic molecular and cellular architecture of GSC-derived GBMO and defines a novel GBMOsc intrinsic immune-like program.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of vector-borne infections, including malaria, often assume age-independent mortality rates of vectors, despite evidence that many insects senesce. In this study we present survival data on insecticide-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.l. from experiments in Cote dIvoire. We fit a constant mortality function and two age-dependent functions (logistic and Gompertz) to the data from mosquitoes exposed (treated) and not exposed (control) to insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), to establish biologically realistic survival functions. This enables us to explore the effects of insecticide exposure on mosquito mortality rates, and the extent to which insecticide resistance might impact the effectiveness of ITNs. We investigate this by calculating the expected number of infectious bites a mosquito will take in its lifetime, and by extension the vectorial capacity. Our results show that the predicted vectorial capacity is substantially lower in mosquitoes exposed to ITNs, despite the mosquitoes in the experiment being highly insecticide-resistant. The more realistic age-dependent functions provide a better fit to the experimental data compared to a constant mortality function and, hence, influence the predicted impact of ITNs on malaria transmission potential. In models with age-independent mortality, there is a great reduction for the vectorial capacity under exposure compared to no exposure. However, the two age-dependent functions predicted an even larger reduction due to exposure, highlighting the impact of incorporating age in the mortality rates. These results further show that multiple exposures to ITNs had a considerable effect on the vectorial capacity. Overall, the study highlights the importance of including age dependency in mathematical models of vector-borne disease transmission and in fully understanding the impact of interventions.\n\nAuthor summaryInterventions against malaria are most commonly targeted on the adult mosquitoes, which transmit the infection from person to person. One of the most important interventions are bed-nets, treated with insecticides. Unfortunately, extensive exposure of mosquitoes to insecticide has led to widespread evolution of insecticide resistance, which might threaten control strategies. Piecing together the overall impact of resistance on the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets is complex, but can be informed by the use of mathematical models. However, there are some assumptions that the models frequently use which are not realistic in terms of the mosquito biology. In this paper, we formulate a model that includes age-dependent mortality rates, an important parameter in vector control since control strategies most commonly aim to reduce the lifespan of the mosquitoes. By using novel data collected using field-derived insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, we explore the effects that the presence of insecticides on nets have on the mortality rates, as well as the difference incorporating age dependency in the model has on the results. We find that including age-dependent mortality greatly alters the anticipated effects of insecticide-treated nets on mosquito transmission potential, and that ignoring this realism potentially overestimates the negative impact of insecticide resistance.",

This report presents the results of the manual curation of twenty-seven genes likely associated with circadian rhythm in the genome of Diaphorina citri, the Asian citrus psyllid. This insect acts as the vector of the bacterial pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the causal agent of citrus greening disease (Huanglongbing). This disease is the most severe detriment to citrus industries and has drastically decreased crop yields worldwide. Based on the genes identified in the psyllid genome, namely cry1 and cry2, D. citri likely possesses a circadian model similar to that of the lepidopteran butterfly, Danaus plexippus.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe tear miRNAome of the male NOD mouse, a model of ocular symptoms of Sjogrens syndrome (SS), was analyzed to identify possible tear biomarkers of the disease.\n\nMethodsMale NOD mice, aged 12-14 weeks, were used to identify tear miRNAs associated with development of autoimmune dacryoadenitis. Age-matched female NOD mice that do not develop the autoimmune dacryoadenitis characteristic of SS were used as negative controls while age- and sex-matched male BALB/c mice served as healthy controls. Total RNA was isolated from stimulated tears pooled from 5 mice per sample and tear miRNAs were sequenced and analyzed. Putative miRNA hits were validated using RT-qPCR in a separate mouse cohort, and the pathways influenced by the validated hits were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.\n\nResultsIn comparison to tears from both healthy (male BALB/c) and negative control (female NOD) mice, initial analysis identified 7 upregulated and 7 downregulated miRNAs in male NOD mouse tears. Of these, 8 were subsequently validated by RT-qPCR in tears from additional mouse cohorts. miRNAs previously implicated in SS pathology included mmu-miR-146a/b-5p, which were significantly downregulated in the male NOD mouse tears, as well as mmu-miR-150-5p and mmu-miR-181a-5p, which were upregulated in the male NOD mouse tears. All other validated hits including the upregulated miR-181b-5p and mmu-miR-203-3p, as well as the downregulated mmu-miR-322-5p and mmu-miR-503-5p, represent novel putative indicators of autoimmune dacryoadenitis in SS.\n\nConclusionsA panel of differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in tears of SS model male NOD mice, including some never previously linked to SS. These may have potential utility as diagnostic biomarkers for ocular symptoms of SS; evaluation of the pathways influenced by these dysregulated miRNAs may also provide further insights into SS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptors (PRs) are the primary visual sensory cells, and their loss leads to blindness that is currently incurable. Cell replacement therapy holds promise as a therapeutic approach to restore vision to those who have lost PRs through damage or disease. While PR transplant research is ongoing in animal models, success is hindered by our limited understanding of PR axon growth during development and regeneration. Using a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter line that labels PRs (WA09 CRX+/tdTomato), we generated retinal organoids in order to study mechanisms of PR process extension. We found that the earliest born PRs exhibit autonomous axon extension from dynamic terminals that appear similar to projection neuron growth cones. However, as hPSC-derived PRs age from 40 to 80 days of differentiation, they lose dynamic terminals in 2D plated cultures and within 3D retinal organoids, which does not correlate with cell birth date. Using a rod-specific hPSC reporter line (WA09 NRL+/eGFP), we further determined that rod PRs never form motile growth cones. Interestingly, PRs without motile terminals are still capable of extending axons, but neurites are generated from process stretching via their attachment to motile non-PR cells, which underlies the observed differences in PR neurite lengths on different substrata. While immobile PR terminals express actin, it is less polymerized and less organized than actin present in motile terminals. However, immobile PRs do localize synaptic proteins to their terminals, suggesting a normal developmental progression. These findings help inform the development of PR transplant therapies to treat blinding diseases and provide a platform to test treatments that restore autonomous PR axon extension.\n\nSignificance StatementLoss of photoreceptors (PRs) in the retina through damage or disease causes irreversible vision loss and blindness. One treatment approach is to replace lost cells with transplanted human stem cell-derived PRs, but this requires PR axons to integrate into the host retina to restore the required neural connections. For this strategy to succeed, we need to understand how PRs extend processes to their targets during development in situ, and whether dissociated human stem cell (hPSC)-derived PRs behave in a similar fashion. In this paper, we show that hPSC-PRs have only a short window during which they are capable of autonomous axon extension, which has implications for PR transplant efforts and for our basic understanding of human retinal development.",

    "abstract": "Grassland habitats currently face severe anthropogenic exploitations leading to cascading effects on the survival of grassland-dependent biodiversity globally, particularly in non-protected areas. Significant amount of such biodiversity-rich grasslands in India are found outside protected areas but lack quantitative information on their status. We evaluated the current and historical (30 years) status of the grasslands using a combination of intensive field surveys and GIS tools across one of the most fertile, human-dominated region: the upper Gangetic Plains of north India. On-ground mapping and visual classifications revealed 57% decline in grassland habitats between 1985 (418 km2) and 2015 (178km2), mostly driven by conversion to croplands (74% contribution). Radio-telemetry data from the largest endemic cervid swamp deer (n=2) showed grassland-dominated average home range (50% BBMM) size of 1.02 km2. The animals highly preferred these patches (average Ivlevs index- 0.85) and showed highest temporal continuity (88%) compared to other LULC classes. Camera trapping within the core habitats suggests critical use of these patches as fawning/breeding grounds. Habitat suitability analysis indicates only [~]18% of the entire area along Ganges is suitable for swamp deer. Accurate mapping (86% accuracy) and characterization of four major grass species revealed a total 144.04 km{superscript 2} vegetation area, dominted by Saccharum sp. (35%). We recommend protection and recovery of these critical grassland patches to maintain  dynamic corridors and other appropriate management strategies involving multiple stakeholders to ensure survival of this critical ecosystem. Such evaluations, if spatially expanded, would be critical to restore this rapidly vanishing ecosystem worldwide.",

Specific memory B and T cell responses were measured in 76 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from 54 patients. Twenty-three vaccinated individuals were included for comparison.\n\nFindingsFollowing a peak at day 15-28 post-infection, the IgG antibody response and plasma neutralizing titers gradually decreased over time but stabilized after 6 months. Plasma neutralizing activity against G614 was still detected in 87% of the patients at 6-15 months. Compared to G614, the median neutralizing titers against Beta, Gamma and Delta variants in plasma collected at early (15-103 days) and late (9-15 month) convalescence were 16- and 8-fold lower, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B and T cells reached a peak at 3-6 months and persisted in the majority of patients up to 15 months although a significant decrease in specific T cells was observed between 6 and 15 months.\n\nConclusionThe data suggest that antiviral specific immunity especially memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients is long-lasting, but some variants of concern, including the fast-spreading Delta variant, may at least partially escape the neutralizing activity of plasma antibodies.\n\nFundingEU-ATAC consortium, the Italian Ministry of Health, the Swedish Research Council, SciLifeLab, and KAW.",

    "abstract": "The balance between cell quiescence and proliferation is fundamental to tissue physiology and homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that quiescence is not a passive and homogeneous state but actively maintained and heterogeneous. These cellular characteristics associated with quiescence were observed primarily in cultured cells under a static medium. However, cells in vivo face different microenvironmental conditions, particularly, under interstitial fluid flows distributed through extracellular matrices. Interstitial fluid flow exerts shear stress on cells and matrix strain, and results in continuous replacement of extracellular factors. In this study, by analyzing individual cells under varying fluid flow rates in microfluidic devices, we found that extracellular fluid flow alters cellular quiescence depth through flow-induced physical and biochemical cues. Specifically, increasing the flow rate drives cells to shallower quiescence and become more likely to reenter the cell cycle upon growth stimulation. Furthermore, we found that increasing shear stress or extracellular factor replacement individually, without altering other parameters, also results in shallow quiescence. We integrated the experimental results into a mathematical model to gain insight and predict the effects of varying extracellular fluid flow conditions on cellular quiescence depth. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism that likely underlies the heterogeneous responses of quiescent cells for tissue repair and regeneration in physiological tissue microenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Hsp70-family chaperones bind short monomeric peptides with a weak characteristic affinity in the low micromolar range, but can also bind some aggregates, fibrils, and amyloids, with low nanomolar affinity. While this differential affinity enables Hsp70 to preferentially target potentially toxic aggregates, it is unknown how Hsp70s differentiate between monomeric and oligomeric states of a target protein. Here we examine the interaction of BiP (the Hsp70 paralog in the endoplasmic reticulum) with proIGF2, the pro-protein form of IGF2 that includes a long and mostly disordered E-peptide region that promotes proIGF2 oligomerization. We discover that electrostatic attraction enables the negatively charged BiP to bind positively charged E-peptide oligomers with low nanomolar affinity. We identify the specific BiP binding sites on proIGF2, and although some are positively charged, as monomers they bind BiP with characteristically low affinity in the micromolar range. We conclude that electrostatics enable BiP to preferentially recognize oligomeric states of proIGF2. Electrostatic targeting of Hsp70 to aggregates may be broadly applicable, as all the currently-documented cases in which Hsp70 binds aggregates with high-affinity involve clients that are expected to be positively charged.",

    "abstract": "We observed the interference between two prevalent respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV, H1N1), and characterized its molecular underpinnings in alveolar epithelial cells (A549). We found that RSV induces higher interferon (IFN) {beta} production than IAV and that IFN{beta} priming confers higher protection against infection with IAV than with RSV. Consequently, we focused on the sequential infection scheme: RSV-then-IAV. Using the A549 WT, IFNAR1 KO, IFNLR1 KO, and IFNAR1-IFNLR1 double KO cell lines we found that both IFN{beta} and IFN{lambda} are necessary for maximum protection against subsequent infection. Immunostaining revealed that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. Strikingly, the susceptible cells turned out to be those already compromised and efficiently expressing RSV, whereas the bystander, interferon-primed cells are resistant to IAV infection. Thus, the virus-virus exclusion at the cell population level is not realized through a direct competition for a shared ecological niche (single cell) but rather achieved with the involvement of specific cytokines induced within the host innate immune response.\n\nImportanceThe influenza A virus (IAV) and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common recurrent respiratory infectants, which show a relatively high coincidence. We demonstrated that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. The susceptible cells are those already compromised and efficiently expressing RSV, whereas the bystander cells are resistant to IAV infection. The cross-protective effect critically depends on IFN{beta} and IFN{lambda} signaling and thus ensues when the proportion of cells preinfected with RSV is relatively low yet sufficient to trigger a pervasive antiviral state in bystander cells. Our study suggests that mild, but not severe, respiratory infections may have a short-lasting protective role against more dangerous respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a large, enveloped DNA virus and its assembly in the cell is a complex multi-step process during which viral particles interact with numerous cellular compartments such as the nucleus and organelles of the secretory pathway. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy are commonly used to study HSV-1 infection. However, 2D imaging limits our understanding of the 3D geometric changes to cellular compartments that accompany infection and sample processing can introduce morphological artefacts that complicate interpretation. In this study, we used soft X-ray tomography to observe differences in whole-cell architecture between HSV-1 infected and uninfected cells. To protect the near-native structure of cellular compartments we used a non-disruptive sample preparation technique involving rapid cryopreservation, and a fluorescent reporter virus was used to facilitate correlation of structural changes with the stage of infection in individual cells. We observed viral capsids and assembly intermediates interacting with nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. Additionally, we observed differences in the morphology of specific organelles between uninfected and infected cells. The local concentration of cytoplasmic vesicles at the juxtanuclear compartment increased and their mean width decreased as infection proceeded, and lipid droplets transiently increased in size. Furthermore, mitochondria in infected cells were elongated and highly branched, suggesting that HSV-1 infection alters the dynamics of mitochondrial fission/fusion. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution 3D images of cellular compartments can be captured in a near-native state using soft X-ray tomography and have revealed that infection causes striking changes to the morphology of intracellular organelles.\n\nImportanceUltrastructural changes to the morphology and organization of cellular compartments during herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection have not previously been studied under near-physiological conditions. In this study, soft X-ray tomography was used to image the ultrastructure of vitrified cells during HSV-1 infection, identifying striking changes to the abundance and organization of cytoplasmic vesicles and mitochondria. The concentration of vesicles in the juxtanuclear region increased with time post infection, which could represent an increasing supply of vesicles to support capsid envelopment, and there is a transient increase in the size of lipid droplets in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that mitochondria elongate and form highly-branched networks as infection progresses. These findings offer insight into stages of virion morphogenesis and the cellular response to infection, highlighting the utility of cryo-soft-X-ray tomography for monitoring the near-native state ultrastructure of infected cells.",

By tracking replisomes in individual cells through thousands of division cycles, we have dissected the mechanism behind this precise process. We have characterized wild-type cells grown under different conditions and also many mutants related to the expression and binding states of the initiator protein DnaA. This rich data set allowed us to compare the relative importance of all previously described control systems. We found that the replication initiation size regulation is not strongly dependent on the absolute concentration of DnaA, nor does it depend on active dnaA expression. Replication initiation is also not consistently triggered by cell division or replication termination. In contrast, some of the factors that convert DnaA between its ATP- and ADP-bound states have a strong effect on initiation size. We suggest a plausible model for DnaA-ATP mediated triggering of initiation at fast growth, where regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA) is the main system for monitoring the number of chromosomes during active replication.",

The Ver3 genome comprises the sodB and sodC genes encoding an iron (AV3SodB) and a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (AV3SodC), respectively; however, the specific role(s) of these genes has remained elusive. We show that the expression of sodB remained unaltered in different oxidative stress conditions whereas sodC was up-regulated in the presence of blue light. Besides, we studied the changes in the in vitro activity of each SOD enzyme in response to diverse agents and solved the crystal structure of AV3SodB at 1.34 [A], one of the highest resolutions achieved for a SOD. Cell fractionation studies interestingly revealed that AV3SodB is located in the cytosol whereas AV3SodC is also found in the periplasm. Consistently, a bioinformatic analysis of the genomes of 53 Acinetobacter species pointed out the presence of at least one SOD type in each compartment, suggesting that these enzymes are separately required to cope with oxidative stress. Surprisingly, AV3SodC was found in an active state also in outer membrane vesicles, probably exerting a protective role. Overall, our multidisciplinary approach highlights the relevance of SOD enzymes when Acinetobacter spp. are confronted with oxidizing agents.",

    "abstract": "As part of the human microbiota, the fungus Candida albicans colonizes the oral cavity and other mucosal surfaces of the human body. Commensalism is tightly controlled by complex interactions of the fungus and the host to preclude fungal elimination but also fungal overgrowth and invasion, which can result in disease. As such, defects in antifungal T cell immunity render individuals susceptible to oral thrush due to interrupted immunosurveillance of the oral mucosa. The factors that promote commensalism and ensure persistence of C. albicans in a fully immunocompetent host remain less clear. Using an experimental model of C. albicans oral colonization in mice we explored fungal determinants of commensalism in the oral cavity. Transcript profiling of the oral isolate 101 in the murine tongue tissue revealed a characteristic metabolic profile tailored to the nutrient poor conditions in the stratum corneum of the epithelium where the fungus resides. Metabolic adaptation of isolate 101 was also reflected in enhanced nutrient acquisition when grown on oral mucosa substrates. Persistent colonization of the oral mucosa by C. albicans also correlated inversely with the capacity of the fungus to induce epithelial cell damage and to elicit an inflammatory response. Here we show that these immune evasive properties of isolate 101 are explained by a strong attenuation of a number of virulence genes, including those linked to filamentation. De-repression of the hyphal program by deletion or conditional repression of NRG1 abolished the commensal behaviour of isolate 101, thereby establishing a central role of this factor in the commensal lifestyle of C. albicans in the oral niche of the host.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe oral microbiota represents an important part of the human microbiota and includes several hundreds to several thousands of bacterial and fungal species. One of the most prominent fungus colonizing the oral cavity is the yeast Candida albicans. While the presence of C. albicans usually remains unnoticed, the fungus can under certain circumstances cause lesions on the lining of the mouth referred to as oral thrush or contribute to other common oral diseases such as caries. Maintaining C. albicans commensalism in the oral mucosa is therefore of utmost importance for oral health and overall wellbeing. While overt fungal growth and disease is limited by immunosurveillance mechanisms during homeostasis, C. albicans strives to survive and evades elimination from the host. Here, we show that while commensalism in the oral cavity is characterized by a restricted fungal virulence and hyphal program, enforcing filamentation in a commensal isolate is sufficient for driving pathogenicity and fungus-induced inflammation in the oral mucosa thwarting persistent colonization. Our results further support a critical role for specialized nutrient acquisition allowing the fungus to thrive in the nutrient poor environment of the squamous epithelium. Together, this work revealed key determinants of C. albicans commensalism in the oral niche.",

    "abstract": "One of the outstanding questions regarding the human gut microbiota is how interventions designed to manipulate the microbiota may influence host phenotypic traits. Here, we employed a dietary intervention to probe this question in the context of lactose intolerance. To assess the effects of dairy elimination and reintroduction on the microbiota and host phenotype, we paired fecal 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with a clinical assay for lactose intolerance, the hydrogen breath test. We studied 12 self-reported mildly lactose intolerant adults, each with tri-weekly collection of fecal samples over a 12-week study period (2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks of dairy elimination, 6 weeks of gradual milk reintroduction) and a hydrogen breath test before and after each phase. We found that although none of the subjects experienced a change in clinically defined status of lactose intolerant or tolerant, most subjects were qualitatively better able to tolerate dairy products with minimal symptoms at the end of the study compared to their baseline. Like clinical status, gut microbiota also resisted modification. Although the mean fraction of the genus Bifidobacterium, a group known to metabolize lactose, increased slightly with dairy reintroduction (from 0.0125 to 0.0206; Wilcoxon P = 0.068), the overall structure of each subjects gut microbiota remained highly individualized and largely stable. Our study is small, but it suggests the possibility of qualitatively improved tolerance in the absence of change in clinically defined tolerance nor major change in the gut microbiota.",

We then proved SRSF7 is a novel m6A regulator that specifically facilitates the m6A methylation near its binding sites on the mRNAs involved in cell proliferation and migration through recruiting methyltransferase complex. Moreover, SRSF7 promotes the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells largely dependent on the m6A methyltransferase. The two single-nucleotide m6A sites on PBK are regulated by SRSF7 and partially mediate the effects of SRSF7 on glioblastoma cells through recognition by IGF2BP2.

To monitor the dynamic activity of AMPK with high sensitivity, we developed a single-fluorophore AMPK activity reporter (ExRai AMPKAR) that exhibits an excitation ratiometric fluorescence change upon phosphorylation by AMPK, with over 3-fold greater response compared to previous AMPKARs. Using subcellularly localized ExRai AMPKAR, we found that the activity of AMPK at the lysosome and mitochondria are differentially regulated. While different activating conditions, irrespective of their effects on ATP, robustly yet gradually increase mitochondrial AMPK activity, lysosomal AMPK activity accumulates with much faster kinetics. Genetic deletion of the canonical upstream kinase liver kinase B1 (LKB1) resulted in slower AMPK activity at lysosomes but did not affect the response amplitude at either location, in sharp contrast to the necessity of LKB1 for maximal cytoplasmic AMPK activity. We further discovered AMPK activity in the nucleus, which resulted from LKB1-mediated cytoplasmic activation of AMPK followed by nuclear shuttling. Thus, a new, sensitive reporter for AMPK activity, ExRai AMPKAR, in complement with mathematical and biophysical methods, captured subcellular AMPK activity dynamics in living cells and unveiled complex regulation of AMPK signaling within subcellular compartments.",

    "abstract": "The conserved MAP kinase and motor scaffold JIP3 prevents excess lysosome accumulation in axons of vertebrates and invertebrates. Whether and how JIP3s interaction with dynein and kinesin-1 contributes to this critical organelle clearance function is unclear. Using purified recombinant human proteins, we show that dynein light intermediate chain (DLIC) binds to the N-terminal RH1 domain of JIP3, its paralog JIP4, and the lysosomal adaptor RILP. A point mutation in a hydrophobic pocket of the RH1 domain, previously shown to abrogate RILPL2 binding to myosin Va, abrogates the binding of JIP3/4 and RILP to DLIC without perturbing the interaction between the JIP3 RH1 domain and kinesin heavy chain. Characterization of this separation-of-function mutation in Caenorhabditis elegans shows that JIP3-bound dynein is required for organelle clearance in the anterior process of touch receptor neurons. Unlike JIP3 null mutants, JIP3 that cannot bind DLIC causes prominent accumulation of endo-lysosomal organelles at the neurite tip, which is rescued by a disease-associated point mutation in JIP3s leucine zipper that abrogates kinesin light chain binding. These results highlight that RH1 domains are interaction hubs for cytoskeletal motors and suggest that JIP3-bound dynein and kinesin-1 participate in bi-directional organelle transport.",

Rhythms are present in red blood cells (RBCs), the most abundant cell type in the body, but their physiological function is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel biochemical assay for haemoglobin (Hb) oxidation status which relies on a redox-sensitive covalent haem-Hb linkage that forms during SDS-mediated cell lysis. Formation of this linkage is lowest when ferrous Hb is oxidised, in the form of ferric metHb. Daily haemoglobin oxidation rhythms are observed in RBCs cultured in vitro or taken from freely behaving mice or humans exhibit and are unaffected by mutations that affect circadian rhythms in nucleated cells. These rhythms correlate with daily rhythms in core body temperature, with temperature lowest when metHb levels are highest. Raising metHb levels with dietary sodium nitrite can further decrease daytime core body temperature in mice via NO signaling. These results extend our molecular understanding of RBC circadian rhythms and suggest they contribute to the regulation of body temperature.",

    "abstract": "Tight regulation of endocytosis ensures accurate control of cellular signaling and membrane dynamics, which are crucial for tissue morphogenesis and functions. Mutations of Bin1 and dynamin-2 (Dyn2), proteins that generate membrane curvature and sever endocytic invaginations, respectively, cause progressive hereditary myopathy. Here, we show that Bin1 inhibits Dyn2 via direct interaction of its SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain with the proline-rich domain (PRD) of Dyn2. Phosphorylation of S848 of Dyn2 by GSK3, a kinase downstream of insulin signaling, relieves Dyn2 from the inhibition of Bin1 and promotes endocytosis in muscle. Mutations of Bin1 associated with centronuclear myopathy disrupt its inhibition of Dyn2, thereby exaggerating Dyn2 fission activity and causing excessive fragmentation of T-tubules in the muscle cells. Our work reveals how Bin1-Dyn2 interaction fine-tunes membrane remodeling at the molecular level, and lay the foundation for future exploration of endocytic regulation and hereditary muscle diseases.",

    "abstract": "Drastic epigenetic reprogramming is essential to convert terminally-differentiated gametes to totipotent embryos. However, it remains puzzling why post-fertilization global DNA reprogramming occurs only in mammals but not in non-mammalian vertebrates. In zebrafish, global methylome inheritance is however accompanied by sweeping enhancer \"dememorization\" as they become fully methylated. By depleting maternal dnmt1 using oocyte microinjection in situ, we eliminated DNA methylation in zebrafish early embryos, which died around gastrulation with severe differentiation defects. Strikingly, methylation deficiency leads to extensive derepression of adult tissue-specific genes and CG-rich enhancers, which acquire ectopic TF binding and, unexpectedly, H3K4me3. By contrast, embryonic enhancers are generally CG-poor and evade DNA methylation repression. Hence, global DNA hypermethylation inheritance coupled with enhancer dememorization installs an epigenetic gate that safeguards embryonic programs and ensures temporally ordered gene expression. We propose that \"enhancer dememorization\" underlies and unifies distinct epigenetic reprogramming modes in early development between mammals and non-mammals.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDHouse mice (Mus musculus) cause significant, ongoing losses to grain crops in Australia, particularly during mouse plagues. Zinc phosphide (ZnP) coated grain is used for control, but with variable success. In a laboratory setting, we tested if mice would (1) switch from consumption of one grain type to another when presented with an alternative, and (2) consume ZnP-treated grains when presented as a choice with a different grain.\n\nRESULTSMice readily switched from their background grain to an alternative grain, preferring cereals (wheat or barley) over lentils. Mice readily consumed ZnP-coated barley grains. Their mortality rate was significantly higher (86%, n=30) in the presence of a less-favoured grain (lentils) compared to their mortality rate (47%, n=29; and 53%, n=30) in the presence of a more-favoured grain (wheat and barley, respectively). Mice died between 4-112 h (median = 18 h) after consuming one or more toxic grains. Independent analysis of ZnP-coated grains showed variable toxin loading indicating that consumption of a single grain would not guarantee intake of a lethal dose. There was also a strong and rapid behavioural aversion if mice did not consume a lethal dose on the first night.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe registered dose rate of 25 g ZnP/kg wheat; [~] 1 mg ZnP/grain in Australia needs to be re-evaluated to determine what factors may be contributing to variation in efficacy. Further field research is also required to understand the complex association between ZnP dose, and quantity and quality of background food on efficacy of ZnP baits.",

There is a growing understanding of the pathologic and molecular abnormalities associated with loss of MTM1, and emerging therapeutic strategies that are in the process of translation to patients. Much of these data have been uncovered through experimentation in pre-clinical animal models of the disease. The most widely used model is an Mtm1 gene knockout mouse line; this line faithfully recapitulates the salient genetic and pathologic features of the disease. Despite the advances in aspects of XLMTM, there remain many unknowns related to disease pathomechanisms and to understanding of MTM1s function in normal muscle development, and a continued need for therapy identification and development. To address these barriers, and to lay the groundwork for future study, we performed a natural history study of the Mtm1 knockout mouse model of XLMTM. We show that certain molecular and pathologic changes precede overt phenotypic changes, while others, including abnormalities in triad structure, occur more coincident with muscle weakness in the mouse.

The assemblies are 1.8 Gb in size and have a repeat content (38%) and GC content (42%) similar to other dragon lizards.

    "abstract": "Infection from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide and the world health organisation has listed it with the highest priority for the need of new antimicrobial therapies. P. aeruginosa strains responsible for the poorest clinical outcomes express either ExoS or ExoU, which are injected into target host cells via the type III secretion system (T3SS). ExoS is a bifunctional cytotoxin that promotes intracellular survival of invasive P. aeruginosa by preventing targeting of the bacteria to acidified intracellular compartments and lysosomal degradation. ExoU is a potent phospholipase which causes rapid destruction of host cell plasma membranes, leading to acute tissue damage and bacterial dissemination. Fluoroquinolones are usually employed as a first line of therapy as they have been shown to be more active against P. aeruginosa in vitro than other antimicrobial classes. However, their overuse over the past decade has caused alarming rates of antibiotic resistance to emerge. In certain clinical situations, aminoglycosides have been shown to be more effective then fluoroquinolones, despite their reduced potency towards P. aeruginosa in vitro. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin and gentamycin) on T3SS expression and toxicity, in corneal epithelial cell infection models. We discovered tobramycin disrupted T3SS expression and inhibited both ExoS and ExoU mediated cytotoxicity, protecting infected HCE-T cells even at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin, however, upregulated the T3SS and in particular did not subvert the cytotoxic effects of ExoS and ExoU.",

Malaria diagnosis is a crucial pillar in the control and elimination efforts, often accomplished by administration of mass-scale Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). The inherent limitations of RDTs-failure of detection in low transmission settings, and deletion of one of the target proteins-Histidine rich protein (HRP) are evident from multiple reports; thus necessitating the need to explore novel diagnostic tools/targets. The present study used peptide microarray to screen potential epitopes from 13 antigenic proteins (CSP, EXP1, LSA1, TRAP, AARP, AMA1, GLURP, MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, MSP4, P48/45, HAP2) of P. falciparum. Three cyclic constrained immunoreactive peptides-C6 (EXP1), A8 (MSP2), B7 (GLURP) were identified from 5,458 cyclic constrained peptides (in duplicate) against P. falciparum infected sera. Peptides (C6, A8, B7-cyclic constrained) and (G11, DSQ, NQN-corresponding linear peptides) were fairly immunoreactive towards P. falciparum-infected sera in dot-blot assay. Using indirect ELISA, cyclic constrained peptides (C6 & B7) were found to be specific to P. falciparum infected sera and further, observed to be significantly reactive towards antibodies from field-collected P. falciparum infected sera. Notably, the structural location of the epitopes defines the reactivity, observed by the preferential recognition of cyclic constrained peptides vs linear peptides and corroborated by the homology modeling analysis of selected proteins. In conclusion, the study identified three cyclic constrained immunoreactive peptides (C6, B7 & A8) from P. falciparum secretory/surface proteins and two of them (C6 & B7) were validated for their diagnostic potential with field-collected P. falciparum infected sera samples.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria import nearly all their [~]1,000-2,000 constituent proteins from the cytosol across their double membrane envelope. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that the conserved protein translocase, termed the TIM complex (also known as TIM23 complex), mediates import of presequence-containing proteins into the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. Among [~]10 different subunits of the complex, the essential multi-pass membrane protein Tim23, together with the evolutionarily related protein Tim17, has long been postulated to form a protein-conducting channel. However, the mechanism of TIM-mediated protein import remains uncertain due to a lack of structural information on the complex. Here, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of the core TIM complex (Tim17-Tim23-Tim44) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that, contrary to the prevailing model, Tim23 and Tim17 do not form a water-filled channel, but instead have separate, lipid-exposed concave cavities that face in opposite directions. Remarkably, our data suggest that the cavity of Tim17 itself forms the protein translocation path whereas Tim23 plays a structural role. We also show how the Tim17-Tim23 heterodimer associates with the scaffold protein Tim44 and J-domain proteins to mediate Hsp70-driven polypeptide transport into the matrix. Our work provides the structural foundation to understand the mechanism of TIM-mediated protein import and sorting, a central pathway in mitochondrial biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology enables the engineering of interactions between living medicines to overcome the specific limitations of any singular therapy. One major challenge of tumor-antigen targeting therapies like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells is the identification of targetable antigens that are specifically and uniformly expressed on heterogenous solid tumors. In contrast, certain species of bacteria selectively colonize immune-privileged tumor cores and can be readily engineered as antigen-independent platforms for therapeutic delivery. Bridging these approaches, we develop a platform of probiotic-guided CAR-T cells (ProCARs), in which T cells are engineered to sense synthetic antigens (SA) that are produced and released by tumor-colonizing probiotic bacteria. We demonstrate increased CAR-T cell activation and tumor-cell lysis when SAs anchor to components of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, we show that ProCARs are intratumorally activated by probiotically-delivered SAs, receive further stimulation from bacterial TLR agonists, and are safe and effective in multiple xenograft models. This approach repurposes tumor-colonizing bacteria as beacons that guide the activity of engineered T cells, and in turn builds the foundation for communities of living medicines.",

    "abstract": "The P23H mutation in rhodopsin (Rho), the visual pigment protein in rod photoreceptor neurons, is the most common genetic cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a retinal disease that causes blindness. Despite multiple studies in animal models, the subcellular details of the fate of misfolded mutant Rho in rod photoreceptors have not been completely defined. We generated a new mouse model of adRP, in which the P23H-Rho mutant allele is fused to the fluorescent protein Tag-RFP-T (P23HhRhoRFP). In heterozygotes, outer segments formed, and WT rhodopsin was properly localized there, but mutant P23H-Rho protein was specifically mislocalized in the inner segments of rods. Despite this cellular phenotype, the P23HhRhoRFP heterozygous mice exhibited only slowly progressing retinal degeneration; in ERG recordings, scotopic a-wave amplitudes were reduced by 24% and 26% at 30 days and 90 days respectively, and the corresponding scotopic b-waves by 18% and 24%. Outer nuclear layer thickness was still 80% of WT at 90 days, but at 364 days had declined to 40% of WT. Transmission electron microscopy revealed greatly expanded membrane lamellae in the inner segment, and by fluorescence imaging, we determined that the mislocalized P23HhRhoRFP was contained in greatly expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. TUNEL staining revealed a slow pace of cell death involving chromosomal endonucleolytic degradation. Quantification of mRNA for markers of ER stress and the unfolded protein response revealed little or no increases in levels of messages encoding the proteins BiP, CHOP, ATF6, XBP1, PERK, Eif2 and Derlin-1, but a decreased level of total Rhodopsin (mouse + human) mRNA levels. The decline in the rate of cell death after an initial burst suggests that P23HhRhoRFP mutant rods undergo an adaptative process that prolongs survival despite gross P23HhRhoRFP protein accumulation in the ER. Because of its slowly progressing nature, and easy visualization of the mutant protein, the P23H-Rho-RFP mouse may represent a useful tool for the future study of the pathology and treatment of P23H-Rho and adRP.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic CD47 overexpression is an encouraging approach to ameliorating xenograft rejection and alloresponses to pluripotent stem cells, and the efficacy correlates with the level of CD47 expression. However, CD47, upon ligation, also transmits signals leading to cell dysfunction or death, raising a concern that overexpressing CD47 could be harmful. Here, we unveiled an alternative source of cell surface CD47. We showed that extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes (Exos), released from normal or tumor cells overexpressing CD47 (transgenic or native) can induce efficient CD47 cross-dressing on pig or human cells. Like the autogenous CD47, CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces is capable of interacting with SIRP to inhibit phagocytosis. However, ligation of the autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 induced cell death. Thus, CD47 cross-dressing provides an alternative source of cell surface CD47 that may elicit its anti-phagocytic function without transmitting harmful signals to the cells. CD47 cross-dressing also suggests a previously unidentified mechanism for tumor-induced immunosuppression. Our findings should help to further optimize the CD47 transgenic approach that may improve outcomes by minimizing the harmful effects of CD47 overexpression.",

M is thus a key target for antivirals, but few high-resolution structures of paramyxovirus M are available, and we lack the clear understanding of how viral M proteins interact with membrane lipids to mediate viral assembly and egress needed to guide antiviral design. Here, we reveal that M proteins associate with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the plasma membrane.

However, little is known about the nutritional and gut microbial factors associated with the risk of allergic rhinitis (AR). We recruited 186 apparently healthy workers with symptoms of AR and 106 controls at the Hitachi Health Care Center, Japan. The habitual consumption of 42 selected nutrients were examined using the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire. Faecal samples were collected and subjected to amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions. Association analysis revealed that four nutrients (retinol, vitamin A, cryptoxanthin, and copper) were negatively associated with AR. Among 40 genera examined, relative abundance of Prevotella and Escherichia were associated with AR. Furthermore, significant statistical interactions were observed between retinol and Prevotella. The age- and sex-adjusted odds of AR were 25-fold lower in subjects with high retinol intake and high Prevotella abundance compared to subjects with low retinol intake and low Prevotella abundance. Our data provide insights into complex interplay between dietary nutrients, gut microbiome, and the development of AR.",

    "abstract": "The ribosomal protein S21 (bS21) gene has been detected in diverse viruses with a large range of genome sizes, yet its in situ expression and potential significance have not been investigated. Here, we report five closely related clades of bacteriophages (phages) represented by 47 genomes (8 curated to completion and up to 331 kbp in length) that encode a bS21 gene. The bS21 gene is on the reverse strand within a conserved region that encodes the large terminase, major capsid protein, prohead protease, portal vertex proteins and some hypothetical proteins. These phages are predicted to infect Bacteroidetes species that inhabit a range of depths in freshwater lakes. Transcriptionally active bS21-encoding phages were sampled in the late-stage of replication, when core structural genes, bS21 and a neighboring gene of unknown function were highly expressed. Thus, our analyses suggest that bS21, which is involved in translation initiation, substitutes into the Bacteroidetes ribosomes and selects for phage transcripts during the late-stage replication when large-scale phage protein production is required for assembly of phage particles.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is in continuous interaction with the innermost layer of the gut, namely the epithelium. One of the various functions of the gut epithelium, is to keep the microbes at bay to avoid overstimulation of the underlying mucosa immune cells. To do so, the gut epithelia secrete a variety of antimicrobial peptides, such as chromogranin A (CgA) peptide catestatin (CST: hCgA352-372). As a defense mechanism, gut microbes have evolved antimicrobial resistance mechanisms to counteract the killing effect of the secreted peptides. To this end, we treated wild-type mice and CST knockout (CST-KO) mice (where only the 63 nucleotides encoding CST have been deleted) with CST for 15 consecutive days. CST treatment was associated with a shift in the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the CST-KO mice. This effect was less prominent in WT mice. Levels of the microbiota-produced short-chain fatty acids, in particular, butyrate and acetate were significantly increased in CST-treated CST-KO mice but not the WT group. Both CST-treated CST-KO and WT mice showed a significant increase in microbiota-harboring phosphoethanolamine transferase-encoding genes, which facilitate their antimicrobial resistance. Finally, we show that CST was degraded by Escherichia coli via an omptin-protease and that the abundance of this gene was significantly higher in metagenomic datasets collected from patients with Crohns disease but not with ulcerative colitis. Overall, this study illustrates how the endogenous antimicrobial peptide, CST, shapes the microbiota composition in the gut and primes further research to uncover the role of bacterial resistance to CST in disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in pre-mRNA processing factor 31 (PRPF31), a core protein of the spliceosomal tri-snRNP complex, cause autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). It has remained an enigma why mutations in ubiquitously expressed tri-snRNP proteins result in retina-specific disorders, and so far, the underlying mechanism of splicing factors-related RP is poorly understood. Here, we used iPSC technology to generate retinal organoids and RPE models from three patients with severe and very severe PRPF31-adRP, normal individuals and a CRISPR/Cas9-corrected isogenic control. To fully assess the impacts of PRPF31 mutations, quantitative proteomics analyses of retinal organoids and RPE cells was carried out showing RNA splicing, autophagy and lysosome, unfolded protein response (UPR) and visual cycle-related pathways to be significantly affected. Strikingly, the patient-derived RPE and retinal cells were characterised by the presence of large amounts of cytoplasmic aggregates containing the mutant PRPF31 and misfolded, ubiquitin-conjugated proteins including key visual cycle proteins, which accumulated progressively with time. Mutant PRPF31 variant was not incorporated into splicing complexes, but reduction of PRPF31 wildtype levels led to tri-snRNP assembly defects in Cajal bodies of PRPF31 patient retinal cells with reduced U4/U6 snRNPs and accumulation of U5, smaller nuclear speckles and reduced formation of active spliceosomes giving rise to global splicing dysregulation. Moreover, the impaired waste disposal mechanisms further exacerbated aggregate formation, and targeting these by activating the autophagy pathway using Rapamycin resulted in reduction of cytoplasmic aggregates and improved cell survival. Our data demonstrate that it is the progressive aggregate accumulation that overburdens the waste disposal machinery rather than direct PRPF31-initiated mis-splicing, and thus relieving the RPE cells from insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates presents a novel therapeutic strategy that can be combined with gene therapy studies to fully restore RPE and retinal cell function in PRPF31-adRP patients.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPRPF31 RP mutations lead to formation of insoluble aggregates containing the mutant PRPF31 and misfolded, ubiquitin conjugated proteins including key visual cycle proteins (e.g. RLBP1) in RPE cells, which accumulate progressively with time and affect tight junctions and cell survival.\nC_LIO_LIMutant PRPF31 is predominantly localised in cytoplasmic aggregates of patient specific RPE and retinal cells and is not able to be incorporated into splicing complexes to cause direct mis-splicing.\nC_LIO_LIHigh-throughput quantitative proteomics identifies significantly altered RNA splicing, visual perception, retinoid metabolism, waste disposal and unfolded protein response pathways in patient RPE cells, and autophagy and lysosome, unfolded protein response (UPR) and visual cycle-related pathways in photoreceptor cells.\nC_LIO_LIAccumulation of PRPF31 mutant variant as cytoplasmic aggregates reduces wildtype PRPF31 in the nucleus leading to tri-snRNP assembly defects, characterised by accumulation of U5 and reduction of U4/U6 snRNPs in Cajal bodies, altered morphology of nuclear speckles and consequently downregulation of active spliceosomes (Bact and C complexes) in PRPF31 patient RPE and retinal cells.\nC_LIO_LIProteomic study of insoluble aggregates identifies other RP-linked splicing factors and multiple key retinal-specific proteins, whose variants are linked to retinitis pigmentosa, within the aggregates of patient RPE cells.\nC_LIO_LIPRPF31 patient RPE cells have impaired waste disposal and proteasome mediated degradation, which together with the impaired autophagy pathway, further exacerbate aggregate formation.\nC_LIO_LIPhagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segment fragments (POS) shed daily by RPE cells accelerates aggregation of key proteins indicating enhanced cytoplasmic aggregate formation under physiological conditions in patient RPE cells.\nC_LIO_LIActivation of autophagy via administration of rapamycin results in reduction of cytoplasmic aggregates in RPE cells, correct localisation of mislocated and misfolded proteins to the nucleus, thereby improving cell survival.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Circular shell rings along the Atlantic Coast of southeastern North America are the remnants of some of the earliest villages that emerged during the Late Archaic Period (5000 - 3000 BP). Many of these villages, however, were abandoned during the Terminal Late Archaic Period (ca 3800 - 3000 BP). Here, we combine Bayesian chronological modeling with multiple environmental proxies to understand the nature and timing of environmental change associated with the emergence and abandonment of shell ring villages on Sapleo Island, Georgia. Our Bayesian models indicate that Native Americans occupied the three Sapelo shell rings at varying times with some generational overlap. By the end of the complexs occupation, only Ring III was occupied before abandonment ca. 3845 BP. Ring III also consists of statistically smaller oysters (Crassostrea virginica) that people harvested from less saline estuaries compared to earlier occupations. These data, when integrated with recent tree ring analyses, show a clear pattern of environmental instability throughout the period in which the rings were occupied. We argue that as the climate became unstable around 4300 BP, aggregation at shell ring villages provided a way to effectively manage fisheries that are highly sensitive to environmental change. However, with the eventual collapse of oyster fisheries and subsequent rebound in environmental conditions ca. 3800 BP, people dispersed from shell rings, and shifted to non-marine subsistence economies and other types of settlements. This study provides the most comprehensive evidence correlations between large-scale environmental change and societal transformations on the Georgia coast during the Late Archaic period.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is a proxy for mitochondrial function and has been of increasing interest to the mitochondrial research community. There are a number of ways to measure mtDNA-CN, ranging from qPCR to whole genome sequencing [1]. A recent article in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics [2] described a novel method for measuring mtDNA-CN that is both inexpensive and reproducible. After adapting the assay for use in our lab, we have found it to be reproducible and well-correlated with mtDNA-CN derived from whole genome sequencing. However, certain individuals show poor concordance between the two measures, particularly individuals with qPCR mtDNA-CN measurements >3 standard deviations below the sample mean, which corresponds to roughly 1% of assayed individuals (Figure 1). After examining whole genome sequencing data, this seems to be due to specific polymorphisms within the D-loop primer region, at positions MT 338, 340, 452, 457, 458, 460, 461, 466, and 467. All individuals with a variant in at least one of these positions have non-concordant mtDNA-CN measurements.

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major concern for wildlife and ecosystem health globally. Genetic determinants of AMR have become indicators of anthropogenic pollution due to their greater association with humans and rarer presence in environments less affected by humans. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution and frequency of the class 1 integron, a genetic determinant of AMR, in both the faecal microbiome and in Escherichia coli isolated from neonates of three pinniped species. Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) and long-nosed fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) pups from eight breeding colonies along the Southern Australian coast were sampled between 2016-2019. DNA from faecal samples (n=309) and from E. coli (n=795) isolated from 884 faecal samples were analysed for class 1 integrons using PCRs targeting the conserved integrase gene (intI) and the gene cassette array. Class 1 integrons were detected in A. p. doriferus and N. cinerea pups sampled at seven of the eight breeding colonies investigated in 4.85% of faecal samples (n=15) and 4.52% of E. coli isolates (n=36). Integrons were not detected in any A. forsteri samples. DNA sequencing of the class 1 integron gene cassette array identified diverse genes conferring resistance to four antibiotic classes. The relationship between class 1 integron carriage and the concentration of five trace elements and heavy metals was also investigated, finding no significant association. The results of this study add to the growing evidence of the extent to which antimicrobial resistant bacteria are polluting the marine environment. As AMR determinants are frequently associated with bacterial pathogens, their occurrence suggests that these pinniped species are vulnerable to potential health risks. The implications for individual and population health as a consequence of AMR carriage is a critical component of ongoing health investigations.",

    "abstract": "The Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) is a set of seven Klebsiella taxa which are found in a variety of niches, and are an important cause of opportunistic healthcare-associated infections in humans. Due to increasing rates of multi-drug resistance within the KpSC, there is a growing interest in better understanding the biology and metabolism of these organisms to inform novel control strategies. We collated 37 sequenced KpSC isolates isolated from a variety of niches, representing all seven taxa. We generated strain-specific genome scale metabolic models (GEMs) for all 37 isolates and simulated growth phenotypes on 511 distinct carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus substrates. Models were curated and their accuracy assessed using matched phenotypic growth data for 94 substrates (median accuracy of 96%). We explored species-specific growth capabilities and examined the impact of all possible single gene deletions on growth in 145 core carbon substrates. These analyses revealed multiple strain-specific differences, within and between species and highlight the importance of selecting a diverse range of strains when exploring KpSC metabolism. This diverse set of highly accurate GEMs could be used to inform novel drug design, enhance genomic analyses, and identify novel virulence and resistance determinants. We envisage that these 37 curated strain-specific GEMs, covering all seven taxa of the KpSC, provide a valuable resource to the Klebsiella research community.",

    "abstract": "In this study, 5 sterols were isolated and purified from Laminaria japonica, commonly known as edible brown seaweed, and their structures were identified based on detailed chemical methods and spectroscopic analyses. Spectroscopic analyses characterized 5 sterols as 29-Hydroperoxy-stigmasta-5,24(28)-dien-3{beta}-ol, saringosterol (24-vinyl-cholest-5-ene-3{beta},24-diol), 24-methylenecholesterol, fucosterol (stigmasta-5,24-diene-3{beta}-ol), and 24-Hydroperoxy-24-vinyl-cholesterol. The bioactivities of these sterols were tested using lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2) enzyme inhibitory assays. Fucosterol exhibited the highest COX-1 and -2 enzyme inhibitory activities at 59 and 47%, respectively. Saringosterol, 24-methylenecholesterol and fucosterol showed higher LPO inhibitory activity at >50% than the other compounds. In addition, the results of molecular docking revealed that the 5 sterols were located in different pocket of COX-1 and -2 and fucosterol with tetracyclic skeletons and olefin methine achieved the highest binding energy (-7.85 and -9.02 kcal/mol) through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond. Our results confirm the presence of 5 sterols in L. japonica and its significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/463984v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c3f43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad7385org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b3c4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3675a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LISterols 29-hydroperoxy-stigmasta-5,24(28)-dien-3{beta}-ol and 24-hydroperoxy-24-vinyl-cholesterol are identified for the first time in L. japonica.\nC_LIO_LISaringosterol, 24-methylenecholesterol and fucosterol showed strong LPO inhibitory activity.\nC_LIO_LIFucosterol showed highest binding affinity for COX-1 and -2 enzymes through hydrophobic interactions.\nC_LI",
