    "abstract": "Since the pioneering work of Thomas Gold published in 1948, it has been known that we owe our sensitive sense of hearing to a process in the inner ear that can amplify incident sounds on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Termed the active process, it uses energy to counteract the viscous dissipation associated with sound-evoked vibrations of the ears mechanotransduction apparatus. Despite its importance, the mechanism of the active process and the proximate source of energy that powers it have remained elusive--especially at the high frequencies characteristic of mammalian hearing. This is partly due to our insufficient understanding of the mechanotransduction process in hair cells, the sensory receptors and amplifiers of the inner ear. It has previously been proposed that a cyclical binding of Ca2+ ions to individual mechanotransduction channels could power the active process. That model, however, relied on tailored reaction rates that structurally forced the direction of the cycle. Here, we ground our study on our previous model of hair-cell mechanotransduction, which relied on the cooperative gating of pairs of channels, and incorporate into it the cyclical binding of Ca2+ ions. With a single binding site per channel and reaction rates drawn from thermodynamic principles, our model shows that hair cells behave as nonlinear oscillators that exhibit Hopf bifurcations, dynamical instabilities long understood to be signatures of the active process. Using realistic parameter values, we find bifurcations at frequencies in the kilohertz range with physiological Ca2+ concentrations. In contrast to the myosin-based mechanism, responsible for low-frequency relaxation oscillations in the vestibular hair cells of amphibians, the current model relies on the electrochemical gradient of Ca2+ as the only energy source for the active process and on the relative motion of cooperative channels within the stereociliary membrane as the single mechanical driver. Equipped with these two mechanisms, a hair bundle proves capable of operating at frequencies in the kilohertz range, characteristic of mammalian hearing.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHow the inner ear amplifies incident sounds at audible frequencies of several kilohertz is a key question that has remained unanswered despite decades of research into several candidate mechanisms. Here, we model the behavior of hair cells, the sensory receptors of the inner ear, and show that they can undergo oscillatory instabilities called Hopf bifurcations due to the effect of Ca2+ on the cooperative opening and closing of mechanotransduction ion channels. Close to the bifurcation point, a hair cell behaves as a nonlinear oscillator that can amplify its input on a cycle-by-cycle basis. We find that our proposed mechanism can operate in the kilohertz range.",

    "abstract": "The end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) led to a severe terrestrial ecosystem collapse. However, the ecological response of insects--the most diverse group of organisms on Earth--to the EPME remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse beetle evolutionary history based on taxonomic diversity, morphological disparity, phylogeny, and ecological shifts from the Early Permian to Middle Triassic, using a comprehensive new data set. Permian beetles were dominated by xylophagous stem groups with a high diversity and disparity, which probably played an underappreciated role in the Permian carbon cycle. Our suite of analyses shows that Permian xylophagous beetles suffered a severe extinction during the EPME largely due to the collapse of forest ecosystems, resulting in an Early Triassic gap of xylophagous beetles. New xylophagous beetles appeared widely in the early Middle Triassic, which is consistent with the restoration of forest ecosystems. Our results highlight the ecological significance of insects in deep-time terrestrial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is closely associated with the pathogenesis of many metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes. There is increasing evidence for the interdependence of the UPR and metabolic signaling pathways. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway controls energy balance in eukaryotes. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible interaction between AMPK signaling and the UPR in muscle cells exposed to a saturated fatty acid, as well as the underlying mechanism. The UPR was induced in C2C12 myotubes by treatment with palmitate along with activation of AMPK signaling. Inhibiting the AMPK pathway with compound C attenuated palmitate-induced UPR activation, while inhibiting the UPR with taurourdodeoxycholic acid alleviated palmitate-induced AMPK activation, suggesting a positive feedback loop between the UPR and AMPK. Additionally, 5-amino-1-{beta}-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide, an AMPK agonist, caused a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of genes related to the UPR, including activating transcription factor (ATF)4, binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD)34. These results provide the first evidence for the involvement of AMPK signaling in the early activation of the UPR induced by saturated fatty acid in skeletal muscle, and suggest that physiologic or pharmacologic activation of the AMPK pathway (ie, by exercise or metformin, respectively) can promote skeletal muscle health and function and thus improve quality of life for individuals with metabolic disorder due to a high-fat diet or obesity.",

    "abstract": "In neurons, endoplasmic reticulum forms a highly dynamic network that enters axons and presynaptic terminals and plays a central role in Ca2+ homeostasis and synapse maintenance. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in regulation of its dynamic remodeling as well as its function in axon development and presynaptic differentiation remain elusive. Here, we used high resolution microscopy and live cell imaging to investigate rapid movements of endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes in axons of cultured motoneurons after stimulation with Brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Our results indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum extends into axonal growth cone filopodia where its integrity and dynamic remodeling are regulated mainly by actin and its motor protein myosin VI. Additionally, we found that in axonal growth cones, ribosomes assemble into 80S subunits within seconds and associate with ER in response to extracellular stimuli which describes a novel function of axonal ER in dynamic regulation of local translation.\n\nSummary statementIn axonal growth cones of motoneurons, dynamic remodeling of ER is coordinated through drebrin A-mediated actin and microtubule crosstalk and contributes to local translation as response to BDNF stimulation.",

High numbers of CD8+ T cells are found in MS lesions and antigen (Ag)-presentation at the BBB was proposed to promote CD8+ T-cell entry into the CNS. Employing live cell imaging and primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (pMBMECs) as in vitro model of the BBB and a mouse model of CNS autoimmunity, we here show that pMBMECs process and present antigens leading to effector CD8+ T-cell differentiation. Under physiological flow, endothelial Ag-presentation prohibited CD8+ T-cell crawling and diapedesis leading to pMBMEC apoptosis. Reduced motility of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells was also observed in CNS microvessels in neuroinflammation in vivo.

However, it is unknown if antibodies elicited by infection with these variants target the same or different regions of the viral spike as antibodies elicited by earlier viral isolates. Here we compare the specificities of polyclonal antibodies produced by humans infected with early 2020 isolates versus the B.1.351 variant of concern (also known as Beta or 20H/501Y.V2), which contains mutations in multiple key spike epitopes. The serum neutralizing activity of antibodies elicited by infection with both early 2020 viruses and B.1.351 is heavily focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, within the RBD, B.1.351-elicited antibodies are more focused on the \"class 3\" epitope spanning sites 443 to 452, and neutralization by these antibodies is notably less affected by mutations at residue 484.

    "abstract": "Arsenic is an environmental toxin that exists mainly as pentavalent arsenate and trivalent arsenite. Both forms activate the yeast SAPK Hog1, but with different consequences. We describe a mechanism by which cells distinguish between these arsenicals through one-step metabolism to differentially regulate the bidirectional glycerol channel Fps1, an adventitious port for arsenite. Cells exposed to arsenate reduce it to thiol-reactive arsenite, which modifies a set of cysteine residues in target proteins; whereas cells exposed to arsenite metabolize it to methylarsenite, which modifies an additional set of cysteine residues. Hog1 becomes arsenylated, which prevents it from closing Fps1. However, this block is overcome in cells exposed to arsenite through methylarsenylation of Acr3, an arsenite efflux pump that we found also regulates Fps1 directly. This adaptation allows cells to restrict arsenite entry through Fps1, but also allows its exit when produced from arsenate exposure. These results have broad implications for understanding how SAPKs activated by diverse stressors can drive stress-specific outputs.\n\nSummary (for JCB table of contents)\n\nJongmin Lee, David E. Levin\n\nLee and Levin investigate the question of how different stressors can drive divergent outputs from an active SAPK.

    "abstract": "Many plants rely on animal mutualists for reproduction. Quantifying how animal mutualists impact plant performance provides a foundation for modelling how change in animal communities affects the composition and functioning of plant communities. We performed a meta-analysis of 2539 experiments, 6 times more than the last comprehensive meta-analysis, examining how gut passage by frugivores influences seed germination. We simultaneously analyzed multiple predictor variables related to study methodology, location, and frugivore identity to disentangle methodological from ecological impacts on effect sizes. We found that gut passage by birds, fish, reptiles, bats, primates, and other mammals on average increased seed germination, but that the magnitude varied across vertebrate groups. The positive effects of gut passage were largely explained by the de-inhibitory effects of pulp removal rather than by the scarification of seed tissues. Some previous studies and meta-analyses that found no effect of gut passage only tested scarification or did not distinguish between these tests of scarification and pulp removal. We found that, for a typical fleshy-fruited plant species, the lack of gut passage reduces germination by 60%. From an evolutionary perspective, this indicates a large risk associated with reliance on animal mutualists that is balanced against the benefits of animal-mediated seed dispersal. From a conservation perspective, this highlights the potential for large demographic consequences of frugivore declines on plant populations. Our database and findings advance quantitative predictions for the role of fruit-frugivore interactions in shaping plant communities in the Anthropocene.",

Here, we identify predominant gut microbial species sharing a parallel evolutionary history with human populations. Patterns of strain transfer between populations are generally consistent with an African origin, and suggest long-term vertical transmission over thousands of generations. We show the same strains also faithfully transmit between mothers and their children. Consistent with the development of intimate symbiosis, species with strongest patterns of codiversification have the smallest genomes. This study reveals long-term fidelity of gut microbiota with human populations through transmission among individuals living in close proximity.

    "abstract": "Gene drives have shown great promise for suppression of pest populations. These engineered alleles can function by a variety of mechanisms, but the most common is the CRISPR homing drive, which converts wild-type alleles to drive alleles in the germline of heterozygotes. Some potential target species are haplodiploid, in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and thus have only one copy of each chromosome. This prevents drive conversion, a substantial disadvantage compared to diploids where drive conversion can take place in both sexes. Here, we study homing suppression gene drives in haplodiploids and find that a drive targeting a female fertility gene could still be successful. However, such drives are less powerful than in diploids and suffer more from functional resistance alleles. They are substantially more vulnerable to high resistance allele formation in the embryo due to maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNA and also to somatic cleavage activity. Examining spatial models where organisms move over a continuous landscape, we find that haplodiploid suppression drives surprisingly perform nearly as well as in diploids, possibly due to their ability to spread further before inducing strong suppression. Together, these results indicate that gene drive can potentially be used to effectively suppress haplodiploid populations.",

    "abstract": "Many animals are dependent on microbial partners that provide essential nutrients lacking from their diet. Ticks, whose diet consists exclusively on vertebrate blood, rely on maternally inherited bacterial symbionts to supply B vitamins. While previously studied tick species consistently harbor a single lineage of those nutritional symbionts, we evidence here that the invasive tick Hyalomma marginatum harbors a unique dual-partner nutritional system between an ancestral symbiont, Francisella, and a more recently acquired symbiont, Midichloria. Using metagenomics, we show that Francisella exhibits extensive genome erosion that endangers the nutritional symbiotic interactions: Its genome includes folate and riboflavin biosynthesis pathways but deprived functional biotin biosynthesis on account of massive pseudogenization. Co-symbiosis compensates this deficiency since the Midichloria genome encompasses an intact biotin operon, which was primarily acquired via lateral gene transfer from unrelated intracellular bacteria commonly infecting arthropods. Thus, in H. marginatum, a mosaic of co-evolved symbionts incorporating gene combinations of distant phylogenetic origins emerged to prevent the collapse of an ancestral nutritional symbiosis. Such dual endosymbiosis was never reported in other blood feeders but was recently documented in agricultural pests feeding on plant sap, suggesting that it may be a key mechanism for advanced adaptation of arthropods to specialized diets.",

    "abstract": "Infections from the SARS-CoV-2 virus have killed over 4.6 million people since it began spreading through human populations in late 2019. In order to develop a therapeutic or prophylactic antibody to help mitigate the effects of the pandemic, a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was isolated from a convalescent patient following recovery from COVID-19 disease. This mAb, designated AUG-3387, demonstrates a high affinity for the spike protein of the original viral strains and all variants tested to date. In vitro pseudovirus neutralization and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity has been demonstrated in vitro. In addition, a dry powder formulation has been prepared using a Thin-Film Freezing (TFF) process that exhibited a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 50.95 {+/-} 7.69% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 3.74 {+/-} 0.73 {micro}m and 2.73 {+/-} 0.20, respectively. The dry powder is suitable for delivery directly to the lungs of infected patients using a dry powder inhaler device. Importantly, AUG-3387, administered as a liquid by intraperitoneal injection or the dry powder formulation delivered intratracheally into Syrian hamsters 24 hours after intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in the lung viral load of the virus. These data suggest that AUG-3387 formulated as a dry powder demonstrates potential to treat COVID-19.",

Efforts are being made to understand the potential cross-protective immunity of memory T cells, induced by prior encounters with seasonal coronaviruses, in providing protection against severe COVID-19. In this study we assessed T-cell responses directed against highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2. Epitope mapping revealed 16 CD8+ T-cell epitopes across the nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) and ORF3a proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and five CD8+ T-cell epitopes encoded within the highly conserved regions of the ORF1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative sequence analysis showed high conservation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab T-cell epitopes in seasonal coronaviruses. Paradoxically, the immune responses directed against the conserved ORF1ab epitopes were infrequent and subdominant in both convalescent and unexposed participants. This subdominant immune response was consistent with a low abundance of ORF1ab encoded proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Overall, these observations suggest that while cross-reactive CD8+ T cells likely exist in unexposed individuals, they are not common and therefore are unlikely to play a significant role in providing broad pre-existing immunity in the community.",

    "abstract": "Blood clots are a central feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and can culminate in pulmonary embolism, stroke, and sudden death. However, it is not known how abnormal blood clots form in COVID-19 or why they occur even in asymptomatic and convalescent patients. Here we report that the Spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen and induces structurally abnormal blood clots with heightened proinflammatory activity. SARS-CoV-2 Spike virions enhanced fibrin-mediated microglia activation and induced fibrinogen-dependent lung pathology. COVID-19 patients had fibrin autoantibodies that persisted long after acute infection. Monoclonal antibody 5B8, targeting the cryptic inflammatory fibrin epitope, inhibited thromboinflammation. Our results reveal a procoagulant role for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and propose fibrin-targeting interventions as a treatment for thromboinflammation in COVID-19.\n\nOne-Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 spike induces structurally abnormal blood clots and thromboinflammation neutralized by a fibrin-targeting antibody.",

While genetic surveys suggest these organisms rely on in situ carbon fixation, rather than the translocation of photosynthetically derived organic carbon4-6, corroborating measurements of carbon fixation in the subsurface are absent. Using a novel ultra-low level 14C-labeling technique, we show that in situ carbon fixation rates in a carbonate aquifer reached 10% of the median rates measured in oligotrophic marine surface waters, and were up to six-fold greater than those observed in lower euphotic zone waters where deep chlorophyll levels peak. Empirical carbon fixation rates were substantiated by both nitrification and anammox rate data. Metagenomic analyses revealed a remarkable abundance of putative chemolithoautotrophic members of an uncharacterized order of Nitrospiria - the first representatives of this class expected to fix carbon via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Based on these fixation rates, we extrapolate global primary production in carbonate groundwaters to be 0.11 Pg of carbon per year.",

    "abstract": "Methanosarcina acetivorans is the primary model to understand the physiology of methanogens that do not use hydrogenase to consume or produce hydrogen (H2) during methanogenesis. The genome of M. acetivorans encodes putative methanophenazine-reducing hydrogenases (Vht and Vhx), F420-reducing hydrogenase (Frh), and hydrogenase maturation machinery (Hyp), yet cells lack significant hydrogenase activity under all growth conditions tested to date. Thus, the importance of hydrogenase to the physiology of M. acetivorans has remained a mystery. M. acetivorans can fix dinitrogen (N2) using nitrogenase that is documented in bacteria to produce H2 during the reduction of N2 to ammonia. Therefore, we hypothesized that M. acetivorans uses hydrogenase to recycle H2 produced by nitrogenase during N2 fixation. Results demonstrate that hydrogenase expression and activity is higher in N2-grown cells compared to cells grown with fixed nitrogen (NH4Cl). To test the importance of each hydrogenase and the maturation machinery, the CRISPRi-dCas9 system was used to generate separate M. acetivorans strains where transcription of the vht, frh, vhx, or hyp operons is repressed. Repression of vhx and frh does not alter growth with either NH4Cl or N2 and has no effect on H2 metabolism. However, repression of vht or hyp results in impaired growth with N2 but not NH4Cl. Importantly, H2 produced endogenously by nitrogenase is detected in the headspace of culture tubes containing the vht or hyp repression strains. Overall, the results reveal that Vht hydrogenase recycles H2 produced by nitrogenase that is required for optimal growth of M. acetivorans during N2 fixation.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe metabolism of M. acetivorans and closely related Methanosarcinales is thought to not involve H2. Here we show for the first time M. acetivorans is capable of H2 cycling like hydrogenotrophic Methanosarcinales (e.g., Methanosarcina barkeri). However, unlike M. barkeri hydrogenase activity and H2 cycling is tightly regulated in M. acetivorans and is only utilized during N2 fixation to consume H2 production endogenously by nitrogenase. The in vivo production of H2 by nitrogenase during N2 reduction is also demonstrated for the first time in a methanogen. Overall, the results provide new insight into the evolution and diversity of methanogen metabolism and new details about methanogen nitrogenase that could be leveraged for practical applications, such as nitrogenase-dependent production of H2 as a biofuel.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe intestinal microbiome is closely related to host health, and metatranscriptomic analysis can assess the functional activity of microbiomes by quantifying the bacterial gene expression level, which helps to elucidate the interaction between the microbiome and the environment. However, functional changes in the microbiome along the host intestinal tract remain unknown, and previous analytical methods have limitations, such as potentially overlooking unknown genes due to dependence on existing databases and being unable to take full advantage of metatranscriptome to reveal the functional change among multiple environments.\n\nResultTo close these gaps, we develop a novel method that integrates metagenome and metatranscriptome to analyze the functional activity of microbiomes between intestinal sites. This method reconstructs a reference metagenomic sequence across multiple intestinal sites, allowing the gene expression levels of microbiome including unknown bacterial genes to be compared between multiple sites. As a result of applying this method to metatranscriptomic analysis in the intestinal tract of common marmoset, the reconstructed metagenome covered most of the expressed genes and it revealed that the changes in bacterial gene expressions among the caecum, transverse colon, and faeces were more dynamic and sensitive to environmental shifts than its abundance. In typical, the coenzyme synthesis gene and antibacterial resistance gene were more highly expressed in the caecum and transverse colon than in faeces, while there was no significant change in abundance of these genes.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate that an analytical method that integrates metagenome and metatranscriptome in multiple intestinal sites captures functional changes in the microbiomes at the gene resolution level.",

Viruses play a key role in regulating other microbial ecosystems, but little is known about how the FRT viruses (virome), particularly bacteriophages, impacts FRT health and dysbiosis. We hypothesize that bacterial vaginosis is associated with alterations in the FRT virome, and these changes correlate with bacteriome shifts. We conducted a retrospective, longitudinal analysis of vaginal swabs collected from 54 bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive and 46 BV-negative South African women. Bacteriome analysis revealed samples clustered into five distinct bacterial community groups (CG). Bacterial alpha diversity was significantly associated with BV. Virome analysis on a subset of baseline samples showed FRT bacteriophages clustering into novel viral state types (VSTs), a viral community clustering system based on virome composition and abundance. Distinct BV bacteriophage signatures included increased alpha diversity along with Bacillus, Burkholderia and Escherichia bacteriophages. Discriminate bacteriophage-bacteria transkingdom associations were also identified between Bacillus and Burkholderia viruses and BV-associated bacteria, providing key insight for future studies elucidating transkingdom interactions driving BV-associated microbiome perturbations. In this cohort, bacteriophage-bacterial associations suggest complex interactions which may play a role in the establishment and maintenance of BV.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological projections point to acquisition of ever-expanding multidrug resistance (MDR) by Escherichia coli, a commensal of the digestive tract acting as a source of urinary tract pathogens. We performed a high-throughput genetic screening of predominantly clinical E. coli isolates from wide geographical origins. This revealed a preferential distribution of the Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor 1 (CNF1)-toxin encoding gene, cnf1, in four sequence types encompassing the pandemic E. coli MDR lineage ST131. This lineage is responsible for a majority of extraintestinal infections that escape first-line antibiotic treatment and has known enhanced capacities to colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Statistical modeling uncovered a dominant global expansion of cnf1-positive strains within multidrug-resistant ST131 subclade H30Rx/C2. Despite the absence of phylogeographical signals, cnf1-positive isolates adopted a clonal distribution into clusters on the ST131-H30Rx/C2 phylogeny, sharing a similar profile of virulence factors and the same cnf1 allele. Functional analysis of the cnf1-positive clinical strain EC131GY ST131-H30Rx/C2, established that a cnf1-deleted EC131GY is outcompeted by the wildtype strain in a mouse model of competitive infection of the bladder while both strains behave similarly during monoinfections. This points for positive selection of cnf1 during UTI rather than urovirulence. Wildtype EC131GY also outcompeted the mutant when concurrently inoculated into the gastrointestinal tract, arguing for selection within the gut. Whatever the site of selection, these findings support that the benefit of cnf1 enhancing host colonization by ST131-H30Rx/C2 in turn drives a worldwide dissemination of the cnf1 gene together with extended spectrum of antibiotic resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an important means by which to study the urine microbiome and is emerging as possible alternative to urine cultures to identify pathogens that cause urinary tract infection (UTI). However, PCR is limited by its inability to differentiate DNA originating from viable, metabolically active versus non-viable, inactive bacteria. This drawback has led to concerns that urobiome studies and PCR-based diagnosis of UTI are confounded by the presence of relic DNA from non-viable bacteria in urine. Propidium monoazide (PMA) dye can penetrate cells with compromised cell membranes and covalently bind to DNA, rendering it inaccessible to amplification by PCR. Although PMA has been shown to differentiate between non-viable and viable bacteria in various settings, its effectiveness in urine has not been previously studied. We sought to investigate the ability of PMA to differentiate between viable and non-viable bacteria in urine.\n\nMethodsVarying amounts of viable or non-viable uropathogenic E. coli (UTI89) or buffer control were titrated with mouse urine. The samples were centrifuged to collect urine sediment or not centrifuged. Urine samples were incubated with PMA and DNA cross-linked using blue LED light. DNA was isolated and uidA gene-specific PCR was performed. For in vivo studies, mice were inoculated with UTI89, followed by ciprofloxacin treatment or no treatment. After the completion of ciprofloxacin treatment, an aliquot of urine was plated on non-selective LB agar and another aliquot was treated with PMA and subjected to uidA-specific PCR.\n\nResultsPMAs efficiency in excluding DNA signal from non-viable bacteria was significantly higher in bacterial samples in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, dCT=13.69) versus bacterial samples in unspun urine (dCT=1.58). This discrepancy was diminished by spinning down urine-based bacterial samples to collect sediment and resuspending it in PBS prior to PMA treatment. In 3 of 5 replicate groups of UTI89-infected mice, no bacteria grew in culture; however, there was PCR amplification of E. coli after PMA treatment in 2 of those 3 groups.\n\nConclusionWe have successfully developed PMA-based PCR methods for amplifying DNA from live bacteria in urine. Our results suggest that non-PMA bound DNA from live bacteria can be present in urine, even after antibiotic treatment.\n\nThis indicates that viable but non-culturable E. coli can be present following treatment of UTI, and may explain why some patients have persistent symptoms but negative urine cultures following UTI treatment.",

In this paper, we show that lack of TPS1, which is known to trigger apoptosis in S. cerevisiae, induces localization of active Ras proteins in mitochondria, confirming the above-mentioned correlation. Next, by characterizing the ras1{Delta} and ras2{Delta} mutants concerning localization of active Ras proteins and propensity to undergo cell death, we show that active Ras2 proteins, which accumulate in the mitochondria following addition of acetic acid, a well-known pro-apoptotic stimulus, might be the GTPases involved in regulated cell death, while active Ras1 proteins, constitutively localized in mitochondria, might be involved in a pro-survival molecular machinery. Finally, by characterizing the gpa2{Delta} and cyr1{Delta} mutants concerning the propensity to undergo cell death, we show that active mitochondrial Ras proteins promote apoptosis through the cAMP/PKA pathway.",

    "abstract": "Plants activate immunity upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Although phytopathogens have evolved a set of effector proteins to counteract plant immunity, some effectors are perceived by hosts and induce immune responses. Here, we show that two secreted ribonuclease effectors, SRN1 and SRN2, encoded in a phytopathogenic fungus, Colletotrichum orbiculare, induce cell death in a signal peptide- and catalytic residue-dependent manner, when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The pervasive presence of SRN genes across Colletotrichum species suggested the conserved roles. Using a transient gene expression system in cucumber (Cucumis sativus), an original host of C. orbiculare, we show that SRN1 and SRN2 potentiate host pattern-triggered immunity. Consistent with this, C. orbiculare SRN1 and SRN2 deletion mutants exhibited increased virulence on the host. In vitro analysis revealed that SRN1 specifically cleaves single-stranded RNAs at guanosine, leaving a 3'-end phosphate. This activity has not been reported in plants. Importantly, the potentiation of C. sativus responses by SRN1 and SRN2 depends on the signal peptide and ribonuclease catalytic residues, suggesting that secreted SRNs cleave RNAs in apoplast and are detected by the host. We propose that the pathogen-derived apoplastic guanosine-specific single-stranded endoribonucleases lead to immunity potentiation in plants.",

Of these, six represent the first full-length paramyxovirus genomes sequenced from the Americas, including two sequences which are the first full-length bat morbillivirus genomes published to date. Our findings add to the vast number of viral sequences in public repositories that have been increasing considerably in recent years due to the rising accessibility of metagenomics. Taxonomic classification of these sequences in the absence of phenotypic data has been a significant challenge, particularly in the paramyxovirus subfamily Orthoparamyxovirinae, where the rate of discovery of novel sequences has been substantial. Using pairwise amino acid sequence classification (PASC), we describe a novel genus within this subfamily tentatively named Jeishaanvirus, which we propose should include as subgenera Jeilongvirus, Shaanvirus, and a novel South American subgenus Cadivirus. We also highlight inconsistencies in the classification of Tupaia virus and Mojiang virus using the same demarcation criteria and show that members of the proposed subgenus Shaanvirus are paraphyletic.

    "abstract": "Infection of peripheral axons by alpha herpesviruses (AHVs) is a critical stage in establishing a life-long infection in the host. Upon entering the cytoplasm of axons, AHV nucleocapsids and associated inner-tegument proteins must engage the cellular retrograde transport machinery to promote the long-distance movement of virion components to the nucleus. The current model outlining this process is incomplete and further investigation is required to discover all viral and cellular determinants involved as well as the temporality of the events. Using a modified tri-chamber system, we have discovered a novel role of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) serine/threonine kinase, US3, in promoting efficient retrograde transport of nucleocapsids. We discovered that transporting nucleocapsids move at similar velocities both in the presence and absence of a functional US3 kinase; however fewer nucleocapsids are moving when US3 is absent and move for shorter periods of time before stopping, suggesting US3 is required for efficient nucleocapsid engagement with the retrograde transport machinery. This led to fewer nucleocapsids reaching the cell bodies to produce a productive infection 12hr later. Furthermore, US3 was responsible for the induction of local translation in axons as early as 1hpi through the stimulation of a PI3K/Akt-mToRC1. These data describe a novel role for US3 in the induction of local translation in axons during AHV infection, a critical step in transport of nucleocapsids to the cell body.\n\nImportanceNeurons are highly polarized cells with axons that can reach centimeters in length. Communication between axons at the periphery and the distant cell body is a relatively slow process involving the active transport of chemical messengers. Theres a need for axons to respond rapidly to extracellular stimuli. Translation of repressed mRNAs present within the axon occurs to enable rapid, localized responses independently of the cell body. AHVs have evolved a way to hijack local translation in the axons to promote their transport to the nucleus. We have determined the cellular mechanism and viral components involved in the induction of axonal translation. The US3 serine/threonine kinase of PRV activates Akt-mToRC1 signaling pathways early during infection to promote axonal translation. When US3 is not present, the number of moving nucleocapsids and their processivity are reduced, suggesting that US3 activity is required for efficient engagement of nucleocapsids with the retrograde transport machinery.",

    "abstract": "During the development of the male germline, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) originate from gonocytes that differentiate from primordial germ cells (PGCs). In the developing and regenerating mouse testis, expression of the gene LIM homeobox 1 (Lhx1) marks the most undifferentiated SSCs. However, an enrichment of Lhx1 expression in spermatogonia-like cells generated in vitro has not been reported so far. Previously, it was shown that a chemical intervention in male mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in serum culture, including a timed combination of the SIRT1 inhibitor Ex-527, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG-108 and the electrophilic redox cycling compound tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), was associated with molecular markers of the PGC to gonocyte differentiation process. Here, we report the in vitro differentiation of male mouse ES cells, cultured under dual chemical inhibition of GSK3{beta} and MEK (termed 2i) with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (termed 2iL) and serum, into cells with spermatogonia-like morphology (CSMs) and population-averaged expression of spermatogonia-specific genes. This was achieved by the removal of 2iL and a specific schedule of 2 partial medium replacements per day with alternating 8-hour and 16-hour intervals over a period of 32 days. Combination of this new cell culture protocol with the previously reported chemical intervention in ES cells changed the population-averaged expression of spermatogonia- and gonocyte-specific genes during the differentiation process and increased the population-averaged gene expression of Lhx1 in the resulting CSMs compared to CSMs without chemical intervention. Furthermore, we detected single CSMs with a strong nuclear LHX1/5 protein signal only in the chemical intervention group. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for the generation of CSMs with an enrichment of Lhx1 expression in vitro. We propose that further investigation of the CSMs generated with this in vitro system may provide new insights into male germline and stem cell development.",

Presence of meiotic genes in prokaryotes suggests that DNA repair mechanisms evolved toward meiotic recombination; however, fusogenic proteins resembling those found in eukaryotes were not identified in prokaryotes. Here, we identify archaeal proteins that are homologs of fusexins, a superfamily of fusogens that mediate eukaryotic gamete and somatic cell fusion, as well as virus entry. The crystal structure of a trimeric archaeal Fusexin1 reveals novel features such as a six-helix bundle and an additional globular domain. Ectopically expressed Fusexin1 can fuse mammalian cells, and this process involves the additional domain and a conserved fusion loop. Archaeal fusexin genes exist within integrated mobile elements, potentially linking ancient archaeal gene exchanges and eukaryotic sex.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCell membrane fusion proteins of viruses and eukaryotes are also present in archaea.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, chromosomes undergo dramatic changes in structural organization, nuclear positioning, and motion. Although the nuclear pore complex has been shown to affect genome organization and function in vegetative cells, its role in meiotic chromosome dynamics has remained largely unexplored. Recent work in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that the mobile nucleoporin Nup2 is required for normal progression through meiosis I prophase and sporulation in strains where telomere-led chromosome movement has been compromised. The meiotic autonomous region (MAR), a short fragment of Nup2 responsible for its role in meiosis, was shown to localize to the nuclear envelope via Nup60 and to bind to meiotic chromosomes. To understand the relative contribution these two activities have on MAR function, we first carried out a screen for MAR mutants defective in sporulation and found that all the mutations disrupt interaction with both Nup60 and meiotic chromosomes. Moreover, nup60 mutants phenocopy nup2 mutants, exhibiting similar nuclear division kinetics, sporulation efficiencies, and genetic interactions with mutations that affect the telomere bouquet. Although full-length Nup60 requires Nup2 for function, removal of Nup60s C-terminus allows Nup60 to bind meiotic chromosomes and promote sporulation without Nup2. In contrast, binding of the MAR to meiotic chromosomes is completely dependent on Nup60. Our findings uncover an inhibitory function for the Nup60 C-terminus and suggest that Nup60 mediates recruitment of meiotic chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, while Nup2 plays a secondary role counteracting Nup60s autoinhibition.",

    "abstract": "Early diverging lineages such as trypanosomes can provide clues to the evolution of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. In Trypanosoma brucei, the pathogen that causes Human African Trypanosomiasis, sexual reproduction occurs in the salivary glands of the insect host, but analysis of the molecular signatures that define these sexual forms is complicated because they mingle with more numerous, mitotically-dividing developmental stages. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) to profile 388 individual trypanosomes from midgut, proventriculus, and salivary glands of infected tsetse flies allowing us to identify tissue-specific cell types. Further investigation of salivary gland parasite transcriptomes revealed fine-scale changes in gene expression over a developmental progression from putative sexual forms through metacyclics expressing variant surface glycoprotein genes. The cluster of cells potentially containing sexual forms was characterized by high level transcription of the gamete fusion protein HAP2, together with an array of surface proteins and several genes of unknown function. We linked these expression patterns to distinct morphological forms using immunofluorescence assays and reporter gene expression to demonstrate that the kinetoplastid-conserved gene Tb927.10.12080 is exclusively expressed at high levels by meiotic intermediates and gametes. We speculate that this protein, currently of unknown function, plays a role in gamete formation and/or fusion.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase of Trypanosoma brucei has been studied in detail. Whereas its F1 moiety is relatively highly conserved in structure and composition, the same is not the case for the Fo part and the peripheral stalk. A core subunit of the latter, the normally conserved subunit b, could not be identified in trypanosomes suggesting that it might be absent. Here we have identified a 17 kDa mitochondrial protein of the inner membrane that is essential for normal growth, efficient oxidative phosphorylation and membrane potential maintenance. Pulldown experiments and native PAGE analysis indicate that the protein is associated with the F1Fo ATP synthase. Its ablation reduces the levels of Fo subunits, but not those of F1, and disturbs the cell cycle. HHpred analysis showed that the protein has structural similarities to subunit b of other species, indicating that the Fo part of the trypanosomal ATP synthase does contain a highly diverged subunit b. Thus, the Fo part of the trypanosomal ATPase synthase may be more widely conserved than initially thought.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria require polysaccharides for structure, survival, and virulence. Despite the central role these structures play in microbiology few tools are available to manipulate their production. In E. coli the glycosyltransferase complex PgaCD produces poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), an extracellular matrix polysaccharide required for biofilm formation. We report that C6-substituted (H, F, N3, SH, NH2) UDP-GlcNAc substrate analogues are inhibitors of PgaCD. In vitro the inhibitors cause PNAG chain termination; consistent with the mechanism of PNAG polymerization from the non-reducing terminus. In vivo, expression of the GlcNAc-1-kinase NahK in E. coli provided a non-native GlcNAc salvage pathway that produced the UDP-GlcNAc analogue inhibitors in situ. The 6-fluoro and 6-deoxy derivatives were potent inhibitors of biofilm formation in the transformed strain, providing a tool to manipulate this key exopolysaccharide. Characterization of the UDP-GlcNAc pool and quantification of PNAG generation support PNAG termination as the primary in vivo mechanism of biofilm inhibition by 6-fluoro UDP-GlcNAc.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria is one of the largest threats to global heath. This rise is due to the genomic plasticity of bacteria, allowing rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance through the uptake of foreign DNA (i.e. horizontal gene transfer, HGT). This genomic plasticity is not limited to DNA from bacteria, highly divergent (trans-kingdom) mRNA have been reported to drive translation in E. coli. Trans-kingdom activity has been attributed to mRNA tertiary structure suggesting the bacterial translation machinery bottle-necks HGT, restricting the expression of foreign DNA. However, here we show that tertiary structure is not responsible for ribosome recruitment and that the translation efficiency is dependent on ribosomal protein S1 and an A-rich Shine-Dalgarno-like element. The S1-facilitated ability of ribosomes to identify and exploit A-rich sequences in foreign RNA highlights the important role that S1 plays in horizontal gene transfer, the robustness of canonical prokaryotic translation, and bacterial evolution.",

NSD and fork reversal are crucial for genome stability and exploited by chemotherapeutic approaches. However, it is unclear how NSD and fork reversal are triggered. Additionally, the fate of the replicative helicase during these processes is unknown. We developed a biochemical approach to study synchronous, localized NSD and fork reversal using Xenopus egg extracts. We show that replication fork uncoupling stimulates NSD of both nascent strands and progressive conversion of uncoupled forks to reversed forks. The replicative helicase remains bound during NSD and fork reversal, indicating that both processes take place behind the helicase. Unexpectedly, NSD occurs before and after fork reversal, indicating that multiple degradation steps take place. Overall, our data show that uncoupling causes NSD and fork reversal and identify key steps involved in these processes.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is an increasing global health concern and is associated with a broad range of morbidities. The gut microbiota are increasingly recognized as important contributors to obesity and cardiometabolic health. This study aimed to characterize oral and gut microbial communities, and evaluate host:microbiota interactions between clinical obesity classifications. We performed 16S rDNA sequencing on fecal and salivary samples, global metabolomics profiling on plasma and stool samples, and dietary profiling in 135 healthy individuals. We grouped individuals by obesity status, based on body mass index (BMI), including lean (BMI 18-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI [&ge;]30). We analyzed differences in microbiome composition, community inter-relationships, and predicted microbial function by obesity status. We found that salivary bacterial communities of lean and obese individuals were compositionally and phylogenetically distinct. An increase in obesity status was positively associated with strong correlations between bacterial taxa, particularly with bacterial groups implicated in metabolic disorders including Fretibacterium, and Tannerella. Consumption of sweeteners, especially xylitol, significantly influenced compositional and phylogenetic diversities of salivary and fecal bacterial communities. In addition, obesity groups exhibited differences in predicted bacterial metabolic activity, which was correlated with hosts metabolite concentrations. Overall, obesity was associated with distinct changes in bacterial community dynamics, particularly in saliva. Consideration of microbiome community structure, and inclusion of salivary samples may improve our ability to understand pathways linking microbiota to obesity and cardiometabolic disease.\n\nIMPORTANCEObesity is a worldwide epidemic that is associated with a wide range of health issues. Microbiota were shown to influence metabolism and obesity development. Our study aimed to evaluate the interactions between obesity, salivary and fecal microbiota, and metabolite concentrations in healthy individuals. The oral bacterial community was more impacted by the obesity status of the host than fecal microbiota. Consistently for oral and fecal microbiota, the number of strong interactions between bacteria increased with the increase in the obesity status. Several predicted microbial metabolic pathways that were shown to be associated with metabolic health were uniquely enriched between obesity groups. In addition, these metabolic pathways were correlated with plasma and stool metabolites. Our results suggest that oral microbiota might better reflect the obesity status of the host than fecal microbiota, and that correlations between microbial taxa are altered during obesity.",

However, the mechanism by which ELS is involved in the pathophysiology of PPD remains unclear. We investigated the longitudinal effects of ELS on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and behaviors in the postpartum period through mouse and human studies.\n\nMethodsBehavioral tests (tail suspension, forced swim, and three-chamber social interaction tests) and measurement of plasma hormone levels were administered at postpartum in female mice with or without exposure to social isolation during late adolescence. Effects of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or a GABAA receptor modulator on their behaviors were examined at one week postpartum. Human plasma cortisol levels from women with ELS were also examined at second and third trimesters as well as two and six weeks postpartum.\n\nResultsWe observed that adolescent social isolation caused an aberrantly sustained elevation of glucocorticoids via dysregulation of the HPA axis, leading to long-lasting postpartum behavioral changes in female mice. The postpartum behavioral changes elicited by this ELS were not ameliorated by the medicines currently used for PPD treatment. However, a post-delivery treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist effectively ameliorated the behavioral changes in mice. We also demonstrated a significant impact of ELS on the HPA axis dysregulation and PPD in women.\n\nConclusionsWe provide experimental evidence that suggest a mechanism-driven therapeutic strategy (repurposing a GR antagonist) for at least some cases of treatment refractory PPD.",

Seventy-nine public datasets for seven environment types (river & seawater, lake & pond, alkaline spring, hot spring, groundwater, sediment, and soil) were analyzed. Taxonomic abundances inferred from high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequences were combined with NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) proteomes to estimate the amino acid compositions and chemical formulas (CcHhNnOoSs) of community proteomes, which yield ZC. Alkaline hot springs have the lowest ZC for both bacterial and archaeal domains of any environment. Positive global correlations between redox potential and ZC are found for bacterial communities in lake & pond, groundwater, and soil environments, but not archaeal communities, suggesting a broad ecological signal of chemical shaping in Bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The opossum (Monodelphis domestica), with its sequenced genome, ease of laboratory care and experimental manipulation, and unique biology, is the most used laboratory marsupial. Using the mammalian methylation array, we generated DNA methylation data from n=100 opossum tissues including blood, liver, and tail. We contrast age-related changes in the opossum methylome to those of C57BL/6J mice. We present several epigenetic clocks for opossums that are distinguished by their compatibility with tissue type (pan-tissue and blood clock) and species (opossum and human). Two dual-species human-opossum pan-tissue clocks accurately measure chronological age and relative age, respectively. These human-opossum epigenetic clocks are expected to provide a significant boost to the attractiveness of opossum as a biological model.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of scRNA-seq data emphasizes the need for integrative analysis to interpret similarities and differences between single-cell samples. Even though different batch effect removal methods have been developed, none of the existing methods is suitable for het-erogeneous single-cell samples coming from multiple biological conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a method named scINSIGHT to learn coordinated gene expression patterns that are common among or specific to different biological conditions, offering a unique chance to identify cellular identities and key biological processes across single-cell samples. We have evaluated scINSIGHT in comparison with state-of-the-art methods using simulated and real data, which consistently demonstrate its improved performance. In addition, our results show the applicability of scINSIGHT in diverse biomedical and clinical problems.",

    "abstract": "The Mu variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been recently classified as a variant of interest (VOI) by the world health organization (WHO) but limited data are available at the moment. In particular, a special attention was given to the R346K mutation located in the receptor binding domain (RBD). In the current study we performed Free energy of perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate it possible impact on a set of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which have been shown to be strong inhibitors of the most other known COVID-19 variants. Our results show that R346K affects the class 2 antibodies but its effect is not so significant (0.66 kcal/mol); i.e. reduces the binding with RBD about 3 times. An identical value was calculated also in the presence of both class 1 and class 2 antibodies (BD-812/836). Further, a similar reduction in the binding (0.4 kcal/mol) was obtained for BD-821/771 pair of mAbs. For comparison, the addition of K417N mutation, present in the newly registered Mu variant in July 2021 in UK, affected the class 1 mAbs by 1.29 kcal/mol reducing stronger the binding by about 10 times. Thus, the resistance effect of R346K mutation in the Mu variant is possible but not so significant and is due to the additional decrease of antibody neutralization based on the reduced binding of class 2 antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Transcription initiation is the first step in gene expression, and is therefore strongly regulated in all domains of life. The RNA polymerase (RNAP) first associates with the initiation factor{sigma} to form a holoenzyme, which binds, bends and opens the promoter in a succession of reversible states. These states are critical for transcription regulation, but remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed the mechanism of open complex formation by monitoring its assembly/disassembly kinetics on individual consensus lacUV5 promoters using high-throughput single-molecule magnetic tweezers. We probed the key protein-DNA interactions governing the open-complex formation and dissociation pathway by modulating the dynamics at different concentrations of monovalent salts and varying temperatures. Consistent with ensemble studies, we observed that RPO is a stable, slowly reversible state that is preceded by a kinetically significant open intermediate (RPI), from which the holoenzyme dissociates. A strong anion concentration and type dependence indicates that the RPO stabilization may involve sequence-independent interactions between the DNA and the holoenzyme, driven by a non-Coulombic effect consistent with the non-template DNA strand interacting with{sigma} and the RNAP {beta} subunit. The temperature dependence provides the energy scale of open-complex formation and further supports the existence of additional intermediates.",
