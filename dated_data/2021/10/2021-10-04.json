    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emerged the necessity of the identification of sequences sites in viral proteome appropriate as antigenic sites and treatment targets. In the present study, we apply a novel approach for deciphering the virus-host organism interaction, by analyzing the Unique Peptides of the virus with a minimum amino acid sequence length defined as Core Unique Peptides (CrUPs) not of the virus per se, but against the entire proteome of the host organism. The result of this approach is the identification of the CrUPs of the virus itself, which do not appear in the host organism proteome. Thereby, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for identification of CrUPs against the Human Proteome and they are defined as C/H-CrUPs. We found that SARS-CoV-2 include 7.503 C/H-CrUPs, with the SPIKE_SARS2 being the protein with the highest density of C/H-CrUPs. Extensive analysis indicated that the P681R mutation produces new C/H-CrUPs around the R685 cleavage site, while the L452R mutation induces the loss of antigenicity of the NF9 peptide and the strong(er) binding of the virus to ACE2 receptor protein. The simultaneous existence of these mutations in variants like Delta results in the immune escape of the virus, its massive entrance into the host cell, a notable increase in virus formation, and its massive release and thus elevated infectivity.",

    "abstract": "A critical determinant of DNA repair pathway choice is the HORMA protein REV7, a small abundant adaptor which binds to various DNA repair proteins through its C-terminal seatbelt domain. The REV7 seatbelt binds to the REV3 polymerase to form the Polymerase {zeta} complex, a positive regulator of translesion synthesis (TLS) repair. Alternatively, the REV7 seatbelt binds to SHLD3 in the Shieldin complex, a positive regulator of NHEJ repair. Recent studies have identified another novel REV7 seatbelt-binding protein, CHAMP1 (Chromosome Alignment-Maintaining Phosphoprotein, though its role in DNA repair is unknown. Here, we show that the REV7-CHAMP1 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair by sequestering REV7 from the Shieldin complex. CHAMP1 competes directly with the SHLD3 subunit of the Shieldin complex for a limited pool of C-REV7, thereby inhibiting the REV7-mediated recruitment of the SHLD2 and SHLD1 effector subunits to DNA double strand breaks. CHAMP1 thereby channels DNA repair away from error-prone NHEJ and towards the competing error-free HR pathway. Similarly, CHAMP1 competes with the REV3 component of the POL{zeta} complex, thereby reducing the level of mutagenic TLS repair. CHAMP1 interacts with POGZ in a heterochromatin complex further promoting HR repair. Importantly, in human tumors, CHAMP1 overexpression promotes HR, confers PARP inhibitor resistance, and correlates with poor prognosis. Thus, by binding to either REV3, SHLD3, or CHAMP1 through its seatbelt, the REV7 protein can promote either TLS repair, NHEJ repair, or HR repair respectively.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures of the ceramide N-(tetracosanoyl)-sphingosine (NS), cholesterol, and a free fatty acid are performed to gain a molecular-level understanding of the structure of the lipids found in the stratum corneum layer of skin. A new coarse-grained model for cholesterol, developed using the multistate iterative Boltzmann inversion method, is compatible with previously developed coarse-grained forcefields for ceramide NS, free fatty acid, and water, and validated against atomistic simulations of these lipids using the CHARMM force field. Self-assembly simulations of multilayer structures using these coarse-grained force fields are performed, revealing that a large fraction of the ceramides adopt extended conformations, which cannot occur in the bilayer structures typically studied using simulation. Cholesterol fluidizes the membrane by promoting packing defects and it is observed that an increase in cholesterol content reduces the bilayer height, due to an increase in interdigitation of the C24 lipid tails, consistent with experimental observations. Through the use of a simple reverse-mapping procedure, a self-assembled coarse-grained multilayer system is used to construct an equivalent structure with atomistic resolution. Simulations of this atomistic structure are found to closely agree with experimentally derived neutron scattering length density profiles. Significant interlayer hydrogen bonding is observed in the inner layers of the atomistic multilayer structure that are not found in the outer layers in contact with water or in equivalent bilayer structures. These results identify several significant differences in the structure and hydrogen bonding of multilayer structures as compared to the more commonly studied bilayer systems, and, as such, highlight the importance of simulating multilayer structures for more accurate comparisons with experiment. These results also provide validation of the efficacy of the coarse-grained forcefields and the framework for multiscale simulation.",

    "abstract": "Tankyrases are ADP-ribosylating enzymes that regulate many physiological processes in the cell and they are therefore possible drug targets for cancer and fibrotic diseases. The catalytic ADP-ribosyl-transferase domain of tankyrases contains a unique zinc-binding motif of unknown function. Recently, this motif was suggested to be involved in the catalytic activity of tankyrases. In this work, we set out to study the effect of the zinc-binding motif on activity, stability and structure of human tankyrases. We generated mutants of human TNKS1 and TNKS2 abolishing the zinc-binding capabilities and characterized the proteins biochemically and biophysically in vitro. We further generated a crystal structure of TNKS2, in which the zinc ion was oxidatively removed. Our work shows that the zinc-binding motif in tankyrases is a crucial structural element which is particularly important for the structural integrity of the acceptor site. While mutation of the motif rendered TNKS1 inactive likely due to introduction of major structural defects, the TNKS2 mutant remained active and displayed a different activity profile compared to the wild type.",

    "abstract": "Many microorganisms can harvest energy from sun light to establish electrochemical potential across cell membrane by pumping protons outward. Light driven proton pumping against a transmembrane gradient entails exquisite electronic and conformational reconfigurations at fs to ms time scales. However, transient molecular events along the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin are difficult to comprehend from noisy and inconsistent electron density maps obtained from multiple experiments. A major challenge arises from the coexisting intermediate populations as a heterogenous conformational mixture continuously evolves over 13 decades in time. This study reports a meta-analysis of the recent time-resolved datasets collected by several consortia. By resolving structural heterogeneity, this in-depth analysis substantially improves the quality of the electron density maps, and provides a clear visualization of the isolated intermediates from I to M. The earliest photoproducts revealed by the deconvoluted maps suggest that a proton transfer uphill against 15 pH units is accomplished by the same physics governing the tablecloth trick. While the Schiff base is displaced at the beginning of the photoisomerization within ~30 fs, the proton stays due to its inertia. This affinity-independent early deprotonation builds up a steep proton concentration gradient that subsequently drives the directional proton conductance toward the extracellular medium. This mechanism fundamentally deviates from the widely adopted notion on multiple steps of chemical equilibrium driven by light-induced changes of proton affinity. The method of a numerical resolution of concurrent events from mixed observations is also generally applicable.\n\nSignificance StatementMicroorganisms can exploit solar energy to offset their cellular acidity from the environment by pumping protons outward under light illumination. The ability to transport ions across the cell membrane in response to light makes this family of small transmembrane proteins a highly desirable toolkit in development of new biotechnologies. It is important to understand how these ion pumps operate at the molecular level. This study finds that the outward proton conductance through bacteriorhodopsin, the most studied model system in the class, is driven by a steep concentration gradient of protons established in the light induced process rather than by an affinity gradient previously sought for decades.\n\nSummary of RevisionThis is the companion manuscript of another paper already published in PNAS Nexus (Ren, Photoinduced isomerization sampling of retinal in bacteriorhodopsin, PNAS Nexus, 1(3), 2022, 10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac103).

    "abstract": "In 2020, nearly 20 million peoples got cancer and nearly 10 million peoples died of cancer, indicating the current therapies do not meet the cancer treatment and cancer remains a great threat to human health and life. New therapies are still in urgent demand. In a recent study, we developed a new effective cancer therapy, gene-interfered ferroptosis therapy (GIFT), by combining cancer cell-specific knockdown of two iron efflux genes (FPN and LCN2) with iron nanoparticles (FeNPs). GIFT shows wide antitumor activity, high cancer specificity, certain cancer eradication potential, and biosafety. To further improve the therapy, we here develop an updated GIFT named as Ferroptosis ASsassinates Tumor (FAST) by knocking down five additional ferroptosis-resistance genes (FSP1, FTH1, GPX4, SLC7A11, NRF2). As a result, we found that FAST showed more significant antitumor activity than GIFT. Especially, FAST eradicated three different types of tumors (leukemia, colon cancer and lung metastatic melanoma) from over 50 percent of cancer mice, making the mice to survive up to 250 days without tumor relapse. FAST also significantly inhibited and prevented growth of spontaneous breast cancer and improved survival in mice. Additionally, FAST showed high pan-antitumor efficacy, high cancer specificity, and in vivo safety.",

However, existing heat-repressible systems are limited and rely on thermal sensitive mRNA or transcription factors which function at low temperatures, lack tunability, suffer delays or overly-complex. To provide an alternative mode of thermal regulation, we developed a library of compact, reversible and tunable thermal-repressible split-T7 RNA polymerase systems (Thermal-T7RNAPs) which fuses temperature-sensitive domains of Tlpa protein with split-T7RNAP to enable direct thermal control of the T7RNAP activity between 30 - 42 {degrees}C. We generated a large mutant library with varying thermal performances via automated screening framework to extend temperature tunability. Lastly, using the mutants, novel thermal logic circuitry was implemented to regulate cell growth and achieve active thermal control of the cell proportions within co-cultures. Overall, this technology expands avenues for thermal control in biotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "Insects detect volatile chemicals using antennae, which house a vast variety of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that innervate hair-like structures called sensilla where odor detection takes place. In addition to OSNs, the antenna also hosts various support cell types. These include the triad of trichogen, tormogen and thecogen support cells that lie adjacent to their respective OSNs. The arrangement of OSN supporting cells occurs stereotypically for all sensilla and is widely conserved in evolution. While insect chemosensory neurons have received considerable attention, little is known about the functional significance of the cells that support them. For instance, it remains unknown whether support cells play an active role in odor detection, or only passively contribute to homeostasis, e.g. by maintaining sensillum lymph composition. To investigate the functional interaction between OSNs and support cells, we used optical and electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila. First, we characterized the distribution of various supporting cells using genetic markers. By means of an ex vivo antennal preparation and genetically-encoded Ca2+ and K+ indicators, we then studied the activation of these auxiliary cells during odor presentation in adult flies. We observed acute responses and distinct differences in Ca2+ and K+ fluxes between support cell types. Finally, we observed alterations in OSN responses upon thecogen cell ablation in mature adults. Upon inducible ablation of thecogen cells, we notice a gain in mechanical responsiveness to mechanical stimulations during single-sensillum recording, but a lack of change to neuronal resting activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that support cells play a more active and responsive role during odor processing than previously thought. Our observations thus reveal that support cells functionally interact with OSNs and may be important for the extraordinary ability of insect olfactory systems to dynamically and sensitively discriminate between odors in the turbulent sensory landscape of insect flight.",

    "abstract": "AAV gene therapies aimed at curing inherited retinal diseases to date have typically focused on photoreceptors and retinal pigmented epithelia within the relatively accessible outer retina. However, therapeutic targeting in diseases such as congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) that involve defects in ON-bipolar cells (ON-BCs) within the mid-retina has been challenged by the relative inaccessibility of the target cell in intact retinas, the limited transduction efficiency of these cells by existing AAV serotypes, poor availability of established ON-BC-specific promoters, and absence of appropriate patient-relevant large animal models. Here, we demonstrate safe and effective ON-BC targeting by AAV gene therapy in a recently characterized naturally-occurring canine model of CSNB, LRIT3-CSNB. To effectively target ON-BCs, new AAV capsid variants with ON-BC tropism and ON-BC specific modified GRM6 promoters were adopted to ensure cell-specific transgene expression. Notably, subretinal injection of one vector, AAVK9#4-shGRM6-cLRIT3-WPRE, significantly recovered rod-derived b-wave in all treated eyes (6/6) of adult dogs injected at 1-3 years of age. The robust therapeutic effect was evident 7 weeks post-injection and was sustained for at least 1 year in all treated eyes. Scotopic vision was significantly improved in treated eyes based on visually-guided obstacle course navigation. Restoration of LRIT3 signals was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Thus, we report on the first ON-BC functional rescue in a large animal model using a novel AAV capsid variant and modified promoter construct optimized for ON-BC specificity, thereby establishing both proof-of-concept and a novel translational platform for treatment of CSNB in patients with defects in photoreceptor-to-bipolar signaling.\n\nSignificanceCanine models of inherited retinal diseases have informed and advanced AAV gene therapies targeting specific cells, including photoreceptors in the outer retina, for treatment of blinding diseases in human patients. However, therapeutic targeting of diseases such as congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) that exhibit defects in ON-bipolar cells (ON-BCs) of the mid-retina remains under-developed. Using a new LRIT3 mutant canine model of CSNB exhibiting ON-BC dysfunction, we tested the ability of a cell-specific AAV capsid and promotor to specifically target ON-BCs for gene delivery. Notably, subretinal injection of AAV-LRIT3 vector demonstrated safety and efficacy with robust and stable rescue of ERG signals and night vision up to 1 year, paving the way for clinical trials in CNSB patients.",

CPT and its FDA-approved analog topotecan (TPT) inhibited inflammatory responses in microglia and macrophages, and ameliorated neuroinflammation in mice. Transcriptomic analysis of sorted microglia revealed an altered transcriptional phenotype following TPT treatment, with Ikzf1 identified as a potential target. Importantly, TOP1 expression was found elevated in several neuroinflammatory conditions, including human MS brains. To achieve targeted delivery to myeloid cells we designed a nanosystem using DNA origami and loaded TPT into it (TopoGami). TopoGami also significantly suppressed the inflammatory response in microglia and mitigated disease progression in MS-like mice.

In the BCN02 clinical trial, which combined the MVA.HIVconsv immunogen with the latency-reversing agent romidepsin in early-ART treated HIV-1 infected individuals, 23% (3/13) of participants showed sustained low-levels of plasma viremia during 32 weeks of a monitored ART pause (MAP). Here, we present a multi-omics analysis to identify compositional and functional gut microbiome patterns associated with HIV-1 control in the BCN02 trial.\n\nResultsViremic controllers during the MAP (controllers) exhibited higher Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio and lower microbial gene richness before vaccination and throughout the study intervention when compared to non-controllers. Longitudinal assessment indicated that the gut microbiome of controllers was enriched in pro-inflammatory bacteria and depleted in butyrate-producing bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Functional profiling also showed that metabolic pathways, including methanogenesis and carbohydrate biosynthesis, were significantly decreased in controllers. Fecal metaproteome analyses confirmed that baseline functional differences were mainly driven by Clostridiales. Participants with high baseline Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio had increased pre-existing immune activation-related transcripts. The Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio as well as host immune-activation signatures inversely correlated with HIV-1 reservoir size.\n\nConclusionsThis proof-of-concept study suggests the Bacteroidales/Clostridiales ratio as a novel gut microbiome signature associated with HIV-1 reservoir size and immune-mediated viral control after ART interruption.",

We also studied changes in the microbial community structure in response to glucose enrichments and analyzed the transcription of Prochlorocccus genes involved in carbon metabolism and photosynthesis.\n\nOur results showed a circadian rhythm for glucose assimilation in Prochlorococcus, with maximum assimilation during the midday and minimum at midnight, which was different compared with that of the total microbial community. This suggests that rhythms in glucose assimilation have been adapted in Prochlorococcus to couple the active transport to photosynthetic light reactions producing energy, and possibly to avoid competition from the rest of the microbial community. High-light Prochlorococcus strains showed most transcriptional changes upon glucose enrichment. Pathways involved in glucose metabolism as the pentose phosphate, the Entner-Dudoroff, glycolysis, respiration and glucose transport showed an increase in the transcript level. A few genes of the low-light strains showed opposite changes, suggesting that glucose assimilation has been subjected to diversification along the Prochlorococcus evolution.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesCarbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) pose serious threats to public health. Compared with clinical CPE, the genetic characteristics of environmental CPE are not well understood. This study aimed to characterize the genetic determinants of carbapenem resistance in CPE isolated from environmental waters in Japan.\n\nMethodsEighty-five water samples were collected from rivers and a lake in Japan. CPE were identified using selective media, and genome sequencing was performed for the obtained isolates (n = 21).\n\nResultsVarious rare/novel carbapenemases were identified: GES-5 in Raoultella planticola (n = 1), FRI-8 and FRI-11 in Enterobacter spp. (n = 8), IMI-22 and IMI-23 in Serratia ureilytica (n = 3), and SFC-1, SFC-2 and SFH-1 in Serratia fonticola (n = 9). Genomes of 11 isolates could be closed, allowing the elucidation of the genetic contexts of the carbapenemase genes. The blaGES-5 gene was located within a class 1 integron, In2071 (cassette array, blaGES-5-aacA3-aadA16), on a 33 kb IncP6 plasmid. The blaFRI-8 genes were carried on IncFII(Yp) plasmids ranging in size from 191 kb to 244 kb, and the blaFRI-11 genes were carried on 70 kb and 74 kb IncFII(pECLA)/IncR plasmids. The blaIMI-22 and blaIMI-23 genes were colocated on a 107 kb plasmid. The blaSFC and blaSFH-1 genes were found on putative genomic islands inserted at tRNA-Phe genes in chromosomes.\n\nConclusionsThis study revealed the presence of rare/novel carbapenemases among CPE in aquatic environments, suggesting that the environment may act as a potential reservoir of these minor carbapenemases.",

Intriguingly, like most plants, fungi and bacteria, parasites of the coccidian subgroup of Apicomplexa, including the human and animal pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, possess all the enzymes required for de novo synthesis of pantothenate. Here, the importance of CoA and pantothenate biosynthesis for the acute and chronic stages of T. gondii infection was dissected through genetic, biochemical and metabolomic approaches, revealing that CoA synthesis is essential for T. gondii tachyzoites, due to the parasites inability to salvage CoA or intermediates of the pathway. In contrast, de novo pantothenate synthesis was only partially active in T. gondii tachyzoites, making the parasite reliant on Pan uptake. However, Pan synthesis proved to be crucial for the establishment of chronic infection, offering a promising target for intervention against the persistent stage of T. gondii.",

Here we show human translation initiation factor eIF3 interacts with select immune system related mRNAs including those encoding the T cell receptor (TCR) subunits TCRA and TCRB. Binding of eIF3 to the TCRA and TCRB mRNA 3-untranslated regions (3-UTRs) depends on CD28 coreceptor signaling and regulates a burst in TCR translation required for robust T cell activation. Use of the TCRA or TCRB 3-UTRs to control expression of an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) improves the ability of CAR-T cells to kill tumor cells in vitro. These results identify a new mechanism of eIF3-mediated translation control that can aid T cell engineering for immunotherapy applications.",

Here, we explore non-coding functions for mRNAs associated with focal adhesions (FAs), cellular structures responsible for mediating cell adhesion and response to changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Using high-throughput single molecule imaging and genomic profiling approaches, we find that mRNAs with distinct sequence characteristics localize to FAs in different human cell types. Notably, [~]85% of FA-mRNAs are not translationally active at steady state or under conditions of FA dissolution or activation. Untranslated mRNA sequences are anchored to FA based on their functional states by the RNA binding protein, G3BP1, forming biomolecular granules. Removing RNA or G3BP1, but not blocking new polypeptide synthesis, dramatically changes FA protein composition and organization, resulting in loss of cell contractility and cellular ability to adapt to changing ECM. We have therefor uncovered a novel, non-coding role for mRNAs as scaffolds to maintain FA structure and function, broadening our understating of noncanonical mRNA functions.",

TEs provide genetic and epigenetic variation that can substantially translate into changes in plant phenotypes. Despite the wealth of data on the ecological and evolutionary effects of TEs on plant individuals, we have virtually no information on the role of TEs on populations and ecosystem functioning. On the example of Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrate that TE-generated variation creates differentiation in ecologically important functional traits. In particular, we show that Arabidopsis populations with increasing diversity of individuals differing in copy numbers of the ONSEN retrotransposon had higher phenotypic and functional diversity. Moreover, increased diversity enhanced population productivity and reduced performance of interspecific competitors. We conclude that TE-generated diversity can have similar effects on ecosystem as usually documented for other biological diversity effects.",

    "abstract": "Advances in whole-genome genotyping and sequencing have allowed genome-wide analyses of association, prediction and heritability in many organisms. However, the application of such analyses to bacteria is still in its infancy, being limited by difficulties including the plasticity of bacterial genomes and their strong population structure. Here we propose, and validate using simulations, a suite of genome-wide analyses for bacteria. We combine methods from human genetics and previous bacterial studies, including linear mixed models, elastic net and LD-score regression, and introduce innovations such as frequency-based allele coding, testing for both insertion/deletion and nucleotide effects and partitioning heritability by genome region. We then analyse three phenotypes of a major human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, including the first analyses of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for each of two antibiotics, penicillin and ceftriaxone. We show that these are highly heritable leading to high prediction accuracy, which is explained by many genetic associations identified under good control of population structure effects. In the case of ceftriaxone MIC, these results are surprising because none of the isolates was resistant according to the inhibition zone diameter threshold. We estimate that just over half of the heritability of penicillin MIC is explained by a known drug-resistance region, which also contributes around a quarter of the heritability of ceftriaxone MIC. For the within-host survival phenotype carriage duration, no reliable associations were found but we observed moderate heritability and prediction accuracy, indicating a polygenic trait. While generating important new results for S. pneumoniae, we have critically assessed existing methods and introduced innovations that will be useful for future large-scale population genomics studies to help decipher the genetic architecture of bacterial traits.\n\nAuthor summaryGenome-wide association, prediction and heritability analyses in bacteria are beginning to help unravel the genetic underpinnings of traits such as antimicrobial resistance, virulence, within-host survival and transmissibility. Progress to date is limited by challenges including the effects of strong population structure and variable recombination, and the many gaps in sequence alignments including the absence of entire genes in many isolates. More work is required to critically asses and develop methods for bacterial genomics. We address this task here, using a range of existing methods from bacterial and human genetics, such as linear mixed models, elastic net and LD-score regression. Using simulations, we first validate and then adapt these methods to introduce new analyses, including separate assessment of gap and nucleotide effects, a new allele coding for association analyses and a method to partition heritability into genome regions. We analyse within-host survival and two antimicrobial response traits of Streptococcus pneumoniae, identifying many novel associations while demonstrating good control of population structure and accurate prediction. We present both new results for an important pathogen and methodological advances that will be useful in guiding future studies in bacterial population genomics.",

    "abstract": "The Polycomb group (PcG) complex PRC1 localizes in the nucleus in the form of condensed structures called Polycomb bodies. The PRC1 subunit Polyhomeotic (Ph) contains an oligomerizing sterile alpha motif (SAM) that is implicated in both PcG body formation and chromatin organization in Drosophila and mammalian cells. A truncated version of Ph containing the SAM (mini-Ph), forms phase separated condensates with DNA or chromatin in vitro, suggesting PcG bodies may form by SAM-driven phase separation. In cells, Ph forms multiple small condensates, while mini-Ph typically forms a single large nuclear condensate. We therefore hypothesize that sequences outside of mini-Ph, which are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, are required for proper condensate formation. We identified three distinct low complexity regions in Ph based on sequence composition. We systematically tested the role of each of these sequences in Ph condensates using live imaging of transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Each sequence uniquely affects Ph SAM-dependent condensate size, number, and morphology, but the most dramatic effects occur when the central, glutamine rich IDR is removed, which results in large Ph condensates. Like mini-Ph condensates, these condensates exclude chromatin. Chromatin fractionation experiments indicate that removal of the glutamine rich IDR reduces chromatin binding, while removal of either of the other IDRs increases chromatin binding. Our data suggest all three IDRs, and functional interactions among them, regulate Ph condensate size and number. Our results can be explained by a model in which tight chromatin binding by Ph IDRs antagonizes Ph SAM driven phase separation and highlight the complexity of regulation of biological condensates housed in single proteins.",

Excipients approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are regarded as safe for human in allowed concentration, but their potential interaction with drug targets have not been investigated systematically, which might influence drugs efficacy. Deep learning models have been used for identification of ligands that could bind to the drug targets. However, due to the limited available data, it is challenging to reliably estimate the likelihood of a ligand-protein interaction. One-shot learning techniques provide a potential approach to address this low-data problem as these techniques require only one or a few examples to classify the new data. In this study, we apply one-shot learning models on datasets that include ligands binding to G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) and Kinases. The predicted results suggest that one-shot learning models could be used for predicting ligand-protein interaction and the models attain better performance when protein targets contain conserved binding pockets. The trained models are also used to predict interactions between excipients and drug targets, which provides a potential efficient strategy to explore the activities of drug excipients. We find that a large number of drug excipients could interact with biological targets and influence their function. The results demonstrate how one-shot learning models can be used to make accurate prediction for excipient-protein interactions and these methods could be used for selecting excipients with limited drug-protein interactions.",

RecBCD is a helicase-nuclease that uses homologous recombination to resolve double-stranded DNA breaks.

However, questions remain about the mechanistic roles of RecA and RecBCD in live cells. Here, we use millisecond super-resolved fluorescence microscopy to pinpoint the spatial localization of fluorescent reporters of RecA or RecB at physiological levels of expression in individual live Escherichia coli cells. By introducing the DNA crosslinker mitomycin C, we induce DNA damage and quantify the resulting steady state changes in stoichiometry, cellular protein copy number and molecular mobilities of RecA and RecB. We find that both proteins accumulate in molecular hotspots to effect repair, resulting in RecA stoichiometries equivalent to several hundred molecules that assemble largely in dimeric subunits before DNA damage, but form periodic subunits of approximately 3-4 molecules within mature filaments of several thousand molecules. Unexpectedly, we find that the physiologically predominant forms of RecB are not only rapidly diffusing monomers, but slowly diffusing dimers.",

Here, we present a mechanistic approach to modelling initiation and malignant transformation in Schwannoma. Each parameter is associated with a specific gene or mechanism operative in Schwann cells, and can be determined by combining incidence data with empirical frequencies of pathogenic variants and LOH. This results in new estimates for the base pair mutation rate u = 4.48 x 10-10 and the rate of LOH = 2.03 x 10-6/yr in Schwann cells. In addition to new parameter estimates, we extend the approach to estimate the risk of both spontaneous and radiation-induced malignant transformation. We conclude that radiotherapy is likely to have a negligible excess risk of malignancy for sporadic VS, with a possible exception of rapidly growing tumours.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) are one of the most commonly diagnosed tumors worldwide. Colorectal adenocarcinomas primarily metastasize into the liver and (less often) into the peritoneum. Patients suffering from CRC-liver metastasis (CRC-LM) typically present with a dismal overall survival compared to non-metastasized CRC patients. The metastasis process and metastasis-promoting factors in patients with CRC are under intensive debate. However, CRC studies investigating the proteome biology are lacking. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens provide a valuable resource for comprehensive proteomic studies of a broad variety of clinical malignancies. The presented pilot study compares the proteome of primary CRC and patient-matched CRC-LM. The applied protocol allows a reproducible and straightforward identification and quantification of over 2,600 proteins within the dissected tumorous tissue. Subsequent unsupervised clustering reveals distinct proteome biologies of the primary CRC and the corresponding CRC-LM. Statistical analysis yields multiple differentially abundant proteins in either primary CRC or their corresponding liver metastases. A more detailed analysis of dysregulated biological processes suggests an active immune response in the liver metastases, including several proteins of the complement system. Proteins with structural roles, e.g. cytoskeleton organization or cell junction assembly appear to be less prominent in liver metastases as compared to primary CRC. Immunohistochemistry corroborates proteomic high expression levels of metabolic proteins in CRC-LM. We further assessed how the in vitro inhibition of two in CRC-LM enriched metabolic proteins affected cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. The presented proteomic investigation in a small clinical cohort promotes a more comprehensive understanding of the distinct proteome biology of primary CRC and their corresponding liver metastases.",

    "abstract": "The devastating impact of infectious bronchitis (IB) triggered by the IB virus (IBV), on poultry farms is generally curbed by livestock vaccination with live attenuated or inactivated vaccines. Yet, this approach is challenged by continuously emerging variants and by time limitations of vaccine preparation techniques. This work describes the design and evaluation of an anti-IBV vaccine comprised of E. coli expressing and secreting viral spike 1 subunit (S1) and nucleocapsid N-terminus and C-terminus polypeptides fused to heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) (LS1, LNN, LNC, respectively). Following chicken oral vaccination, anti-IBV IgY levels and cellular-mediated immunity as well as protection against virulent IBV challenge, were evaluated 14 days following the booster dose. Oral vaccination induced IgY levels that exceeded those measured following vaccination with each component separately. Following exposure to inactivated IBV, splenocytes isolated from chicks orally vaccinated with LNN or LNC -expressing bacteria, showed a higher percentage of CD8+ cells as compared to splenocytes isolated from chicks vaccinated with wild type or LTB-secreting E. coli and to chicks subcutaneously vaccinated. Significant reduction in viral load and percent of shedders in the vaccinated chicks was evident starting 3 days following challenge with 107.5 EID50/ml virulent IBV. Taken together, orally delivered LTB-fused IBV polypeptide-expressing bacteria induced virus-specific IgY antibody production and was associated with significantly shorter viral shedding on challenge with a live IBV. The proposed vaccine design and delivery route promise an effective and rapidly adaptable means of protecting poultry farms from devastating IB outbreaks.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMucosal vaccination was shown particularly beneficial against respiratory viruses.\nC_LIO_LIAn anti-IBV vaccine composed of three IBV polypeptides fused to LTB was designed.\nC_LIO_LIVaccine composed of bacteria secreting polypeptides was orally delivered.\nC_LIO_LIVaccine induced specific immune responses and shortened viral shedding duration.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell interactions drive essential biological processes critical to cell and tissue development, function, pathology, and disease outcome. The growing appreciation of immune cell interactions within disease environments has led to significant efforts to develop protein- and cell-based therapeutic strategies. A better understanding of these cell-cell interactions will enable the development of effective immunotherapies. However, characterizing these complex cellular interactions at molecular resolution in their native biological contexts remains challenging. To address this, we introduce photocatalytic cell tagging (PhoTag), a modality agnostic platform for profiling cell-cell interactions. Using photoactivatable flavin-based cofactors, we generate phenoxy radical tags for targeted labeling at the cell surface. Through various targeting modalities (e.g. MHC-Multimer, antibody, single domain antibody (VHH)) we deliver a flavin photocatalyst for cell tagging within monoculture, co-culture, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. PhoTag enables highly selective tagging of the immune synapse between an immune cell and an antigen-presenting cell through targeted labeling at the cell-cell junction. This allowed for the ability to profile gene expression-level differences between interacting and bystander cell populations. Given the modality agnostic and spatio-temporal nature of PhoTag, we envision its broad utilization to detect and profile intercellular interactions within an immune synapse and other confined cellular regions for any biological system.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria use cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) to control changes in lifestyle. The molecule, synthesised by proteins having diguanylate cyclase activity, is often a signal to transition from motile to sedentary behaviour. In Vibrio cholerae, c-di-GMP can exert its effects via the transcription factors VpsT and VpsR. Together, these proteins activate genes needed for V. cholerae to form biofilms. In this work, we have mapped the genome-wide distribution of VpsT in a search for further regulatory roles. We show that VpsT binds 23 loci and recognises a degenerate DNA palindrome having the consensus 5-W-5R-4[CG]-3Y-2W-1W+1R+2[GC]+3Y+4W+5-3. Most genes targeted by VpsT encode functions related to motility, biofilm formation, or c-di-GMP metabolism. Most notably, VpsT activates expression of the vpvABC operon that encodes a diguanylate cyclase. This creates a positive feedback loop needed to maintain intracellular levels of c-di-GMP. Mutation of the key VpsT binding site, upstream of vpvABC, severs the loop and c-di-GMP levels fall accordingly. Hence, as well as relaying the c-di-GMP signal, VpsT impacts c-di-GMP homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Cannibalism is a differentiation strategy and social multicellular behavior in biofilms. The novel factors and mechanisms to trigger the bacterial cannibalism remain scarce. Here, we report a novel bacillunoic acids-mediated strategy for manipulating cannibalism in Bacillus velezensis SQR9 biofilm formation. A subfraction of cells differentiate into cannibals that secrete toxic bacillunoic acids to lyse a fraction of their sensitive siblings, and the released nutrients enhance biofilm formation. Meanwhile, the self-immunity of cannibal cells was induced by bacillunoic acids. A two-component system, the OmpS-OmpR signal-transduction pathway, controls the expression of the ABC transporter BnaAB for self-immunity. Specifically, bacillunoic acids activate the autophosphorylation of OmpS, a transmembrane histidine kinase, which then transfers a phosphoryl group to its response regulator OmpR. The phosphorylation of OmpR activates the transcription of the transporter gene bnaAB by binding its promoter. Thus, bacillunoic acids are pumped out of cells by the ABC transporter BnaAB. Moreover, we discovered that strain SQR9 could use the bacillunoic acids-mediated cannibalism to optimize its community to produce more bacillunoic acids for bacterial competition. This study revealed that bacillunoic acids play a previously undiscovered dual role in both cannibalism during biofilm formation and interspecies competition, which has an important biological significance.",

    "abstract": "Metapopulation structure (i.e. the spatial arrangement of local populations and corridors between them) plays a fundamental role in the persistence of wildlife populations, but can also drive the spread of infectious diseases. While the disruption of metapopulation connectivity can reduce disease spread, it can also impair host resilience by disrupting gene flow and colonisation dynamics. Thus, a pressing challenge for many wildlife populations is to elucidate whether the benefits of disease management methods that reduce metapopulation connectivity outweigh the associated risks.\n\nDirectly transmissible cancers are clonal malignant cell lines capable to spread through host populations without immune recognition, when susceptible and infected hosts become in close contact. Using an individual-based metapopulation model we investigate the effects of the interplay between host dispersal, disease transmission rate and inter-individual contact distance for transmission (determining within-population mixing) on the spread and persistence of a transmissible cancer, Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), from local to regional scales. Further, we explore population isolation scenarios to devise management strategies to mitigate disease spread.\n\nDisease spread, and the ensuing population declines, are synergistically determined by individuals dispersal, disease transmission rate and within-population mixing. Low to intermediate transmission rates can be magnified by high dispersal and inter-individual transmission distance. Once disease transmission rate is high, dispersal and inter-individual contact distance do not impact the outcome of the disease transmission dynamics.\n\nIsolation of local populations effectively reduced metapopulation-level disease prevalence but caused severe declines in metapopulation size and genetic diversity. The relative position of managed (i.e. isolated) populations within the metapopulation had a significant effect on disease prevalence, highlighting the importance of considering metapopulation structure when implementing metapopulation-scale disease control measures. Our findings suggests that population isolation is not an ideal management method for preventing disease spread in species inhabiting already fragmented landscapes, where genetic diversity and extinction risk are already a concern, such as the Tasmanian devil.",

    "abstract": "The sparseness of chromosomal contact information and the presence of homologous chromosomes with very similar nucleotide sequences make Hi-C analysis difficult. We propose a new algorithm using allele-specific single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) chromosomal architectures from the Hi-C dataset of single diploid cells. Our algorithm has a function to discriminate SNVs specifically found between homologous chromosomes to our \"recurrence plot\"-based algorithm to estimate the 3D chromosome structure, which does not require imputation for ambiguous segment information. The new algorithm can efficiently reconstruct 3D chromosomal structures in single human diploid cells by employing only Hi-C segment pairs containing allele-specific SNVs. The datasets of the remaining pairs of segments without allele-specific SNVs are used to validate the estimated chromosome structure. This approach was used to reconstruct the 3D structures of human chromosomes in single diploid cells at a 1-Mb resolution. Introducing a subsequent mathematical measure further improved the resolution to 40-kb or 100-kb. The reconstruction data reveals that human chromosomes form chromosomal territories and take fractal structures where the mean dimension is a non-integer value. We also validate our approach by estimating 3D protein/polymer structures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFatigue is common in patents with breast cancer (BC), and can occur in patients with early stage disease and in the absence of muscle wasting (i.e. cachexia). We have reported transcriptional and proteomic alterations in muscles from BC patients, which are associated with fatigue. Mice implanted with human BC xenografts recapitulate the muscle molecular composition changes seen in patients, coupled with a greater rate of contraction-induced fatigue. Multiple bioinformatics platforms in both human and mouse muscles have identified peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG) as central to this phenotype, with multiple PPARG target genes downregulated in response to tumor growth. The current study tested the hypothesis that the PPARG agonist pioglitazone (pio), a commonly prescribed diabetes drug, would rescue the transcriptional alterations observed in muscles of tumor-bearing mice.\n\nMethodsSixteen female NSG mice were implanted with breast cancer patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (BC-PDOX) via transplantation of Her2/neu+ human tumor fragments. BC-PDOX mice were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received daily oral pio at 30 mg.kg-1 (n=8), or a control group that received a similar volume of vehicle (n=8). Treatment was initiated when tumors reached a volume of 600mm3, and lasted for 2-weeks. Hindlimb muscles were isolated from BC-PDOX and non-tumor bearing mice for RNA-sequencing, gene expression validation, and ATP quantification. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in muscles from BC-PDOX mice relative to non-tumor bearing controls were identified using DESeq2, and multiple bioinformatics platforms were employed to contextualize the DEGs.\n\nResultsWe found that the administration of pio restored the muscle gene expression patterns of BC-PDOX mice to a profile resembling muscles of non-tumor bearing NSG control mice. Validation of skeletal muscle gene expression by qPCR confirmed pio increased the expression of PPARG target genes in skeletal muscles. Isolated mitochondria from muscles of BC-PDOX mice treated with pio contained greater levels of ATP. There were no differences in body weights, muscle weights, or tumor volumes in pio vs. vehicle treated BC-PDOX mice.\n\nConclusionsThese data demonstrate that oral pio supplementation rescues the BC-associated downregulation of PPARG target genes in skeletal muscle. Additionally, muscles from BC-PDOX mice treated with pio had greater levels of ATP, which would be associated a more fatigue-resistant muscle phenotype. Therefore, we propose that the FDA-approved and generic diabetes drug, pio, be considered as a supportive therapy for the treatment of BC-associated muscle fatigue.",

The relevance of SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTERS (SWEETs) in plant susceptibility to pathogens has been established, but their role in plant defense remains unknown. We identified Arabidopsis thaliana SWEETs (AtSWEETs) involved in defense against nonhost and host Pseudomonas syringae pathogens through reverse genetic screening of atsweet1-17 mutants. Double/triple mutant, complementation, and overexpression line analysis, and apoplastic sucrose estimation studies revealed that AtSWEET12 suppresses pathogen multiplication by limiting sucrose availability in the apoplast. Localization studies suggested that plant defense occurred via increased plasma membrane targeting of AtSWEET12 with concomitant AtSWEET11 protein reduction. Moreover, the heterooligomerization of AtSWEET11 and AtSWEET12 was involved in regulating sucrose transport. Our results highlight a PAMP-mediated defense strategy against foliar bacterial pathogens whereby plants control AtSWEET11-mediated sucrose efflux in the apoplast through AtSWEET12. We uncover a fascinating new mechanism of pathogen starvation as a broad-spectrum disease resistance mechanism in parallel with existing immune pathways.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe transporter AtSWEET12 restricts bacterial pathogen multiplication by regulating sucrose availability to pathogens in the apoplast.",

Season and region effects were found to significantly affect species abundance for a total of 41 and 40 species respectively, while interannual effects were found to be significant for 19 species, and finally, the NAO index for 3 species. Global LPUE density maps are presented for a number of selected species and a subsample of trips where VMS records were available.

    "abstract": "The Baja California Pacific Islands (BCPI) is a seabird hotspot in the southern California Current System supporting 129 seabird breeding populations of 23 species and over one million birds annually. These islands had a history of environmental degradation because of invasive alien species, human disturbance, and contaminants that caused the extirpation of 27 seabird populations. Most of the invasive mammals have been eradicated and breeding colonies have been restored with social attraction techniques. We have systematic information for most of the breeding populations since 2008. To assess population trends, we analyzed data and present results for 19 seabird species on ten island groups. The maximum number of breeding pairs for each nesting season was used to estimate the population growth rate ({lambda}) for each species at every island colony. We performed a nonparametric bootstrapping to assess whether seabird breeding populations are increasing or decreasing. San Benito, Natividad, and San Jeronimo are the top three islands in terms of abundance of breeding pairs. The most widespread species is Cassins Auklet with 14 colonies. Twenty-three populations of 13 species are significantly increasing while eight populations of six species are decreasing. We did not find statistical significance for 30 populations, however, 20 have {lambda}>1 which suggest they are growing. Seven of the 18 species for which we estimated a regional population trend are significantly increasing, including three surface-nesting species: Brown Pelican, Elegant Tern and Laysan Albatross, and four burrow-nesting species: Ainleys and Ashy Storm-Petrels, and Craveris and Guadalupe Murrelet. Our results suggest that the BCPI support healthy and growing populations of seabirds that have shown to be resilient to extreme environmental conditions such as the \"Blob\", and that such resilience has been strengthen from conservation and restoration actions such as the eradication of invasive mammals and social attraction techniques.",

    "abstract": "Pesticides are one of the main drivers of the worldwide amphibian decline. Their actual toxicity depends on a number of factors, like the species in focus or the developmental stage of exposed individuals. As ectothermic species, the metabolism of amphibians is influenced by ambient temperature. Therefore, temperature also affects metabolic rates and thus processes that might enhance or reduce toxic effects. Studies about the interactive effect of temperature and toxicity on amphibians are rare and deliver contrasting results. To investigate the temperature-dependent pesticide sensitivity of larvae of two European species we conducted acute toxicity tests for the viticultural fungicide Folpan(R) 500 SC with the active ingredient folpet at different temperatures (6{degrees}C, 11{degrees}C, 16{degrees}C, 21{degrees}C, 26{degrees}C). Sensitivity of Rana temporaria and Bufotes viridis was highly affected by temperature: early larvae (Gosner stage 20) were about twice more sensitive to Folpan(R) 500 SC at 6{degrees}C compared to 21{degrees}C. Next to temperature, species and developmental stage of larvae had an effect on sensitivity. The most sensitive individuals (early stages of R. temporaria at 6{degrees}C) were 14.5 times more sensitive than the least sensitive ones (early stages of B. viridis at 26{degrees}C). Our results raise concerns about typical ecotoxicological studies with amphibians that are often conducted at temperatures between 15{degrees}C and 20{degrees}C. We suggest that future test designs should be performed at temperatures that reflect the temperature range amphibians are exposed to in their natural habitats.

    "abstract": "The concern with human health has increased the interest in producing foods enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), directly or naturally by inclusion in the animals diet. The positive effects such as antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic have been observed in pigs and rats, used as human models for study. The present study evaluated the effect of cows milk with different lipid profiles on performance, serum fatty acid profile, biochemical analysis, and a complete blood count of gilts used as a human model. At 34 days, thirty gilts were equally distributed in three treatments. Experimental treatments were milk from cows without the oil supplementation (C), milk from cows fed an enriched diet with linseed oil (n-3), and milk from cows fed an enriched diet with soybean oil (n-6). Milk supplementation was performed until the age of 190 days, provided once in the morning. The n-3 and n-6 milk reduced the concentration of myristic acid in the blood and increased the leukocytes. Milk enriched with n-3 compared to n-6 reduced stearic acid. In conclusion, milk with a better PUFA profile can reduce saturated fatty acids in the blood and alter the concentration of cells in the defense system.",

    "abstract": "Cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics are crucial for the secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells in response to elevated blood glucose concentrations. To obtain better insights into the interactions between energy production and mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics, we combine live-cell mitochondria imaging with biophysical-based modeling and network analysis to elucidate the principle regulating mitochondrial morphology to match metabolic demand in pancreatic beta cells. A minimalistic differential equation-based model for beta cells was constructed to include glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, simple calcium dynamics, and graph-based fission/fusion dynamics controlled by ATP synthase flux and proton leak flux. The model revealed that mitochondrial fission occurs in response to hyperglycemia, starvation, ATP synthase inhibition, uncoupling, and diabetic condition, in which the rate of proton leak exceeds the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Under these metabolic challenges, the propensities of tip-to-tip fusion events simulated from the microscopic images of the mitochondrial networks were lower than those in the control group and prevented mitochondrial network formation. The modeling and network analysis could serve as the basis for further detailed research on the mechanisms of bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics coupling.",

    "abstract": "MotivationConvolutional neural networks have enabled unprecedented breakthroughs in a variety of computer vision tasks. They have also drawn much attention from other domains, including drug discovery and drug development. In this study, we develop a computational method based on convolutional neural networks to tackle a fundamental question in drug discovery and development, i.e. the prediction of compound-protein interactions based on compound structure and protein sequence. We propose a hierarchical graph convolutional network (HGCN) to encode small molecules. The HGCN aggregates a molecule embedding from substructure embeddings, which are synthesized from atom embeddings. As small molecules usually share substructures, computing a molecule embedding from those common substructures allows us to learn better generic models. We then combined the HGCN with a one-dimensional convolutional network to construct a complete model for predicting compound-protein interactions. Furthermore we apply an explanation technique, Grad-CAM, to visualize the contribution of each amino acid into the prediction.\n\nResultsExperiments using different datasets show the improvement of our model compared to other GCN-based methods and a sequence based method, DeepDTA, in predicting compound-protein interactions. Each prediction made by the model is also explainable and can be used to identify critical residues mediating the interaction.\n\nAvailability and implementationhttps://github.com/banhdzui/cpi_hgcn.git",
