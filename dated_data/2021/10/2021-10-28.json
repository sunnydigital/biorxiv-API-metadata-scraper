    "abstract": "The feedback people receive on their behavior shapes the process of belief formation and self-efficacy in mastering a given task. However, the neural and computational mechanisms of how the subjective value of these beliefs, and the corresponding affect, bias the learning process remain unclear. We investigated these mechanisms during the learning of self-efficacy beliefs using fMRI, pupillometry, and computational modeling, and by analyzing individual differences in affective experience. Biases in the formation of self-efficacy beliefs were associated with affect, pupil dilation, and neural activity within the anterior insula, amygdala, ventral tegmental area/ substantia nigra, and mPFC. Specifically, neural and pupil responses map the valence of the prediction errors in correspondence with individuals experienced affect and learning bias during belief formation. Together with the functional connectivity dynamics of the anterior insula within this network, our results hint at neural and computational mechanisms that integrate affect into the process of belief formation.",

    "abstract": "Many hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells function as place cells, increasing their firing rate when a specific place field is traversed. The dependence of CA1 place cell firing on position within the place field is asymmetric. We investigated the source of this asymmetry by injecting triangular depolarizing current ramps to approximate the spatially-tuned, temporally-diffuse depolarizing synaptic input received by these neurons while traversing a place field. Ramps were applied to CA1 pyramidal neurons from male rats in vitro (slice electrophysiology) and in silico (multi-compartmental NEURON model). Under control conditions, CA1 neurons fired more action potentials at higher frequencies on the up-ramp versus the down-ramp. This effect was more pronounced for dendritic compared to somatic ramps. We incorporated a four-state Markov scheme for NaV1.6 channels into our model and calibrated the spatial dependence of long-term inactivation according to the literature; this spatial dependence was sufficient to explain the difference in dendritic versus somatic ramps. Long-term inactivation reduced the firing frequency by decreasing open-state occupancy, and reduced spike amplitude during trains by decreasing occupancy in closed states, which comprise the available pool. PKC activator phorbol-dibutyrate, known to reduce NaV long-term inactivation, removed spike amplitude attenuation in vitro more visibly in dendrites and greatly reduced adaptation, consistent with our hypothesized mechanism. Intracellular application of a peptide inducing long-term NaV inactivation elicited spike amplitude attenuation during spike trains in the soma and greatly enhanced adaptation. Our synergistic experimental/computational approach shows that long-term inactivation of NaV1.6 is a key mechanism of adaptation in CA1 pyramidal cells.\n\nSignificance statementThe hippocampus plays an important role in certain types of memory, in part through context-specific firing of \"place cells\"; these cells were first identified in rodents as being particularly active when an animal is in a specific location in an environment, called the place field of that neuron. In this in vitro/in silico study, we found that long-term inactivation of sodium channels causes adaptation in the firing rate that could potentially skew the firing of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons earlier within a place field. A computational model of the sodium channel revealed differential regulation of spike frequency and amplitude by long-term inactivation, which may be a general mechanism for spike frequency adaptation in the central nervous system.",

Here, we investigated whether inappropriate macrophage-evoked inflammation alters CNS control of daily-life animal locomotion using a set of zebrafish mutants selected for specific macrophage dysfunction and microglia deficiency. Large-scale genetic and computational analyses revealed that NOD-like receptor nlrc3l mutants are capable of normal motility and visuomotor response, but preferentially swim less in the daytime, suggesting low motivation rather than physical impairment. Examining their brain activities and structures implicate impaired dopaminergic descending circuits, where neutrophils abnormally infiltrate. Furthermore, neutrophil depletion recovered daytime locomotion. Restoring wild-type macrophages reversed behavioral and neutrophil aberrations, while three other microglia-lacking mutants failed to phenocopy nlrc3l mutants. Overall, we reveal how peripheral inflammatory macrophages with elevated pro-inflammatory cues (including il1b, tnfa, cxcl8a) in the absence of microglia co-opt neutrophils to infiltrate the brain, thereby enabling local modulation of neural circuits affecting spontaneous locomotion.",

    "abstract": "New therapeutic strategies to reduce sepsis-related mortality are urgently needed, as sepsis accounts for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Since hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for producing blood and immune cells, including in response to immunological stress, we explored their potential for treating sepsis. In a mouse model of Group A Streptococcus (GAS)-induced sepsis, severe immunological stress was associated with significant depletion of bone marrow HSPCs and mortality within approximately 5-7 days. We hypothesized that the inflammatory environment of GAS infection drives rapid HSPC differentiation and depletion that can be rescued by infusion of donor HSPCs. Indeed, infusion of 10,000 naive HSPCs into GAS-infected mice resulted in rapid myelopoiesis and a 50-60% increase in overall survival. Surprisingly, mice receiving donor HSPCs displayed a similar pathogen load compared to untreated mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significantly increased number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in HSPC-infused mice, which correlated with reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and restored HSPC levels. These findings suggest that HSPCs play an essential immunomodulatory role that may translate into new therapeutic strategies for sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Microbial interactions such as those between phytoplankton and bacteria been studied intensively using specific model organisms, due to their potential impact on ecosystems and biogeochemistry. Yet, to what extent interactions differ between closely related organisms, or how these interactions change over time or culture conditions, remains unclear. Here, we characterize the interactions between five strains each of two globally abundant marine microorganisms, Prochlorococcus (a phototroph) and Alteromonas (a heterotroph), from the first encounter between individual strains and over more than a year of repeated cycles of exponential growth and long-term nitrogen starvation. Prochlorococcus-Alteromonas interactions had little effect on traditional growth parameters such as Prochlorococcus growth rate, maximal fluorescence or lag phase, affecting primarily the dynamics of culture decline, which we interpret as representing cell mortality and lysis. The shape of the Prochlorococcus decline curve and the carrying capacity of the co-cultures were determined by the phototroph and not the heterotroph strains involved. Comparing various mathematical models of culture mortality suggests that Prochlorococcus death rate increases over time in mono-cultures but decreases in co-cultures, with cells potentially becoming more resistant to stress. Our results demonstrate intra-species differences in ecologically-relevant co-culture outcomes. These include the recycling efficiency of N and whether the interactions are mutually synergistic or competitive. They also highlight the information-rich growth and death curves as a useful readout of the interaction phenotype.\n\nSignificance StatementInteractions between phytoplankton and marine bacteria impact global ecosystems and biogeochemistry. Here, we explore how intra-species variability affects the interactions between Prochlorococcus, a globally abundant photosynthetic cyanobacetrium and Alteromonas, a heterotrophic bacterium that lives off and recycles organic matter. Under nitrogen starvation, Prochlorococcus growing alone increasingly accumulate damage and die, whereas in co-culture with Alteromonas they become increasingly resilient. The specific Prochlorococcus strain had a much larger effect on co-culture behavior than the Alteromonas strain, determining whether the interactions are mutually synergistic or potentially competitive. These results show how ecologically relevant outcomes of interactions may vary between closely related microorganisms, and highlight growth and death curves from laboratory (co)-cultures as information-rich views of microbial growth and death.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) cause mortality, morbidity, and waste of healthcare resources. HAIs are also an important driver of antimicrobial resistance, which is increasing around the world. Beginning in November 2016, we instituted an initiative to detect outbreaks of HAI using prospective whole genome sequencing-based surveillance of bacterial pathogens collected from hospitalized patients. Here we describe the biodiversity of bacteria sampled from hospitalized patients at a single center, as revealed through systematic analysis of their genomes. We sequenced the genomes of 3,004 bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients collected over a 25-month period. We identified bacteria belonging to 97 distinct species, which were distributed among 14 species groups. Within these groups, isolates could be distinguished from one another by both average nucleotide identity (ANI) and principal component analysis of accessory genes (PCA-A). Genetic distances between isolates and rates of evolution varied between different species, which has implications for the selection of distance cut-offs for outbreak analysis. Antimicrobial resistance genes and the sharing of mobile genetic elements between different species were frequently observed. Overall, this study describes the population structure of pathogens circulating in a single healthcare setting, and shows how investigating microbial population dynamics can inform genomic epidemiology studies.\n\nImportanceHospitalized patients are at increased risk of becoming infected with antibiotic-resistant organisms. We used whole-genome sequencing to survey and compare over 3,000 bacterial isolates collected from hospitalized patients at a large medical center over a two-year period. We identified nearly 100 different bacterial species, suggesting that patients can be infected with a wide variety of different organisms. When we examined how genetic relatedness differed between species, we found that different species are likely evolving at different rates within our hospital. This is significant because the identification of bacterial outbreaks in the hospital currently relies on genetic similarity cut-offs, which are often applied uniformly across organisms. Finally, we found that antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements were abundant among the bacterial isolates we sampled. Overall, this study provides an in-depth view of the genomic diversity and evolution of bacteria sampled from hospitalized patients, as well as genetic similarity estimates that can inform hospital outbreak detection and prevention efforts.",

The Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is characterized by agenesis of the uterus and upper part of the vagina in females with normal ovarian function. Although heavily studied, the cause of the disease is still enigmatic. Current research in the field of MRKH mainly focusses on DNA-sequencing efforts and, so far, failed to decipher the nature and heterogeneity of the disease, thereby holding back scientific and clinical progress. Here, we developed long-term expandable organoid cultures from endometrium found in uterine rudiment horns of MRKH patients. Phenotypically, they share great similarity with healthy control organoids and are surprisingly fully hormone responsive. Transcriptome analyses, however, identified an array of dysregulated genes that point at potentially disease-causing pathways altered during the development of the female reproductive tract. We consider the endometrial organoid cultures to be a powerful research tool that promise to enable an array of studies into the pathogenic origins of MRKH syndrome and possible treatment opportunities to improve patient quality of life.",

    "abstract": "A phylogenetic framework explaining plant secondary metabolite diversity is lacking, but metabolite classes could represent adaptations to habitat resource availability. We test the hypothesis that primary adaptive strategies (competitors, C; stress-tolerators, S; ruderals, R) are associated, respectively, with nitrogenous metabolites synthesized in persistent organs (alkaloids), nitrogen-lacking aromatic terpenes and phenolics, and nitrogenous compounds prevalent in reproductive tissues (cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates). A matrix was compiled of 1019 species for which secondary metabolite pathways and CSR strategies are known. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness and native biomes, we found that most phytochemical pathways did not correlate with strategy axes, but certain key associations were evident. C-selection was positively associated with amino acid-derived phenylpropanoids (low phylogenetic relatedness; {lambda} <0.5) and pyrrolizidine alkaloids and galloyl derivatives (high {lambda}), and negatively with N-lacking linear monoterpenes (low {lambda}). Nitrogenous cyanogenic glucosides positively correlated with R-selection (low {lambda}). Terpenoids were widely distributed, but correlated positively with S- and negatively with R-selection (low {lambda}). Twenty-six correlations between phytochemicals and biomes (low {lambda}) were evident. Most secondary metabolite synthesis pathways are widespread, reflecting common roles and obligate defence, and strong phylogenetic effects are often evident. However, the character of phytochemical/adaptive strategy associations agrees with ecological theory and thus reflects adaptation.",

This might drive resource competition dynamics that cumulatively impact tree species coexistence, but few manipulative experiments have directly tested this. Combining surveys and experiments in a modern coexistence theory framework, we tested how variation in mycorrhizal strategies and nutrient conditions affect competitive outcomes between co-occurring ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species. The dependency on EM symbioses increased with latitude and nitrogen (N) limitation, matching global trends. Host-specific soil microbiome conditioning and N fertilization combined to qualitatively affect coexistence outcomes. Lower N conditions favored EM over AM trees, but N fertilization reversed this outcome for southern species, consistent with regional-scale forest mycorrhizal transitions. As the magnitude and outcome of microbially-mediated competition depends on mycorrhizal differentiation and soil nutrient availability, this strongly supports the importance of mycorrhizal symbioses in driving large-scale biogeographic patterns of tree species.",

    "abstract": "In restoration ecology, the Field of Dreams Hypothesis posits that restoration efforts that create a suitable environment could lead to eventual recovery of the remaining aspects of the ecosystem through natural processes. Natural processes following partial restoration has lead to ecosystem recovery in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. However, understanding the efficacy of a \"field of dreams\" approach requires comparison of different approaches to partial restoration in terms of spatial, temporal, and ecological scale to what would happen with more comprehensive restoration efforts. We explore the relative effect of partial restoration and ongoing recovery on restoration efficacy with a dynamical model based on temperate rocky reefs in Northern California. We analyze our model for both the ability and rate of bull kelp forest recovery under different restoration strategies. We compare the efficacy of a partial restoration approach with a more comprehensive restoration effort by exploring how kelp recovery likelihood and rate change with varying intensities of urchin removal and kelp outplanting over different time periods and spatial scales. We find that, for the case of bull kelp forests, setting more favorable initial conditions for kelp recovery through implementing both urchin harvesting and kelp outplanting at the start of the restoration project has a bigger impact on the kelp recovery rate than applying restoration efforts through a longer period of time. Therefore partial restoration efforts, in terms of spatial and temporal scale, can be significantly more effective when applied across multiple ecological scales in terms of both the capacity and rate of achieving the target outcomes.",

In self-compatible hermaphrodites, individuals may vary in their lifetime propensity for selfing, which consists of individual and environmental components. According to the reproductive assurance hypothesis explaining partial selfing, a key environmental factor is mate availability, which fluctuates with population density.\n\nWe quantified individual variation in selfing propensity in a hermaphroditic snail by manipulating mate availability, recording mating behaviour, estimating selfing rates from progeny arrays, and measuring female lifetime fitness. We found substantial among-individual variation in selfing propensity, including pure outcrossers, pure selfers, and two types of plastic individuals. This variation only manifested in the laboratory; for the highly dense field population, data suggest full outcrossing. Meanwhile, experimental levels of mate availability (low versus moderate) neither significantly affected selfing propensities nor selfing rates.\n\nInstead, selfing propensities had an individual, environment-independent component. Our results imply that selfing propensities are partially heritable and, when selected on, cause mean selfing rates to evolve. We propose that genetic variation in selfing propensities offers a reconciliation between the reproductive assurance hypothesis and its limited empirical support in animals: distributions of selfing propensities vary temporally and spatially, thus obscuring the relationship between population density and realised selfing rates.",

    "abstract": "Numerous empirical studies have witnessed a plastic increase in meiotic recombination rate in organisms experiencing physiological stress due to unfavourable environmental conditions. Yet, it is not clear enough which characteristics of an ecological factor (intensity, duration, variability, etc.) make it stressogenic and therefore recombinogenic for an organism. Several previous theoretical models proceeded from the assumption that organisms increase their recombination rate when the environment becomes more severe, and demonstrated the evolutionary advantage of such recombination strategy. Here we explore another stress-associated recombination strategy, implying a reversible increase in recombination rate each time when the environment alternates. We allow such plastic changes in the organisms, grown in an environment different from that of their parents, and, optionally, also in their offspring. We show that such shift-inducible recombination is always favoured over intermediate constant optimal recombination. Besides, it sometimes outcompetes also zero and free optimal constant recombination, therefore making selection on recombination less polarized. Shift-inducible strategies with a longer, transgenerational plastic effect, are favoured under slightly stronger selection and longer period. These results hold for both panmixia and partial selfing, although selfing makes the dynamics of recombination modifier alleles faster. Our results suggest that epigenetic factors, presumably underlying the environmental plasticity of recombination, may play an important evolutionary role.",

    "abstract": "An unexpectedly high proportion of SNPs on the X chromosome in the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 data were identified with significant sex differences in minor allele frequencies (sdMAF). sdMAF persisted for many of these SNPs in the recently released high coverage whole genome sequence, and it was consistent between the five super-populations. Among the 245,825 common biallelic SNPs in phase 3 data presumed to be high quality, 2,039 have genome-wide significant sdMAF (p-value <5e-8). sdMAF varied by location: (NPR)=0.83%, pseudo-autosomal region (PAR1)=0.29%, PAR2=13.1%, and PAR3=0.85% of SNPs had sdMAF, and they were clustered at the NPR-PAR boundaries, among others. sdMAF at the NPR-PAR boundaries are biologically expected due to sex-linkage, but have generally been ignored in association studies. For comparison, similar analyses found only 6, 1 and 0 SNPs with significant sdMAF on chromosomes 1, 7 and 22, respectively. Future X chromosome analyses need to take sdMAF into account.",

    "abstract": "The cuticle, a hydrophobic layer of cutin and waxes synthesized by plant epidermal cells, is the major barrier to water loss when stomata are closed. Dissecting the genetic architecture of natural variation for maize leaf cuticular conductance (gc) is important for identifying genes relevant to improving crop productivity in drought-prone environments. To this end, we performed an integrated genome- and transcriptome-wide association study (GWAS/TWAS) to identify candidate genes putatively regulating variation in leaf gc. Of the 22 plausible candidate genes identified, five were predicted to be involved in cuticle precursor biosynthesis and export, two in cell wall modification, nine in intracellular membrane trafficking, and seven in the regulation of cuticle development. A gene encoding an INCREASED SALT TOLERANCE1-LIKE1 (ISTL1) protein putatively involved in intracellular protein and membrane trafficking was identified in GWAS and TWAS as the strongest candidate causal gene. A set of maize nested near-isogenic lines that harbor the ISTL1 genomic region from eight donor parents were evaluated for gc, confirming the association between gc and ISTL1 in a haplotype-based association analysis. The findings of this study provide novel insights into the role of regulatory variants in the development of the maize leaf cuticle, and will ultimately assist breeders to develop drought-tolerant maize for target environments.\n\nSentence summaryWe performed an integrated GWAS/TWAS and identified 22 candidate genes putatively regulating variation in maize leaf gc. The association between gc and the strongest candidate causal gene, ISTL1, was validated with maize nested near-isogenic lines.",

    "abstract": "Engineering synthetic cells has a broad appeal, from understanding living cells to designing novel biomaterials for therapeutics, biosensing, and hybrid interfaces. A key prerequisite to creating synthetic cells is a functional three-dimensional container capable of orchestrating biochemical reactions. In this study, we present an easy and effective technique to make cell-sized porous containers crafted using the interactions between biomolecular condensates and actin cytoskeleton - we coin them actinosomes. This approach uses polypeptide/nucleoside triphosphate condensates and localizes actin monomers on their surface. By triggering actin polymerization at the expense of sequestered ATP and using osmotic gradients, the condensates are structurally transformed into containers with the boundary made up of actin filaments and polylysine polymers. We show that the GTP-to-ATP ratio is a crucial parameter for forming actinosomes: insufficient ATP prevents condensate dissolution while excess ATP leads to undesired crumpling. The surface of actinosomes lacks any structural order and is porous. We show the functionality of the actinosomes by using them as bioreactors capable of protein synthesis. Actinosomes are a handy addition to the synthetic cell platform, with appealing properties like ease-of-production, inherent encapsulation capacity, and an active surface which holds the potential to trigger signaling cascades and form multicellular assemblies, with potential for medical and biotechnological applications.",

To provide a comprehensive visualization of chromatin architecture and other multi-omics data for lung cancer research, we have constructed a comprehensive database, LungCancer3D (http://www.lungcancer3d.net). This web-based tool focuses on displaying human lung cancer-related HiC data along with a variety of other publicly available data, such as RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, DNA methylation, DNA mutation, and copy number variations. Researchers can visualize these diverse multi-omics data directly through the genome browser and discover how the genes expression is regulated at diverse levels. For example, we have demonstrated that the high expression level of C-MYC in lung cancer may be caused by the distant enhancer introduced by the de novo chromatin loops in lung cancer cells to bind the C-MYC promoter. The integrated multi-omics analyses through the LungCancer3D website can reveal the mechanisms underlying lung cancer development and provide potential targets for lung cancer therapy.",

The development of new statistical and computational methods in Bioconductor for such data will be facilitated by easy availability of landmark datasets using standard data classes.\n\nResultsWe collected, processed, and packaged publicly available landmark datasets from important single-cell multimodal protocols, including CITE-Seq, ECCITE-Seq, SCoPE2, scNMT, 10X Multiome, seqFISH, and G&T. We integrate data modalities via the MultiAssayExperiment Bioconductor class, document and re-distribute datasets as the SingleCellMultiModal package in Bioconductors Cloud-based ExperimentHub. The result is single-command actualization of landmark datasets from seven single-cell multimodal data generation technologies, without need for further data processing or wrangling in order to analyze and develop methods within Bioconductors ecosystem of hundreds of packages for single-cell and multimodal data.\n\nConclusionsWe provide two examples of integrative analyses that are greatly simplified by SingleCellMultiModal. The package will facilitate development of bioinformatic and statistical methods in Bioconductor to meet the challenges of integrating molecular layers and analyzing phenotypic outputs including cell differentiation, activity, and disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryExperimental data packages that provide landmark datasets have historically played an important role in the development of new statistical methods in Bioconductor by lowering the barrier of access to relevant data, providing a common testing ground for software development and benchmarking, and encouraging interoperability around common data structures.

    "abstract": "Identification and indexing of chemical compounds in full-text articles are essential steps in biomedical article categorization, information extraction, and biological text mining. BioCreative Challenge was established to evaluate methods for biological text mining and information extraction. Track 2 of BioCreative VII (summer 2021) consists of two subtasks: chemical identification and chemical indexing in full-text PubMed articles. The chemical identification subtask also includes two parts: chemical named entity recognition (NER) and chemical normalization. In this paper, we present our work on developing a hybrid pipeline for chemical named entity recognition, chemical normalization, and chemical indexing in full-text PubMed articles. Specifically, we applied BERT-based methods for chemical NER and chemical indexing, and a sieve-based dictionary matching method for chemical normalization. For subtask 1, we used PubMedBERT with data augmentation on the chemical NER task. Several chemical-MeSH dictionaries including MeSH.XML, SUPP.XML, MRCONSO.RFF, and PubTator chemical annotations are used in a specific order to get the best performance on chemical normalization. We achieved an F1 score of 0.86 and 0.7668 on chemical NER and chemical normalization, respectively. For subtask 2, we formulated it as a binary prediction problem for each individual chemical compound name. We then used a BERT-based model with engineered features and achieved a strict F1 score of 0.4825 on the test set, which is substantially higher than the median F1 score (0.3971) of all the submissions.",

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for the success of computer-aided drug discovery. However, the accuracy of current scoring functions is usually unsatisfactory due to their rough approximation or sometimes even omittance of many factors involved in protein-ligand binding. For instance, the intrinsic dynamic of the protein-ligand binding state is usually disregarded in scoring function because these rapid binding affinity prediction approaches are only based on a representative complex structure of the protein and ligand in the binding state. That is, the dynamic protein-ligand binding complex ensembles are simplified as a static snapshot in calculation. In this study, two novel features were proposed for characterizing the dynamic properties of protein-ligand binding based on the static structure of the complex, which is expected to be a valuable complement to the current scoring functions. The two features demonstrate the geometry-shape matching between a protein and a ligand as well as the dynamic stability of protein-ligand binding. We further combined these two novel features with several classical scoring functions to develop a binary classification model called DyScore that uses the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm to classify compound poses as binders or non-binders. We have found that DyScore achieves state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing active and decoy ligands on both enhanced DUD dataset and external test sets with both proposed novel features showing significant contributions to the improved performance. Especially, DyScore exhibits superior performance on early recognition, a crucial requirement for success in virtual screening and de novo drug design.

The locus codes for two unrelated and distinctly regulated proteins: p14ARF and p16INK4a, which inhibit MDM2 and CDK4/6, respectively. Loss of CDKN2A is also a recurrent event in relapsed neuroblastoma, a childhood tumour that arises from neural crest cells. To examine the consequences of the loss of the two distinct gene transcripts in neuroblastoma, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knockout p14, p16 and p14+p16 in SY5Y cells. RNA sequencing of the transcriptome revealed a striking shift towards an immature Schwann cell precursor-like phenotype with mesenchymal characteristics, specifically in the p16 and p14+p16 knockouts. High-throughput drug screening of p16 and p14+p16 knockout clones identified a large increase in sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. On protein level, we were able to confirm that EGFR pathway activation is higher in p14+p16 knockout cells and that treatment with the EGFR inhibitor afatinib resulted in higher levels of apoptosis. Afatinib also reduced tumour growth in vivo in xenografts transplanted with p14+p16 knockout SY5Y cells. Overall, our study suggests that CDKN2A deletion in neuroblastoma relates to a phenotypic shift towards a more progenitor like state and increases sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors.",

Natural products derived from the genus Streptomyces represent a rich and diverse repertoire of chemical molecules from which new antibiotics are likely to be found. However, a major challenge is that the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for natural product synthesis are often poorly expressed under laboratory culturing conditions, thus preventing isolation and screening of novel chemicals. To address this, we describe a novel approach to activate silent BGCs through rewiring endogenous regulation using synthetic gene regulators based upon CRISPR-Cas. First, we create CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) systems that allow for highly programmable and effective gene repression and activation in Streptomyces. We then harness these tools to activate a silent BGC through perturbing its endogenous regulatory network. Together, this work advances the synthetic regulatory toolbox for Streptomyces and facilitates the programmable activation of silent BGCs for novel chemical discovery.",

Here, utilizing a photothrombotic murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we show that imatinib-mediated inhibition of stroke-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction coincided with decreased expression of genes associated with inflammation and fibrosis in the cerebrovasculature. We found that imatinib effectively dampened stroke-induced reactive gliosis and myofibroblast transdifferentiation, whilst having very limited effect on the rest of the glia scar and on peripheral leukocyte infiltration. Further, our data suggest that consolidation of the PDGFR+ portion of the fibrotic scar in imatinib-treated mice contributes to the improvement in functional outcome compared to the vehicle controls, where the PDGFR+ scar is expanding. Comparison with human stroke transcriptome databases revealed significant overlap with imatinib-regulated genes, suggesting imatinib may modulate reactive gliosis and fibrotic scarring also in human stroke.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated genetic targeting of microglia remains challenging. Overcoming this hurdle is essential for gene editing in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we characterized the minimal/native promoter of the HexB gene, which is known to be specifically and stably expressed in the microglia during homeostatic and pathological conditions. Dual reporter and serial deletion assays identified the critical role of the natural 5 untranslated region (-97 bp related to the first ATG) in driving transcriptional activity of the mouse HexB gene. The native promoter region of mouse, human and monkey HexB located at -135, -134 and -170 bp to the first ATG, respectively. These promoters were highly active and specific in microglia with strong cross-species transcriptional activities, but had no activities in primary astrocytes. In addition, we identified a 135 bp promoter of CD68 gene was also highly active in microglia but not in astrocytes. Considering that HexB is specifically expressed in microglia, not in monocytes/macrophages or other neuronal cells, these data suggest that the newly characterized 134 bp microglia-specific HexB promoter can be an ideal candidate for microglia-targeting AAV gene therapy, which could be developed for HIV eradication in the brain wherein microglia harbor the main HIV reservoirs in the CNS.\n\nSummaryIt is hard to overstate the importance of gene therapy that can remove viral genes from human cells. A cure for HIV would mean a lifetime free of treatment for patients who now must maintain a strict regimen of ART indefinitely. In order to develop a cure using AAV delivery, payload DNA must meet the AAV vector size limitations, and the payload genes must be expressed appropriately. Previous studies have identified microglia-specific HexB gene that shows stable expression during neural homeostasis and pathogenesis. Our study identified the essential HexB gene promoter (134 bp) as a strong candidate for AAV gene therapy to specifically target the brain microglia, the main cellular reservoirs of HIV in the central nervous system. Our studies continue to move us closer to identifying target-specific gene therapy for NeuroAIDS.",

Several lines of evidence point towards a role for microglia and other brain macrophages in disease initiation and progression, but exactly how lesion formation is triggered is currently unknown. Here, we characterized early changes in MS brain tissue through transcriptomic analysis of normal appearing white matter (NAWM). We found that NAWM was characterized by enriched expression of genes associated with inflammation and cellular stress derived from brain macrophages.

    "abstract": "Multi-armed restless bandit tasks are regularly applied in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to assess exploration and exploitation behavior in structured environments. These models are also readily applied to examine effects of (virtual) brain lesions on performance, and to infer neurocomputational mechanisms using neuroimaging or pharmacological approaches. However, to infer individual, psychologically meaningful parameters from such data, computational cognitive modeling is typically applied. Recent studies indicate that softmax (SM) decision rule models that include a representation of environmental dynamics (e.g. the Kalman Filter) and additional parameters for modeling exploration and perseveration (Kalman SMEP) fit human bandit task data better than competing models. Parameter and model recovery are two central requirements for computational models: parameter recovery refers to the ability to recover true data-generating parameters; model recovery refers to the ability to correctly identify the true data generating model using model comparison techniques. Here we comprehensively examined parameter and model recovery of the Kalman SMEP model as well as nested model versions, i.e. models without the additional parameters, using simulation and Bayesian inference. Parameter recovery improved with increasing trial numbers, from around .8 for 100 trials to around .93 for 300 trials. Model recovery analyses likewise confirmed acceptable recovery of the Kalman SMEP model. Model recovery was lower for nested Kalman filter models as well as delta rule models with fixed learning rates.\n\nExploratory analyses examined associations of model parameters with model-free performance metrics. Random exploration, captured by the inverse softmax temperature, was associated with lower accuracy and more switches. For the exploration bonus parameter modeling directed exploration, we confirmed an inverse-U-shaped association with accuracy, such that both an excess and a lack of directed exploration reduced accuracy. Taken together, these analyses underline that the Kalman SMEP model fulfills basic requirements of a cognitive model.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection produces a long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4+ T cells that represents the major barrier to HIV-1 cure. The reservoir contains both intact and defective proviruses, but only the proviruses that are intact can re-initiate infection upon cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here we combine 4 color quantitative polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing (Q4PCR) to distinguish intact and defective proviruses and measure reservoir content longitudinally in 12 infected individuals. Q4PCR differs from other PCR based methods in that the amplified proviruses are sequence verified as intact or defective. Samples were collected systematically over the course of up to 10 years beginning shortly after the initiation of ART. The size of the defective reservoir was relatively stable with minimal decay during the 10-year observation period. In contrast, the intact proviral reservoir decayed with estimated half-life of 4.9 years. Nevertheless, both intact and defective proviral reservoirs are dynamic. As a result, the fraction of intact proviruses found in expanded clones of CD4+ T cells increases overtime with a concomitant decrease in overall reservoir complexity. Thus, reservoir decay measurements by Q4PCR are quantitatively similar to viral outgrowth (VOA) and intact proviral DNA PCR (IPDA) with the addition of sequence information that distinguishes intact and defective proviruses and informs reservoir dynamics. The data is consistent with the notion that intact and defective proviruses are under distinct selective pressure, and that the intact proviral reservoir is progressively enriched in expanded clones of CD4+ T cells resulting in diminishing complexity over time.\n\nSignificanceHIV-1 infection requires lifelong treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to viral rebound of a latent reservoir of intact, transcriptionally silent provirus found to persist in the genome of CD4+ T cells. One of the major challenges to understanding the nature of the latent reservoir is accurately characterizing the measuring the size of the reservoir. Herein, we use quadruplex polymerase chain reaction (Q4PCR) to assess the dynamics of the latent reservoir in HIV+ individuals who have been on long-term ART for up to 10 years. Our results show that Q4PCR can be used to accurately measure the latent reservoir, while providing the added benefit of assessing the genetic diversity of the reservoir to better understand changes to clonal dynamics overtime.",

    "abstract": "Essential peptidoglycan synthases, like penicillin binding proteins 2 and 3 (PBP2/PBP3) of Escherichia coli, define shape by orchestrating cell elongation and division, respectively. Despite being intensively studied as drug targets, the regulatory rules governing their production remain poorly understood. During infection, the closely related pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium downregulates PBP2/PBP3 production and replace them with alternative peptidoglycan synthases, PBP2SAL/PBP3SAL, absent in E. coli. The bases for such switch in morphogenetic proteins are unknown. Here, we show that the S. Typhimurium regulator OmpR triggers PBP2SAL and PBP3SAL expression responding solely to acid pH and define a shared motif present in upstream regions of the PBP2SAL- and PBP3SAL-coding genes sufficient for such control. The elimination of PBP2/PBP3 in infection conditions is however multifactorial, requiring acidity, high osmolarity and being favoured by OmpR and the Prc protease. Remarkably, we found that E. coli loses the essential PBP3 required for cell division when exposed to both acidity and high osmolarity, the environmental cues encountered by intracellular S. Typhimurium. Therefore, OmpR played a central role in the evolution of this pathogen when co-opting the regulation of PBP2SAL/PBP3SAL and, consequently, promoting a new morphogenetic cycle that made possible increasing progeny inside acidic eukaryotic phagosomes.\n\nSignificanceSome enzymes that participate in peptidoglycan metabolism are present exclusively in bacterial pathogens and modify its structure to limit immune recognition. The intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is the only example known to date in which a \"substitution\" of essential peptidoglycan enzymes involved in cell division and elongation takes place during infection. The data presented here support instability of PBP3 in environments with acidity and high osmolarity as a probable selective pressure that promoted the fixation of alternative morphogenetic enzymes. This was possible due to the control that OmpR exerted over these new foreign functions. The acquisition of enzymes like PBP2SAL and PBP3SAL therefore represent a \"quantum leap\" evolutionary event in S. Typhimurium that made possible the colonization of acidic intracellular niches.",

Its multiresistant character is becoming a major health problem, yet the pathogenicity of S. pettenkoferi is poorly characterized. In this study, pathogenicity of a S. pettenkoferi clinical isolate from diabetic foot osteomyelitis was compared to a Staphylococcus aureus strain in various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Growth kinetics were compared against S. aureus and bacteria survival was assessed in the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line, the THP-1 human leukemia monocytic cell line and the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. Ex vivo analysis were performed in whole blood survival assays, and in vivo assays via the infection model of zebrafish embryos. Moreover, whole-genome analysis was performed. Our results showed that S. pettenkoferi was able to survive in human blood, human keratinocytes, murine macrophages, and human macrophages. S. pettenkoferi demonstrated its virulence by causing substantial embryo mortality in the zebrafish model. Genomic analysis revealed virulence factors such as biofilm- (e.g., icaABCD; rsbUVW) and regulator- (e.g., agr, mgrA, sarA, saeS) encoding genes well characterized in S. aureus. This study thus advances the knowledge of this under investigated pathogen and validates the zebrafish infection model for this bacterium.",

Here, we measured feeding behavior and used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare the microbial community across a diel cycle in two distantly related species of Daphnia, that differ in their life history traits, to assess how daily feeding patterns impact microbiome composition. We find that Daphnia species reared under similar laboratory conditions have significantly different microbial communities.

Oscillations of cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) and regulator cyclins control cell cycling, many are pharmacological targets in cancer. This study examines gene expression relationships between drivers, cell cycle components, and a subset of proliferation genes in colon (COAD) and lung (LUAD) adenocarcinomas. Several known drivers of COAD and LUAD including APC, CTNNB1, KRAS, MYC, Braf, TP53, Rb1, and EGFR are also observed with focus on Wnt and MAPK signaling activation. Wnt signaling activation has relevance for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, as it provides cancer cells with escape mechanisms.\n\nMYC and KRAS co-expressed directly with far fewer proliferation genes in LUAD than COAD, suggesting their expression is ectopic to S phase in lung tumors. APC indirectly co-expressed with the same factors in both COAD and LUAD, but was found co-expressed indirectly with MYC and mutated only in COAD. Other Wnt signaling components also co-expressed in low MYC context in COAD, had significantly higher mutation frequencies. These data suggest Wnt signaling activation to be the indirect result of decreased MYC availability in COAD, and ectopic overexpression of MYC in LUAD. Cyclins CCNH, CCNC, and CCNK, co-expressed with far fewer proliferation genes in LUAD. Conversely, Braf had direct co-expression with many proliferation factors in non EGFR activated LUAD. Proliferation in EGFR activated LUAD was completely deregulated with E2F(s) 4/5/6 expression, potentially explaining their low proliferative ability.",

We previously reported a heterozygous missense (c.740C>T) ACTN2 gene variant, associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and characterized by an electro-mechanical phenotype in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Here, we created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tools two heterozygous functional knock-out hiPSC lines with a second wild-type (ACTN2wt) and missense ACTN2 (ACTN2mut) allele, respectively. We evaluated their impact on cardiomyocyte structure and function, using a combination of different technologies, including immunofluorescence and live cell imaging, RNA-seq, and mass spectrometry. This study showed that ACTN2mut present a higher percentage of multinucleation, protein aggregation, hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray and activation of both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway as compared to ACTN2wt in 2D-cultured hiPSC-CMs. Furthermore, the expression of ACTN2mut was associated with a marked reduction of sarcomere-associated protein levels in 2D-cultured hiPSC-CMs and force impairment in engineered heart tissues. In conclusion, our study highlights the activation of proteolytic systems in ACTN2mut hiPSC-CMs likely to cope with ACTN2 aggregation and therefore directs towards proteopathy as an additional cellular pathology caused by this ACTN2 variant, which may contribute to human ACTN2-associated cardiomyopathies.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres are the foundation for mitotic kinetochore assembly and thus are essential for chromosome segregation. Centromeres are epigenetically defined by nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. CENP-A nucleosome assembly is uncoupled from replication and occurs in G1 but how cells control this timing is incompletely understood. The formation of CENP-A nucleosomes in vertebrates requires CENP-C and the Mis18 complex which recruit the CENP-A chaperone HJURP to centromeres. Using a cell-free system for centromere assembly in X. laevis egg extracts, we discover two activities that inhibit CENP-A assembly in metaphase. HJURP phosphorylation prevents the interaction between HJURP and CENP-C in metaphase, blocking the delivery of soluble CENP-A to centromeres. Non-phosphorylatable mutants of HJURP constitutively bind CENP-C in metaphase but are not sufficient for new CENP-A assembly. We find that the M18BP1.S subunit of the Mis18 complex also binds to CENP-C to competitively inhibit HJURPs access to centromeres. Removal of these two inhibitory activities causes CENP-A assembly in metaphase.\n\nSUMMARYVertebrate CENP-A assembly is normally restricted to G1 phase.

    "abstract": "Soils are impacted at a global scale by several anthropogenic factors, including chemical pollutants. Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental persistence, and as they might affect soil health and functions. However, data on impacts of PFASs on soil structure and microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at environmental-relevant nominal concentrations (1 ~ 1000 ng g-1) on soil functions, using a 6-week microcosm experiment. We measured soil respiration, litter decomposition, enzyme and microbial activities, soil aggregates, and bacterial abundance. PFAS (even at 1 ng g-1 for PFBS) significantly increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on bacterial abundance, and {beta}-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS concentrations. Soil respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in the 3rd week, while this effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were negatively affected by PFOS and PFOA, possibly related to microbial shifts. The general microbial activities and {beta}-D-cellobiosidase and phosphatase activities were barely affected by PFAS treatments. Our work highlights the potential effects of PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in terrestrial ecosystem functioning.\n\nSynopsisPFAS are likely to affect soil health.\n\nAbstract Art\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/465889v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@88c630org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b985corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bfdc81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@125b09e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex is one of the central chromatin remolding complexes that mediate gene repression. NuRD is essential for numerous developmental events, including heart development. Clinical and genetic studies have provided direct evidence for the role of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), the catalytic component of NuRD, in congenital heart disease (CHD), including atrial and ventricular septal defects. Further, it has been demonstrated that CHD4 is essential for mammalian cardiomyocyte formation and function. A key unresolved question is how CHD4/NuRD is localized to specific cardiac targets genes, as neither CHD4 nor NuRD can directly bind DNA. Here, we coupled a bioinformatics-based approach with mass spectrometry analyses to demonstrate that CHD4 interacts with the core cardiac transcription factors GATA4, NKX2-5 and TBX5 during embryonic heart development. Using transcriptomics and genome-wide occupancy data, we have characterized the genomic landscape of GATA4, NKX2-5 and TBX5 repression and defined the direct cardiac gene targets of GATA4-CHD4, NKX2-5-CHD4 and TBX5-CHD4 complexes. These data were used to identify putative cis-regulatory elements regulated controlled by these complexes. We genetically interrogated two of these silencers in vivo, Acta1 and Myh11. We show that deletion of these silencers leads to inappropriate skeletal and smooth muscle gene mis-expression, respectively, in the embryonic heart. These results delineate how CHD4/NuRD is localized to specific cardiac loci and explicates how mutations in the broadly expressed CHD4 protein lead to cardiac specific disease states.",

    "abstract": "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect average gene expression levels, provide important insights into context-specific gene regulation. Classic eQTL analyses use one-to-one association tests, which test gene-variant pairs individually and ignore correlations induced by gene regulatory networks and linkage disequilibrium. Probabilistic topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, estimate latent topics for a collection of count observations. Prior multi-modal frameworks that bridge genotype and expression data assume matched sample numbers between modalities. However, many data sets have a nested structure where one individual has several associated gene expression samples and a single germline genotype vector. Here, we build a telescoping bimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (TBLDA) framework to learn shared topics across gene expression and genotype data that allows multiple RNA-sequencing samples to correspond to a single individuals genotype. By using raw count data, our model avoids possible adulteration via normalization procedures. Ancestral structure is captured in a genotype-specific latent space, effectively removing it from shared components. Using GTEx v8 expression data across ten tissues and genotype data, we show that the estimated topics capture meaningful and robust biological signal in both modalities, and identify associations within and across tissue types. We identify 53,358 cis-eQTLs and 1,173 trans-eQTLs by conducting eQTL mapping between the most informative features in each topic. Our TBLDA model is able to identify associations using raw sequencing count data when the samples in two separate data modalities are matched one-to-many, as is often the case in biological data.",

However, little research has been conducted to investigate the conservation and variation of protein glycosylation pathways in other eukaryotic organisms. Euglena gracilis is an industrially important microalga, used in the production of biofuels and nutritional supplements. It is evolutionarily highly divergent from green algae and more related to Kinetoplastid pathogens. It was recently shown that E. gracilis possesses the machinery for producing a range of protein glycosylations and make simple N-glycans, but the modified proteins were not identified. This study identifies the glycosylated proteins, including transporters, extra cellular proteases and those involved in cell surface signalling. Notably, many of the most highly expressed and glycosylated proteins are not related to any known sequences and are therefore likely to be involved in important novel functions in Euglena.",

It is unknown if or how atrial t-tubules can be restored and if restored t-tubules are functional.\n\nSheep were tachypaced to induce HF and recovered when pacing was stopped. Serial block face Scanning Electron Microscopy and confocal imaging were used to understand t-tubule ultrastructure and function. Candidate proteins involved in atrial t-tubule recovery were identified by western blot and causality determined using expression studies.\n\nSheep atrial t-tubules reappeared following recovery from HF. Despite being disordered (branched, longer and longitudinally arranged) recovered t-tubules triggered Ca2+ release and were associated with restoration of systolic Ca2+. Telethonin and myotubularin abundance correlated with t-tubule density and altered the density and structure of BIN1-driven tubules in neonatal myocytes. Myotubularin had a greater effect, increasing tubule length and branching, replicating that seen in the recovery atria.\n\nRecovery from HF restores atrial t-tubules and systolic Ca2+ and myotubularin facilitates this process. Atrial t-tubule restoration could present a new and viable therapeutic strategy.\n\nBrief SummaryThe loss of atrial transverse (t)-tubules and the associated dysfunction in heart failure is reversible and the protein myotubularin plays an important role.",

While it is well-established that microbes, such as bacteria and fungi most often exist in multicellular biofilm communities, descriptions in standard biology textbooks continue to focus on the single-celled form of microbial life. We have developed an analogy-based instructional tool to introduce and explain biofilms to high school and undergraduate students. The module employs an analogy with beehives, given that biofilms and beehives are both  superorganism states, to explain key biofilm features such as development and structure, chemical communication, division of labor and emergent properties. We delivered this analogy based learning tool to a cohort of 49 high school and undergraduate students, and based on participant feedback and learnings, present a formal evaluation of the instructional tool. Further, we outline prerequisites and learning approaches that can enable the delivery of this module in classroom and virtual learning settings, including suggestions for pre-lesson reading, student-centred interactive activities, and specific learning objectives. Taken together, this instructional analogy holds potential to serve as an educational tool to introduce biofilms in high school and undergraduate curricula in a relatable and comprehensible manner.",

Separate lines of evidence suggest that synapses and astrocytes play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying ALS. Given that astrocytes make specialised contacts with some synapses, called tripartite synapses, we hypothesise that tripartite synapses could act as the fulcrum of disease in ALS. To test this hypothesis, we have performed an extensive microscopy-based investigation of synapses and tripartite synapses in the spinal cord of ALS model mice and post-mortem human tissue from ALS cases. We reveal widescale synaptic changes at the early symptomatic stages of the SOD1G93a mouse model. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that large complex postsynaptic structures are lost in ALS mice. Most surprisingly, tripartite synapses are selectively lost while non-tripartite synapses remain in equal number to healthy controls. Finally, we also observe a similar selective loss of tripartite synapses in human post-mortem ALS spinal cords. From these data we conclude that tripartite synaptopathy is a key hallmark of ALS.",

Thus, we applied optical fluorescence imaging to assess mesoscale calcium functional connectivity (FC) in the Mecp2 cortex prior to symptom onset as well as during decline. We found that FC was profoundly disrupted in Mecp2 males both in juvenile development and early adulthood. Female Mecp2 mice displayed a subtle homotopic contralateral increase in motor cortex as juveniles but not in adulthood, where instead parietal regions were implicated. Additionally, conditional rescue studies indicated FC phenotypes are driven by excitatory neurons. Altogether, the female results identify subtle candidate translatable biomarkers of disease progression, while the male results indicate MeCP2 protein is needed in a circuit-specific manner for FC.",

Investigating remyelination in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is difficult in MS, where collecting serial short-interval scans is challenging. Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets, a model of MS that recapitulates focal cerebral MS lesions, we investigated whether remyelination can be detected and characterized noninvasively. In 6 animals followed with multisequence 7-tesla MRI, 36 focal lesions, classified as demyelinated or remyelinated based on signal intensity on proton density-weighted images, were subsequently assessed with histopathology. Remyelination occurred in 5 of 6 marmosets and 51% of lesions. Radiological-pathological comparison showed high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (90%) for detecting remyelination by in vivo MRI. This study demonstrates the prevalence of spontaneous remyelination in marmoset EAE and the ability of in vivo MRI to detect it, with implications for preclinical testing of pro-remyelinating agents and translation to clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are important for normal brain function. In many neurodegenerative diseases glial cells undergo significant morphological, functional and gene expression changes termed reactive gliosis. The cause, identity and neuroprotective or neurotoxic nature of these changes remains incompletely understood. This knowledge in needed to develop a framework of how individual pathological changes in glial cells contribute to progressive dysfunction and selective neuronal vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. This is particularly relevant during the early disease stages that allow for the effective therapies and reversal or slowing of disease phenotypes. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1). While mutant ATXN1 is expressed broadly throughout the brain, SCA1 is characterized by severe degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Despite major advances in dissecting the effects of mutant ATXN1 on Purkinje cells, much less is understood how cerebellar astrocytes and oligodendrocytes respond to and contribute to Purkinje cell dysfunction in SCA1. To address this question we performed cerebellar single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA seq) of early disease stage Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q] mice, a transgenic SCA1 mouse model expressing mutant ATXN1 only in Purkinje cells. We found no changes in cell numbers in the SCA1 cerebellum. We validated previously indicated pathway and gene expression changes in the Purkinje cells, and identified novel DEG and pathways in Purkinje cells, including Ralyl that may provide compensatory roles and maintain PC function. Importantly we identified profound non-cell autonomous and potentially neuroprotective gene expression and pathway alterations in Bergman glia, velate astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that may contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

The T-cell phenotypes of treated TB patients were prospectively characterized in a blinded fashion using mass cytometry after Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen stimulation, and then correlated to sputum culture status. At two months of treatment, cytotoxic and terminally differentiated CD8+ T-cells were under-represented and naive CD4+ T-cells were over-represented in positive-versus negative-sputum culture patients, regardless of Mtb drug susceptibility.

GerAB belongs to the Amino Acid-Polyamine-Organocation superfamily of transporters. Using evolutionary co-variation analysis, we provide evidence that GerAB adopts a structure similar to an L-alanine transporter from this superfamily. We show that mutations in gerAB predicted to disrupt the ligand-binding pocket impair germination, while mutations predicted to function in L-alanine recognition enable spores to respond to L-leucine or L-serine. Finally, substitutions of bulkier residues at these positions cause constitutive germination. These data suggest that GerAB is the L-alanine sensor and that B subunits in this broadly conserved family function in nutrient detection.",

    "abstract": "The human microbiota harbors diverse bacterial and bacteriophage (phage) communities. Bacteria evolve to overcome phage infection, thereby driving phage evolution to counter bacterial resistance. Understanding how phages promote genetic alterations in medically relevant bacteria is important as phages continue to become established biologics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. Before phages are used as standalone or combination antibacterial therapies, we must obtain a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms of phage infection and how host bacteria alter their genomes to become resistant. We performed coevolution experiments using a single Enterococcus faecalis strain and two distantly related phages, to determine how phage pressure impacts the evolution of the E. faecalis genome. Whole genome sequencing revealed mutations previously demonstrated to be essential for phage infection. We also identified mutations in several genes previously unreported to be associated with phage infection in E. faecalis. Intriguingly, there was only one shared mutation in the E. faecalis genome in response to each of the two phages tested, demonstrating that infection by genetically distinct phages results in different host responses. This study shows that infection of the same host by disparate phages leads to evolutionary trajectories that result in distinct genetic changes. This implies that bacteria respond to phage pressure through host responses that are tailored to specific phages. This work serves as the basis for the study of E. faecalis genome evolution during phage infection and will inform the design of future therapeutics, such as phage cocktails, intended to target MDR E. faecalis.\n\nIMPORTANCEStudies characterizing the genome evolution of bacterial pathogens following phage selective pressure are lacking. Phage therapy is experiencing a rebirth in Western medicine. Such studies are critical for understanding how bacteria subvert phage infection and how phages evolve to counter such mutations. This study utilizes comparative genomic analyses to demonstrate how a pathogenic strain of Enterococcus faecalis responds to infection by two genetically distant phages. We show that genetic alterations in the E. faecalis genome accumulate in a manner that is specific to the infecting phage with little to no overlap in shared fixed mutations. This suggests that bacterial genome evolution in response to phage infection is uniquely tied to phage genotype, and sets a precedence for investigations into how phages drive bacterial genome evolution relevant to phage therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Aromatic residues appeared relatively late in the evolution of protein sequences. They stabilize the hydrophobic core of globular proteins and are typically absent from intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). However, recent advances in protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) studies have shown that aromatic residues in IDRs often act as important \"stickers\", promoting multivalent interactions and the formation of higher-order oligomers. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we compared levels of sequence disorder in RNA binding proteins and the human proteome and found that aromatic residues appear more frequently than expected in the IDRs of RNA binding proteins, which are often found to undergo LLPS. Phylogenetic analysis shows that aromatic residues are highly conserved among chordates, highlighting their importance in LLPS-driven functional assembly. These results suggest therefore that aromatic residues have contributed twice to evolution: in stabilizing structured proteins and in the assembly of biomolecular condensates.",

The mechanisms underpinning these often transient niche breadth modifications are poorly known, but utilisation of novel resources likely depends on phenological synchrony between the consumer and resource. We use a climate-driven range and host shift by the butterfly Aricia agestis to test how climate-driven changes in host phenology and condition affect phenological synchrony, and consider implications for host use.\n\nOur data suggest that the perennial plant which was the primary host before range expansion is a more reliable resource than the annual Geraniaceae upon which the butterfly has become specialised in newly colonised parts of its range. In particular, climate-driven phenological variation in the novel host Geranium dissectum generates a narrow and variable  window of opportunity for larval productivity in summer. Therefore, although climatic change may allow species to shift hosts and colonise novel environments, specialisation on phenologically-limited hosts may not persist at ecological margins as climate change continues. We highlight the potential role for phenological (a)synchrony in determining lability of consumer-resource associations at range margins, and the importance of considering causes of synchrony in biotic interactions when predicting range shifts.",

While relations between leaf shape and either climate or height has been relatively well studied in eudicots, the macroecological drivers of shape remain poorly known in monocots.

We further reconstruct the ancestral leaf shape using multistate speciation and extinction models and compare the frequency of shapes with global temperatures through time.\n\nResultsWe find that plant height associates with dissected leaves and that annual precipitation associates with pinnate shapes. The ancestral leaf shape is unclear but early diversification was dominated by pinnate-dissected palms, which has remained the most species-rich form of leaves throughout palm history.\n\nMain conclusionsPalms that are tall and live in humid regions are more likely to have pinnate leaves. Through geological time scales, temperature did not play an obvious role in determining leaf shapes.

    "abstract": "KaiC is a dual ATPase, with one active site in its N-terminal domain and another in its C-terminal domain, that drives the circadian clock system of cyanobacteria through sophisticated coordination of the two sites. To elucidate the coordination mechanism, we studied the contribution of the dual ATPase activities in the ring-shaped KaiC hexamer and these structural bases for activation and inactivation. At the N-terminal active site, a lytic water molecule is sequestered between the N-terminal domains, and its reactivity to ATP is controlled by the quaternary structure of the N-terminal ring. The C-terminal ATPase activity is regulated mostly by water-incorporating voids between the C-terminal domains, and the size of these voids is sensitive to phosphoryl modification of S431. The N-terminal ATPase activity inversely correlates with the affinity of KaiC for KaiB, a clock protein constitutes the circadian oscillator together with KaiC and KaiA, and the complete dissociation of KaiB from KaiC requires KaiA-assisted activation of the dual ATPase. Delicate interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal rings make it possible for the components of the dual ATPase to work together, thereby driving the assembly and disassembly cycle of KaiA and KaiB.\n\nSignificance StatementKaiC, a core clock protein in the cyanobacterial circadian clock system, hydrolyzes ATP at two distinct sites in a slow but ordered manner to measure the circadian time scale. We used biochemical and structural biology techniques to characterize the properties and interplay of dual ATPase active sites. Our results show that the N-terminal and C-terminal ATPases communicate with each other through an interface between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains in KaiC. The dual ATPase sites are regulated rhythmically in a concerted or opposing manner dependent on the phase of the circadian clock system, controlling the affinities of KaiC for other clock proteins, KaiA and KaiB.",

    "abstract": "Embryogenesis is orchestrated through local morphogen gradients and endometrial constraints that give rise to the three germ layers in a well-defined assembly. In vitro models of embryogenesis have been demonstrated by treating pluripotent stem cells in adherent or suspension culture with soluble morphogens and small molecules, which leads to tri-lineage differentiation. However, treatment with exogenous agents override the subtle spatiotemporal changes observed in vivo that ultimately underly the human body plan. Here we demonstrate how microconfinement of pluripotent stem cells on hydrogel substrates catalyses gastrulation-like events without the need for supplements. Within six hours of initial seeding, cells at the boundary show elevated cytoskeletal tension and yes-associated protein (YAP) activity, which leads to changes in cell and nuclear morphology, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and emergence of defined patterns of primitive streak containing SRY-Box Transcription Factor 17 (SOX17)+ T/BRACHYURY+ cells. Immunofluorescence staining, transcript analysis, and the use of pharmacological modulators reveal a role for mechanotransduction-coupled non-canonical wingless-type (WNT) signalling in promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition and multilayered organization within the colonies. These microscale gastruloids were removed from the substrate and encapsulated in 3D hydrogels, where biomaterials properties correspond to maintenance and spatial positioning of the primitive streak. Together, this approach demonstrates how materials alone can nurture embryonic gastrulation, thereby providing an in vitro model of early development.",

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophy is a progressive and ultimately lethal neuromuscular disease due to lack of therapeutic options that restore muscle function. Gene editing and gene transfer hold great promise as therapies for various neuromuscular diseases when administered prior to the onset of severe clinical symptoms. However, the efficacy of these strategies for restoring neuromuscular function and improving survival in the late stages of muscular dystrophy with severe muscle pathophysiology is unknown. Dystroglycanopathies are muscular dystrophies characterized by extensive skeletal muscle degeneration and, in many cases, are accompanied by eye and brain abnormalities. Thus far, mutations in at least eighteen human genes are known to cause dystroglycanopathies, including those in the like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (LARGE1) gene. LARGE1 encodes a xylosyl- and glucuronosyltransferase that modifies -dystroglycan (-DG) with matriglycan, a linear repeating disaccharide of alternating xylose and glucuronic acid that binds to the laminin G-like domains of extracellular matrix proteins with high affinity. Largemyd/Largemyd (myd) mice lack expression of Large1, and exhibit severe skeletal muscle pathophysiology, impaired mobility, and a drastically reduced lifespan (50% survivorship at 35 weeks of age). Here, we show that systemic delivery of AAV2/9 CMV Large1 (AAVLarge1) in >34-week-old myd mice with advanced disease restores matriglycan expression, attenuates skeletal muscle pathophysiology, improves motor and respiratory function, and normalizes systemic metabolism, which collectively and dramatically extends survival. Our results demonstrate that in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, skeletal muscle function can be restored, illustrating its remarkable plasticity, and that survival can be greatly improved even after the onset of severe skeletal muscle pathophysiology.",

Our current understanding of ROS production in thylakoids suggests that oxygen (O2) reduction takes place at numerous components of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain (PETC). To refine models of site- specific O2 reduction capacity of various PETC components in isolated thylakoids, the stoichiometry of oxygen production and consumption reactions, associated with H2O2 accumulation, was quantified using membrane inlet mass spectrometry and specific inhibitors. Combined with P700 spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping, we demonstrate that electron flow to PSI is essential for H2O2 accumulation during light-induced photosynthetic electron transport process. Further leaf disc measurements provided clues that H2O2 from PETC has a potential of increasing mitochondrial respiration and CO2 release.\n\nOne sentence summaryPhotosynthetically derived H2O2 only accumulates at Photosystem I and may trigger cooperation with mitochondria during stress",

    "abstract": "The Absence of bc1 Complex (ABC1) is an ancient, atypical protein kinase family that emerged prior to the archaeal-eubacterial divergence. Loss-of-function mutants in ABC1 genes are linked to respiratory defects in microbes and humans, and to compromised photosynthetic performance and stress tolerance in plants. However, demonstration of protein kinase activity remains elusive, hampering their study. Here, we investigate a homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtABC1K6, and demonstrate in vitro protein kinase activity as autophosphorylation, which we replicate with a human ABC1 ortholog. We show that AtABC1K6 protein kinase activity requires an atypical buffer composition, including Mn2+ as divalent cation co-factor and a low salt concentration. AtABC1K6 associates with plastoglobule lipid droplets of A. thaliana chloroplasts, along with five paralogs. Protein kinase activity associated with isolated A. thaliana plastoglobules was inhibited at higher salt concentrations, but could accommodate Mg2+ as well as Mn2+, indicating salt sensitivity, but not the requirement for Mn2+, may be a general characteristic of ABC1s. Loss of functional AtABC1K6 impairs the developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. This phenotype is complemented by the wild-type sequence of AtABC1K6 but not by a kinase-dead point mutant in the unique Ala-triad of the ATP-binding pocket, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the proteins kinase activity.

Yet, how neurons undergo synaptic changes and become recruited during motor learning to form a memory engram remains an open question.

We find that the degree of reactivation of M1 engram neurons correlates strongly with motor performance. We further demonstrate that learning-induced dendritic spine reorganization specifically occurs in these M1 engram neurons. In addition, we find that motor learning leads to an increase in the number and strength of outputs from M1 engram neurons onto striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and that these synapses form local clusters along SPN dendrites.

    "abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent human bacterial infections. New therapeutic approaches, including vaccination and immunotherapy, are urgently needed to combat the rapid global dissemination of multidrug-resistant uropathogens. Development of therapies is impeded by an incomplete understanding of memory development during UTI. Here, we found that reducing bacterial load early in infection, by reducing the inoculum or with antibiotics after infection, completely abrogated the protective memory response. We observed a mixed T helper cell polarization, comprised of Th1, Th2, and Th17 T cells, among T cells infiltrating the bladder during primary infection. Thus, we hypothesized that reducing antigen load altered T helper cell polarization leading to poor memory. Surprisingly, however, T helper cell polarization was unchanged in these scenarios. Instead, we uncovered a population of tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells that was significantly reduced in the absence of sufficient antigen. Demonstrating that TRM cells are necessary for immune memory, transfer of lymph node or spleen-derived infection-experienced T cells to naive animals did not confer protection against infection. Supporting that TRM cells are sufficient to protect against recurrent UTI, animals depleted of systemic T cells, or treated with FTY720 to block memory lymphocyte migration from lymph nodes to infected tissue, were equally protected compared to unmanipulated mice against a second UTI. Thus, we uncovered an unappreciated key role for TRM cells in the memory response to bacterial infection in this mucosa, providing a target for non-antibiotic-based immunotherapy and/or new vaccine strategies to prevent recurrent UTI.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTRM are necessary and sufficient for memory to recurrent UTI",

    "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, multi-system, debilitating disability manifesting as severe fatigue and post-exertional malaise. The chronic dysfunctions in ME/CFS are increasingly recognized as significant health factors with potential parallels with  long COVID. However, the etiology of ME/CFS remains elusive with limited high-resolution human studies. In addition, reliable biomarker-based diagnostics have not been well-established, but may assist in disease classification, particularly during different temporal phases of the disease. Here, we performed deep multi- omics (shotgun metagenomics of gut microbiota and plasma metabolomics) and clinical phenotyping of healthy controls (n=79) vs. two cohorts of ME/CFS patients - those with short-term disease (<4 years, n=75), and patients with long-term disease (>10y, n=79). Overall, ME/CFS was characterized by reduced gut microbiome diversity and richness with high heterogeneity, and depletion of sphingomyelins and short-chain fatty acids in the plasma. We found significant differences when stratifying by cohort; short-term ME/CFS was associated with more microbial dysbiosis, but long-term ME/CFS was associated with markedly more severe phenotypic and metabolic abnormalities. We identified a reduction in the gene-coding capacity (and relative abundance of butyrate producers) of microbial butyrate biosynthesis together with a reduction in the plasma concentration of butyrate, especially in the short-term group. Global co-association and detailed gene pathway correlation analyses linking the microbiome and metabolome identified additional potential biological mechanisms underlying host-microbiome interactions in ME/CFS, including bile acids and benzoate pathways. Finally, we built multiple state-of-the-art classifiers to identify microbes, microbial gene pathways, metabolites, and clinical features that individually or together, were most able to differentiate short or long-term MECFS, or MECFS vs. healthy controls. Taken together, our study presents the highest resolution, multi-cohort and multi- omics analysis to date, providing an important resource to facilitate mechanistic hypotheses of host-microbiome interactions in ME/CFS.",

    "abstract": "Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are considered a key mechanism generating frequency-dependent dynamics in plant communities. Negative feedbacks, in particular, are often invoked to explain coexistence and the maintenance of diversity in species-rich communities. However, the primary modeling framework used to study PSFs considers only two plant species, and we lack clear theoretical expectations for how these complex interactions play out in communities with natural levels of diversity. Here, we demonstrate that this canonical model for PSFs is equivalent to a well-studied model from evolutionary game theory, and use this equivalence to characterize the dynamics with an arbitrary number of plant species. Surprisingly, we find that coexistence of more than two species is virtually impossible, suggesting that alternative theoretical frameworks are needed to describe feedbacks observed in diverse natural communities. Drawing on our analysis, we discuss future directions for PSF models and implications for experimental study of PSF-mediated coexistence in the field.",

    "abstract": "Robust DNA damage prevention and repair strategies are crucial to faithful reproduction and inheritance of the genetic material. Although many molecular pathways that respond to DNA damage are well conserved through evolution, the quality and effectiveness of these systems can vary between species. Studies dating back for nearly a century document that the dark-winged fungus gnat Sciara coprophila (Order: Diptera; sub-order: Nematocera) is relatively resistant to irradiation-induced mutations that cause visible phenotypes when compared to the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Order: Diptera; sub-order: Brachycera). However, the molecular responses to irradiation for S. coprophila have yet to be analyzed. To address this gap, we first characterized the effects of ionizing radiation on S. coprophila throughout its life cycle. Our data show that developing S. coprophila embryos are highly sensitive to even low doses of gamma-irradiation, whereas larvae can tolerate up to 80 Gy and still retain their ability to develop to adulthood with a developmental delay of 5 to 8 extra days in the larval stage. To survey the genes involved in the early transcriptional response to irradiation, we compared RNA-seq profiles of larvae with and without radiation treatment. Our analysis showed that 327 genes are differentially expressed in irradiated larvae, with 232 genes upregulated and 95 genes downregulated relative to controls. The upregulated genes were enriched for DNA damage response genes, including those involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, whereas the down-regulated genes were enriched for developmental regulators, consistent with the developmental delay observed in irradiated larvae. Thus, our study has laid the groundwork to further dissect how Sciara copes with radiation-induced damage.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis, the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation in the developing nervous system, is the process that underlies the diversity of size and cell type found in animal nervous systems. Our understanding of how this process has evolved is limited because of the lack of high resolution data and live-imaging methods across species. The retina is a classic model for the study of neurogenesis in vertebrates and live-imaging of the retina has shown that during development, progenitor cells are organized in a pseudostratified neuroepithelium and nuclei migrate in coordination with the cell cycle along the apicobasal axis of the cell, a process called interkinetic nuclear migration. Eventually cells delaminate and differentiate within the boundaries of the epithelium. This process has been considered unique to vertebrates and thought to be important in maintaining organization during the development of a complex nervous system. Coleoid cephalopods, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, have the largest nervous system of any invertebrate and convergently-evolved camera-type eyes, making them a compelling comparative system to vertebrates. Here we have pioneered live-imaging techniques to show that the squid, Doryteuthis pealeii, displays cellular mechanisms during cephalopod retinal neurogenesis that are hallmarks of vertebrate processes. We find that retinal progenitor cells in the squid undergo interkinetic nuclear migration until they exit the cell cycle, we identify retinal organization corresponding to progenitor, post-mitotic and differentiated cells, and we find that Notch signaling regulates this process. With cephalopods and vertebrates having diverged 550 million years ago, these results suggest that mechanisms thought to be unique to vertebrates may be common to highly proliferative neurogenic primordia contributing to a large nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between longevity and brain size in a variety of taxa. Little research has been devoted to understanding this link in parrots; yet parrots are well-known for both their exceptionally long lives and cognitive complexity. We employed a large-scale comparative analysis that investigated the influence of brain size and life history variables on longevity in parrots. Specifically, we addressed two hypotheses for evolutionary drivers of longevity: the Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis, which proposes that increased cognitive abilities enable longer life spans, and the Expensive Brain Hypothesis, which holds that increases in life span are caused by prolonged developmental time of, and increased parental investment in, large brained offspring. We estimated life expectancy from detailed zoo records for 133,818 individuals across 244 parrot species. Using a principled Bayesian approach that addresses data uncertainty and imputation of missing values, we found a consistent correlation between relative brain size and life expectancy in parrots. This correlation was best explained by a direct effect of relative brain size. Notably, we found no effects of developmental time, clutch size, or age at first reproduction. Our results suggest that selection for enhanced cognitive abilities in parrots have in turn promoted longer lifespans.",

    "abstract": "The basilar pontine nuclei (bPN) receive inputs from the entire neocortex and constitute the main source of mossy fibers to the cerebellum. Despite their critical position in the cortico-cerebellar pathway, it remains unclear if and how the bPN process inputs. An important unresolved question is whether the bPN strictly receives excitatory inputs or also receives inhibitory inputs. In the present study, we identified the mesodiencephalic junction as a prominent source of GABAergic afferents to the bPN. We combined optogenetics and whole-cell patch clamp recordings and confirmed that the bPN indeed receives monosynaptic GABA inputs from this region. Furthermore, we found no evidence that these inhibitory inputs converge with motor cortex (M1) inputs at the single neuron level. We also found no evidence of any connectivity between bPN neurons, suggesting the absence of a local circuit. Finally, rabies tracings revealed that GABAergic MDJ neurons themselves receive prominent inputs from neocortical output neurons. Our data indicates that inhibition from the MDJ, and excitation from the neocortex remain separate streams of information through the bPN. It is therefore unlikely that inhibition in the bPN has a gating function, but rather shapes an appropriate output of the bPN during behavior.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInfants start developing rudimentary language skills and can start understanding simple words well before their first birthday [Bergelson and Swingley, 2012]. This development has also been shown primarily using Event Related Potential (ERP) techniques to find evidence of word comprehension in the infant brain [Parise and Csibra, 2012, Friedrich and Friederici, 2010]. While these works validate the presence of semantic representations of words (word meaning) in infants, they do not tell us about the mental processes involved in the manifestation of these semantic representations or the content of the representations. To this end, we use a decoding approach where we employ machine learning techniques on Electroencephalography (EEG) data to predict the semantic representations of words found in the brain activity of infants. We perform multiple analyses to explore word semantic representations in two groups of infants (9-month-old and 12-month-old). Our analyses show significantly above chance decodability of overall word semantics, word animacy, and word phonetics. As we analyze brain activity, we observe that participants in both age groups show signs of word comprehension immediately after word onset, marked by our models significantly above chance word prediction accuracy. We also observed strong neural representations of word phonetics in the brain data for both age groups, some likely correlated to word decoding accuracy and others not. Lastly, we discover that the neural representations of word semantics are similar in both infant age groups. Our results on word semantics, phonetics, and animacy decodability, give us insights into the evolution of neural representation of word meaning in infants.",

    "abstract": "Serum response factor (SRF) is an essential transcription factor that influences many cellular processes including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. SRF directly regulates and is required for immediate early gene (IEG) and actin cytoskeleton-related gene expression. SRF coordinates these competing transcription programs through discrete sets of cofactors, the Ternary Complex Factors (TCFs) and Myocardin Related Transcription Factors (MRTFs). The relative contribution of these two programs to in vivo SRF activity and mutant phenotypes is not fully understood. To study how SRF utilizes its cofactors during development, we generated a knock-in SrfI allele in mice harboring point mutations that disrupt SRF-MRTF-DNA complex formation but leave SRF-TCF activity unaffected. Homozygous SrfI/I mutants die at E10.5 with notable cardiovascular phenotypes, and neural crest conditional mutants succumb at birth to defects of the cardiac outflow tract but display none of the craniofacial phenotypes associated with complete loss of SRF in that lineage. Our studies further support an important role for MRTF mediating SRF function in cardiac neural crest and suggest new mechanisms by which SRF regulates transcription during development.",
