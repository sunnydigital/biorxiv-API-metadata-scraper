    "abstract": "Eukaryal cells are used for the production of many recombinant pharmaceutical proteins, including several of the current top-selling products. The protein secretory pathway in eukaryal cells is complex and involves many different processes such as post-translational modifications, translocation, and folding. Furthermore, recombinant protein production competes with native secretory proteins for the limited energy and proteome resources allocated to the protein secretory pathway. Due to the complexity of this pathway, improvement through metabolic engineering has traditionally been relatively ad-hoc; and considering the industrial importance of this pathway, there is a need for more systematic approaches for novel design principles. Here, we present the first proteome-constrained genome-scale protein secretory model of a eukaryal cell, namely for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pcSecYeast). The model contains all key processes of this pathway, i.e., protein translation, modification, and degradation coupled with metabolism. The model can capture delicate phenotypic changes such as the switch in the use of specific glucose transporters in response to changing extracellular glucose concentration. Furthermore, the model can also simulate the effects of protein misfolding on cellular growth, suggesting that retro-translocation of misfolded proteins contributes to protein retention in the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We used pcSecYeast to simulate various recombinant proteins production and identified overexpression targets for different recombinant proteins overproduction. We experimentally validated many of the predicted targets for -amylase production in this study, and the results show that the secretory pathways have more limited capacity than metabolism in terms of protein secretion.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in people with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of acoustic detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in left prefrontal cortex than listeners with normal hearing, specifically in a region engaged in a separate spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment of left prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "It is unknown whether specific microglia are selectively induced by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), tau pathologies, or both in combination. To address this, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile mice bearing both A{beta} and tau pathologies during Alzheimers disease (AD) progression. We identify novel microglia subtypes induced in a disease stage-specific manner. We show that during early-stage disease, interferon signaling induces a subtype of microglia termed EADAM. During late-stage disease, a second microglia subtype termed LADAM is detected. While EADAM and LADAM-like microglia are observed in other neurodegenerative models, the magnitude and composition of subtype markers are distinct from microglia observed with AD-like pathology. The pattern of EADAM- and LADAM-associated gene expression is observed in microglia from human AD, during the early and late stages of disease, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that several siglec genes are selectively expressed in either EADAM or LADAM. Siglecg is expressed in white-matter-associated LADAM, and expression of the human orthologue of Siglecg is progressively elevated in AD-stage-dependent manner but not shown in non-AD tauopathy. Our findings imply that both A{beta} and tau pathologies are required for disease stage-specific induction of EADAM and LADAM.",

    "abstract": "Sustained attention is a critical cognitive function reflected in an individuals whole-brain pattern of fMRI functional connectivity. However sustained attention is not a purely static trait. Rather, attention waxes and wanes over time. Do functional brain networks that underlie individual differences in sustained attention also underlie changes in attentional state? To investigate, we replicate the finding that a validated connectome-based model of individual differences in sustained attention tracks pharmacologically induced changes in attentional state. Specifically, preregistered analyses revealed that participants exhibited functional connectivity signatures of stronger attention when awake than when under deep sedation with the anesthetic agent propofol. Furthermore, this effect was relatively specific to the predefined sustained attention networks: propofol administration modulated strength of the sustained attention networks more than it modulated strength of canonical resting-state networks and a network defined to predict fluid intelligence, and the functional connections most affected by propofol sedation overlapped with the sustained attention networks. Thus, propofol modulates functional connectivity signatures of sustained attention within individuals. More broadly these findings underscore the utility of pharmacological intervention in testing both the generalizability and specificity of network-based models of cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "The marble burying test is a commonly used paradigm to screen phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The current methodological approach relies solely on reporting the number of buried marbles at the end of the test. By measuring the proxy of the behavior (buried marbles), rather than the behavior itself (burying bouts), many important characteristics regarding the temporal aspect of this assay are lost. Here we introduce a novel, automated method to quantify mouse behavior throughout the duration of the marble burying test with the focus on the burying bouts. Using open-source software packages, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm (the \"classifier\") to distinguish burying behavior in freely moving mice. In order to confirm the classifiers accuracy and uncover the behavioral meaning of the marble burying test, we performed marble burying test in three mouse models: Ube3am-/p+ (Angelman Syndrome model), Shank2-/- (autism model), and Sapap3-/- (obsessive-compulsive disorder model) mice. The classifier scored burying behavior accurately and consistent with the literature in the Ube3am-/p+ mice, which showed decreased levels of burying compared to controls. Shank2-/- mice showed a similar pattern of decreased burying behavior, which was not found in Sapap3-/- mice. Tracking mouse behavior throughout the test enabled us to quantify activity characteristics, revealing hypoactivity in Ube3am-/p+ and hyperactivity in the Shank2-/- mice, indicating that mouse activity is unrelated to burying behavior. Together, we demonstrate that our classifier is an accurate method for the analysis of the marble burying test, providing more information than the currently used methods.\n\nSignificance StatementThe marble burying test is widely used in phenotyping neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorder mouse models. Currently, its analysis consists of manually scoring the number of buried marbles upon the completion of the assay. This approach is not standardized across laboratories, and leaves out important variables such as movement characteristics and information about the burying bouts. This leads to divergent interpretations of the marble burying test, ranging from anxiety to cognitive impairment. We introduce a method that reliably tracks mouse behavior throughout the experiment, classifies the duration and number of the burying bouts, and is generalizable across laboratories. Using machine learning for measuring the actual burying behavior standardizes this method, and provides rich information about the burying characteristics.",

Lav in non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is phase-variable: the gene reversibly switches ON-OFF via changes in length of a locus-located GCAA(n) simple DNA sequence repeat tract. The expression status of lav was examined in carriage and invasive collections of NTHi, where it was predominantly not expressed (OFF). Phenotypic study showed lav expression (ON) results in increased adherence to host cells, and denser biofilm formation. A survey of Haemophilus spp. genome sequences showed lav is present in [~]60% of NTHi strains, but lav is not present in most typeable H. influenzae. Sequence analysis revealed a total of five distinct variants of the Lav passenger domain present in Haemophilus spp., with these five variants showing a distinct lineage distribution.

    "abstract": "Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is synthesized by bacteria under stressful environmental conditions and acts by a variety of mechanisms to promote cell survival. While the kinase that synthesizes polyP (PPK, enocoded by the ppk gene) is well known, little is understood about how environmental stress signals lead to activation of this enzyme. Previous work has shown that the transcriptional regulators DksA, RpoN ({sigma}54), and RpoE ({sigma}24) positively regulate polyP production, but not ppk transcription, in Escherichia coli. In this work, we set out to examine the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoN and nitrogen starvation stress response pathways in controlling polyP synthesis in more detail. In the course of these experiments, we identified GlnG, GlrR, PhoP, PhoQ, RapZ, and GlmS as proteins that affect polyP production, and uncovered a central role for the nitrogen phosphotransferase regulator PtsN (EIIANtr) in a polyP regulatory pathway, acting upstream of DksA, downstream of RpoN, and apparently independently of RpoE. However, none of these regulators appears to act directly on PPK, and the mechanism(s) by which they modulate polyP production remain unclear. Unexpectedly, we also found that the pathways that regulate polyP production vary depending not only on the stress condition applied, but also on the composition of the media in which the cells were grown before exposure to polyP-inducing stress. These results constitute substantial progress towards deciphering the regulatory networks driving polyP production under stress, but highlight the remarkable complexity of this regulation and its connections to a broad range of stress-sensing pathways.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria respond to changes in their environments with a complex regulatory network that controls the expression and activity of a wide range of effectors important for their survival. This stress response network is critical for the virulence of pathogenic bacteria and for the ability of all bacteria to grow in natural environments. Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is an evolutionarily ancient and almost universally conserved stress response effector that plays multiple roles in virulence, stress response, and survival in diverse organisms. This work provides new insights into the connections between well characterized nitrogen starvation and cell envelope stress response signaling pathways and the production of polyP in Escherichia coli.",

Sequence divergence paired with paralogous relationships with neighboring genes, has complicated the accurate identification of the human ZP3r ortholog. Here, we phylogenetically and syntenically resolve that the human ortholog of ZP3r is the pseudogene C4BPAP1. We investigate the evolution of this gene within primates. We observe independent pseudogenization events of ZP3r in all Apes with the exception of Orangutans, and many monkey species. ZP3r in both primates that retain ZP3r and rodents contains positively selected sites. We hypothesize that redundant mechanisms mediate ZP3 recognition in mammals and ZP3rs relative importance to ZP recognition varies across species.",

It is unknown how dietary changes influence liver homeostasis. Here, we show that a switch from ad libitum feeding to intermittent fasting, IF, promotes rapid hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat. This study provides the first example of dietary influence on adult hepatocyte proliferation and challenges the widely held view that liver tissue is mostly quiescent unless chemically or mechanically injured.",

    "abstract": "From micro to planetary scales, spatial heterogeneity--patchiness--is ubiquitous in ecological systems, defining the environments in which organisms move and interact. While this fact has been recognized for decades, most large-scale ecosystem models still use spatially averaged \"mean fields\" to represent natural populations, while fine-scale, spatially explicit models are mostly restricted to particular organisms or systems. In a conceptual paper, Grunbaum (2012, Interface Focus 2: 150-155) introduced a heuristic framework, based on three dimensionless ratios quantifying movement, reproduction, and resource consumption, to characterize patchy ecological interactions and identify when mean-field assumptions are justifiable. In this paper, we calculated Grunbaums dimensionless numbers for 33 real interactions between consumers and their resource patches in terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments. Consumers ranged in size from bacteria to blue whales, and patches lasted from minutes to millennia, spanning spatial scales of mm to hundreds of km. We found that none of the interactions could be accurately represented by a purely mean-field model, though 26 of them (79%) could be partially simplified by averaging out movement, reproductive, or consumption dynamics. Clustering consumer-resource pairs by their non-dimensional ratios revealed several unexpected dynamic similarities between disparate interactions. For example, bacterial Pseudoalteromonas exploit nutrient plumes in a similar manner to Mongolian gazelles grazing on ephemeral patches of steppe vegetation. Our findings suggest that dimensional analysis is a valuable tool for characterizing ecological patchiness, and can link the dynamics of widely different systems into a single quantitative framework.",

A subset of X-linked genes escape XCI, but the extent to which this phenomenon occurs and how it varies across tissues and in a population is as yet unclear. In order to characterize the incidence and variability of escape across individuals and tissues, we conducted a large scale transcriptomic study of XCI escape in adipose, skin, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and immune cells in 248 twins drawn from a healthy population cohort. We identify 159 X-linked genes with detectable escape, of which 54 genes, including 19 lncRNAs, were not previously known to escape XCI. Across tissues we find a range of tissue-specificity, with 11% of genes escaping XCI constitutively across tissues and 24% demonstrating tissue-restricted escape, including genes with cell-type specific escape between immune cell types (B, T-CD4+, T-CD8+ and NK cells) of the same individual. Escape genes interact with autosomal-encoded proteins and are involved in varied biological processes such as gene regulation. We find substantial variability in escape between individuals. 49% of genes show inter-individual variability in escape, indicating escape from XCI is an under-appreciated source of gene expression differences. We utilized twin models to investigate the role of genetics in variable escape. Overall, monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs share more similar escape than dizygotic twin pairs, indicating that genetic factors underlie differences in escape across individuals. However, we also identify instances of discordant XCI within MZ co-twin pairs, suggesting that environmental factors also influence escape. Thus, XCI escape may be shaped by an interplay of genetic factors with tissue- and cell type-specificity, and environment. These results illuminate an intricate phenotype whose characterization aids understanding the basis of variable trait expressivity in females.",

Besides, the origin and genetic diversity of HM people and their phylogenetic relationship with surrounding modern and ancient populations are unknown. Here, we reported genome-wide SNPs in 52 representative Miao people and combined them with 144 HM people from 13 geographically representative populations to characterize the full genetic admixture and adaptive landscape of HM speakers. We found that obvious genetic substructures existed in geographically different HM populations and also identified one new ancestral lineage specifically exited in HM people, which spatially distributed from Sichuan and Guizhou in the North to Thailand in the South and temporally dated to at least 500 years. The sharing patterns of the newly-identified homogeneous ancestry component combined the estimated admixture times via the decay of Linkage Disequilibrium and haplotype sharing in GLOBETROTTER suggested that the modern HM-speaking populations originated from Southwest China and migrated southward recently, which is consistent with the reconstructed phenomena of linguistic and archeological documents.

The proposed KRV framework improves statistical power by capturing intrinsic structure within the genetic and microbiome data while reducing the multiple-testing burden. We apply the covariate-adjusted KRV test to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos in a genome-wide association analysis (first gene-level, then variant-level) for microbiome beta-diversity. We have identified an immunity-related gene, IL23R, reported in previous association studies and discovered 3 other novel genes, 2 of which are involved in immune functions or autoimmune disorders. Our findings highlight the value of the KRV as a powerful microbiome GWAS approach and support an important role of immunity-related genes in shaping the gut microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Protein language models have emerged as an alternative to multiple sequence alignment for enriching sequence information and improving downstream prediction tasks such as biophysical, structural, and functional properties. Here we show that a combination of traditional one-hot encoding with the embeddings from two different language models (ProtTrans and ESM-1b) allows a leap in accuracy over single-sequence based techniques in predicting protein 1D secondary and tertiary structural properties, including backbone torsion angles, solvent accessibility and contact numbers. This large improvement leads to an accuracy comparable to or better than the current state-of-the-art techniques for predicting these 1D structural properties based on sequence profiles generated from multiple sequence alignments. The high-accuracy prediction in both secondary and tertiary structural properties indicates that it is possible to make highly accurate prediction of protein structures without homologous sequences, the remaining obstacle in the post AlphaFold2 era.",

They comprise of various characteristics such as diploid genetics, small genome size, rapid growth cycle, and relatively low repetitive DNA content, making it a perfect model for plant genome projects.\n\nObjectiveThe aim of this present Insilico research study is to carry out molecular drug docking studies between PERK13-Proline rich receptor like protein kinase and De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose or di-galactosylated curcumin, a derivative of curcumin. PERK13 protein is considered to play a significant role in helping plants tackle salinity levels in water.\n\nMethodsIn this study, protein modelling tools and servers are used to model the 3D structure and the same is validated using Protein structure validation tools. Automated drug docking servers were used to dock the modelled protein with the chemical compound to analyse the electrostatic (H bond) interaction between PERK13 and De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose, a better water-soluble compound than curcumin. The docked structure was visualized using an advanced molecular visualization tool.\n\nResults and DiscussionThe overall results obtained from this study on De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose and PERK13 protein shows that De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose, directly binds with the active site and other potentially binding regions of PERK13. Hence, it is concluded that De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose could potentially play a vital role in future research related to the problem of helping the plants tackle increased saline levels in water.",

    "abstract": "Decreased oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) outside of the physiological range may severely subvert cell, tissue, and organism survival. Mammals have evolved mechanisms to sense hypoxia and induce a series of hypoxic responses. In recent years, high-throughput techniques have greatly promoted global perturbation studies of protein expression during hypoxia, and these studies have contributed to the understanding of the complex regulatory networks of hypoxia. In this study, we developed an integrated resource for the expression dynamics of proteins in response to hypoxia (iHypoxia), which contains 1,629 expression events of 1,215 proteins identified by low-throughput experiments (LTEs) and 154,953 quantitative expression events of 36,194 proteins identified by high-throughput experiments (HTEs) from five mammals that exhibit a response to hypoxia. Various experimental details such as the hypoxic experimental conditions, expression patterns, and samples were carefully collected and integrated. In addition, we conducted an orthologous search and identified 581,763 proteins that may respond to hypoxia among 50 animals. An enrichment analysis of human proteins identified from LTEs showed that these proteins were enriched in certain drug targets and cancer genes. The annotation of known posttranslational modification (PTM) sites to proteins identified by LTEs revealed that these proteins underwent extensive PTMs, particularly phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation. Based on the results, iHypoxia provides a convenient and user-friendly method for users to obtain hypoxia-related information of interest. We anticipate that iHypoxia, which is freely accessible at http://ihypoxia.omicsbio.info, will advance the understanding of hypoxia and serve as a valuable data resource.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is considered as one of the three most common cancers around the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Coix lachrymal jobi, commonly known as Jobs tears or adlay has been reported to possess anti-cancer properties. Despite evidences provided by clinical data, the usage of Coix lacryma-jobi in treating cancer, particularly breast cancer, has been scarce. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its anti-breast cancer property using various network pathway analyses. Bioactive compounds from Coix lacryma-jobi and its potential target genes were obtained from SymMap. Breast cancer-related target genes were collected from CTD. Protein-protein interaction network was analyzed using the STRING database. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID to further explore the mechanisms of Coix lacryma-jobi in treating breast cancer. PPI and compound-target-pathway were visualized using Cytoscape. A total of 26 bioactive compounds, 201 corresponding targets, 36625 breast cancer-associated targets were obtained, and 200 common targets were considered potential therapeutic targets. The 9 bioactive compounds identified were berberine, oleic acid, beta-sitosterol, sitosterol, linoleic acid, berberrubine, jatrorrhizine, thalifendine, and stigmasterol. The identified 5 core targets were ESR1, JUN, MAPK14, and RXRA. Coix lacryma-jobi targets enriched in GO terms were mostly involved in regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, drug response, steroid hormone receptor activity, and protein binding. This study elucidates on the pharmacological underpinnings on the potency of adlay against breast cancer. Its subsequent drug development will be worth a step forward for a breast cancer-free society.",

    "abstract": "AimsInternephron signalling and interaction are fundamental for kidney function. Earlier studies have shown that nephrons signal to each other over short distances and adjust their activity accordingly. Micropuncture experiments revealed synchronous clusters of 2-3 nephrons formed from such interactions, while imaging and modelling results suggested the possibility of larger clusters. Such clusters are expected to play an important role in renal autoregulation, but their presence has not been confirmed and their size has not been estimated. In this study, we present methodology for high resolution renal blood flow imaging and apply it to estimate frequency and phase angle differences in kidney blood vessels under normal conditions and after administration of the vasoactive agents angiotensin II and acetylcholine.\n\nMethods and resultsTo resolve signals from separate arterioles in a sufficiently large field of view, we developed a method for renal laser speckle contrast imaging. Our setup provides imaging of blood flow in the kidney cortex with a limit of image resolution at 0.8m per pixel and imaging frequency of 160Hz. We used the method to record from 1.5x1.5 mm2 sections of the renal surface in anaesthetised Sprague-Dawley rats in unstimulated conditions and during IV infusion of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II or the vasodilator acetylcholine. In each section, we resolved and segmented 94.8{+/-}15.66 individual arterioles and venules, and analyzed blood flow using wavelet spectral analysis to identify clusters of synchronized blood vessels.\n\nConclusionsWe observed spatial and temporal evolution of blood vessel clusters of various sizes, including the formation of large (>90 vessels) long-lived clusters (>10 periods) locked at the frequency of the tubular glomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism. The analysis showed that synchronization patterns and thus the co-operative dynamics of nephrons change significantly when either of the vasoactive agents is administered. On average, synchronization was stronger (larger clusters, longer duration) with angiotensin II administration than in the unstimulated state or with acetyl choline. While it weakens with distance, increased synchronization duration spanned the whole field of view, and likely, beyond it. Neighbouring vessels tend to demonstrate in-phase synchronization, especially in the vasoconstricted condition, which is expected to cause locally increased pressure variation. Our results confirm both the presence of the local synchronization in the renal microcirculatory blood flow and the fact that it changes depending on the condition of the vascular network and the blood pressure, which might have further implications for the role of such synchronization in pathologies development.",

    "abstract": "As the most abundant tissue on Earth1, xylem is responsible for lateral growth in plants. Typical xylem has a radial system composed of ray parenchyma cells and an axial system of fusiform cells2. In most angiosperms, fusiform cells are a combination of vessel elements for water transportation and libriform fibers for mechanical support, while both functions are performed together by tracheids in other vascular plants2. However, little is known about the developmental programs and evolutionary relationships of these xylem cell types. Through both single-cell and laser-capture microdissection transcriptomic profiling, here we demonstrate the developmental lineages of ray and fusiform cells in stem-differentiating xylem across four divergent woody angiosperms. Cross-species analyses of single-cell trajectories reveal highly conserved ray, yet variable fusiform, lineages across angiosperms. Core eudicots Populus trichocarpa and Eucalyptus grandis share nearly identical fusiform lineages. The tracheids in the basal eudicot Trochodendron aralioides, an evolutionarily reversed character3, 4, exhibit strong transcriptomic similarity to vessel elements but not libriform fibers, suggesting that water transportation, instead of mechanical support, is the major feature. We also found that the more basal angiosperm Liriodendron chinense has a fusiform lineage distinct from that in core eudicots. This evo-developmental framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the formation of xylem cell lineages across multiple plant species spanning over a hundred million years of evolutionary history5.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics and connectivity of neural circuits continuously change during an animals lifetime on timescales ranging from milliseconds to days. Therefore, to investigate how biological networks accomplish remarkable cognitive and behavioral tasks, minimally invasive methods are needed to perform repeated measurements, or perturbations of neural circuits in behaving animals across time. Such tools have been developed to investigate the brain but similar approaches are lacking for comprehensively and repeatedly recording motor circuits in behaving animals. Here we describe a suite of microfabricated technologies that enable long-term, minimally invasive optical recordings of the adult Drosophila melanogaster ventral nerve cord (VNC)--neural tissues that are functionally equivalent to the vertebrate spinal cord. These tools consist of (i) a manipulator arm that permits the insertion of (ii) a compliant implant into the thorax to expose the imaging region of interest; (iii) a numbered, transparent polymer window that encloses and provides optical access to the inside of the thorax, and (iv) a hinged remounting stage that allows gentle and repeated tethering of an implanted animal for two-photon imaging. We validate and illustrate the utility of our toolkit in several ways. First, we show that the thoracic implant and window have minimal impact on animal behavior and survival while also enabling neural recordings from individual animals across at least one month. Second, we follow the degradation of chordotonal organ mechanosensory nerve terminals in the VNC over weeks after leg amputation. Third, because our tools allow recordings of the VNC with the gut intact, we discover waves of neural population activity following ingestion of a high-concentration caffeine solution. In summary, our microfabricated toolkit makes it possible to longitudinally monitor anatomical and functional changes in premotor and motor neural circuits, and more generally opens up the long-term investigation of thoracic tissues.",

Here, we investigated the dynamic changes in the functional brain networks during 20-min capsaicin-induced sustained orofacial pain. In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from the other primary somatomotor cortices and integrated with subcortical and frontoparietal regions, constituting a brain-wide pain supersystem. As pain decreased over time, the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were separated from this pain supersystem and connected to multiple cerebellar regions. Machine-learning models based on these dynamic network features showed significant predictions of changes in pain experience across two independent datasets (n = 48 and 74). This study provides new insights into how multiple brain systems dynamically interact to construct and modulate pain experience, potentially advancing our mechanistic understanding of chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Radiation therapy induces cytotoxic DNA damage, which results in cell-cycle arrest and activation of cell-intrinsic death pathways, but its application has been limited by the radioresistance of tumors, such as in malignant melanoma. RIG-I is a cytosolic immune receptor expressed in all somatic cells, including tumor cells, with a key role in sensing viral RNA. RIG-I specific oligonucleotide ligands elicit a robust cell-intrinsic antiviral response and immunogenic cell death in tumor cells and are being tested in clinical trials. Nonetheless, their potential to overcome radioresistance has not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrate that activation of RIG-I enhances the extent and immunogenicity of irradiation-induced tumor cell death in human and murine melanoma cell lines in vitro and improved survival in the murine B16 melanoma model. Pathway analysis of transcriptomic data revealed a central role for p53 downstream of the combination treatment, which was corroborated using p53-/- B16 cells. In vivo, the effect of irradiation on immune-cell activation and inhibition of tumor growth was absent in mice carrying p53-/- B16 tumors, while the response to RIG-I stimulation in those mice was maintained. Our results identify p53 as pivotal for the synergistic antitumoral effect of RIG-I and irradiation, resulting in potent induction of immunogenic tumor-cell death. Thus, the administration of RIG-I ligands in combination with radiotherapy is a promising therapeutic approach to treating radioresistant tumors with a functional p53 pathway, such as malignant melanoma.",

By analyzing cell morphological data of different bacterial species under antibiotic stress, we find that bacterial cells robustly reduce surface-to-volume ratio in response to most types of antibiotics. Using quantitative modelling we show that by reducing surface-to-volume ratio, bacteria can effectively reduce intracellular antibiotic concentration by decreasing antibiotic influx. The model predicts that bacteria can increase surface-to-volume ratio to promote antibiotic dilution if efflux pump activity is reduced, in agreement with data on membrane-transport inhibitors. Using the particular example of ribosome-targeting antibiotics, we present a systems-level model for the regulation of cell shape under antibiotic stress, and discuss feedback mechanisms that bacteria can harness to increase their fitness in the presence of antibiotics.",

The nitrogen metabolism genes were expressed similarly in {Delta}mtrA-glnR and {Delta}glnR under both nitrogen-limited and nutrient-rich conditions, with patterns distinctly different from that of {Delta}mtrA, suggesting a decisive role for GlnR in the control of nitrogen metabolism genes and further suggesting that regulation of these genes by MtrA is GlnR-dependent.

    "abstract": "Recent reports have challenged the notion that the lens is immune-privileged. However, these studies have not fully identified the molecular mechanism(s) that promote immune surveillance of the lens. Using a mouse model of targeted glutathione (GSH) deficiency in ocular surface tissues, we have investigated the role of oxidative stress in upregulating cytokine expression and promoting immune surveillance of the eye. RNA-sequencing of lenses from postnatal day (P) 1- aged Gclcf/f;Le-CreTg/- (KO) and Gclcf/f;Le-Cre-/- control (CON) mice revealed upregulation of many cytokines (e.g., CCL4, GDF15, CSF1) and immune response genes in the lenses of KO mice. The eyes of KO mice had a greater number of cells in the aqueous and vitreous humors at P1, P20 and P50 than age-matched CON and Gclcw/w;Le-CreTg/- (CRE) mice. Histological analyses revealed the presence of innate immune cells (i.e., macrophages, leukocytes) in ocular structures of the KO mice. At P20, the expression of cytokines and ROS content was higher in the lenses of KO mice than in those from age-matched CRE and CON mice, suggesting that oxidative stress may induce cytokine expression. In vitro administration of the oxidant, hydrogen peroxide, and the depletion of GSH (using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)) in 21EM15 lens epithelial cells induced cytokine expression, an effect that was prevented by co-treatment of the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a antioxidant. The in vivo and ex vivo induction of cytokine expression by oxidative stress was associated with the expression of markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), -SMA, in lens cells. Given that EMT of lens epithelial cells causes posterior capsule opacification (PCO), we propose that oxidative stress induces cytokine expression, EMT and the development of PCO in a positive feedback loop. Collectively these data indicate that oxidative stress induces inflammation of lens cells which promotes immune surveillance of ocular structures.\n\nHighlightsO_LIImmune surveillance of ocular structures occurs in mouse eyes deficient in glutathione.\nC_LIO_LIOxidative stress upregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., GDF15, CSF1) in lens cells in vitro and in vivo.\nC_LIO_LIThe upregulation of cytokines in lens cells is associated with markers of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype.\nC_LIO_LIOxidative stress-induced inflammation and associated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition may play a role in the development of posterior capsule opacification.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a highly democratizable technique that provides optical super-resolution (SR) without requirement of sophisticated imaging instruments. An open source package for SOFI algorithm is needed to support not only the utilization of SOFI, but also the community adoption and participation for further development of SOFI. In this work, we developed PySOFI, an open source python package for SOFI analysis that offers the flexibility to inspect, test, modify, improve and extend the algorithm. We provide a complete documentation for the package and a collection of Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate the usage of the package. We discuss the architecture of PySOFI, illustrate how to use each functional module, and demonstrate how to extend the PySOFI package with additional modules. We expect PySOFI to facilitate efficient adoption, testing, modification, dissemination and prototyping of new SOFI-relevant algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria organize many activities according to their grow rate via the ppGpp signaling system. Yet it is not clear how this signaling system \"knows\" how fast cells grow. Through quantitative experiments, we show that ppGpp responds inversely to the rate of translational elongation in E. coli. Together with its roles in inhibiting ribosome biogenesis and activity, ppGpp closes a key regulatory circuit that enables the cell to perceive and control the rate of its growth across conditions. The celebrated linear growth law relating the ribosome content and growth rate emerges as a consequence of keeping a supply of ribosome reserves while maintaining elongation rate in slow growth conditions. Further analysis suggests the elongation rate itself is detected by sensing the ratio of dwelling and translocating ribosomes, a strategy employed to collapse the complex, high-dimensional dynamics of the molecular processes underlying cell growth to perceive the physiological state of the whole.",

    "abstract": "Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is a severe demyelinating, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency in glycosphingolipid catabolic enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC). Histologically, Krabbe disease is characterized by the appearance of large multinucleated globoid cells that express classical macrophage markers (both of brain-resident microglia and peripheral monocyte-derived). Globoid cells reside near areas of degeneration; however, their functional significance in disease progression remains unclear. In the current study, we differentiated microglia-like cells from iPSCs from a donor with infantile Krabbe disease and compared them to microglia generated from two healthy controls and two donors with the lysosomal storage disorder metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), which is genetically distinct from Krabbe disease but presents similarly in terms of severity of demyelination and neurodegeneration. We report the novel finding of prominent formation of giant multinucleated globoid cells from the microglia derived from the Krabbe donor, but not from healthy control or MLD donors. The Krabbe microglia displayed reduced IL-6 protein expression upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, and the multinucleated globoid cells themselves appeared deficient in phagocytosis of both disease-relevant myelin debris and E. coli, together hinting at an impairment of normal function. The formation of the globoid cells could be attenuated by fully replacing the medium following passaging, suggesting that yet-to-be determined secreted factors are influencing cell fusion in our culture system. While preliminary, our results imply that globoid cells may be detrimental in Krabbe disease by hindering the normal function of brain-residing macrophages.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the mechanisms behind the influence of expectation and context on pain perception is crucial for improving analgesic treatments. Prediction error (PE) signals how much a noxious stimulus deviates from expectation and is therefore crucial for our understanding of pain perception. It is thought that the brain engages in  adaptive coding of pain PE, such that sensitivity to unexpected outcomes is modulated by contextual information. While there is behavioural evidence that pain is coded adaptively, and evidence that reward PE signals are coded adaptively, controversy remains regarding the underlying neural mechanism of adaptively-coded pain PEs.\n\nMethodsA cued-pain task was performed by 19 healthy adults while undergoing FMRI scanning. BOLD responses to the task were tested using an axiomatic approach to identify areas that may code pain PE adaptively.\n\nResultsThe left dorsal anterior insula demonstrated a pattern of response consistent with adaptively-coded pain PE. Signals from this area were sensitive to both predicted pain magnitudes on the instigation of expectation, and the unexpectedness of pain delivery. Crucially however, the response at pain delivery was consistent with the local context of the pain stimulation, rather than the absolute magnitude of delivered pain, a pattern suggestive of an adaptively-coded PE signal.\n\nConclusionsThe study advances our understanding of the neural basis of pain prediction. Alongside existing evidence that the periaqueductal grey codes pain PE and the posterior insula codes pain magnitude, the results highlight a distinct contribution of the left dorsal anterior insula in the processing of pain.\n\nSignificance statementAlthough there is behavioural evidence that pain is coded adaptively, the neural mechanisms serving this process are not well understood. This study used functional MRI to provide the first evidence that the left dorsal anterior insula, an area associated with aversive learning, responds to pain in a manner consistent with the adaptive coding of pain prediction error. This study aids our understanding of the neural basis of subjective pain representation, and thus can contribute to the advancement of analgesic treatments.",

    "abstract": "The liver is the largest solid organ in the body, yet it remains incompletely characterized. Here, we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and bile-duct macrophages. We also uncover the respective spatially-resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that bile-duct macrophages are induced by local lipid exposure, while Kupffer cells crucially depend on their crosstalk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily-conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMYBs are among the largest transcription factor families in plants. Consequently, members of this family are involved in a plethora of processes including development and specialized metabolism. The MYB families of many plant species were investigated in the last two decades since the first investigation looked at Arabidopsis thaliana. This body of knowledge and characterized sequences provide the basis for the identification, classification, and functional annotation of candidate sequences in new genome and transcriptome assemblies.\n\nResultsA pipeline for the automatic identification and functional annotation of MYBs in a given sequence data set was implemented in Python. MYB candidates are identified, screened for the presence of a MYB domain and other motifs, and finally placed in a phylogenetic context with well characterized sequences. In addition to technical benchmarking based on existing annotation, the transcriptome assembly of Croton tiglium and the annotated genome sequence of Castanea crenata were screened for MYBs. Results of both analyses are presented in this study to illustrate the potential of this application. The analysis of one species takes only a few minutes depending on the number of predicted sequences and the size of the MYB gene family. This pipeline, the required bait sequences, and reference sequences for a classification are freely available on github: https://github.com/bpucker/MYB_annotator.\n\nConclusionsThis automatic annotation of the MYB gene family in novel assemblies makes genome-wide investigations consistent and paves the way for comparative studies in the future. Candidate genes for in-depth analyses are presented based on their orthology to previously characterized sequences which allows the functional annotation of the newly identified MYBs with high confidence. The identification of orthologs can also be harnessed to detect duplication and deletion events.",
