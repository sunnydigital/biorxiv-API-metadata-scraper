    "abstract": "Protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are essential for many biological processes, so understanding aspects of the sequences and structures involved in PRIs is important for unraveling such processes. Because of the expensive and time-consuming techniques required for experimental determination of complex protein-RNA structures, various computational methods have been developed to predict PRIs. However, most of these methods focus on predicting only RNA-binding regions in proteins or only protein-binding motifs in RNA. Methods for predicting entire residue-base contacts in PRIs have not yet achieved sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, some of these methods require the identification of 3D structures or homologous sequences, which are not available for all protein and RNA sequences. Here, we propose a prediction method for predicting residue-base contacts between proteins and RNAs using only sequence information and structural information predicted from sequences. The method can be applied to any protein-RNA pair, even when rich information such as its 3D structure, is not available. In this method, residue-base contact prediction is formalized as an integer programming problem. We predict a residue-base contact map that maximizes a scoring function based on sequence-based features such as k-mers of sequences and the predicted secondary structure. The scoring function is trained using a max-margin framework from known PRIs with 3D structures. To verify our method, we conducted several computational experiments. The results suggest that our method, which is based on only sequence information, is comparable with RNA-binding residue prediction methods based on known binding data.",

    "abstract": "Categorical neural responses underlie various forms of selection and decision-making. Such binary-like responses promote robust signaling of the winner in the presence of input ambiguity and neural noise. Here, we show that a  donut-like inhibitory mechanism in which each competing option suppresses all options except itself, is highly effective at generating categorical neural responses. It surpasses motifs of feedback inhibition, recurrent excitation, and divisive normalization invoked frequently in decision-making models. We demonstrate experimentally not only that this mechanism operates in the midbrain spatial selection network in barn owls, but also that it is necessary for categorical signaling by it. The functional pattern of neural inhibition in the midbrain forms an exquisitely structured  multi-holed donut consistent with this networks combinatorial inhibitory function for stimulus selection. Additionally, modeling reveals a generalizable neural implementation of the donut-like motif for categorical selection. Self-sparing inhibition may, therefore, be a powerful circuit module central to categorization.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiome research focuses on populations living in high-income countries or on the other end of the spectrum, namely non-urban agriculturalist and hunter-gatherer societies. The scarcity of research between these extremes limits our understanding of how the gut microbiota relates to health and disease in the majority of the worlds population. We present the first study evaluating gut microbiome composition in transitioning South African populations using short- and long-read sequencing. We analyzed stool samples from adult females (age 40 - 72) living in rural Bushbuckridge municipality (n=118) or urban Soweto (n=51) and find that these microbiomes are taxonomically intermediate between those of individuals living in high-income countries and traditional communities. We demonstrate that reference collections are incomplete for characterization of microbiomes of individuals living outside high-income countries, resulting in artificially low species-level beta diversity measurements. To improve reference databases, we generated complete genomes of undescribed taxa, including Treponema, Lentisphaerae, and Succinatimonas species. Our results suggest that the gut microbiome in South African populations do not exist along a simple \"western-nonwestern\" axis and that these populations contain microbial diversity that remains to be described.",

    "abstract": "Spatial partitioning is a propensity of biological systems orchestrating cell activities in space and time. The dynamic regulation of plasma membrane nano-environments has recently emerged as a key fundamental aspect of plant signaling, but the molecular components governing it are still mostly unclear. The receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) controls complex formation of the immune receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) with its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and this function is inhibited by the FER ligand RAPID ALKALANIZATION FACTOR 23 (RALF23). Here, we show that FER regulates the plasma membrane nanoscale organization of FLS2 and BAK1. Our study demonstrates that akin to FER, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) extensin (LRXs) proteins contribute to RALF23 responsiveness, regulate BAK1 nanoscale organization and immune signaling. Furthermore, RALF23 perception leads to rapid modulation of FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale organization and its inhibitory activity on immune signaling relies on FER kinase activity. Our results suggest that perception of RALF peptides by FER and LRXs actively modulates the plasma membrane nanoscale landscape to regulate cell surface signaling by other receptor kinases.",

However, using all SNPs mapped to a gene, including those with low association scores, can mask the association signal of a gene.\n\nWe therefore propose a new two-step strategy, consisting in first selecting the SNPs most associated with the phenotype within a given gene, before testing their joint effect on the phenotype. The recently proposed kernelPSI framework for kernel-based post-selection inference makes it possible to model non-linear relationships between features, as well as to obtain valid p-values that account for the selection step.\n\nIn this paper, we show how we adapted kernelPSI to the setting of quantitative GWAS, using kernels to model epistatic interactions between neighboring SNPs, and post-selection inference to determine the joint effect of selected blocks of SNPs on a phenotype. We illustrate this tool on the study of two continuous phenotypes from the UKBiobank.\n\nWe show that kernelPSI can be successfully used to study GWAS data and detect genes associated with a phenotype through the signal carried by the most strongly associated regions of these genes. In particular, we show that kernelPSI enjoys more statistical power than other gene-based GWAS tools, such as SKAT or MAGMA.\n\nkernelPSI is an effective tool to combine SNP-based and gene-based analyses of GWAS data, and can be used successfully to improve both statistical performance and interpretability of GWAS.",

    "abstract": "Recent human behavioral and neuroimaging results suggest that people are selective in when they encode and retrieve episodic memories. To explain these findings, we trained a memory-augmented neural network to use its episodic memory to support prediction of upcoming states in an environment where past situations sometimes reoccur. We found that the network learned to retrieve selectively as a function of several factors, including its uncertainty about the upcoming state. Additionally, we found that selectively encoding episodic memories at the end of an event (but not mid-event) led to better subsequent prediction performance. In all of these cases, the benefits of selective retrieval and encoding can be explained in terms of reducing the risk of retrieving irrelevant memories. Overall, these modeling results provide a resource-rational account of why episodic retrieval and encoding should be selective and lead to several testable predictions.",

    "abstract": "The manipulation of gene activity through the creation of hypomorphic mutants has been a long-standing tool in examining gene function. Our previous studies have indicated that hypomorphic mutants could be created by inserting cis-regulatory sequences composed of consecutive adenosine nucleotides called polyA tracks. Here we use polyA tracks to create hypomorphic mutants and functional characterization of membrane, secretory and endogenous proteins. Insertion of polyA tracks into the sequences of interleukin-2 and membrane protein CD20 results in a programmable reduction of mRNA stability and attenuation of protein expression regardless of the presence of signaling sequence. Likewise, CRISPR/Cas9 targeted insertion of polyA tracks in the coding sequence of endogenous human genes AUF1 and TP53 results in a programmable reduction of targeted protein and mRNA levels. Functional analyses of AUF1 engineered hypomorphs indicate a direct correlation between AUF1 gene levels and the stability of AUF1-regulated mRNAs. Hypomorphs of TP53 affect the expression of the target genes differentially depending upon the severity of the hypomorphic mutation. Finally, decreases in TP53 protein affect the same cellular pathways in polyA track engineered cells as in cancer cells, indicating these variants biological relevance. These results highlight this technologys power to create predictable, stable hypomorphs in recombinant or endogenous genes in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in the neuroscience of everyday communication is how scene acoustics shape the neural processing of attended speech sounds and in turn impact speech intelligibility. While it is well known that the temporal envelopes in target speech are important for intelligibility, how the neural encoding of target-speech envelopes is influenced by background sounds or other acoustic features of the scene is unknown. Here, we combine human electroencephalography with simultaneous intelligibility measurements to address this key gap. We find that the neural envelope-domain signal-to-noise ratio in target-speech encoding, which is shaped by masker modulations, predicts intelligibility over a range of strategically chosen realistic listening conditions unseen by the predictive model. This provides neurophysiological evidence for modulation masking. Moreover, using high-resolution vocoding to carefully control peripheral envelopes, we show that target-envelope coding fidelity in the brain depends not only on envelopes conveyed by the cochlea, but also on the temporal fine structure (TFS), which supports scene segregation. Our results are consistent with the notion that temporal coherence of sound elements across envelopes and/or TFS influences scene analysis and attentive selection of a target sound. Our findings also inform speech-intelligibility models and technologies attempting to improve real-world speech communication.",

There is therefore an urgent need to design conservation policies that maximise the protection of biodiversity and its contributions to people, within the constraints of limited budgets. Here we present a novel framework for spatial conservation prioritisation that combines simulation models, reinforcement learning and ground validation to identify optimal policies. Our methodology, CAPTAIN (Conservation Area Prioritisation Through Artificial Intelligence Networks), quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection, allowing the exploration of multiple biodiversity metrics. Under a fixed budget, our model protects substantially more species from extinction than the random or naively targeted protection of areas. CAPTAIN also outperforms the most widely used software for spatial conservation prioritisation (Marxan) in 97% of cases and reduces species loss by an average of 40% under simulations, besides yielding prioritisation maps at substantially higher spatial resolution using empirical data. We find that regular biodiversity monitoring, even if simple and with a degree of inaccuracy - characteristic of citizen science surveys - substantially improves biodiversity outcomes. Given the complexity of people-nature interactions and wealth of associated data, artificial intelligence holds great promise for improving the conservation of biological and ecosystem values in a rapidly changing and resource-limited world.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the medical sphere, understanding naming conventions strengthen the integrity of naming human diseases remains nominal rather than substantial yet. Since the current nosology-based standard for human diseases could not offer a one-size-fits-all corrective mechanism, many idiomatic but flawed names frequently appear in scientific literature and news outlets at the cost of sociocultural impacts.\n\nObjectiveWe attempt to examine the ethical oversights of current naming practices and propose heuristic rationales and approaches to determine a pithy name instead of an inopportune nosology.\n\nMethodsFirst, we examined the compiled global online news volumes and emotional tones on some inopportune nosology like German measles, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu, and Huntingtons disease in the wake of COVID-19. Second, we prototypically scrutinize the lexical dynamics and pathological differentials of German measles and common synonyms by leveraging the capacity of the Google Books Ngram Corpus. Third, we demonstrated the empirical approaches to curate an exclusive substitute for an anachronistic nosology German measles based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations.\n\nResultsThe infodemiological study shows that the public informed the offensive names with extremely negative tones in textual and visual narratives. The findings of the historiographical study indicate that many synonyms of German measles did not survive, while German measles became an anachronistic usage, and rubella has taken the dominant place since 1994. The PubMedBERT model could identify rubella as a potential substitution for German measles with the highest semantic similarity. The results of the semantic drift experiments further indicate that rubella tends to survive during the ebb and flow of semantic drift.\n\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that the nosological evolution of anachronistic names could result in sociocultural impacts without a corrective mechanism. To mitigate such impacts, we introduce some ethical principles for formulating an improved naming scheme. Based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations, our illustrated experiments could provide hallmark references to the remedial mechanism of naming practices and pertinent credit allocations.",

One such protein is AKAP5, which contains SLiMs that anchor PKA and Calcineurin, and recruit substrate (the TRPV1 receptor). Calcineurin is anchored to AKAP5 by a well-characterised PxIxIT SLiM. Here we show, using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, that the Calcineurin PxIxIT-binding groove also recognises several hitherto unknown lower-affinity SLiMs in addition to the PxIxIT motif. We demonstrate that the assembly is in reality a complex system with conserved SLiMs spanning a wide affinity range. The capture is analogous to that seen for many DNA-binding proteins that have a weak non-specific affinity for DNA outside the canonical binding site, but different in that it involves (i) two proteins, and (ii) hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions. It is also compatible with the requirement for both stable anchoring of the enzyme and responsive downstream signalling. We conclude that the AKAP5 C-terminus is enriched in lower-affinity/mini-SLiMs that, together with the canonical SLiM, maintain a structurally disordered but tightly regulated signalosome.",

    "abstract": "Cross-linked actin networks are the primary component of the cell cytoskeleton and have been the subject of numerous experimental and modeling studies. While these studies have demonstrated that the networks are viscoelastic materials, evolving from elastic solids on short timescales to viscous fluids on long ones, questions remain about the duration of each asymptotic regime, the role of the surrounding fluid, and the behavior of the networks on intermediate timescales. Here we perform detailed simulations of passively cross-linked non-Brownian actin networks to quantify the principal timescales involved in the elastoviscous behavior, study the role of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions, and parameterize continuum models from discrete stochastic simulations. To do this, we extend our recent computational framework for semiflexible filament suspensions, which is based on nonlocal slender body theory, to actin networks with dynamic cross linkers and finite filament lifetime. We introduce a model where the cross linkers are elastic springs with sticky ends stochastically binding to and unbinding from the elastic filaments, which randomly turn over at a characteristic rate. We show that, depending on the parameters, the network evolves to a steady state morphology that is either an isotropic actin mesh or a mesh with embedded actin bundles. For different degrees of bundling, we numerically apply small-amplitude oscillatory shear deformation to extract three timescales from networks of hundreds of filaments and cross linkers. We analyze the dependence of these timescales, which range from the order of hundredths of a second to the actin turnover time of several seconds, on the dynamic nature of the links, solvent viscosity, and filament bending stiffness. We show that the network is mostly elastic on the short time scale, with the elasticity coming mainly from the cross links, and viscous on the long time scale, with the effective viscosity originating primarily from stretching and breaking of the cross links. We show that the influence of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions depends on the network morphology: for homogeneous meshworks, nonlocal hydrodynamics gives only a small correction to the viscous behavior, but for bundled networks it both hinders the formation of bundles and significantly lowers the resistance to shear once bundles are formed. We use our results to construct three-timescale generalized Maxwell models of the networks.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that excitatory neurons in the brain play a significant role in seizure generation. Nonetheless, spiny stellate cells are cortical excitatory non-pyramidal neurons in the brain, which their basic role in seizure occurrence is not well understood. In the present research, we study the critical role of spiny stellate cells or the excitatory interneurons (EI), for the first time, in epileptic seizure generation using an extended neural mass model inspired by Liu and Wang model in 2017. Applying bifurcation analysis on this modified model, we investigated the rich dynamics corresponding to the epileptic seizure onset and transition between interictal and ictal states caused by EI connectivity to other cell types. Our results indicate that the transition between interictal and ictal states (preictal signal) corresponds to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, and thus, the extended model suggests that before seizure onset, the amplitude and frequency of neural activities gradually increase. Moreover, we showed that 1) the altered function of GABAergic and glutamatergic receptors of EI can cause seizure, and 2) the pathway between the thalamic relay nucleus and EI facilitates the transition from interictal to the ictal activity by decreasing the preictal period. Thereafter, we considered both sensory and cortical periodic inputs to study model responses to various harmonic stimulations. Bifurcation analysis of the model, in this case, suggests that the initial state of the model might be the main cause for the transition between interictal and ictal states as the stimulus frequency changes. The extended thalamocortical model shows also that the amplitude jump phenomenon and nonlinear resonance behavior result from the preictal state of the modified model. These results can be considered as a step forward to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transition from normal activities to epileptic activities.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are multicellular microbial communities that encase themselves in an extracellular matrix (ECM) of secreted biopolymers and attach to surfaces and interfaces. Bacterial biofilms are detrimental in hospital and industrial settings, but they can be beneficial in agricultural contexts. An essential property of biofilms that grants them with increased survival relative to planktonic cells is phenotypic heterogeneity; the division of the biofilm population into functionally distinct subgroups of cells. Phenotypic heterogeneity in biofilms can be traced to the cellular level, however, the molecular structures and elemental distribution across whole biofilms as well as possible linkages between them remain unexplored. Mapping X-ray diffraction (XRD) across intact biofilms in time and space, we revealed the dominant structural features in Bacillus subtilis biofilms, stemming from matrix components, spores and water. By simultaneously following the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) signal of biofilms and isolated matrix components, we discovered that the ECM preferentially binds calcium ions over other metal ions, specifically, zinc, manganese and iron. These ions, remaining free to flow below macroscopic wrinkles that act as water channels, eventually accumulate and lead to sporulation. The possible link between ECM properties, regulation of metal ion distribution and sporulation across whole intact biofilms unravels the importance of molecular-level heterogeneity in shaping biofilm physiology and development.\n\nSignificance StatementBiofilms are multicellular soft microbial communities that are able to colonize synthetic surfaces as well as living organisms. To survive sudden environmental changes and efficiently share their common resources, cells in a biofilm divide into subgroups with distinct functions, leading to phenotypic heterogeneity. Here, by studying intact biofilms by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and fluorescence, we revealed correlations between biofilm macroscopic architectural heterogeneity and the spatio-temporal distribution of extracellular matrix, spores, water and metal ions. Our findings demonstrate that biofilm heterogeneity is not only affected by local genetic expression and cellular differentiation, but also by passive effects resulting from the physicochemical properties of the molecules secreted by the cells, leading to differential distribution of nutrients that propagates through macroscopic length scales.",

    "abstract": "Differential adhesion within cell populations enables the emergence of unique patterns in heterogeneous multicellular systems. This process has been previously explored using synthetically engineered heterogenous multicell spheroid systems, in which cell subpopulations engage in bidirectional intercellular signaling to regulate the expression of different cadherins. While engineered cell systems provide excellent experimental tools to observe pattern formation in cell populations, computational models may be leveraged to more systematically explore the key parameters that drive the emergence of different patterns. We developed and validated two- and three-dimensional agent-based models (ABMs) of spheroid patterning for cells engineered with a bidirectional signaling circuit that regulates N- and P-cadherin expression. The model was used to predict how varying initial cell seedings, cadherin induction probabilities, or homotypic adhesion strengths between cells impact spheroid patterning, and unsupervised machine learning techniques were used to map system parameters to unique spheroid patterns. The model was then deployed to design new synthetic cell signaling circuits based on a desired final multicell pattern.",

    "abstract": "Meromictic Lake Cadagno, an ancient ocean analogue, is known for its permanent stratification and persistent anoxygenic microbial bloom within the chemocline. Although the anaerobic microbial ecology of the lake has been extensively studied for at least 25 years, a comprehensive picture of the microbial food web linking the bacterial layer to phytoplankton and viruses, with explicit measures of primary and secondary production, is still missing. This study sought to better understand the abundances and productivity of microbes in the context of nutrient biogeochemical cycling across the stratified zones of Lake Cadagno. Photosynthetic pigments and chloroplast 16S rRNA gene phylogenies suggested the presence of eukaryotic phytoplankton through the water column. Evidence supported high abundances of Ankyra judayi, a high-alpine adapted chlorophyte, in the oxic mixolimnion where oxygenic-primary production peaked. Through the no- and low-oxygen chemocline and monimolimnion, chlorophytes related to Closteriopsis acicularis, a known genus of meromictic lakes, and Parachlorella kessleri were observed. Chromatium, anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria, dominated the chemocline along with Lentimicrobium, a genus of known fermenters whose abundance was newly reported in Lake Cadagno. Secondary production peaked in the chemocline suggesting primary producers depend on hetrotrophs for nutrient remineralization. As previously observed, sulfur reducing bacteria (SRBs), especially Desulfocapsa and Desulfobulbus, were present in the chemocline and anoxic monimolimnion. Virus-to-microbe ratios (VMR) peaked in the zone of phytoplankton, yet were at a minimum at the peak of Chromatium. These dynamic trends suggest viruses may play a role in the modulation of oxygenic and anoxygenic photo- and chemosynthesis in Lake Cadagno and other permanently stratified systems.\n\nImportanceAs a window to the past, the study offers insights into the role of microbial guilds of Proterozoic ocean chemoclines in the production and recycling of organic matter of sulfur- and ammonia-containing ancient oceans. The new observations described here suggest that eukaryotic algae were persistent in the low oxygen upper-chemocline in association with purple and green sulfur bacteria in the lower half of the chemocline. Further, this study provides the first insights into Lake Cadagno viral ecology. High viral abundances suggested viruses may be essential components of the chemocline where their activity may result in the release and recycling of organic matter. The framework developed in this study through the integration of diverse geochemical and biological data types lays the foundation for future studies to quantitatively resolve the processes performed by discrete populations comprising the microbial loop in this early anoxic ocean analogue.",

    "abstract": "Advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled high-throughput analysis of proteomes in biological systems. The state-of-the-art MS data analysis relies on database search algorithms to quantify proteins by identifying peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), which convert mass spectra to peptide sequences. Different database search algorithms use distinct search strategies and thus may identify unique PSMs. However, no existing approaches can aggregate all user-specified database search algorithms with guaranteed control on the false discovery rate (FDR) and guaranteed increase in the identified peptides. To fill in this gap, we propose a statistical framework, Aggregation of Peptide Identification Results (APIR), that is universally compatible with all database search algorithms. Notably, under a target FDR threshold, APIR is guaranteed to identify at least as many, if not more, peptides as individual database search algorithms do. Evaluation of APIR on a complex protein standard shows that APIR outpowers individual database search algorithms and guarantees the FDR control. Real data studies show that APIR can identify disease-related proteins and post-translational modifications missed by some individual database search algorithms. Note that the APIR framework is easily extendable to aggregating discoveries made by multiple algorithms in other high-throughput biomedical data analysis, e.g., differential gene expression analysis on RNA sequencing data.",

We find that the AlphaFold2 protocol together with optimized multiple sequence alignments, generate models with acceptable quality (DockQ[&ge;]0.23) for 63% of the dimers. From the predicted interfaces we create a simple function to predict the DockQ score which distinguishes acceptable from incorrect models as well as interacting from non-interacting proteins with state-of-art accuracy.

    "abstract": "Assessing the effects of a plant-host shift is important for monitoring insect populations over long time periods and for interventions in a conservation or pest management framework. In a heterogeneous environment, individuals may disperse between sources and sinks in order to persist. Here we propose a single-species two-patch model that aims to capture the generational movement of an insect that exhibits density-dependent dispersal, to see how shifting between hosts could alter its viability and asymptotic dynamics. We then analyse the stability and persistence properties of the model and further validate it using parameter estimates derived from laboratory experiments. In order to evaluate the potential of this model, we applied it to Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae), which has become a harmful pest in several countries around the world. Although many studies have investigated the preference and attractiveness of potential hosts on this invasive drosophilid, no studies thus far have investigated whether a shift of fruit host could affect such a species ecological viability or spatiotemporal persistence. The model results show that a shift in host choice can significantly affect the growth potential and fecundity of a species such as D. suzukii, which ultimately could aid such invasive populations in their ability to persist within a changing environment.",

    "abstract": "Waves of electrical excitation rotating around an obstacle is one of the important mechanisms of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias occurring in the heart damaged by post-infarction scar. Such a scar also has a border zone around it, which has electrophysiological properties different from the rest of normal myocardial tissue. Spatial patterns of wave rotation in the presence of such tissue heterogeneity are poorly studied. In this paper we perform a comprehensive numerical study of various regimes of rotation of a wave in a plane layer of the ventricular tissue around an obstacle surrounded by a gray zone. We use a TP06 cellular ionic model which reproduces the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes in the left ventricle of human heart. We vary the extent of obstacle and gray zone and study the pattern of wave rotation and its period. We observed different regimes of wave rotation that can be subdivided into several classes: (1) functional rotation and (2) scar rotation regimes, which were identified in the previous studies, and new (3) gray zone rotation regime: where the wave instead of rotation around the obstacle, rotates around the gray zone (an area of tissue heterogeneity) itself. For each class, the period of rotation is determined by different factors, which we discuss and quantify. We also found that due to regional pathological remodeling of myocardial tissue, we can obtain additional regimes associated with dynamical instabilities of two types which may affect or not affect the period of rotation.",

    "abstract": "The awn, a needle-like structure extending from the tip of the lemma in grass species, plays a role in environmental adaptation and fitness. In some crops, awns appear to have been eliminated during domestication. Although numerous genes involved in awn development have been identified, several dominant genes that eliminate awns are also known to exist. For example, in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), the dominant awn inhibiting gene has been known since 1921; however, its molecular features remain uncharacterized. In this study, we conducted quantitative trait locus analysis and a genome-wide association study of awn-related traits in sorghum and identified DOMINANT AWN INHIBITOR (DAI), which encodes the ALOG family protein on chromosome 3. DAI appeared to be present in most awnless sorghum cultivars, likely because of its effectiveness. Detailed analysis of the ALOG protein family in cereals revealed that DAI originated from duplication of its twin paralog (DAIori) on chromosome 10. Observations of immature awns in near-isogenic lines revealed that DAI inhibits awn elongation by suppressing both cell proliferation and elongation. We also found that only DAI gained a novel function to inhibit awn elongation through an awn-specific expression pattern distinct from that of DAIori. Interestingly, heterologous expression of DAI with its own promoter in rice inhibited awn elongation in the awned cultivar Kasalath. We found that DAI originated from gene duplication, providing an interesting example of gain-of-function that occurs only in sorghum but shares its functionality with rice and sorghum.",

In bacteria, NSM-based regulatory networks are highly complex, entailing large numbers of enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of active signaling molecules. How the converging input from multiple enzymes is transformed into robust and unambiguous cellular responses has remained unclear. Here we show that Escherichia coli converts dynamic changes of c-di-GMP into discrete binary signaling states, thereby generating heterogeneous populations with either high or low c-di-GMP. This is mediated by an ultrasensitive switch protein, PdeL, which senses the prevailing cellular concentration of the signaling molecule and couples this information to c-di-GMP degradation and transcription feedback boosting its own expression. We demonstrate that PdeL acts as a digital filter that facilitates precise developmental transitions, confers cellular memory, and generates functional heterogeneity in bacterial populations to evade phage predation. Based on our findings, we propose that bacteria apply ultrasensitive regulatory switches to convert dynamic changes of NSMs into binary signaling modes to allow robust decision-making and bet-hedging for improved overall population fitness.",

Although temperature receptors have been identified in different animals, how these receptors respond to temperatures is largely unknown.

The ability/inclination to move varies among these species and at different temperatures. Importantly, different species prefer various ranges of temperatures. While wild-type D. melanogaster flies avoid the warm temperature in the warm avoidance assay and the cool temperature in the cool avoidance assay, D. bipectinata and D. yakuba avoid neither warm nor cool temperatures and D. biarmipes and D. mojavensis do not avoid the warm temperature in the warm avoidance assay. These results demonstrate that Drosophila species have different mobilities and temperature preferences, thereby benefiting the research on molecular mechanisms of temperature responsiveness.\n\nSummary statementThe ability to move and the preference for temperatures vary among fly species when flies are exposed to steep temperature gradients.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord cross-sectional area (CSA) is a relevant biomarker to assess spinal cord atrophy in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the considerable inter-subject variability among healthy participants currently limits its usage. Previous studies explored factors contributing to the variability, yet the normalization models were based on a relatively limited number of participants (typically < 300 participants), required manual intervention, and were not implemented in an open-access comprehensive analysis pipeline. Another limitation is related to the imprecise prediction of the spinal levels when using vertebral levels as a reference; a question never addressed before in the search for a normalization method. In this study we implemented a method to measure CSA automatically from a spatial reference based on the central nervous system (the pontomedullary junction, PMJ), we investigated various factors to explain variability, and we developed normalization strategies on a large cohort (N=804).\n\nCervical spinal cord CSA was computed on T1w MRI scans for 804 participants from the UK Biobank database. In addition to computing cross-sectional at the C2-C3 vertebral disc, it was also measured at 64 mm caudal from the PMJ. The effect of various biological, demographic and anatomical factors was explored by computing Pearsons correlation coefficients. A stepwise linear regression found significant predictors; the coefficients of the best fit model were used to normalize CSA.\n\nThe correlation between CSA measured at C2-C3 and using the PMJ was y = 0.98x + 1.78 (R2 = 0.97). The best normalization model included thalamus volume, brain volume, sex and interaction between brain volume and sex. With this model, the coefficient of variation went down from 10.09% (without normalization) to 8.59%, a reduction of 14.85%.\n\nIn this study we identified factors explaining inter-subject variability of spinal cord CSA over a large cohort of participants, and developed a normalization model to reduce the variability. We implemented an approach, based on the PMJ, to measure CSA to overcome limitations associated with the vertebral reference. This approach warrants further validation, especially in longitudinal cohorts. The PMJ-based method and normalization models are readily available in the Spinal Cord Toolbox.",

    "abstract": "The bone-cartilage unit (BCU) is a universal feature in diarthrodial joints, which is mechanically-graded and subjected to shear and compressive strains. Changes in the BCU have been linked to osteoarthritis progression. Here we report existence of a physiological internal strain gradient (pre-strain) across the BCU at the ultrastructural scale of the extracellular matrix constituents, specifically the collagen fibril. We use X-ray scattering that probes changes in the axial periodicity of fibril-level D-stagger of tropocollagen molecules in the matrix fibrils, as a measure of microscopic pre-strain. We find that mineralized collagen nanofibrils in the calcified plate are in tensile pre-strain relative to the underlying trabecular bone. This behaviour contrasts with the previously accepted notion that fibrillar pre-strain (or D-stagger) in collagenous tissues always reduces with mineralization, via reduced hydration and associated swelling pressure. Within the calcified part of the BCU, a finer-scale gradient in pre-strain (0.6% increase over [~]50m) is observed. The increased fibrillar pre-strain is linked to prior research reporting large tissue-level residual strains under compression. The findings may have biomechanical adaptative significance: higher in-built molecular level resilience/damage resistance to physiological compression, and disruption of the molecular-level pre-strains during remodelling of the BCI may be potential factors in osteoarthritis-based degeneration.",

Clinical applications require contamination-free samples to avoid misleading results and provide a sound basis for diagnosis.\n\nResultsHere we present ContaTester, a tool which requires only allele balance information gathered from a VCF file to detect cross-contamination in germline human DNA samples. Based on a regression model of allele balance distribution, ContaTester allows fast checking of contamination levels for single samples or large cohorts (less than two minutes per sample). We demonstrate the efficiency of ContaTester using experimental validations: ContaTester shows similar results to methods requiring alignment data but with a significantly reduced storage footprint and less computation time. Additionally, for contamination levels above 5%, ContaTester can identify contaminants across a cohort, providing important clues for troubleshooting and quality assessment.\n\nConclusionsContaTester estimates contamination levels from VCF files generated from whole genome sequencing normal sample and provides reliable contaminant identification for cohorts or experimental batches.",

    "abstract": "For many environments, biome-specific microbial gene catalogues are being recovered using shotgun metagenomics followed by assembly and gene-calling on the assembled contigs. The assembly can be conducted either by individually assembling each sample or by co-assembling reads from all the samples. The co-assembly approach can potentially recover genes that display too low abundance to be assembled from individual samples. On the other hand, combining samples increases the risk of mixing data from closely related strains, which can hamper the assembly process. In this respect, assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of (near) identical genes is likely preferable. Thus, both approaches have pros and cons and it remains to be evaluated which assembly strategy is most effective. Here, we have evaluated three assembly strategies for generating gene catalogues from metagenomes using a dataset of 124 samples from the Baltic Sea: 1) assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of the resulting genes, 2) co-assembly on all samples, and 3) mix-assembly, combining individual and co-assembly. The mix-assembly approach resulted in a more extensive non-redundant gene set than the other approaches, and with more genes predicted to be complete and that could be functionally annotated. The mix-assembly consists of 67 million genes (Baltic Sea gene set; BAGS) that have been functionally and taxonomically annotated. The majority of the BAGS genes are dissimilar (<95% amino acid identity) to the Tara Oceans gene dataset, and hence BAGS represents a valuable resource for brackish water research.\n\nIMPORTANCESeveral ecosystem types, such as soils and oceans, are studied through metagenomics. It allows the analysis of genetic material of the microbes within a sample without the need for cultivation. When performing the DNA sequencing with an instrument that generates short sequence reads, these reads need to be assembled in order to obtain more complete gene sequences. In this paper, we have evaluated three strategies for assembling metagenome sequences using a large metagenomic dataset from the Baltic Sea. The method that we call mix-assembly generated the greatest number of non-redundant genes and the largest fraction of genes that were predicted to be complete. The resulting gene catalogue will serve as an important resource for brackish water research. We believe this method to be efficient also for generating gene catalogs for other biomes.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery is generally difficult, expensive, and low success rate. One of the essential steps in the early stages of drug discovery and drug repurposing is identifying drug-target interactions. Binding affinity indicates the strength of drug-target pair interactions. In this regard, several computational methods have been developed to predict the drug-target binding affinity, and the input representation of these models has been shown to be very effective in improving accuracy. Although the recent models predict binding affinity more accurate than the first ones, they need the structure of target proteins. Despite the strong interest in protein structure, there is a massive gap between known sequences and experimentally determined structures. Therefore, finding an appropriate presentation for drug and protein sequences is vital for drug-target binding affinity prediction. In this paper, our primary goal is to assess the drug and protein sequence representation for improving drug-target binding affinity prediction.",

    "abstract": "Receptor-mediated endocytosis is the primary process for nanoparticle uptake in cells and one of the main entry mechanisms for viral infection. The cell membrane adheres to the particle (nanoparticle or virus) and then wraps it to form a vesicle delivered to the cytosol. Previous findings identified a minimum radius for a spherical particle below which endocytosis cannot occur. This is due to the insufficient driving force, from receptor-ligand affinity, to overcome the energy barrier created by membrane bending. In this paper, we extend this result to the case of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is the most common pathway for virus entry. Moreover, we investigate the effect of ligand inhibitors on the particle surface, motivated by viral antibodies, peptides or phage capsids nanoparticles. We determine the necessary conditions for endocytosis by considering the additional energy barrier due to the membrane bending to wrap such inhibiting protrusions. We find that the density and size of inhibitors determine the size range of internalized particles, and endocytosis is completely blocked above critical thresholds. The assembly of a clathrin coat with a spontaneous curvature increases the energy barrier and sets a maximum particle size (in agreement with experimental observations on smooth particles). Our investigation suggests that morphological considerations can inform the optimal design of neutralizing viral antibodies and new strategies for targeted nanomedicine.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution and super-resolution techniques become more frequently used in thick, inhomogeneous samples. In particular for imaging life cells and tissue in which one wishes to observe a biological process at minimal interference and in the natural environment, sample inhomogeneities are unavoidable. Yet sample-inhomogeneities are paralleled by refractive index variations, for example between the cell organelles and the surrounding medium, that will result in the refraction of light, and therefore lead to sample-induced astigmatism. Astigmatism in turn will result in positional inaccuracies of observations that are at the heart of all super-resolution techniques. Here we introduce a simple model and define a figure-of-merit that allows one to quickly assess the importance of astigmatism for a given experimental setting. We found that astigmatism caused by the cells nucleus can easily lead to aberrations up to hundreds of nanometers, well beyond the accuracy of all super-resolution techniques. The astigmatism generated by small objects, like bacteria or vesicles, appear to be small enough to be of any significance in typical super-resolution experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is ubiquitous, with mixtures of PFAS detected in drinking water, food, household dust, and other exposure sources. Animal toxicity studies and human epidemiology indicate that PFAS may act through shared mechanisms including activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  (PPAR). However, the effect of PFAS mixtures on human relevant molecular initiating events remains an important data gap in the PFAS literature. Here, we tested the ability of modeling approaches to predict the effect of diverse PPAR ligands on receptor activity using Cos7 cells transiently transfected with a full length human PPAR (hPPAR) expression construct and a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven luciferase reporter. Cells were treated for 24 hours with two full hPPAR agonists (pemafibrate and GW7647), a full and a partial hPPAR agonist (pemafibrate and mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate), or a full hPPAR agonist and a competitive antagonist (pemafibrate and GW6471). Receptor activity was modeled with three additive approaches: effect summation, relative potency factors (RPF), and generalized concentration addition (GCA). While RPF and GCA accurately predicted activity for mixtures of full hPPAR agonists, only GCA predicted activity for full and partial hPPAR agonists and a full agonist and antagonist. We then generated concentration response curves for seven PFAS, which were well-fit with three-parameter Hill functions. The four perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCA) tended to act as full hPPAR agonists while the three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSA) tended to act as partial agonists that varied in efficacy between 28-67% of the full agonist, positive control level. GCA and RPF performed equally well at predicting the effects of mixtures with three PFCAs, but only GCA predicted experimental activity with mixtures of PFSAs and a mixture of PFCAs and PFSAs at ratios found in the general population. We conclude that of the three approaches, GCA most accurately models the effect of PFAS mixtures on hPPAR activity in vitro.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPerfluorinated carboxylic acids are full human PPAR agonists\nC_LIO_LIPerfluorinated sulfonic acids are partial human PPAR agonists\nC_LIO_LIGCA predicts human PPAR activity for mixtures of full and partial agonists\nC_LIO_LIGCA predicts human PPAR activity for mixtures of agonists and competitive antagonists\nC_LIO_LIGCA accurately predicts human PPAR activity in response to PFAS mixtures\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "IntroductionBased on data that outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction is predicted by final infarct size (IS), reducing IS is of paramount importance. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated a strong infarct-sparing effect of SGLT2 inhibitors - a class of drugs which have proved to be safe and beneficial in patients with heart failure. Repurposing SGLT2 inhibitors for the benefit of patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction should be preceded by investigation of the underlying mechanisms of this infarct limitation. Experimental and clinical data indicate a potential role for autonomic modulation in these mechanisms, specifically sympatho-inhibition. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the parasympathetic mechanism in the infarct-limiting effect of SGLT2 inhibition.\n\nMethodsFortyeight Sprague Dawley male rats were fed with a standard diet containing either the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin or vehicle, for 5-7 days. Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury was initiated by a 40-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by a 2hr period of reperfusion under isoflurane anaesthesia. Bilateral cervical vagotomy was performed 10min prior to myocardial ischaemia. Alternatively, muscarinic receptors were blocked systemically with the non-selective blocker atropine sulphate (2 mg/kg bolus, then 1 mg/kg/h) or the M3-selective blocker 4-DAMP (2 mg/kg bolus).\n\nResultsPre-treatment with ertugliflozin reduced IS in comparison with the vehicle-treated controls (p<0.001). Bilateral vagotomy, atropine sulphate and 4-DAMP all abolished this infarct-limiting effect (IS 35{+/-}10%, 44{+/-}8%, and 35{+/-}4% respectively; P<0.01 vs. Ertu for vagotomy, P<0.001 vs. Ertu for both atropine sulphate and 4-DAMP).\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that the Infarct-limiting effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin, may be mediated via activation of the vagus nerve and M3-cholinoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Many kinds of cellular compartments comprise decision making mechanisms that control growth and shrinkage of the compartment in response to external signals. Key examples include synaptic plasticity mechanisms that regulate the size and strength of synapses in the nervous system. However, when synaptic compartments and postsynaptic densities are small such mechanisms operate in a regime where chemical reactions are discrete and stochastic due to low copy numbers of the species involved. In this regime, fluctuations are large relative to mean concentrations, and inherent discreteness leads to breakdown of mass action kinetics. Understanding how synapses and other small compartments achieve reliable switching in the low copy number limit thus remains a key open problem. We propose a novel self regulating signaling motif that exploits the breakdown of mass action kinetics to generate a reliable size-regulated switch. We demonstrate this in simple two and three-species chemical reaction systems and uncover a key role for inhibitory loops among species in generating switching behavior. This provides an elementary motif that could allow size dependent regulation in more complex reaction pathways and may explain discrepant experimental results on well-studied biochemical pathways.",

While hippocampal neurons provide the basis for a spatial map, prefrontal cortical neurons generalize over environmental features. Whether these generalized representations result from a bidirectional interaction with, or are mainly derived from hippocampal spatial representations is not known. By examining simultaneously recorded hippocampal and medial prefrontal neurons, we observed that prefrontal spatial representations show a delayed coherence with hippocampal ones. We also identified subpopulations of cells in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex that formed functional cross-area couplings; these resembled the optimal connections predicted by a probabilistic model of spatial information transfer and generalization. Moreover, cross-area couplings were strongest and had the shortest delay preceding spatial decision-making. Our results suggest that generalized spatial coding in the medial prefrontal cortex is inherited from spatial representations in the hippocampus, and that the routing of information can change dynamically with behavioral demands.",

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is applicable to the study of cerebral microvasculature in vivo. Optimised acquisition schemes enable the generation of three-dimensional OCT angiograms, i.e., volumetric images of red blood cell flux in capillary networks, currently at a repetition rate of up to 1/10 seconds. This makes testable a new class of hypotheses that strive to bridge the gap between microscopic phenomena occurring at the spatial scale of neurons, and less invasive but crude techniques to measure macroscopic blood flow dynamics. Here we present a method for quantifying the occurrence of transient capillary stalls in OCT angiograms, i.e., events during which blood flow through a capillary branch is temporarily occluded. By making the assumption that information on such events is present predominantly in the imaging plane, we implemented a pipeline that automatically segments a network of interconnected capillaries from the maximum intensity projections (MIP) of a series of 3D angiograms. We then developed tools enabling rapid manual assessment of the binary flow status (open/stalled) of hundreds of capillary segments based on the intensity profile of each segment across time. The entire pipeline is optimized to run on a standard laptop computer, requiring no high-performance, low-availability resources, despite very large data volumes. To further reduce the threshold of adoption, and ultimately to support the development of reproducible research methods in the young field, we provide the documented code for scrutiny and re-use under a permissive open-source license.",

    "abstract": "When presented with two egg-laying substrates, Drosophila lay most of their eggs on the option with higher relative value. How do flies make this relative-value decision? Might the strategy they use allow them to choose the best option even when they experience substrates with a more complex spatiotemporal profile than in canonical two-choice paradigms? We measured Drosophila egg-laying behavior in diverse substrate environments. In all cases, we found that flies dynamically increase or decrease their egg-laying rates as they explore substrates for a deposition site so as to target eggs to the best, recently visited option. Visiting the best option typically led to a strong reduction in egg laying on other substrates for several minutes, with this timescale varying across fly strains. Our data support a model in which flies compare the value of the current substrate with an internally constructed expectation on the value of available options to regulate the likelihood of laying an egg. We show that dopamine-neuron activity is critical for learning and/or expressing this expectation, similar to its role in certain tasks in vertebrates. Integrating sensory experiences over minutes to generate an internal sense of the quality of available options, i.e., forming an expectation, allows flies to use a dynamic reference point for judging the current substrate and might be a general way in which decisions are made, even beyond flies and egg laying.",

    "abstract": "Direct activation of cell-surface receptors is highly desirable for elucidating the physiological roles of receptors. However, subtype-selective ligands are very limited because of the high homology among receptor subtypes. A potential approach for selective activation of a receptor subtype is chemogenetics, in which both point mutagenesis of the receptors and designed ligands are used. However, ligand-binding properties are affected in most current methods. Here, we developed a chemogenetic method for direct activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1), which plays essential roles in cerebellar functions in the brain. Our screening identified a mGlu1 mutant, mGlu1(N264H), that was directly activated by palladium complexes. Notably, a palladium complex showing low cytotoxicity successfully activated mGlu1 in mGlu1(N264H) knock-in mice, revealing that activation of endogenous mGlu1 is sufficient to evoke the critical cellular mechanism of synaptic plasticity, a basis of motor learning in the cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "Powassan viruses (POWVs) are neurovirulent tick-borne flaviviruses emerging in the Northeastern U.S., with a 2% prevalence in Long Island (LI) deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis). POWVs are transmitted in as little as 15 minutes of a tick bite, and enter the CNS to cause encephalitis (10% fatal) and long-term neuronal damage. POWV-LI9 and POWV-LI41 present in LI Ixodes ticks were isolated by directly inoculating VeroE6 cells with tick homogenates and detecting POWV infected cells by immunoperoxidase staining. Inoculated POWV-LI9 and LI41 were exclusively present in infected cell foci, indicative of spread cell to cell, despite growth in liquid culture without an overlay. Cloning and sequencing establish POWV-LI9 as a phylogenetically distinct lineage II POWV strain circulating in LI deer ticks. Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) and pericytes form a neurovascular complex that restricts entry into the CNS. We found that POWV-LI9, -LI41 and Lineage I POWV-LB, productively infect hBMECs and pericytes and that POWVs were basolaterally transmitted from hBMECs to lower chamber pericytes without permeabilizing polarized hBMECs. Synchronous POWV-LI9 infection of hBMECs and pericytes induced proinflammatory chemokines, interferon-{beta} (IFN{beta}) and IFN-stimulated genes, with delayed IFN{beta} secretion by infected pericytes. IFN inhibited POWV infection, but despite IFN secretion a subset of POWV infected hBMECs and pericytes remained persistently infected. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for POWVs (LI9/LI41 and LB) to infect hBMECs, spread basolaterally to pericytes and enter the CNS. hBMEC and pericyte responses to POWV infection suggest a role for immunopathology in POWV neurovirulence and potential therapeutic targets for preventing POWV spread to neuronal compartments.\n\nImportanceWe isolated POWVs from LI deer ticks (I. scapularis) directly in VeroE6 cells and sequencing revealed POWV-LI9 as a distinct lineage II POWV strain. Remarkably, inoculating VeroE6 cells with POWV containing tick homogenates resulted in infected cell foci in liquid culture, consistent with cell to cell spread. POWV-LI9, -LI41, and Lineage I POWV-LB strains infected hBMECs and pericytes that comprise neurovascular complexes. POWVs were nonlytically transmitted basolaterally from infected hBMECs to lower chamber pericytes, suggesting a mechanism for POWV transmission across BBB. POWV-LI9 elicited inflammatory responses from infected hBMEC and pericytes that may contribute to immune cell recruitment and neuropathogenesis. This study reveals a potential mechanism for POWVs to enter the CNS by infecting hBMECs and spreading basolaterally to abluminal pericytes. Our findings reveal that POWV-LI9 persists in cells that form a neurovascular complex spanning the BBB, and suggest potential therapeutic targets for preventing POWV spread to neuronal compartments.",

    "abstract": "We now have a growing understanding that functional short proteins can be translated out of small Open Reading Frames (sORF). Such \"microproteins\" can perform crucial biological tasks and can have considerable phenotypic consequences. However, their size makes them less amenable to genomic analysis, and their evolutionary origins and conservation are poorly understood. Given their short length it is plausible that some of these functional microproteins have recently originated entirely de novo from non-coding sequence. Here we test the possibility that de novo gene birth can produce microproteins that are functional \"out-of-the-box\". We reconstructed the evolutionary origins of human microproteins previously found to have measurable, statistically significant fitness effects. By tracing the appearance of each ORF and its transcriptional activation, we were able to show that, indeed, novel small proteins with significant phenotypic effects have emerged de novo throughout animal evolution, including many after the human-chimpanzee split. We show that traditional methods for assessing the coding potential of such sequences often fall short, due to the high variability present in the alignments and the absence of telltale evolutionary signatures that are not yet measurable. Thus we provide evidence that the functional potential intrinsic to sORFs can be rapidly, and frequently realised through de novo gene birth.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation does not occur in a vacuum: interactions develop over time in social groups that undergo demographic changes. Intuition suggests that stable social environments favour developing few but strong reciprocal relationships (a  focused strategy), while volatile social environments favour the opposite: more but weaker social relationships (a  diversifying strategy). We model reciprocal investments under a quality-quantity tradeoff for social relationships. We find that volatility, counterintuitively, can favour a focused strategy. This result becomes explicable through applying the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy, originally developed for senescence, to social life. Diversifying strategies show superior performance later in life, but with costs paid at young ages while the social network is slowly being built. Under volatile environments, many individuals die before reaching sufficiently old ages to reap the benefits. Social strategies that do well early in life are then favoured: a focused strategy leads individuals to form their first few social bonds quickly and to make strong use of existing bonds. Our model highlights the importance of pleiotropy and population age structure for the evolution of cooperative strategies and other social traits, and shows that it is not sufficient to reflect on the fate of survivors only, when evaluating the benefits of social strategies.",

In metagenomics candidate genomes are usually obtained from a metagenome assembly and a subsequent binning of the assembled contigs. BinChecker provides a novel approach to quality assessment that is based on a fast protein domain search and a clustering approach for identification of marker domain (\"feature\") sets. The feature sets that are used for estimation are not pre-computed for a given database of reference genomes, but are individually found for each bin by adaptive clustering and feature selection. In particular, the adaptivity facilitates the creation and extension of the underlying database, which just requires to add protein feature profiles of reference genomes. Tests with simulated bins indicate that the prediction accuracy of BinChecker meets the current state of the art while providing significant advantages in terms of speed and flexibility.",

Each mitochondrion contains on average less than a full copy of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome. Here, we asked whether mitochondrial dynamics may allow individual mitochondria to  collect a full copy of the mtDNA genome over time, by facilitating exchange between individuals. Akin to trade on a social network, exchange of mtDNA fragments across organelles may lead to the emergence of full  effective genomes in individuals over time. We characterise the collective dynamics of mitochondria in Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl cells using a recent approach combining single-cell timelapse microscopy, video analysis, and network science. We then use a quantitative model to predict the capacity for the sharing and accumulation of genetic information through the networks of encounters between mitochondria. We find that biological encounter networks are strikingly well predisposed to support the collection of full genomes over time, outperforming a range of other networks generated from theory and simulation. Using results from the coupon collectors problem, we show that the upper tail of the degree distribution is a key determinant of an encounter networks performance at this task and discuss how features of mitochondrial dynamics observed in biology facilitate the emergence of full effective genomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDurable treatments that benefit a wide pool of patients remain elusive for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The success of immunotherapy in a subset of NSCLC patients highlights the potential contribution of immune response to anti-tumor immunity while underscoring a need for broadly applicable therapeutic strategies. HDAC inhibitors are a promising class of drugs whose immunomodulatory properties are now being appreciated. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the HDAC6 inhibitor, ACY241 on lung tumor immune compartment with the goal of understanding the scope of its immunomodulatory properties and its therapeutic potential in combination with Oxaliplatin.\n\nMethodsLung adenocarcinoma-bearing mice were treated with ACY241 or vehicle after which the proportions and phenotype of tumor-associated T cells and macrophages were evaluated by comprehensive flow cytometric analysis. Bulk RNA-sequencing was also conducted on both cellular subsets to interrogate the transcriptomic changes associated with ACY241 treatment relative to vehicle controls. In vivo drug efficacy study was performed by administration of ACY241 and/or Oxaliplatin and assessing tumor growth and survival of tumor-bearing mice. Ex vivo functional studies was performed to assess tumor-associated T cell effector function as it correlates with measured outcomes.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that ACY241 promotes increased presence of T and NK cells in the lung tumors of treated mice. The tumor-associated T cells under ACY241 treatment displayed enhanced activation, proliferation, and effector profile. In addition, tumor-associated macrophages exhibited increased expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules while expression of inhibitory ligands were reduced. RNA-sequencing of both tumor-associated T cells and macrophages revealed significant genomic changes in both subsets that is consistent with ACY241-mediated enhancement of immune priming. These broad immunomodulatory properties of ACY241 were associated with significantly enhanced tumor-associated T cell effector functionality, robust anti-tumor response, and significantly prolonged survival of NSCLC-bearing mice when combined with the chemotherapy drug Oxaliplatin.\n\nConclusionCollectively, our studies highlight the broad immunomodulatory effect of ACY241 as a promising HDAC6 inhibitor which coupled with Oxaliplatin promotes robust therapeutic outcomes in a pre-clinical model of NSCLC, providing compelling rationale for the clinical testing of this novel combinatorial regimen in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Human hepatitis D virus (HDV), discovered in 1977, represented the sole known deltavirus for decades. The dependence on hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection and its glycoproteins for infectious particle formation led to the assumption that deltaviruses are human-only pathogens. However, since 2018, several reports have described identification of HDV-like agents from various hosts but without co-infecting hepadnaviruses. Indeed, we demonstrated that Swiss snake colony virus 1 (SwSCV-1) uses arenaviruses as the helper for infectious particle formation, thus shaking the dogmatic alliance with hepadnaviruses for completing deltavirus life cycle. In vitro systems enabling helper virus-independent replication are key for studying the newly discovered deltaviruses. Others and we have successfully used constructs containing multimers of the deltavirus genome for the replication of various deltaviruses via transfection in cell culture. Here, we report the establishment of deltavirus infectious clones with 1.2x genome inserts bearing two copies of the genomic and antigenomic ribozymes. We used SwSCV-1 as the model to compare the ability of the previously reported \"2x genome\" and the \"1.2x genome\" plasmid constructs/infectious clones to initiate replication in cell culture. Using immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, immuno- and northern blotting, we found the 2x and 1.2x genome clones to similarly initiate deltavirus replication in vitro and both induced a persistent infection of snake cells. We hypothesize that duplicating the ribozymes facilitates the cleavage of genome multimers into unit-length pieces during the initial round of replication. The 1.2x genome constructs enable easier introduction of modifications required for studying deltavirus replication and cellular interactions.\n\nIMPORTANCEHepatitis D virus (HDV) is a satellite virus infecting humans with strict association to hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection because HBV glycoproteins can mediate infectious HDV particle formation. For decades, HDV was the sole representative of deltaviruses, which had led to hypotheses suggesting that it evolved in humans, the only known natural host. Recent sequencing studies have led to the discovery of HDV-like sequences across a wide range of species, representing a paradigm shift in deltavirus evolution. Molecular biology tools such as infectious clones, which enable initiation of deltavirus infection without helper virus, are key to demonstrate that the recently found deltaviruses are capable of independent replication. Such tools will enable identification of the potential helper viruses. Here, we report a 1.2x genome copy strategy for designing plasmid-based infectious clones to study deltaviruses and to demonstrate that plasmid delivery into cultured snake cells sufficiently initiates replication of different deltaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscles can regenerate throughout life time from resident Pax7-expressing (Pax7+) muscle stem cells (MuSCs)1-3. Pax7+ MuSCs are normally quiescent and localized at a niche in which they are attached to the extracellular matrix basally and compressed against the myofiber apically3-5. Upon muscle injury, MuSCs lose apical contact with the myofiber and re-enter cell cycle to initiate regeneration. Prior studies on the physical niche of MuSCs focused on basal elasticity6,7, and significance of the apical force exerted on MuSCs remains unaddressed. Here we simulate MuSCs mechanical environment in vivo by applying physical compression to MuSCs apical surface. We demonstrate that compression drives activated MuSCs back to a quiescent stem cell state, even when seeded on different basal elasticities. By mathematical modeling and manipulating cell tension, we conclude that low overall tension combined with high edge tension generated by compression lead to MuSC quiescence. We further show that apical compression results in up-regulation of Notch downstream genes, accompanied by increased levels of nuclear Notch. The compression-induced nuclear Notch is ligand-independent, as it does not require the canonical S2-cleavage of Notch by ADAM10/17. Our results fill the knowledge gap on the role of apical tension for MuSC fate. Implications to how stem cell fate and activity are interlocked with the mechanical integrity of its resident tissue are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The large conformational flexibility of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been a puzzle in structural and pharmacological studies for the past few decades. Apart from structural rearrangements induced by ligands, enzymatic phosphorylations by GPCR kinases (GRKs) at the carboxy-terminal tail (C-tail) of a GPCR also makes conformational alterations to the transmembrane helices and facilitates the binding of one of its transducer proteins named {beta}-arrestin. Phosphorylation-induced conformational transition of the receptor that causes specific binding to {beta}-arrestin but prevents the association of other transducers such as G proteins lacks atomistic understanding and is elusive to experimental studies. Using microseconds of all-atom conventional and Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations, we investigate the allosteric mechanism of phosphorylation induced-conformational changes in {beta}2-adrenergic receptor, a well-characterized GPCR model system. Free energy profiles reveal that the phosphorylated receptor samples a new conformational state in addition to the canonical active state corroborating with recent nuclear magnetic resonance experimental findings. The new state has a smaller intracellular cavity that is likely to accommodate {beta}-arrestin better than G protein. Using contact map and inter-residue interaction energy calculations, we found the phosphorylated C-tail adheres to the cytosolic surface of the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Transfer entropy calculations show that the C-tail residues drive the correlated motions of TM residues, and the allosteric signal is relayed via several residues at the cytosolic surface. Our results also illustrate how the redistribution of inter-residue nonbonding interaction couples with the allosteric communication from the phosphorylated C-tail to the transmembrane. Atomistic insight into phosphorylation-induced {beta}-arrestin specific conformation is therapeutically important to design drugs with higher efficacy and fewer side effects. Our results therefore open novel opportunities to fine-tune {beta}-arrestin bias in GPCR signaling.",

    "abstract": "We present an extension of the Monte Carlo based mesoscopic membrane model, where the membrane is represented as a dynamically triangulated surface and the proteins are modeled as anisotropic inclusions formulated as in-plane nematic field variables adhering to the deformable elastic sheet. In the extended model, we have augmented the Hamiltonian to study membrane deformation due to a mixture of multiple types of curvature generating proteins. This feature opens the door for understanding how multiple kinds of curvature-generating proteins may be working in a coordinated manner to induce desired membrane morphologies. For example, among other things, we study membrane deformations and tubulation due to a mixture of positive and negative curvature proteins as mimics of various proteins from BAR domain family. We also study the effect membrane anisotropy, which manifest as membrane localization and differential binding affinity of a given curvature protein, leading to insights into the tightly regulated cargo sorting and transport processes. Our simulation results show different morphology of deformed vesicles that depend on the curvatures and number of the participating proteins as well as on the protein-protein and membrane-proteins interactions.\n\nSignificanceMembrane remodeling requires highly orchestrated interactions between several types of lipids and curvature proteins. Experimentally probing the membrane deformation intermediates is non-trivial. For example, it is not known exactly how two or more different kinds of BAR domain proteins work in concert to induce and stabilize certain membrane curvatures. In this work, we use mesoscopic continuum modeling and explore the factors that induce and stabilize a range of membrane deformation due to a mixture of positive and negative curvature proteins.",

    "abstract": "KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human lung adenocarcinomas (hLUAD) and activating mutations in KRAS frequently co-occur with loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor genes, TP53 or STK11/LKB1. However, mutation of all three genes is rarely observed in hLUAD, even though engineered mutations of all three genes produces a highly aggressive lung adenocarcinoma in mice (mLUAD). Here we provide an explanation of this difference between hLUAD and mLUAD by uncovering an evolutionary divergence in regulation of the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI1). Using KRAS/TP53 mutant hLUAD cell lines, we show that TPI1 enzymatic activity can be altered via phosphorylation at Ser21 by the Salt Inducible Kinases (SIKs) in an LKB1-dependent manner; this allows modulation of glycolytic flux between completion of glycolysis and production of glycerol lipids. This metabolic flexibility appears to be critical in rapidly growing cells with KRAS and TP53 mutations, explaining why loss of LKB1 creates a metabolic liability in these tumors. In mice, the amino acid at position 21 of TPI1 is a Cys residue which can be oxidized to alter TPI1 activity, allowing regulation of glycolytic flux balance without a need for SIK kinases or LKB1. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for TPI1 in metabolic reprogramming and suggest that LKB1 and SIK family kinases are potential targets for treating KRAS/TP53 mutant hLUAD. Our data also provide a cautionary example of the limits of genetically engineered murine models as tools to study human diseases such as cancers.",

    "abstract": "Cells maintain homeostatic telomere length, and this homeostatic disruption leads to various types of diseases. Presently, it is not clear how telomeres achieve homeostasis. One of the prevailing hypotheses is a protein-counting model with a built-in sensor mechanism that counts proteins that directly regulate the telomeric length. However, it does not explain telomere length regulation at the mechanistic level. Here, we present a mathematical model based on the underlying molecular mechanisms of length regulation needed to establish telomere length homeostasis in yeast. We perform both deterministic and stochastic simulations to validate the models with the experimental data of Teixeira et al., rate-balance plot, and phase plane analysis to understand the nature of dynamics exhibited by the models. For global analysis, we constructed bifurcation diagrams. The model explains the role of negative and positive feedback loops and a delay between telomerase and telomere-bound proteins, leading to oscillations in telomere length. We map these in-silico results to Teixeiras proposition of telomeres making a transition between extendible and non-extendible states.",

    "abstract": "In the avian auditory brain stem, acoustic timing and intensity cues are processed in separate, parallel pathways via the two division of the cochlear nucleus, nucleus angularis (NA) and nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Differences in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic properties, such as release probability and short-term plasticity, contribute to differential processing of the auditory nerve inputs. We investigated the distribution of synaptotagmin, a putative calcium sensor for exocytosis, via immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence in the embryonic and hatchling chick brain stem (Gallus gallus). We found that the two major isoforms, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2), showed differential expression. In the NM, anti-Syt2 label was strong and resembled the endbulb terminals of the auditory nerve inputs, while anti-Syt1 label was weaker and more punctate. In NA, both isoforms were intensely expressed throughout the neuropil. A third isoform, synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), was largely absent from the cochlear nuclei. In nucleus laminaris (NL, the target nucleus of NM), anti-Syt2 and anti-Syt7 strongly labeled the dendritic lamina. These patterns were established by embryonic day 18 and persisted to postnatal day 7. Double labeling immunofluorescence showed Syt1 and Syt2 were associated with Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 (VGluT2), but not Vesicular GABA Transporter (VGAT), suggesting these Syt isoforms were localized to excitatory, but not inhibitory, terminals. These results suggest that Syt2 is the major calcium binding protein underlying excitatory neurotransmission in the timing pathway comprising NM and NL, while Syt2 and Syt1 regulate excitatory transmission in the parallel intensity pathway via cochlear nucleus NA.",

To explore the impact of chronically reduced sleep, we conducted unbiased metabolomics on heads from three Drosophila short-sleeping mutants. Common features included elevated ornithine and polyamines; and lipid, acyl-carnitine, and TCA cycle changes suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Biochemical studies of overall, circulating, and excreted nitrogen in sleep mutants demonstrate a specific defect in eliminating nitrogen, suggesting that elevated polyamines may function as a nitrogen sink. Both supplementing polyamines and inhibiting their synthesis with RNAi regulated sleep in control flies. Finally, both polyamine-supplemented food and high-protein feeding were highly toxic to sleep mutants, suggesting their altered nitrogen metabolism is maladaptive. Together, our results suggest polyamine accumulation specifically, and nitrogen stress in general, as potential mechanisms linking chronic sleep loss to adverse health outcomes.",

However, because the Atx2 protein contains multiple separable activities, deeper understanding requires experiments to address the exact mechanisms by which Atx2 modulates neurodegeneration (ND) progression. Recent work on two ALS models, C9ORF72 and FUS, in Drosophila has shown that a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (cIDR) of Atx2 protein, required for assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, is essential for the progression of neurodegenerative phenotypes as well as for accumulation of protein inclusions associated with these ALS models. Here we show that the Atx2-cIDR also similarly contributes to the progression of degenerative phenotypes and accumulation of Huntingtin protein aggregates in Drosophila models of HD. Because Huntingtin is not an established component of RNP granules, these observations support a recently hypothesised, unexpected protein-handling function for RNP granules, which could contribute to the progression of Huntingtons disease and, potentially, other proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "The paraventricular nucleus (PVT) of the midline thalamus is a critical higher-order cortico-thalamo-cortical integration site that plays a critical role in various behaviors including reward seeking, cue saliency, and emotional memory. Anatomical studies have shown that PVT projects to both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC). However, dual mPFC-HC projecting neurons which could serve a role in synchronizing mPFC and HC activity during PVT-dependent behaviors, have not been explored. Here we used a dual retrograde adenoassociated virus (AAV) tracing approach to characterize the location and proportion of different projection populations that send collaterals to mPFC and/or ventral hippocampus (vHC). Additionally, we examined the distribution of calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) with respect to these projection populations PVT. We found that PVT contains separate populations of cells that project to mPFC, vHC, and those that innervate both regions. Interestingly, dual mPFC-HC projecting cells expressed neither CR or CB. Topographically, mPFC- and vHC-projecting CB+ and CR+ cells clustered around dual projecting neurons in PVT. These results are consistent with the features of dual mPFC-vHC projecting cells in the nucleus reuniens (RE) and suggestive of a functional mPFC-PVT-vHC system that may support mPFC-vHC interactions in PVT-dependent behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Inducible Cre recombinase facilitates temporal control of genetic recombination in numerous transgenic model systems, a feature which has made it a popular tool for studies of adult neurogenesis. One of the most common forms of inducible Cre, CreERT2, requires activation by the synthetic estrogen tamoxifen (TAM) to initiate recombination of LoxP-flanked sequences. To date, most studies deliver TAM via intraperitoneal injection. But the introduction of TAM-infused commercial chows has recently expanded the possible modes of TAM delivery. Despite the widespread use of TAM-inducible genetic models in adult neurogenesis research, the comparative efficiency and off-target effects of TAM administration protocols is surprisingly infrequently studied. Here we compare a standard, 5 day TAM injection regimen with voluntary consumption of TAM-infused chow. First, we used adult NestinCreERT2;Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-EYFP reporter mice to show that 2 weeks of TAM chow and 5 days of injections led to LoxP recombination in a similar phenotypic population of neural stem and progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus. However, TAM chow resulted in substantially less overall recombination than injections. TAM administration also altered adult neurogenesis, but in different ways depending on administration route: TAM injection disrupted neural progenitor cell proliferation 3 weeks after TAM, whereas TAM chow increased neuronal differentiation of cells generated during the diet period. These findings provide guidance for selection of TAM administration route and appropriate controls in adult neurogenesis studies using TAM-inducible Cre mice. They also highlight the need for better understanding of off-target effects of TAM in other neurological processes and organ systems.",

    "abstract": "Animal models of disease are valuable resources for investigating pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. However, for complex disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD), the generation and availability of innumerous distinct animal models present unique challenges to AD researchers and hinder the success of useful therapies. Here, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD across its lifespan to better inform the field of the various pathologies that appear at specific ages, and comment on drift that has occurred in the development of pathology in this line since its development 20 years ago. This modern characterization of the 3xTg-AD model includes an assessment of impairments in behavior, cognition, and long-term potentiation followed by quantification of amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaque burden and neurofibrillary tau tangles, biochemical levels of A{beta} and tau protein, and neuropathological markers such as gliosis and accumulation of dystrophic neurites. We also present a novel comparison of the 3xTg-AD model with the 5xFAD model using the same deep-phenotyping characterization pipeline. The results from these analyses are freely available via the AD Knowledge Portal (https://admodelexplorer.synapse.org). Our work demonstrates the utility of a characterization pipeline that generates robust and standardized information relevant to investigating and comparing disease etiologies of current and future models of AD.\n\nContribution to the Field StatementAlzheimers Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory impairments and affects more than 30 million individuals worldwide. Using animal models of AD, researchers have elucidated disease progression and hallmark pathologies that may underpin the memory impairments seen in patients. However, therapeutic targets have failed to translate successfully from animal studies to human clinical trials, prompting a reassessment of the development, use, and interpretation of data acquired using the innumerous AD animal models available to researchers. To address these shortcomings, we have developed a robust and reproducible modern characterization of pathologies within current and future animal models of AD to better assess distinct pathologies that arise at specific brain regions and ages of different models. Using the popular 3xTg-AD mouse, we demonstrate the utility of these deep-phenotyping analyses and highlight the drift that affected development of pathologies in this line over the past two decades. Utilizing this same systematic characterization, we also perform a direct comparison with 5xFAD mice, another popular animal model of AD. The robust and standardized data generated from these systematic deep-phenotyping analyses are available for broad use by the AD research community to assess, compare, and determine appropriate animal models of AD.",

We observed a continuous increase in COMT promotor DNA methylation which correlated with higher saliva cortisol levels and was still detectable one week later.

Inhibiting PDHK reverses NLRP3 inflammasome-induced metabolic reprogramming, enhances autophagy, promotes mitochondrial fusion over fission, preserves cristae ultrastructure, and attenuates mitochondrial ROS production. The suppressive effect of PDHK inhibition on the NLRP3 inflammasome is independent of its canonical role as a pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator. We suggest that PDHK inhibition improves mitochondrial fitness by reversing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in acutely inflamed macrophages.",

With the increasing global warming, industrialization there is a great effect on climate change which requires us to see various alternatives for strains that are more tolerant to heat so that some techniques are developed to filter a large number of genotypes for high temperature tolerance. Here we report the standardization of Temperature Induction Response (TIR) technique to identify thermotolerant rice genotypes. The phenotypic characteristics of Rice due to high temperature is calculated with germination (%), growth of the seedling and molecular analysis is also considered. The heat stress is provided to the plants with the help of TIR protocol with the adjustment of temperature to lethal (55{degrees}C) and sub-lethal levels (38-55{degrees}C) in a TIR chamber with alterations in humidity. Of the 74 genotypes screened, 14 showed thermo tolerance caused by high temperatures. Both tolerant and sensitive genotypes were separated based on their survival percentages. The tolerant class are selected based on the growth and development of genotypes having high survival percentage and also their shoot and root lengths, fresh and dry weights are compared to the heat tolerant checks N22, Dular and Nipponbare. These genotypes have intrinsic heat tolerance and thus can be explored as a source of donors in breeding programs intended for global warming. The molecular markers which are identified to be linked with heat tolerant class through allele code are quite helpful and can be used in marker assisted breeding approach to attain heat tolerance in cultivated varieties.",

    "abstract": "To understand how functional traits shape ecological communities it is necessary to understand both how traits across the community affect its functioning and how eco-evolutionary dynamics within the community change the traits over time. Of particular interest are so-called evolutionarily stable communities (ESCs), since these are the end points of eco-evolutionary dynamics and can persist over long time scales. One theoretical framework that has successfully been used for assembling ESCs is adaptive dynamics. However, this framework cannot account for intraspecific variation-- neither locally nor across structured populations. On the other hand, in moment-based approaches, intraspecific variation is accommodated, but community assembly has been neglected. This is unfortunate as some questions regarding for example local adaptation vis-a-vis diversification into multiple species requires both facets. In this paper we develop a general theoretical framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. We showcase how ESCs can be assembled using the framework, and illustrate various aspects of the framework using two simple models of resource competition. We believe this unifying framework could be of great use to address questions regarding the role of functional traits in communities where population structure, intraspecific variation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics are all important.",

    "abstract": "Fish often spawn eggs with ovarian fluids that have been hypothesized to support sperm of some males over others (cryptic female choice). Alternatively, sperm reactions to ovarian fluids could reveal male strategies linked to their likely roles during spawning. Sperm of males who would usually be close to females during spawning are then expected to be better adapted to the presence of ovarian fluids than to water only, while the reverse would be expected for males that typically spawn at larger distance to the females. We tested these predictions with gametes and ovarian fluids from wild-caught lake char (Salvelinus umbla). We found that sperm of more colorful males showed increased sperm velocity in diluted ovarian fluids while sperm of paler males were fastest in water only. We then let equal numbers of sperm compete for fertilizations in the presence or absence of ovarian fluids and used microsatellite markers to assign in total 1,464 embryos (from 70 experimental trials) to their fathers. Overall, sperm of more colorful males reached higher fertilization success than sperm of pale males. This difference was enhanced by the presence of ovarian fluids and best explained by the increased sperm velocity. Sperm competitiveness was not enhanced with decreasing genetic distance to a given female, although parallel stress tests on embryos had revealed that females would profit more from mating with least related males rather than most colored ones. We conclude that sperm of more colorful males are best adapted to ovarian fluids, and that the observed reaction norms reveal male strategies rather than cryptic female choice.",

    "abstract": "The widespread evolution of tube-like anthers releasing pollen from apical pores is associated with buzz pollination, in which bees vibrate flowers to remove pollen. The mechanical connection among anthers in buzz-pollinated species varies from loosely held conformations, to anthers tightly held together with trichomes or bio-adhesives forming a functionally joined conical structure (anther cone). Joined anther cones in buzz-pollinated species have evolved independently across plant families and via different genetic mechanisms, yet their functional significance remains mostly untested. We used experimental manipulations to compare vibrational and functional (pollen release) consequences of joined anther cones in three buzz-pollinated species of Solanum (Solanaceae). We applied bee-like vibrations to focal anthers in flowers with (\"joined\") and without (\"free\") experimentally created joined anther cones, and characterised vibrations transmitted to other anthers and the amount of pollen released. We found that joined anther architectures cause non-focal anthers to vibrate at higher amplitudes than free architectures. Moreover, in the two species with naturally loosely held anthers, anther fusion increases pollen release, while in the species with a free but naturally compact architecture it does not. We discuss hypotheses for the adaptive significance of the convergent evolution of joined anther cones.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDermal fibrosis occurs in many human diseases, particularly systemic sclerosis (SSc) where persistent inflammation leads to collagen deposition and fiber formation in skin and multiple organs. The family of protein kinase D (PKD) has been linked to inflammatory responses in various pathological conditions, however, its role in inflammation-induced dermal fibrosis has not been well defined. Here, using a murine fibrosis model that gives rise to dermal lesions similar to those in SSc, we investigated the role of PKD in dermal fibrosis in mice lacking PKD2 activity.\n\nMethodsHomozygous kinase-dead PKD2 knock-in mice (PKD2SSAA/SSAA-KI) were obtained through intercrossing mice heterozygous for PKD2S707A/S711A (PKD2SSAA). The wild-type and KI mice were subjected to repeated subcutaneous injection of bleomycin (BLM) to induce dermal inflammation and fibrosis. As controls, mice were injected with PBS. At the end of the experiment, mouse skin at the injection site was dissected, stained, and analyzed for morphological changes and expression of inflammatory and fibrotic markers. PKD-regulated signaling pathways were examined by real-time RT-qPCR and Western blotting. In a separate experiment, BLM-treated mice were administered with or without a PKD inhibitor, CRT0066101 (CRT). The effects of CRT on dermal fibrosis were analyzed similarly. The identity of the PKD expressing cells were probed using myeloid lineage markers CD45, CD68 in BLM-treated mouse tissues.\n\nResultsDermal thickness and collagen fibers of kinase-dead PKD2-KI mice were significantly reduced in response to BLM treatment as compared to the wild-type mice. These mice also exhibited reduced -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and collagen expression. At molecular levels, both transforming growth factor {beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNAs were decreased in the KI mice treated with BLM as compared to those in the wild-type mice. Similarly, CRT significantly blocked BLM-induced dermal fibrosis and inhibited the expression of -SMA, collagen, and IL-6 expression. Further analysis indicated that PKD2 was mainly expressed in CD45+/CD68+ myeloid cells that could be recruited to the lesional sites to promote the fibrotic process of the skin in response to BLM.\n\nConclusionsKnock-in of the kinase-dead PKD2 or inhibition of PKD activity in mice protected against BLM-induced dermal fibrosis by reducing dermis thickness and expression of fibrotic biomarkers including -SMA, collagen, and inflammatory/fibrotic mediators including TGF-{beta}1 and IL-6. PKD2 does this potentially through modulating the recruitment and function of myeloid cells in skin of BLM-treated mice. Overall, our study demonstrated a potential critical role of PKD catalytic activity in inflammation-induced dermal fibrosis.",

Significantly lower SOD activities occurred in the 400 mg/kg group compared to that in the control group. Higher dietary Cr6+ exposure (400 and 800 mg Cr6+ /kg dry weight) did not negatively alter the CAT activities, but significantly inhibited CAT activities in 100 mg/kg group, compared to control group. ACP activities in groups 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg were significantly lower than those in control group, while no significant differences occurred in AKP activities among groups.

    "abstract": "The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem shows early signs of protein pathologies in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. As the LCs small size (approximately 2.5 mm in width) presents a challenge for molecular imaging, the past decade has seen a steep rise in structural and functional Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies aiming to characterise the LCs changes in ageing and neurodegeneration. However, given its position in the brainstem and small volume, great care must be taken to yield methodologically reliable MR results as spatial deviations in transformations can greatly reduce the statistical power of the analyses at the group level. Here, we suggest a spatial transformation procedure and a set of quality assessment methods which allow LC researchers to achieve the spatial precision necessary for investigating this small but potentially impactful brain structure.\n\nUsing a combination of available toolboxes (SPM12, ANTs, FSL, FreeSurfer), individual structural and functional 3T LC scans are transformed into MNI space via a study-specific anatomical template. Following this, the precision of spatial alignment in individual MNI-transformed images is quantified using in-plane distance measures based on slice-specific centroids of structural LC segmentations and based on landmarks of salient anatomical features in mean functional images, respectively.\n\nMedian in-plane distance of all landmarks on the transformed structural as well as functional LC imaging data were below 2 mm, thereby falling below the typical LC width of 2.5 mm suggested by post-mortem data.\n\nWith the set of spatial post-processing steps outlined in this paper and available for download, we hope to give readers interested in LC imaging a starting point for a reliable analysis of structural and functional MR data of the LC and to have also taken a first step towards establishing reporting standards of LC imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Somatic missense mutations in histone genes turn these essential proteins into oncohistones, which can drive oncogenesis. Understanding how missense mutations alter histone function is challenging in mammals as mutations occur in a single histone gene. For example, described oncohistone mutations predominantly occur in the histone H3.3 gene, despite the human genome encoding 15 H3 genes. To understand how oncogenic histone missense mutations alter histone function, we leveraged the budding yeast model, which contains only two H3 genes, to explore the functional consequences of oncohistones H3K36M, H3G34W, H3G34L, H3G34R, and H3G34V. Analysis of cells that express each of these variants as the sole copy of H3 reveals that H3K36 mutants show different drug sensitivities compared to H3G34 mutants. This finding suggests that changes to proximal amino acids in the H3 N-terminal tail alter distinct biological pathways. We exploited the caffeine sensitive growth of H3K36 mutant cells to perform a high copy suppressor screen. This screen identified genes linked to histone function and transcriptional regulation, including Esa1, a histone H4/H2A acetyltransferase; Tos4, a forkhead-associated domain-containing gene expression regulator; Pho92, an N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein and Sgv1/Bur1, a cyclin-dependent kinase. We show that the Esa1 lysine acetyltransferase activity is critical for suppression of the caffeine sensitive growth of H3K36R mutant cells while the previously characterized binding interactions of Tos4 and Pho92 are not required for suppression. This screen identifies pathways that could be altered by oncohistone mutations and highlights the value of yeast genetics to identify pathways altered by such mutations.",

    "abstract": "The inability to detect early degenerative changes to the articular cartilage surface that commonly precede bulk osteoarthritic degradation is an obstacle to early disease detection for research or clinical diagnosis. Leveraging a known artifact that blurs tissue boundaries in clinical arthrograms, contrast agent diffusivity can be derived from computed tomography arthrography (CTa) scans. We combined experimental and computational approaches to study protocol variations that may alter the CTa-derived apparent diffusivity. In experimental studies on bovine cartilage explants, we examined how contrast agent dilution and transport direction (absorption vs. desorption) influence the apparent diffusivity of untreated and enzymatically digested cartilage. Using multiphysics simulations, we examined mechanisms underlying experimental observations and the effects of image resolution, scan interval and early scan termination. The apparent diffusivity during absorption decreased with increasing contrast agent concentration by an amount similar to the increase induced by tissue digestion. Models indicated that osmotically induced fluid efflux strongly contributed to the concentration effect. Simulated changes to spatial resolution, scan spacing and total scan time all influenced the apparent diffusivity, indicating the importance of consistent protocols. With careful control of imaging protocols and interpretations guided by transport models, CTa-derived diffusivity offers promise as a biomarker for early degenerative changes.",

Outcomes remain poor despite multimodality treatment. MRTs are among the most genomically stable cancers and lack therapeutically targetable genetic mutations. We utilized metaVIPER, an extension of the Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon (VIPER) algorithm, to computationally infer activated druggable proteins in the tumor of an eight month old patient and then expanded the analysis to TCGA and TARGET cohorts. In vitro studies were performed on a panel of MRT and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor cell lines. Two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of MRT were used for in vivo efficacy studies. MetaVIPER analysis from the patients tumor identified significantly high inferred activity of nuclear export protein Exportin-1 (XPO1). Expanded metaVIPER analysis of TCGA and TARGET cohorts revealed consistent elevations in XPO1 inferred activity in MRTs compared to other cancer types. All MRT cell lines demonstrated baseline activation of XPO1. MRT cell lines demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to the XPO1 inhibitor, selinexor which led to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Targeted inhibition of XPO1 in patient-derived xenograft models of MRT using selinexor resulted in abrogation of tumor growth. Selinexor demonstrates efficacy in preclinical models of MRT. These results support investigation of selinexor in a phase II study in children with MRT and illustrate the importance of an N-of-1 approach in driving discovery beyond the single patient.\n\nStatement of Translational RelevanceWe describe the patient-driven discovery of XPO1 activation as a non-genetically encoded vulnerability in MRTs. The application of metaVIPER analysis to tumors lacking actionable oncogenic alterations represents a novel approach for identifying potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers of response. Our preclinical validation of selinexor confirms XPO1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MRT.",
