    "abstract": "Reduced-dimension or spatial in situ scatter plots are widely employed in bioinformatics papers analyzing single-cell data to present phenomena or cell-conditions of interest in cell groups. When displaying these cell groups, color is frequently the only graphical cue used to differentiate them. However, as the complexity of the information presented in these visualizations increases, the usefulness of color as the only visual cue declines, especially for the sizable readership with color-vision deficiencies (CVDs). In this paper, we present scatterHatch, an R package that creates easily interpretable scatter plots by redundant coding of cell groups using colors as well as patterns. We give examples to demonstrate how the scatterHatch plots are more accessible than simple scatter plots when simulated for various types of CVDs.",

    "abstract": "The acidic luminal pH of lysosomes, maintained within a narrow range, is essential for proper degrative function of the organelle and is generated by the action of a V-type H+ ATPase, but other pathways for ion movement are required to dissipate the voltage generated by this process. ClC-7, a Cl-/H+ antiporter responsible for lysosomal Cl- permeability, is a candidate to contribute to the acidification process as part of this \"counterion pathway\". The signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2 modulates lysosomal dynamics, including by regulating lysosomal ion channels, raising the possibility that it could contribute to lysosomal pH regulation. Here we demonstrate that depleting PI(3,5)P2 by inhibiting the PIKfyve kinase causes lysosomal hyperacidification, primarily via an effect on ClC-7. We further show that PI(3,5)P2 directly inhibits ClC-7 transport and that this inhibition is eliminated in a disease-causing gain-of-function ClC-7 mutation. Together these observations suggest an intimate role for ClC-7 in lysosomal pH regulation.",

    "abstract": "A small population of self-renewing stem cells initiate tumors and maintain therapeutic resistance in glioblastoma. Given the limited treatment options and dismal prognosis for this disease there is urgent need to identify drivers of stem cells that could be druggable targets. Previous work showed that the endosomal pH regulator NHE9 is upregulated in glioblastoma and correlates with worse survival prognosis. Here, we probed for aberrant signaling pathways in patient-derived glioblastoma cells and found that NHE9 increases cell surface expression and phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases by promoting their escape from lysosomal degradation. Downstream of NHE9-mediated receptor activation, oncogenic signaling pathways converged on the JAK2-STAT3 transduction axis to induce pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog and suppress markers of glial differentiation. We used both genetic and chemical approaches to query the role of endosomal pH in glioblastoma phenotypes. Loss-of-function mutations in NHE9 that failed to alkalinize endosomal lumen did not increase self-renewal capacity of gliomaspheres in vitro. However, monensin, a chemical mimetic of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, and the H+ pump inhibitor bafilomycin bypassed NHE9 to directly alkalinize the endosomal lumen resulting in stabilization of receptor tyrosine kinases and induction of Oct4 and Nanog. Using orthotopic models of primary glioblastoma cells we found that NHE9 increased tumor initiation in vivo. We propose that NHE9 initiates inside-out signaling from the endosomal lumen, distinct from the established effects of cytoplasmic and extracellular pH on tumorigenesis. Endosomal pH may be an attractive therapeutic target that diminishes stemness in glioblastoma, agnostic of specific receptor subtype.\n\nSignificanceA well-known hallmark of cancer is excessive acidification of tumor microenvironment, caused by upregulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity on the cancer cell membrane. However, the role of organellar pH in tumor biology has not been established. This study identifies a mechanistic link between upregulation of the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE9 and stemness properties in glioblastoma, the most malignant and common brain tumor in adults. By increasing pH of the recycling endosome, NHE9 exerts a broad effect on post-translational stability and activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to increased stem cell-like properties of self-renewal and tumor initiation in glioblastoma models. Our findings suggest that targeting NHE9 or endosomal pH could be an effective strategy for receptor agnostic glioblastoma treatment.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal complaints in autism are common and impact the quality of life of affected individuals, yet the underlying mechanisms are understudied. We have found that individuals with mutations in CHD8 present with gastrointestinal disturbances. We have shown that loss of chd8, the sole ortholog of CHD8 in zebrafish, leads to reduced number of enteric neurons and decreased intestinal mobility. However, it remains unclear how chd8 acts during the development of the enteric nervous system and whether CHD8-associated gastrointestinal complaints are solely due to impaired neuronal function in the intestine. Here, utilizing a stable chd8 mutant zebrafish model, we found that the loss of chd8 leads to reduced number of vagal neural crest cells (NCCs), enteric neural progenitors, emigrating from the neural tube and their early migration capability was altered. At later stages, although the intestinal colonization by the NCCs was complete, we found decreased numbers of both NCC-derived serotonergic neurons and serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, suggesting an intestinal hyposerotonemia in absence of chd8. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed altered expression of key receptors and enzymes in serotonin and acetylcholine signaling pathways. Next, tissue examination of chd8 mutants revealed thinner intestinal epithelium accompanied by accumulation of neutrophils and decreased numbers of goblet cells and eosinophils. Last, single-cell sequencing of whole mid- and posterior intestines showed a global disruption of the immune balance with perturbed expression of inflammatory interleukins and changes in immune cell clusters. Our findings propose a causal developmental link between chd8, NCC development, intestinal homeostasis, and autism-associated gastrointestinal complaints.",

    "abstract": "Historical contingency, such as the order of species arrival, can modify competitive outcomes via niche modification or preemption. However, how these mechanisms ultimately modify stabilising niche and average fitness differences remains largely unknown. By experimentally assembling two congeneric spider mite species feeding on tomato plants during two generations, we show that order of arrival affects species competitive ability and changes the outcome of competition. Contrary to expectations, order of arrival did not cause positive frequency dependent priority effects. Instead, coexistence was predicted when the inferior competitor (Tetranychus urticae) arrived first. In that case, T. urticae colonised the preferred feeding stratum (leaves) of T. evansi leading to spatial niche preemption, which equalised fitness and reduced niche differences, driving community assembly to a close-to-neutrality scenario. Our study demonstrates how the order of species arrival and the spatial context of competitive interactions can jointly determine whether species can coexist.",

Shrub encroachment is considered an effect of these changes, but its still unclear how this effect is mediated by environmental heterogeneity. Our goal is to determine which environmental factors shape the fine-scale spatial distribution and temporal trends of alpine dwarf shrub.\n\nLocationThree sites in the Central Apennine, Italy.\n\nMethodsWe used a comprehensive set of environmental factors across a broad temporal span to model, at a fine-scale, both (1) the current spatial distribution and (2) the change in shrub cover over the past 60 years.\n\nResultsOur results show that dwarf shrubs have generally increased in our study sites over the past 60 years, yet their distribution is strongly shaped by the joint influence of the fine-scale topography, productivity, land use and micro-climate. In particular, shrubs have been locally favored in areas with harsher alpine environmental constraints and stronger resource limitation. Instead, contrary to expectations, at this fine scale, warmer temperatures and the decline in grazing have not favored shrub encroachment.\n\nConclusionDwarf shrubs appear as a stress-tolerant, pioneer vegetation that is currently distributed mainly over areas that are otherwise sparsely vegetated. It appears that shrubs exhibit poor competitive ability to invade grasslands and, though they have increased overall, they remain restricted to the least productive areas. Fine-scale environmental heterogeneity may strongly influence future responses of dwarf shrubs in changing alpine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The gonadotoxic effects of some cancers significantly increase the risk of developing infertility and cessation of ovary hormones (premature ovarian insufficiency, POI). Fertility preservation in the form of ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) is offered to pediatric and adolescent cancer patients who cannot undergo oocyte retrieval and egg cryopreservation. The cryopreserved ovarian tissue can be transplanted back and has been found to restore fertility in 20 - 40% of transplants and restore hormone function for an average of 3 to 5 years. However, some individuals have primary or metastatic disease within their ovarian tissue and would not be able to transplant it back in its native form. Therefore, there is a need for additional methods for hormone and fertility restoration that would support a safe transplant with increased successful livebirths and long-term hormone restoration. To support these goal, we sought to understand the contribution of the ovarian microenvironment to its physical and biochemical properties to inform bioprosthetic ovary scaffolds that would support isolated follicles. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we determined that the bovine ovarian cortex was significantly more rigid than the medulla. To determine if this difference in rigidity was maintained in isolated matrisome proteins from bovine ovarian compartments, we cast and 3D printed hydrogels created from decellularized bovine ovarian cortex and medulla slices. The cast gels and 3D printed bioprosthetic ovary scaffolds from the cortex was still significantly more rigid than the medulla biomaterials. To expand our bioengineering toolbox that will aide in the investigation of how biochemical and physical cues may affect folliculogenesis, we sought to confirm the concentration of matrisome proteins in bovine ovarian compartments. The matrisome proteins, COL1, FN, EMILIN1 and AGRN were more abundant in the bovine ovarian cortex than the medulla. Whereas, VTN was more abundant in the medulla than the cortex and COL4 was present in similar amounts within both compartments. Finally, we removed proteins of interest, EMILIN1 and AGRN, from decellularized bovine ovarian cortex materials and confirmed that this specifically depleted these proteins without affecting the rigidity of cast or 3D printed hydrogels. Taken together our results indicate the existence of a rigidity gradient in the bovine ovary, that this rigidity gradient is maintained in resulting engineered materials strongly implicating a role for matrisome proteins in contributing to the physical properties of the bovine ovary. By establishing additional engineering tools we will continue to explore mechanisms behind matrisome-follicle interactions.",

    "abstract": "In the general framework of the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), a hierarchical clustering algorithm is commonly used to module definition. However, hierarchical clustering depends strongly on the topological overlap measure. In other words, this algorithm may assign two genes with low topological overlap to different modules even though their expression patterns are similar. Here, a novel gene module clustering algorithm for WGCNA is proposed. We develop a gene module clustering network (gmcNet), which simultaneously addresses single-level expression and topological overlap measure. The proposed gmcNet includes a \"co-expression pattern recognizer\" (CEPR) and \"module classifier\". The CEPR incorporates expression features of single genes into the topological features of co-expressed ones. Given this CEPR-embedded feature, the module classifier computes module assignment probabilities. We validated gmcNet performance using 4,976 genes from 20 native Korean cattle. We observed that the CEPR generates more robust features than single-level expression or topological overlap measure. Given the CEPR-embedded feature, gmcNet achieved the best performance in terms of modularity (0.261) and the differentially expressed signal (27.739) compared with other clustering methods tested. Furthermore, gmcNet detected some interesting biological functionalities for carcass weight, backfat thickness, intramuscular fat, and beef tenderness of Korean native cattle. Therefore, gmcNet is a useful framework for WGCNA module clustering.\n\nAuthor summaryA graph neural network is a good alternative algorithm for WGCNA module clustering. Even though the graph-based learning methods have been widely applied in bioinformatics, most studies on WGCNA did not use graph neural network for module clustering. In addition, existing methods depend on topological overlap measure of gene pairs. This can degrade similarity of expression not only between modules, but also within module. On the other hand, the proposed gmcNet, which works similar to message-passing operation of graph neural network, simultaneously addresses single-level expression and topological overlap measure. We observed the higher performance of gmcNet comparing to existing methods for WGCNA module clustering. To adopt gmcNet as clustering algorithm of WGCNA, it remains future research issues to add noise filtering and optimal k search on gmcNet. This further research will extend our proposed method to be a useful module clustering algorithm in WGCNA. Furthermore, our findings will be of interest to computational biologists since the studies using graph neural networks to WGCNA are still rare.",

    "abstract": "Entamoeba histolytica is a disease-causing parasitic amoeba which affects an estimated 50 million people worldwide, particularly in socioeconomically vulnerable populations experiencing water sanitation issues. Infection with E. histolytica is referred to as amoebiasis, and can cause symptoms such as colitis, dysentery, and even death in extreme cases. Drugs exist that are capable of killing this parasite, but they are hampered by downsides such as significant adverse effects at therapeutic concentrations, issues with patient compliance, the need for additional drugs to kill the transmissible cyst stage, and potential development of resistance. Past screens of small and medium sized chemical libraries have yielded anti-amoebic candidates, thus rendering high-throughput screening a promising direction for new drug discovery in this area. In this study, we screened a curated 80,000-compound library from Janssen pharmaceuticals against E. histolytica trophozoites in vitro, and from it identified a highly potent new inhibitor compound. Further experimentation confirmed the activity of this compound, as well as that of several structurally related compounds, originating from both the Janssen Jump-stARter library, and from chemical vendors, thus highlighting a new structure-activity relationship (SAR). In addition, we confirmed that the compound inhibited E. histolytica survival as rapidly as the current standard of care and inhibited transmissible cysts of the related model organism Entamoeba invadens. Together these results constitute the discovery of a novel class of chemicals with favorable in vitro pharmacological properties which may lead to an improved therapy against this parasite and in all of its life stages.\n\nAuthor summaryThe parasite Entamoeba histolytica represents a significant challenge in the field of global health. It currently infects and causes disease among millions of people worldwide, particularly those lacking access to clean water. Drugs exist to treat this disease, but nevertheless it persists as a problem, likely at least partly due to problems and downsides inherent to these drugs. Hence the search for new and better ones is needed. We report here our contribution to this search, consisting of testing a large, carefully-curated collection of tens of thousands of chemicals for their ability to kill E. histolytica. This large-scale test resulted in the identification of one of the compounds as potently anti-amoebic, capable of killing the parasite cells at extremely low concentrations. Further experimentation found several chemically-related compounds to also possess this property, and additionally found the first compound capable of killing the infective life stage of another Entamoeba parasite. These results have revealed an entire new family of chemicals with good potential for development as better drugs against this disease.",

    "abstract": "A modern person constantly changes the environment of his mental activity, moving real into an immersive environment, for example, from the surrounding reality to the information environment of a smartphone and back. This kind of transition is needed to satisfy many of the cognitive and emotional needs of people. The transition from a real physical environment to virtual reality (VR) with the help of a special headset, for example, the Oculus Rift or HTC vive, occurs less often, causing less frequent emotional state. If at the same time the emotional state of a person is investigated, then, as a rule, the manifestation of heart rate variability (HRV) is used as an indicator. However, there are relatively few studies in the literature on physiological responses using HRV during the perception of VR content. The results of such studies are extrapolated to data evoked in HRV manifestations by stimuli of real and virtual environments. We studied HRV in 55 participants while they were in the flow of VR content of different dynamics. The results were analyzed by statistically testing the hypothesis of the effect of VR immersion and the effect of transitions between realities on HRV manifestations, as well as the effect of VR flow dynamics on HRV. The results showed that the perception of the VR flow and the content transitions made in it determine the change in HRV in the form of such parameters as LF and the Baevsky Index, which can be considered as markers of immersion in VR. An increase in emotional arousal with sequential participation in virtual games in one virtual stream determines the manifestations of HRV - HR, Moda and PAR.\n\nThe results contribute to understanding the possibilities of using VR technology to recognize emotions during the transition between the natural environment and VR, as well as to determine the level of emotional arousal when immersed in the changing flow of virtual content. These studies are important for the study of the psychology of emotions in the VR flow paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Hepatobiliary cancers (HBCs) are the most aggressive and sixth most diagnosed cancers globally. Biomarkers for timely diagnosis and targeted therapy in HBCs are still limited. Considering the gap, our objective is to identify unique and overlapping molecular signatures associated with HBCs. We analyzed publicly available transcriptomic datasets on Gallbladder cancer (GBC), Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) to identify potential biomarkers using integrative systems approaches. An effective Common and Unique Molecular Signature Identification (CUMSI) approach has been developed, which contains analysis of differential gene expression (DEG), gene co-expression networks (GCN), and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) networks. Functional analysis of the DEGs unique for GBC, HCC, and ICC indicated that GBC is associated with cellular processes, HCC is associated with immune signaling pathways, and ICC is associated with lipid metabolic pathways. Our findings shows that the hub genes and pathways identified for each individual cancer type of the HBS are related with the primary function of each organ and each cancer exhibit unique expression patterns despite being part of the same organ system.",

Crus I and II and Lobules V and VI were our cerebellar seeds of interest. We characterized reproductive stage using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria. Results show that postmenopausal females have lower cerebello-striatal and cerebello-cortical connectivity, particularly in frontal regions, along with lower connectivity within the cerebellum, compared to reproductive females. Postmenopausal females also exhibit greater connectivity in some brain areas as well. Differences begin to emerge across transitional stages of menopause.

    "abstract": "Sexual assault and rape are crimes that impact victims worldwide. Although the psychosocial and eco-evolutionary factors associated with this antisocial behavior have repeatedly been studied, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unknown mainly due to the lack of an appropriate animal model of sexual aggression (SxA). Here, we established a novel paradigm to provoke and subsequently assess SxA in adult male Wistar rats: the sexual aggression test (SxAT). Briefly, male Wistar rats are sexually aroused by a receptive female, which is exchanged by a non-receptive female immediately after the first intromission. This protocol elicits forced mounting (FM) and aggressive behavior (AB) towards the non-receptive female to different degrees, which can be scored. In a series of experiments we can show that SxA behavior is a relatively stable trait in rats and correlates positively with sexual motivation. Rats with innate abnormal anxiety and aggressive behavior also show abnormal SxA behavior. In addition, central infusion of oxytocin moderately inhibits AB, but increases FM. Finally, we identified the agranular insular cortex to be specifically activated by SxA, and inhibition of this region mildly decreased AB during the SxAT.\n\nAltogether, the SxAT is a paradigm that can be readily implemented in behavioral laboratories as a valuable tool to find answers regarding the biological mechanisms underlying SxA in humans, as well as social decision-making in general.",

Because microglia are activated by retinal damage, we investigated their role during regeneration following acute or chronic damage. At three weeks-post-fertilization (wpf), fish exhibiting NMDA-induced acute damage or cone photoreceptor-specific chronic degeneration, the gold rush (gosh) mutant, displayed reactive microglia and Muller glia proliferation. Retinas treated to inhibit the immune response lacked reactive microglia and possessed fewer PCNA-positive cells, while LPS treatment increased microglia and PCNA-labeled cells. NMDA-injured retinas upregulated the expression of il-1{beta} and tnf- pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, followed by increased expression of il-10 and arg1 anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine genes. An early and transiently TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia population was identified in the NMDA-damaged retina. In contrast, gosh mutant retinas exhibited a mild increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression concurrently with a greater increased in anti-inflammatory/remodeling cytokine gene expression. Few TNF- pro-inflammatory microglia were observed in the gosh retina. How inflammation regulates regeneration in zebrafish would provide important clues towards improving the therapeutic strategies for repairing injured mammalian tissues.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial electrode stimulation (tES), one of the techniques used to apply non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), modulates cortical activities by delivering weak electric currents through scalp-attached electrodes. This emerging technique has gained increasing attention recently; however, the results of tES vary greatly depending upon subjects and the stimulation paradigm, and its cellular mechanism remains uncertain. In particular, there is a controversy over the factors that determine the cortical response to tES. Some studies have reported that the electric fields (EF) orientation is the determining factor, while others have demonstrated that the EF magnitude itself is the crucial factor. In this work, we conducted an in-depth investigation of cortical activity in two types of electrode montages used widely--the conventional (C)-tES and high-definition (HD)-tES--as well as two stimulation waveforms--direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). To do so, we constructed a multi-scale model by coupling an anatomically realistic human head model and morphologically realistic multi-compartmental models of three types of cortical neurons (layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron, layer 4 basket cell, layer 5 pyramidal neuron). Then, we quantified the neuronal response to the C-/HD-tDCS/tACS and explored the relation between the electric field (EF) and the radial fields (RF: radial component of EF) magnitude and the cortical neurons threshold. The EF tES induced depended upon the electrode montage, and the neuronal responses were correlated with the EF rather than the RFs magnitude. The electrode montages and stimulation waveforms caused a small difference in threshold, but the higher correlation between the EFs magnitude and the threshold was consistent. Further, we observed that the neurons morphological features affected the degree of the correlation highly. Thus, the EF magnitude was a key factor in the responses of neurons with arborized axons. Our results demonstrate that the crucial factor in neuronal excitability depends upon the neuron models morphological and biophysical properties. Hence, to predict the cellular targets of NIBS precisely, it is necessary to adopt more advanced neuron models that mimic realistic morphological and biophysical features of actual human cells.",

    "abstract": "For many diseases, including cancer, viral infections such as COVID-19, bacterial infections, and auto-immune diseases, the immune response is a major determinant of progression, response to therapy, and clinical outcome. Innate and adaptive immune response are controlled by coordinated activity of multiple immune cell types. The functional activity state of immune cells is determined by cellular signal transduction pathways (STPs). A novel mRNA-based signaling pathway assay platform has been developed to quantitatively measure relevant STP activities in all types of immune cells and mixed immune cell samples for experimental and diagnostic purposes. We generated a STP activity profile, termed Immune-Pathway Activity Profile (I-PAP), for a variety of immune cell types in resting and activated state, and provide a first example for use in patient samples.\n\nMethodsThe technology to measure STP activity has been described for androgen and estrogen receptor, PI3K, MAPK, TGF{beta}, Notch, NF{kappa}B, JAK-STAT1/2, and JAK-STAT3 pathways. STP activity was measured on Affymetrix expression microarray data from preclinical studies containing public data from different types of immune cells, resting/naive or immune-activated in vitro, to establish I-PAPs. Subsequently data from a clinical study on rheumatoid arthritis were analyzed.\n\nResultsI-PAPs of naive/resting and immune-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, T helper cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells were established and in agreement with known experimental immunobiology. In whole blood samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients TGF{beta} pathway activity was increased; JAK-STAT3 pathway activity was selectively increased in female patients. In naive CD4+ Tregs TGF{beta} pathway activity was increased, while in memory T effector cells JAK-STAT3 pathway activity tended to increase, suggesting that these immune cell types contributed to whole blood analysis results.\n\nConclusionSTP assay technology (currently being converted to qPCR-based assays) makes it possible to directly measure functional activity of cells of the innate and adaptive immune response enabling quantitative assessment of the immune response of an individual patient. Envisioned utility lies in (1) prediction and monitoring of response to immunomodulatory treatments for a variety of immune-mediated diseases, including RA; (2) uncovering novel treatment targets; (3) improvement and standardization of in vitro immunology research and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone mediates suites of physical and behavioral traits across vertebrates, and circulation varies considerably across and within taxa. However, an understanding of the causal factors of variation in circulating testosterone has proven difficult despite decades of research. According to the challenge hypothesis, agonistic interactions between males immediately prior to the breeding season produce the highest levels of testosterone measured during this period. While many studies have provided support for this hypothesis, most species do not respond to male-male competition by elevating testosterone. As a result, a recent revision of the hypothesis ( challenge hypothesis 2.0) places male-female interactions as the primary cause of rapid elevations in testosterone circulation in male vertebrates. Here, we offer a test of both iterations of the challenge hypothesis in a tropical bird species. We first illustrate that male White-shouldered Fairywrens (Malurus alboscapulatus) differ by subspecies in plasma testosterone concentrations. Then we use a social network approach to find that males of the subspecies with higher testosterone are characterized by greater social interaction scores, including more time aggregating to perform sexual displays. Next, we use a controlled experiment to test whether males respond to simulated territorial intrusion or courtship interaction contexts by elevating testosterone. Males sampled during courtship had greater plasma testosterone both relative to flushed controls and males sampled during simulated intrusion. Ultimately, our results are consistent with challenge hypothesis 2.0, as males rapidly elevated testosterone following interactions with females, but not during territorial challenges.",

Viral macrodomains are critical for replication and virus-induced pathogenesis; therefore, these enzymes are a promising target for antiviral therapy. However, no potent or selective viral macrodomain inhibitors currently exist, in part due to the lack of a high-throughput assay for this class of enzymes. Here, we developed a high-throughput ADP-ribosylhydrolase assay using the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain Mac1. We performed a pilot screen which identified dasatinib and dihydralazine as ADP-ribosylhydrolase inhibitors. Importantly, dasatinib does not inhibit MacroD2, the closest Mac1 homolog in humans. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying selective inhibitors based on ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity, paving the way for screening large compound libraries to identify improved macrodomain inhibitors and explore their potential as antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and future viral threats.",

    "abstract": "Human vision is sensitive enough to detect a single photon, but the minimal exposure required to extract meaning from stimulation - arguably the visual systems function - remains unknown. This requirement cannot be characterised in terms of stimulus energy, because the system is differentially sensitive to attributes that are distinguished by stimulus configuration rather than physical amplitude. Observers can extract large amounts of information from brief displays; but for given display durations, certain types of information are discerned more readily than others, suggesting that visual pathways prioritise certain stimulus properties. Determining the minimal exposure durations required for processing various aspects of a visual stimulus can thus shed light on the systems priorities. Technical limitations have so far prevented measurement of such minima; here, we used a novel technique enabling arbitrarily brief displays with microsecond-level precision to establish the minimal durations required for processing human faces, a stimulus category whose perception is associated with several well-characterised behavioural and neural markers. We found that neural and psychophysical measures converged to reveal a sequence of distinct minimal exposures required for object-level detection (1-2 ms), face-specific processing (3-4 ms), and emotion-specific processing (4-5 ms). Our findings resolve debates about factors that may facilitate processing: Face orientation affected minimal exposure, but emotional expression did not. Awareness emerged with detection; we found no evidence of subliminal perception. These findings critically inform theories of visual processing and awareness by elucidating the information to which the visual system is attuned.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile, an intestinal pathogen and leading cause of nosocomial infection, exhibits extensive phenotypic heterogeneity through phase variation by site-specific recombination. The signal transduction system CmrRST, which encodes two response regulators (CmrR and CmrT) and a sensor kinase (CmrS), impacts C. difficile cell and colony morphology, surface and swimming motility, biofilm formation, and virulence in an animal model. CmrRST is subject to phase variation through site-specific recombination and reversible inversion of the  cmr switch, and expression of cmrRST is also regulated by c-di-GMP through a riboswitch. The goal of this study was to determine how the cmr switch and c-di-GMP work together to regulate cmrRST expression. We generated \"phase locked\" strains by mutating key residues in the right inverted repeat flanking the cmr switch. Phenotypic characterization of these phase locked cmr-ON and -OFF strains demonstrates that they cannot switch between rough and smooth colony morphologies, respectively, or other CmrRST-associated phenotypes. Manipulation of c-di-GMP levels in these mutants showed that c-di-GMP promotes cmrRST expression and associated phenotypes independent of cmr switch orientation. We identified multiple promoters controlling cmrRST transcription, including one within the ON orientation of cmr switch and another that is positively autoregulated by CmrR. Overall, this work reveals a complex regulatory network that governs cmrRST expression and a unique intersection of phase variation and c-di-GMP signaling. These findings suggest that multiple environmental signals impact the production of this signaling transduction system.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile is a leading cause of hospital-acquired intestinal infections in the U.S. The CmrRST signal transduction system controls numerous physiological traits and processes in C. difficile, including cell and colony morphology, motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. Here we define the complex, multi-level regulation of cmrRST expression, including stochastic control through phase variation, modulation by the second messenger c-di-GMP, and positive autoregulation by CmrR. The results of this study suggest that multiple, distinct environmental stimuli and selective pressures must be integrated to appropriately control cmrRST expression.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a ubiquitous bacterium and one of the most prevalent Gram-negative species associated with drug resistant infections. The large number of sequenced genomes available have provided us with a consistently growing knowledge base to further understand pathogenesis and epidemiology of this organism. However, data from sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) are underrepresented in global sequencing efforts and E. coli genetic diversity from this region is poorly described. To reduce this gap, we investigated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli colonising adults in Blantyre, Malawi to assess the bacterial diversity and AMR determinants and to place these isolates in the context of the wider population structure. We performed short-read whole-genome sequencing of 473 colonising ESBL E. coli isolated from human stool and contextualised the genomes with a previously curated multi-country species wide collection of 10,146 genomes. The most frequently identified sequence types (STs) in our collection were the globally successful ST131, ST410 and ST167, and the dominant ESBL genes were blaCTX-M, mirroring global trends. However, 37% of Malawian isolates did not cluster with any isolates in the curated multicountry collection and a core gene phylogeny was consistent with locally spreading subclades within globally dominant clones, including in ST410 and ST167. We also found Carbapenemase genes in our collection at low frequency; we used long read sequencing to characterise selected ESBL and carbapenemase-associated plasmids, demonstrating the presence of globally distributed carbapenemase carrying plasmids. Increased genomic surveillance of E. coli from Malawi and sSA is necessary to understand local, regional and global transmission of both E. coli and the AMR genes they commonly carry.\n\nImpact StatementDrug-resistant Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) or carbapenemase enzymes have been identified by the World Health Organisation as priority pathogens of global concern, and whole genome sequencing has provided insight into mechanisms of virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and the spread of high-risk clones. However, studies analysing large numbers of E. coli using whole-genome data often focus on opportunistic use of hospital diagnostic collections in high-income settings. Understanding how the genomic epidemiology of E. coli in low- and middle-income countries (including many of the nations of sub-Saharan Africa) differs is essential to provide insight into local, and global drivers of transmission. We therefore sequenced 473 ESBL-producing E. coli genomes colonising adults in Blantyre, Malawi. We analyse determinants of antimicrobial resistance and virulence and place the isolates in wider context using a previously published global E. coli collection that was generated to represent the whole species diversity of sequences publicly available at the time of generation. We find that there is diversity in Malawian isolates not reflected in the curated global collection: widely successful antimicrobial-resistance associated E. coli sequence types are represented in Blantyre, but locally circulating subclades are apparent. Furthermore, given the high number of ESBL producing pathogens causing infections there is an unmet need for carbapenem antimicrobials which are still active against ESBL-producers but are not yet widely available in our setting. We find that carbapenemases (enzymes that can render bacteria resistant to carbapenems) in our collection are unusual but present and carried on globally disseminated plasmids. So too are globally successful, stably carbapenemase-associated E. coli lineages. Although the Malawian isolates analysed typically lacked carbapenemases, carbapenem use is increasing in Malawi and their unstewarded use will accelerate selection for carbapememases in E. coli in the future. Our study highlights the need for robust stewardship protocols and ongoing genomic surveillance as these agents are introduced.\n\nData SummaryAll data and code to replicate this analysis are available as the blantyreESBL v1.3 R package (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5554081) available at https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL.

    "abstract": "The type six secretion system (T6SS) is a prevalent bacterial weapon delivering toxic effector proteins into nearby competitors. In addition to immunity genes that protect against a particular effector, alternate yet crucial nonspecific defences have also recently been identified. To systematically identify genes influencing T6SS susceptibility in numerous species, we designed a Tn-Seq-based competition assay. Combined with follow-up analyses using E. coli and V. cholerae gene knockout collections, we demonstrate that our Tn-Seq competition technique can be used to identify both immunity and non-immunity defences against the T6SS. We also identify E. coli proteins that facilitate T6SS-mediated cell death, including metabolic genes such as cyaA and gltA, where mutant strains were resistant to attack. Our findings act as a proof-of-concept for the technique while also illuminating novel genes of interest. Since Tn-Seq can be applied in numerous species, our method has broad potential for identifying diverse T6SS defence genes across genomes in a high-throughput manner.\n\nImportanceThe type six secretion system (T6SS) is a molecular poison-tipped spear that bacteria use to kill nearby competitors. To prevent self killing, they use antitoxins called immunity genes that specifically neutralize the poisons. Beyond immunity genes, multiple additional defences have recently been discovered but there are likely many more across the genomes of diverse species. To help discover these novel mechanisms, we designed a high-throughput method that can be used in numerous different species to rapidly identify genes involved in sensitivity to T6SS attacks. Using T6SS  killers delivering individual poisons and two commonly studied  prey bacteria, we show proof-of-principle that the technique can discover proteins that make the prey cells more resistant or sensitive to particular poisons. This will greatly improve the speed at which genes influencing the T6SS can be identified and selected for further study in follow-up analyses.",

    "abstract": "Reductive dehalogenases (RDases) are a family of redox enzymes that are required for anaerobic organohalide respiration, a microbial process that is useful in bioremediation. Structural and mechanistic studies of these enzymes have been greatly impeded due to challenges in RDase heterologous expression, primarily because of their cobamide-dependence. There have been a few successful attempts at RDase production in unconventional heterologous hosts, but a robust method has yet to be developed. In this work we outline a novel respiratory RDase expression system using Escherichia coli as the host. The overexpression of E. colis cobamide transport system, btu, and RDase expression under anaerobic conditions were established to be essential for the expression of active RDases from Dehalobacter - an obligate organohalide respiring bacterium. The expression system was validated on six RDase enzymes with amino acid sequence identities ranging from >30-95%. Dehalogenation activity was verified for each RDase by assaying cell-free extracts of small-scale expression cultures on various chlorinated substrates including chloroalkanes, chloroethenes, and hexachlorocyclohexanes. Two RDases, TmrA from Dehalobacter sp. UNSWDHB and HchA from Dehalobacter sp. HCH1, were purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Incorporation of both the cobamide and iron-sulfur cluster cofactors was verified, and the specific activity of TmrA was found to be consistent with that of the native enzyme. The heterologous expression of respiratory RDases, particularly from obligate organohalide respiring bacteria, has been extremely challenging and unreliable. Here we present a relatively straightforward E. coli expression system that has performed well for a variety of Dehalobacter spp. RDases.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding microbial reductive dehalogenation is important to refine the global halogen cycle and to improve bioremediation of halogenated contaminants; however, studies of the family of enzymes responsible are limited. Characterization of reductive dehalogenase enzymes has largely eluded researchers due to the lack of a reliable and high-yielding production method. We are presenting an approach to express reductive dehalogenase enzymes from Dehalobacter, a key group of organisms used in bioremediation, in E. coli. This expression system will propel the study of reductive dehalogenases by facilitating their production and isolation, allowing researchers to pursue more in-depth questions about the activity and structure of these enzymes. This platform will also provide a starting point to improve the expression of reductive dehalogenases from many other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms dominate life in cryospheric ecosystems. In glacier-fed streams (GFSs), ecological windows of opportunities allow complex microbial biofilms to develop and transiently form the basis of the food web, thereby controlling key ecosystem processes. Here, using high-resolution metagenomics, we unravel strategies that allow biofilms to seize this opportunity in an ecosystem otherwise characterized by harsh environmental conditions. We found a diverse microbiome spanning the entire tree of life and including a rich virome. Various and co-existing energy acquisition pathways point to diverse niches and the simultaneous exploitation of available resources, likely fostering the establishment of complex biofilms in GFSs during windows of opportunity. The wide occurrence of rhodopsins across metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), besides chlorophyll, highlights the role of solar energy capture in these biofilms. Concomitantly, internal carbon and nutrient cycling between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs may help overcome constraints imposed by the high oligotrophy in GFSs. MAGs also revealed mechanisms potentially protecting bacteria against low temperatures and high UV-radiation. The selective pressure of the GFS environment is further highlighted by the phylogenomic analysis, differentiating the representatives of the genus Polaromonas, an important component of the GFS microbiome, from those found in other ecosystems. Our findings reveal key genomic underpinnings of adaptive traits that contribute to the success of complex biofilms to exploit environmental opportunities in GFSs, now rapidly changing owing to global warming.",

    "abstract": "Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are common bacterial contractile injection systems that inject toxic \"effector\" proteins into neighboring cells. Effector discovery is generally done manually, and computational approaches used for effector discovery depend on genetic linkage to T6SS genes and/or sequence similarity to known effectors. We bioinformatically investigated T6SS in more than 11,832 genomes of Gram negative bacteria. We found that T6SS encoding bacteria are host-associated and pathogenic, enriched in specific human and plant tissues, while depleted in marine, soil, and engineered environments. Analysis of T6SS cores with C-terminal domains (\"evolved\" cores) showed \"evolved\" HCP are rare, overwhelmingly encoded in orphan operons, and are largely restricted to Escherichia. Using the wealth of data generated from our bioinformatic analysis, we developed two algorithms for large-scale discovery of T6SS effector proteins (T6Es). We experimentally validated ten putative antibacterial T6SS effector proteins and one cognate immunity gene from a diverse species. This study provides a systematic genomic perspective of the role of the T6SS in nature, a thorough analysis of T6E evolution and genomic properties, and discovery of a large number of candidate T6Es using new approaches.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation requires large amounts of energy in the form of ATP and low potential electrons to overcome the high activation barrier for cleavage of the dinitrogen triple bond. The model aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Azotobacter vinelandii, generates low potential electrons in the form of reduced ferredoxin (Fd) and flavodoxin (Fld) using two distinct mechanisms via the enzyme complexes Rnf and Fix. Both Rnf and Fix are expressed during nitrogen fixation, and deleting either rnf1 or fix genes has little effect on diazotrophic growth. However, deleting both rnf1 and fix eliminates the ability to grow diazotrophically. Rnf and Fix both use NADH as a source of electrons, but overcoming the energetics of NADHs endergonic reduction of Fd/Fld is accomplished through different mechanisms. Rnf harnesses free energy from the proton motive force, whereas Fix uses electron bifurcation to effectively couple the endergonic reduction of Fd/Fld to the exergonic reduction of quinone. Different stoichiometries and gene expression analyses indicate specific roles for the two reactions under different conditions. In this work, complementary physiological studies and thermodynamic modeling reveal how Rnf and Fix simultaneously balance redox homeostasis in various conditions. Specifically, the Fix complex is required for efficient growth under low oxygen concentrations, while Rnf sustains homeostasis and delivers sufficient reduced Fd to nitrogenase under standard conditions. This work provides a framework for understanding how the production of low potential electrons sustains robust nitrogen fixation in various conditions.\n\nImportanceThe availability of fixed nitrogen is critical for life in many ecosystems, from hot springs to agriculture. Due to the energy demands of biological nitrogen fixation, organisms must tailor their metabolism during diazotrophic growth to deliver energy requirements to nitrogenase in the form of ATP and low potential electrons. Therefore, a complete understanding of diazotrophic energy metabolism and redox homeostasis is required to understand the impact on ecological communities or to promote crop growth in agriculture through engineered diazotrophs.",

    "abstract": "Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is associated with a deficiency of skin lipids, increased populations of Staphylococcus aureus in the microbiome, and structural defects in the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of human skin. However, the pathogenesis of AD is ambiguous as it is unclear whether observed changes are the result of AD or contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous studies have shown that S. aureus is capable of permeating across isolated human SC tissue when lipids are depleted to levels consistent with AD conditions. In this study, we expand upon this discovery to determine the mechanisms of bacterial penetration into the SC barrier. Specifically, we establish whether bacteria are permeating intercellularly, between corneocytes, or employing a combination pathway of both inter- and intra-cellular travel. The mechanical implications of bacterial invasion, lipid depletion, and media immersion are also evaluated using a newly developed, physiologically relevant, temperature-controlled drip chamber. Results reveal that S. aureus can be internalized by corneocytes, indicating transcellular movement through the tissue during permeation, consistent with previous theoretical models. S. aureus also degrades the mechanical integrity of human SC, particularly when the tissue is partially depleted of lipids. These observed mechanical changes are likely the cause of broken or ruptured tissue seen as exudative lesions in AD flares. This work further highlights the necessity of lipids in skin microbial barrier function.\n\nImportanceMillions of people suffer from the chronic inflammatory skin disease Atopic Dermatitis (AD), whose symptoms are associated with a deficiency of skin lipids that exhibit antimicrobial functions, and increased populations of the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, the pathogenesis of AD is ambiguous, and it remains unclear if these observed changes are merely the result of AD, or contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. In this article, we demonstrate the necessity of skin lipids in preventing S. aureus from penetrating the outermost barrier of human skin thereby causing a degradation in tissue integrity. In terms of AD, this bacterial permeation into the viable epidermis could act as an inflammatory trigger of the disease and could also explain tissue fragility and lesion formation seen with AD patients. Moreover, bacterial induced degradation could lead to increased pathways and further allergen intervention creating chronic irritation.",

    "abstract": "Sebaceous glands are adnexal structures, which critically contribute to skin homeostasis and the establishment of a functional epidermal barrier. Sebocytes, the main cell population found within the sebaceous glands, are highly specialized lipid-producing cells. Sebaceous gland-resembling tissue structures are also found in male rodents in form of preputial glands. Similar to sebaceous glands, they are composed of lipid-specialized sebocytes. Due to a lack of adequate organ culture models for skin sebaceous glands and the fact that preputial glands are much larger and easier to handle, previous studies have used preputial glands as a model for skin sebaceous glands. Here, we compared both types of sebocytes, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach, to unravel potential similarities and differences between the two sebocyte populations. In spite of common gene expression patterns due to general lipid-producing properties, we found significant differences in the expression levels of genes encoding enzymes involved in the biogenesis of specialized lipid classes. Specifically, genes critically involved in the mevalonate pathway, including squalene synthase, as well as the sphingolipid salvage pathway, such as ceramide synthase, (acid) sphingomyelinase or acid and alkaline ceramidases, were significantly less expressed by preputial gland sebocytes. Together, our data revealed tissue-specific sebocyte populations, indicating major developmental, functional as well as biosynthetic differences between both glands. The use of preputial glands as surrogate model to study skin sebaceous glands is therefore limited, and major differences between both glands need to be carefully considered before planning an experiment.",

Contrasting trends of complementary polymorphisms such as C[-&gt;]T vs G[-&gt;]A as well as A[-&gt;]G vs T[-&gt;]C in the IRs vindicated similar replication-associated strand asymmetry regarding cytosine and adenine deamination, respectively, across these bacteria. Surprisingly, the polymorphism pattern at FFS was different from that of the IRs and its frequency was always more than the IRs in these bacteria. Further, the polymorphism patterns within a bacterium were inconsistent across the five amino acids, which neither the replication nor the transcription-associated mutations could explain. However, the polymorphism at FFS coincided with amino acid specific codon usage bias in the five bacteria. Further, strand asymmetry in nucleotide composition could be explained by the polymorphism at FFS, not at the IRs. Therefore, polymorphisms at FFS might not be treated as nearly neutral unlike that in IRs in these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cohesin is a central architectural element of chromosomes that regulates numerous DNA-based events. The complex holds sister chromatids together until anaphase onset and organizes individual chromosomal DNAs into loops. Purified cohesin translocates along DNA in a diffusive fashion that can be propelled by transcribing RNA polymerase. The complex also extrudes DNA loops in a process that consumes ATP. In this study we examine processive genomic translocation of cohesin in vivo. To this end, obstacles of increasing size were tethered to DNA to act as roadblocks to complexes mobilized by transcription in yeast. The obstacles were built from a GFP-lacI core fused to one or more mCherries. A chimera with four mCherries blocked cohesin passage in late G1. During M phase, the threshold barrier depended on the state of cohesion: non-cohesive complexes were also blocked by four mCherries whereas cohesive complexes were blocked by as few as three mCherries. Furthermore, cohesive complexes that were stalled at obstacles, in turn, blocked the passage of non-cohesive complexes. That synthetic barriers alter cohesin redistribution demonstrates that the complex translocates processively on chromatin in vivo. The approach provides a relative measure of the maximum size of the DNA binding chamber(s) of cohesin. Together, this study reveals unexplored limitations to cohesin movement on chromosomes.\n\nSignificance StatementCohesin is an architectural protein that brings distant chromosomal DNA sites together. The complex links sister chromatids cohesion but it also binds to single pieces of DNA in ways that do not generate cohesion. One class of non-cohesive complexes organizes chromosomal DNA into loops. All cohesin complexes move on DNA but the constraints on such movement are not fully explored. Here, we use size-calibrated obstacles in yeast to interrogate cohesin and the properties of its movement on DNA. We show that both cohesive and non-cohesive complexes translocate processively on chromosomes. In addition, we show that cohesive and non-cohesive complexes are blocked by obstacles of different size. Lastly, we show that stalled cohesive complexes block passage of non-cohesive complexes.",

Since the SR complex can form de novo, the role of the LR complex (i.e., DNAPKcs) for chromosomal EJ is unclear. We have examined EJ of chromosomal blunt DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and found that DNAPKcs is significantly less important than XLF and XRCC4 for such EJ. However, weakening XLF via disrupting interaction interfaces (e.g., disrupting the XLF homodimer interface) causes a marked requirement for DNAPKcs, its kinase activity, and its ABCDE-cluster autophosphorylation sites for blunt DSB EJ. In contrast, other aspects of genome maintenance are sensitive to DNAPKcs kinase inhibition in a manner that is not further enhanced by XLF loss (i.e., suppression of homology-directed repair and structural variants, and IR-resistance). We suggest that DNAPKcs is required to position a weakened XLF in an LR complex that can transition into a functional SR complex for blunt DSB EJ, but also has distinct functions for other aspects of genome maintenance.",

    "abstract": "PLATZ transcription factors play important roles in plant growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, how PLATZ regulates plant drought tolerance and ABA sensitivity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PLATZ4 increases drought tolerance and ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana by suppressing the expression of PIP2;8, DEG3, At1g33840 and At3g01345, while upregulating the expression of PR1, ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5. Moreover, PLATZ4 directly binds A/T-rich sequences within the PIP2;8 promoter but not ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 promoters. Consistent with this, PIP2;8 acts epistatically to PLATZ4. Furthermore, the aquaporin activity of PIP2;8 was confirmed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast cells in response to osmotic stress. Analysis of water loss of seedlings overexpressing PIP2;8 or lacking PIP2;8 function indicated that PIP2;8-mediated water flow is particularly active in response to drought stress in planta. Accordingly, stomatal closure was enhanced in pip2;8 mutants but reduced in PIP2;8-overexpressing plants. In platz4 mutant and PLATZ4-overexpressing plants, water loss and stomatal closure changed oppositely to those in pip2;8 mutants and PIP2;8-overexpressing plants, respectively. In addition, the interaction between PLATZ4 and AITR6 was confirmed by several assays, and the binding of PIP2;8 promoter by PLATZ4 was strengthened by an interaction with AITR6. Collectively, our findings reveal that PLATZ4 interacts with AITR6 to increase ABA sensitivity and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis by upregulating expression of PR1, ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 while inhibiting the expression of PIP2;8 and associated genes.\n\nOne sentence summaryPLATZ4 interacted with AITR6 to increase drought tolerance and ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana by directly bind A/T-rich sequences within the plasma membrane aquaporin (PIP)2;8 promoter.",

    "abstract": "During moderate severity drought and low water potential ({psi}w) stress, poorly understood signaling mechanisms restrict both meristem cell division and subsequent cell expansion. We found that the Clade E Growth-Regulating 2 (EGR2) protein phosphatase and Microtubule Associated Stress Protein 1 (MASP1) differed in their stoichiometry of expression across the root meristem and had opposing effects on root meristem activity at low {psi}w. Ectopic MASP1 or EGR expression increased or decreased, respectively, root meristem size and root elongation during low {psi}w stress. This, along with the ability of phosphomimic MASP1 to overcome EGR suppression of root meristem size and observation that ectopic EGR expression had no effect on unstressed plants, indicated that during low {psi}w EGR activation and attenuation of MASP1 phosphorylation in their overlapping zone of expression determines root meristem size and activity. Ectopic EGR expression also decreased root cell size at low {psi}w. Conversely, both the egr1-1egr2-1 and egr1-1egr2-1masp1-1 mutants had similarly increased root cell size; but, only egr1-1egr2-1 had increased cell division. These observations demonstrated that EGRs affect meristem activity via MASP1 but affect cell expansion via other mechanisms. Interestingly, EGR2 was highly expressed in the root cortex, a cell type important for growth regulation and environmental response.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySpatial differences in EGR-MASP1 expression and control of MASP1 phosphorylation adjust root meristem activity to regulate growth during drought stress.\n\nThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Paul E.

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved outcomes for a variety of malignancies; however, many patients fail to benefit. While tumor-intrinsic mechanisms are likely involved in therapy resistance, it is unclear to what extent host genetic background influences response. To investigate this, we utilized the Diversity Outbred (DO) and Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse models. DO mice are an outbred stock generated by crossbreeding 8 inbred founder strains, and CC mice are recombinant inbred mice generated from the same 8 founders. We generated 207 DOB6F1 mice representing 48 DO dams and demonstrated that these mice reliably accept the C57BL/6-syngeneic B16F0 tumor and that host genetic background influences response to ICI. Genetic linkage analysis from 142 mice identified multiple regions including one within chromosome 13 that associated with therapeutic response. We utilized 6 CC strains bearing the positive (NZO) or negative (C57BL/6) driver genotype in this locus. We found that 2/3 of predicted responder CCB6F1 crosses show reproducible ICI response. The chromosome 13 locus contains the murine prolactin family, which is a known immunomodulating cytokine associated with various autoimmune disorders. To directly test whether prolactin influences ICI response rates, we implanted inbred C57BL/6 mice with subcutaneous slow-release prolactin pellets to induce mild hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin augmented ICI response against B16F0, with increased CD8 infiltration and 5/8 mice exhibiting slowed tumor growth relative to controls. This study highlights the role of host genetics in ICI response and supports the use of F1 crosses in the DO and CC mouse populations as powerful cancer immunotherapy models.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUsing germline genetic analysis in Diversity Outbred and Collaborative Cross models, we identify prolactin as a host-intrinsic regulator of response to combined immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division is a complex process requiring the coordination of multiple components, to allow the appropriate spatial and temporal control of septum formation and cell scission. Peptidoglycan (PG) is the major structural component of the septum, and our recent studies in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus have revealed a complex, multi- stage PG architecture that develops during septation. Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are essential for the final steps of PG biosynthesis - their transpeptidase activity links together the peptide sidechain of nascent glycan strands together. PBP1 is required for cell division in S. aureus and here we demonstrate that it has multiple essential functions associated with its enzymatic activity and as a regulator of division. Loss of PBP1, or just its C-terminal PASTA domains, results in cessation of division at the point of septal plate formation. The PASTA domains can bind PG and thus coordinate the cell division process. The transpeptidase activity of PBP1 is also essential but its loss leads to a strikingly different phenotype of thickened and aberrant septa, which is phenocopied by the morphological effects of adding the PBP1-specific {beta}-lactam, meropenem. Together these results lead to a model for septal PG synthesis where PBP1 enzyme activity is responsible for the characteristic architecture of the septum and PBP1 protein molecules coordinate cell division allowing septal plate formation.",

    "abstract": "Shigella spp. are human bacterial pathogens that cause bacillary dysentery. Virulence depends on a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), a highly conserved structure present in multiple important human and plant pathogens. Upon host cell contact, the T3SS translocon is delivered to the host membrane, facilitates bacterial docking to the membrane, and enables delivery of effector proteins into the host cytosol. The Shigella translocon is composed of two proteins, IpaB and IpaC, which together form this multimeric structure within host plasma membranes. Upon interaction of IpaC with host intermediate filaments, the translocon undergoes a conformational change that allows for bacterial docking onto the translocon and, together with host actin polymerization, enables subsequent effector translocation through the translocon pore. To generate additional insights into the translocon, we mapped the topology of IpaB in plasma membrane-embedded pores using cysteine substitution mutagenesis coupled with site-directed labeling and proximity-enabled crosslinking by membrane permeant sulfhydryl reactants. We demonstrate that IpaB function is dependent on post translational modification by a plasmid-encoded acyl carrier protein. We show that the first transmembrane domain of IpaB lines the interior of the translocon pore channel such that the IpaB portion of the channel forms a funnel-like shape leading into the host cytosol. In addition, we identify regions of IpaB within its cytosolic domain that protrude into and are closely associated with the pore channel. Taken together, these results provide a framework for how IpaB is arranged within translocons natively delivered by Shigella during infection.\n\nImportanceType 3 secretion systems are nanomachines employed by many bacteria, including Shigella, which deliver into human cells bacterial virulence proteins that alter cellular function in ways that promote infection. Delivery of Shigella virulence proteins occurs through a pore formed in human cell membranes by the proteins IpaB and IpaC. Here, we define how IpaB contributes to the formation of pores natively delivered into human cell membranes by S. flexneri. We show that a specific domain of IpaB (transmembrane domain 1) lines much of the pore channel and that portions of IpaB that lie in the inside of the human cell loop back into and/or are closely associated with the pore channel. These findings provide new insights into the organization and function of the pore in serving as the conduit for delivery of virulence proteins into human cells during Shigella infection.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) associated pathogen of global importance, and polyvalent vaccines targeting K. pneumoniae O-antigens are in development. Genomes from sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) are underrepresented in global sequencing efforts. We therefore carried out a genomic analysis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae complex isolates colonising adults in Blantyre, Malawi, placed these isolates in a global genomic context, and compared colonising to invasive isolates from the main public hospital in Blantyre. 203 isolates from stool and rectal swabs from adults were whole-genome sequenced and compared to a publicly available multicountry collection of 484 K. pneumoniae genomes sampled to cover maximum diversity of the species, 150 previously sequenced Malawian and 66 Kenyan isolates from blood or sterile sites. We inferred phylogenetic relationships and analysed the diversity of genetic loci linked to AMR, virulence, capsule (K-) and LPS O-antigen (O-types). We find that the diversity of Malawian Klebsiella isolates is representative of the species population structure, but with local success and expansion of sequence types (STs) ST14, ST15, ST340 and ST307. Siderophore and hypermucoidy genes were more frequent in invasive versus carriage isolates (present in 13% vs 1%, p < 0.001) but still generally lacking in most invasive isolates. The population structure and distribution of O-antigen types was similar in Malawian invasive and carriage isolates, with O4 being more common in Malawian isolates (14%) than in previously published studies (2-5%). We conclude that host factors, pathogen opportunity or alternate virulence loci not linked to invasive disease elsewhere are likely to be the major determinants of invasive disease in Malawi. Distinct ST and O-type distributions in Malawi highlights the need for geographically aware sampling to robustly define secular trends in Klebsiella diversity. Colonising and invasive isolates in Blantyre are similar and hence O-typing of colonising Klebsiella isolates may be a rapid and cost-effective approach to describe global diversity and guide vaccine development.\n\nData SummaryAll data and code to replicate this analysis is available as the blantyreESBL v1.0.0 R package (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5554082) available at https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL.

P. hygromyciniae is unlikely to be a human pathogen, as it did not survive at 37 {degrees}C and was not cytotoxic towards a mammalian cell line. The P. hygromyciniae strain harbors a novel 250 kb megaplasmid which confers resistance to hygromycin B and contains numerous other genes predicted to encode replication and conjugation machinery.

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cAMP regulates a number of different cellular processes, such as cell growth, metabolism, stress resistance and gene transcription. The intracellular target for this second messenger in yeast cells is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The way in which a broad specificity protein kinase mediates one right physiological response after cAMP increase indicates that specificity is highly regulated in the cAMP / PKA system. Here we address the mechanism through which cAMP-PKA signalling mediates its response to heat shock thermotolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme composed of a regulatory (Bcy1) subunit dimer and two catalytic subunits (Tpk1, Tpk2 and Tpk3). PKA subunits are differentially expressed under certain stress conditions. In the present study we show that, although the mRNA levels of TPK1 are upregulated upon heat shock at 37{degrees}C, no change is detected in Tpk1 protein levels. The half-life of TPK1 mRNA increases and this mRNA condensates in cytoplasmic foci upon thermal stress. The resistance of TPK1 mRNA foci to cycloheximide-induced disassembly, together with the polysome profiling analysis suggest that TPK1 mRNA is impaired for entry into translation. TPK1 mRNA foci and TPK1 expression were also evaluated during thermotolerance. The crosstalk of cAMP-PKA pathway and cell wall integrity (CWI) signalling was also studied. Wsc3 sensor and other components of the CWI pathway are necessary for the upregulation of TPK1 mRNA upon heat shock conditions. The assembly in cytoplasmic foci upon thermal stress shows to be dependent of Wsc3. Finally, evidence of an increase in the abundance of Tpk1 in the PKA holoenzyme in response to heat shock is presented, suggesting that a recurrent stress enhanced the fitness for the coming favorable conditions The results indicate the existence of a mechanism that exclusively regulates Tpk1 subunit expression and therefore contributing to the specificity of cAMP-PKA.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTPKA subunits are differentially expressed under heat-shock conditions. The mRNA of the TPK1 subunit is upregulated upon heat-shock at 37{degrees}C and thermotolerance, the half-life increases upon heat-stress and also this transcript condensates in cytoplasmic foci upon thermal stress and thermotolerance. The resistance to cycloheximide treatment of TPK1 mRNA foci together with the analysis by polysome profiling suggest that TPK1 mRNA is impaired for entry into translation upon thermal stress. An increase in Tpk1 protein and PKA activity was detected after the heat stress treatments.\n\nCell Wall Integrity pathway, through Wsc3 sensor, is involved in TPK1 expression. Heat-stress regulates TPK1 expression through this pathway from an intermediate step of the cascade and independently of the upstream elements of the CWI pathway activation. These results demonstrate a new crosstalk between the two signalling pathways.\n\nThe increment in Tpk1-dependent PKA activity during cell adaptation to heat stress might contribute to the overall cellular fitness when more favorable environmental conditions are restored.\n\nThe results indicate the existence of a mechanism that exclusively regulates TPK1 subunit expression and therefore contributing to the specificity of cAMP-PKA.",

Here in this study, we identify PAM-1 (Pax7 Associated Muscle lncRNA) that is induced in activated SCs to promote SC activation into myoblast cells upon injury. PAM-1 is generated from a myoblast specific super-enhancer (SE); as a seRNA it binds with a number of target genomic loci predominantly in trans. Further studies demonstrate that it interacts with Ddx5 to tether PAM-1 SE to it inter-chromosomal targets Timp2 and Vim to activate the gene expression. Lastly, we show that PAM-1 expression is increased in aging SCs, which leads to enhanced inter-chromosomal interaction and target genes up-regulation. Altogether, our findings identify PAM-1 as a previously unknown lncRNA that regulates both SC activation and aging through its trans gene regulatory activity.",

Mice with a frameshift mutation of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (Lpcat1), which produces saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) composed of two saturated fatty acids, has been reported to cause spontaneous retinal degeneration (rd11 mice). In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of LPCAT1 in the retina and found that genetic deletion of Lpcat1 induces light-independent and photoreceptor-specific apoptosis in mice. Lipidomic analyses of the retina and isolated photoreceptor outer segment (OS) suggested that loss of Lpcat1 decreases saturated PC production and affects the proper cellular fatty acid flux, presumably by altering saturated fatty acyl-CoA availabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lpcat1 deletion increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in photoreceptor cells, but not in other retinal cells without affecting the OS structure and trafficking of OS-localized proteins. These results suggest that the LPCAT1-dependent production of saturated PC is critical for metabolic adaptation during photoreceptor maturation. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of saturated fatty acid metabolism in photoreceptor cell degeneration-related retinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Amphiphilic copolymers show promise in extracting membrane proteins directly from lipid bilayers into  native nanodiscs. However, many such copolymers are polyanionic and sensitive to divalent cations, limiting their applicability. We characterize the Ca2+ and Mg2+ sensitivity of poly(acrylic acid-co-styrene) (AASTY) copolymers with analytical UV and fluorescent size exclusion chromatography, enabling us to separate signals from nanodiscs, copolymers, and soluble aggregates. We find that divalent cations promote aggregation and precipitation of both free and lipid bound copolymers. We see that excess, free copolymer acts as a  cation sink that protects nanodiscs from Ca2+ induced aggregation. Removal of the free copolymer through dialysis induces aggregation that can be mitigated by KCl. Finally, we find that the nanodisc size is dynamic and dependent on lipid concentration. Our results offer insight to nanodisc behaviour, and can help guide experimental design, aimed at mitigating the shortcomings inherent in negatively charged nanodisc forming copolymers.",

In a mouse study, E{Delta}M-HM2e- or E{Delta}M-tM2e-pseudotyped viral particles (PVPs) induced significantly higher titers of anti-HA and/or anti-M2e antibodies. We also developed recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-E{Delta}M-HM2e and rVSV-E{Delta}M-tM2e vaccines that resulted in rapid and potent induction of HA and/or M2 antibodies in mouse sera and mucosa.

These sweeps may originate from the Bay of Bengal where bacteriophage predation and the evolution of anti-phage counter defenses is a recurring theme. The bacteriophage ICP1 is a key predator of epidemic V. cholerae and is notable for acquiring a CRISPR-Cas system to combat PLE, a defensive subviral parasite encoded by its V. cholerae host. Here we describe the discovery of five previously unknown PLE variants, including one found during recent surveillance of patient samples in Bangladesh. We also observed a lineage sweep of PLE negative V. cholerae occurring within a patient population in under a year which coincided with a loss of ICP1s CRISPR-Cas system. These findings reinforce the importance of surveillance to better understand the selective pressures that drive pandemic cholera.",

To determine how infection impacts placental trophoblasts, we utilized rhesus macaque trophoblast stem cells (TSC) that can be differentiated into early gestation syncytiotrophoblasts (ST) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT). TSCs and STs, but not EVTs, were highly permissive to productive infection with ZIKV strain DAK AR 41524. The impact of ZIKV on the cellular transcriptome showed that infection of TSCs and STs increased expression of immune related genes, including those involved in type I and type III interferon responses. ZIKV exposure altered extracellular vesicle (EV) protein, mRNA, and miRNA cargo, regardless of productive infection. These findings suggest that early gestation macaque TSCs and STs are permissive to ZIKV infection, and that EV analysis may provide a foundation for identifying non-invasive biomarkers of placental infection in a highly translational model.",

After replication stress and double-strand break formation a number of repair factors are Sumoylated and interact with other Sumoylated factors, including the nuclease Yen1. Yen1 plays a critical role to ensure genome stability and unperturbed chromosome segregation by removing covalently linked DNA intermediates that are formed by homologous recombination. Here we show how this important role of Yen1 is dependent on interactions mediated by non-covalent binding to Sumoylated partners. Mutations in the motifs that allow Sumo-mediated recruitment of Yen1 impair its ability to resolve DNA intermediates and result in increased genome instability and chromosome mis-segregation.",

    "abstract": "Oral infections, particularly periodontitis, are a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, although the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG-LPS) on cardiac function in mice, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Mice (C57BL/6) were injected with PG-LPS (0.8 mg/kg/day) with or without an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (TAK-242, 0.8 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Left ventricular ejection function was significantly decreased at 1 week (from 67 {+/-} 0.5 to 58 {+/-} 1.2 %) and remained low at 4 weeks (57 {+/-} 1.0 %). The number of apoptotic myocytes was increased (approximately 7.4-fold), the area of fibrosis was increased (approximately 3.3-fold) and the number of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive myocytes, a sensitive indicator of oxidative DNA damage, was increased (approximately 7.6-fold) at 4 weeks in the heart of PG-LPS treated mice. However, levels of various serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in PG-LPS-treated mice were similar to those in control mice. The impairment of cardiac function in PG-LPS-treated mice appears to involve activation of TLR4-NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4 signaling, leading to abundant production of reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ leakage from sarcoplastic reticulumn induced by calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban (at Thr-17) and ryanodine receptor 2 (at Ser-2448). Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 with TAK-242 attenuated the changes in cardiac function in PG-LPS-treated mice. Our results indicate that TLR4-NOX4 signaling may be a new therapeutic target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases in patients with periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Although peripheral deafferentation studies have demonstrated a critical role for trigeminal afference in modulating the orosensorimotor control of eating and drinking, the central trigeminal pathways mediating that control, as well as the timescale of control, remain to be elucidated. In rodents, three ascending somatosensory pathways process and relay orofacial mechanosensory input: the lemniscal, paralemniscal, and extralemniscal. Two of these pathways (the lemniscal and extralemniscal) exhibit highly structured topographic representations of the orofacial sensory surface, as exemplified by the one-to-one somatotopic mapping between vibrissae on the animals face and barrelettes in brainstem, barreloids in thalamus, and barrels in cortex. Here we use the Prrxl1 knockout mouse model to investigate ingestive behavior deficits associated with disruption of the lemniscal pathway. The Prrxl1 deletion disrupts somatotopic patterning and axonal projections throughout the lemniscal pathway but spares patterning in the extralemniscal nucleus. Our data reveal an imprecise and inefficient ingestive phenotype with deficits that span timescales from milliseconds to months, tightly linking trigeminal input with ingestion, from moment-to-moment consummatory to long term appetitive control. We suggest that ordered assembly of trigeminal sensory information along the lemniscal pathway is critical for the rapid and precise modulation of motor circuits driving eating and drinking action sequences.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) localized on the host plant cell wall. These receptors activate a broad-spectrum and durable defense, which are desired characteristics for disease resistance in plant breeding programs. In this study, candidate sequences for PRRs with lysin motifs (LysM) were investigated in the Coffea arabica genome. For this, approaches based on the principle of sequence similarity, conservation of motifs and domains, phylogenetic analysis, and modulation of gene expression in response to Hemileia vastatrix were used. The candidate sequences for PRRs in C. arabica (Ca1-LYP, Ca2-LYP, Ca1-CERK1, Ca2-CERK1, Ca-LYK4, Ca1-LYK5 and Ca2-LYK5) showed high similarity with the reference PRRs used: Os-CEBiP, At-CERK1, At-LYK4 and At-LYK5. Moreover, the ectodomains of these sequences showed high identity or similarity with the reference sequences, indicating structural and functional conservation. The studied sequences are also phylogenetically related to the reference PRRs described in Arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species. All candidates for receptors had their expression induced after the inoculation with H. vastatrix, since the first time of sampling at 6 hours post-inoculation (hpi). At 24 hpi, there was a significant increase in expression, for most of the receptors evaluated, and at 48 hpi, a suppression. The results showed that the candidate sequences for PRRs in the C. arabica genome display high homology with fungal PRRs already described in the literature. Besides, they respond to pathogen inoculation and seem to be involved in the perception or signaling of fungal chitin, acting as receptors or coreceptors of this molecule. These findings represent an advance in the understanding of the basal immunity of this species.",

    "abstract": "Several efforts have been made by many researchers worldwide to develop coffee plants resistant to different Cercospora species; however, studies concerning C. coffeicola, specifically, are still incipient. In the present study, a blend of strains from this pathogen was inoculated into 18 Brazilian commercial cultivars, a coffee clone of Arabica, as well as into 41 accessions from the Germplasm Collection of Minas Gerais, to evaluate the genetic resistance ability within the population and select superior genotypes for the breeding program. After predicting genotypic values of the evaluated material, the most efficient way to select genotypes based on the data of severity to brown eye spot (BES) was also examined. Moreover, the action of defense mechanisms against C. coffeicola attacks was investigated by assessing the levels of total soluble phenolic compounds and soluble lignin in contrasting genotypes regarding disease susceptibility. Based on the results, the accession MG 1207 Sumatra demonstrated an intrinsic genetic capacity to maintain low levels of severity to brown eye spot. This genotype can thus substantially contribute to the development of new cultivars, which may lead to reduced use of pesticides. This study also evidenced that four evaluations of severity is enough to reach accuracy and efficiency for the severity of BES, thus providing expressive genetic gains. Finally, it is suggested that the levels of lignin and phenolic compounds are not associated with the resistance of coffee genotypes to brown eye spot.",

Actin cables also affect yeast lifespan by promoting transport and inheritance of higher-functioning mitochondria to daughter cells. Here, we report that actin cable stability declines with age. Our genome-wide screen for genes that affect actin cable stability identified the open reading frame YKL075C. Deletion of YKL075C results in increases in actin cable stability and abundance, mitochondrial fitness, and replicative lifespan. Transcriptome analysis revealed a role for YKL075C in regulating branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. Consistent with this, modulation of BCAA metabolism or decreasing leucine levels promotes actin cable stability and function in mitochondrial quality control. Our studies support a role for actin stability in yeast lifespan, and demonstrate that this process is controlled by BCAA and a previously uncharacterized ORF YKL075C, which we refer to as actin, aging and nutrient modulator protein 1 (AAN1).",
