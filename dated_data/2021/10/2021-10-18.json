    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront an urgent need for the rapid development of highly efficacious vaccines, particularly in light of the ongoing emergence of multiple variants of concern. Plant-based recombinant protein platforms are emerging as cost-effective and highly scalable alternatives to conventional protein production. Viral glycoproteins, however, are historically challenging to produce in plants. Herein, we report the production of plant-expressed wild-type glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD (receptor-binding domain) protein that is recognized by anti-RBD antibodies and exhibits high-affinity binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Moreover, our plant-expressed RBD was readily detected by IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies from naturally infected convalescent, vaccinated, or convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We further demonstrate that RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor was efficiently neutralized by antibodies from sera of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and partially and fully vaccinated individuals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that recombinant RBD produced in planta exhibits suitable biochemical and antigenic features for use in a subunit vaccine platform.",

    "abstract": "In plants, many invading microbial pathogens are recognized by cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), inducing defense responses; yet how PRRs perceive pathogen sphingolipids remains unclear. Here, we show that the ceramide Pi-Cer D from a plant pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora infestans triggers defense responses in Arabidopsis. Pi-Cer D is cleaved by an Arabidopsis apoplastic ceramidase, NCER2, and the resulting 9-methyl-branched sphingoid base is recognized by a plasma membrane lectin receptor-like kinase, RDA2. Importantly, 9-methyl-branched sphingoid base, which is unique to microbes, induces plant immune responses by interacting with RDA2. Loss of RDA2 or NCER2 function compromised Arabidopsis resistance against an oomycete pathogen, indicating that these are crucial for defense. We provide new insights that help elucidate the recognition mechanisms of pathogen-derived lipid molecules in plants.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryOomycete-derived ceramide is cleaved into sphingoid base by ceramidase and recognized by an Arabidopsis receptor kinase.",

    "abstract": "Nutrients and metabolites play important roles in immune functions. Recent studies show lactate instead of glucose can serve as a primary carbon fuel source for most tissues. The role of lactate in tumor immunity is not well understood with immune suppressive functions reported for lactic acid, the conjugate acid form of lactate. In this study, we report lactate increases the stemness of CD8+ T cells and augments anti-tumor immunity. Subcutaneous administration of lactate but not glucose shows CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor growth inhibition. Single cell transcriptomics analysis revealed lactate treatment increased a subpopulation of stem-like TCF-1-expressing CD8+ T cells, which is further validated by ex vivo culture of CD8+ T cells from mouse splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by lactate increased acetylation in the histone H3K27 site at the Tcf7 super enhancer locus and increased the gene expression of Tcf7. Adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells pretreated with lactate in vitro showed potent tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Our results elucidate the immune protective role of lactate in anti-tumor immunity without the masking effect of acid. These results may have broad implications for T cell therapy and the understanding of lactate in immune metabolism.",

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients exhibit acute respiratory distress syndrome which can be compounded by endemic respiratory viruses and thus highlighting the need to understand the genetic bases of clinical outcome under multiple respiratory infections. In this study, 42 individual datasets and a multi-parametric based selected list of over 12,000 genes against five medically important respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus were collected and analysed in an attempt to understand differentially regulated gene patterns and to cast genetic markers of individual and multiple co-infections. While a certain cohort of virus-specific genes were regulated (negatively and positively), notably results revealed a greatest correlation among gene regulation by SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. Furthermore, out of analysed genes, the MAP2K5 and NFKBIL1 were specifically and highly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo or in vitro. In contrast, several genes including GPBAR1 and SC5DL were specifically downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 datasets. Additionally, we catalogued a set of genes that were conserved or differentially regulated across all the respiratory viruses. These finding provide foundational and genome-wide data to gauge the markers of respiratory viral infections individually and under co-infection.",

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of licensed vaccines, pneumococcal disease caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), remains a serious infectious disease threat globally. Disease manifestations include pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis, resulting in over a million deaths annually. Pneumococcal disease disproportionally impacts elderly individuals [&ge;]65 years old. Interventions are complicated through a combination of complex disease progression and 100 different bacterial capsular polysaccharide serotypes. This has made it challenging to develop a broad vaccine against S. pneumoniae, with current options utilizing capsular polysaccharides as the primary antigenic content. However, current vaccines are substantially less effective in protecting the elderly. We previously developed a Liposomal Encapsulation of Polysaccharides (LEPS) vaccine platform, designed around limitations of current pneumococcal vaccines, that allowed the non-covalent coupling of polysaccharide and protein antigen content and protected young hosts against pneumococcal infection in murine models. In this study, we modified the formulation to make it more economical and tested the novel LEPS vaccine in aged hosts. We found that in young mice (2-3 months), LEPS elicited comparable responses to the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar-13. Further, LEPS immunization of old mice (20-22 months) induced comparable antibody levels and improved antibody function compared to Prevnar-13. Importantly, LEPS protected old mice against both invasive and lung localized pneumococcal infections. In summary, LEPS is an alternative and effective vaccine strategy that protects aged hosts against different manifestations of pneumococcal disease.",

In contrast, multi-subunit effectors dominate natural systems, represent emerging technologies, and were recently associated with RNA-guided DNA transposition.

Here, we apply cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) to radically accelerate the characterization of multi-subunit CRISPR effectors and transposons. Numerous DNA constructs can be combined in one TXTL reaction, yielding defined biomolecular readouts in hours. Using TXTL, we mined phylogenetically diverse I-E effectors, interrogated extensively self-targeting I-C and I-F systems, and elucidated targeting rules for I-B and I-F CRISPR transposons using only DNA-binding components. We further recapitulated DNA transposition in TXTL, which helped reveal a distinct branch of I-B CRISPR transposons.

    "abstract": "Ribosomes are the universally conserved ribonucleoprotein complexes that synthesize proteins. The two subunits of the eukaryotic ribosome are produced through a quasi-independent assembly-line-like pathway involving the hierarchical actions of numerous trans-acting biogenesis factors and the incorporation of ribosomal proteins. The factors work together to shape the nascent subunits through a series of intermediate states into their functional architectures. The earliest intermediate of the small subunit (SSU or 40S) is the SSU Processome which is subsequently transformed into the pre-40S intermediate. This transformation is, in part, facilitated by the binding of the methyltransferase Bud23. How Bud23 is released from the resultant pre-40S is not known. The ribosomal proteins Rps0, Rps2, and Rps21, termed the Rps0-cluster proteins, and several biogenesis factors are known to bind the pre-40S around the time that Bud23 is released, suggesting that one or more of these factors induce Bud23 release. Here, we systematically examined the requirement of these factors for the release of Bud23 from pre-40S particles. We found that the Rps0-cluster proteins are needed but not sufficient for Bud23 release. The atypical kinase/ATPase Rio2 shares a binding site with Bud23 and is thought to be recruited to pre-40S after the Rps0-cluster proteins. Depletion of Rio2 prevented the release of Bud23 from the pre-40S. More importantly, the addition of recombinant Rio2 to pre-40S particles affinity-purified from Rio2-depleted cells was sufficient for Bud23 release in vitro. The ability of Rio2 to displace Bud23 was independent of nucleotide hydrolysis. We propose a novel role for Rio2 in which its binding to the pre-40S actively displaces Bud23 from the pre-40S, and we suggest a model in which the binding of the Rps0-cluster proteins and Rio2 promote the release of Bud23.",

In cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload leads to pathological production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activates the permeability transition, and cardiomyocyte death. Here we investigated the cardiac phenotype caused by deletion of EF-hand domain-containing protein D1 (Efhd1-/-), a Ca2+-binding mitochondrial protein whose function is poorly understood. Efhd1-/- mice are viable and have no adverse cardiac phenotypes. They feature reductions in basal ROS levels and mitoflash events, both important precursors for mitochondrial injury, though cardiac mitochondria have normal susceptibility to Ca2+ overload. Notably, we also find that Efhd1-/- mice and their cardiomyocytes are resistant to hypoxic injury.",

    "abstract": "Age-related impairments in myoblast differentiation may contribute to reductions in muscle function in older adults, however, the underlying proteostasis processes are not well understood. Young (P6-10) and replicatively aged (P48-50) C2C12 myoblast cultures were investigated during early (0h-24h) and late (72h-96h) stages of differentiation using deuterium oxide (D2O) labelling and mass spectrometry. The absolute dynamic profiling technique for proteomics (Proteo-ADPT) was applied to quantify the absolute rates of abundance change, synthesis and degradation of individual proteins. Proteo-ADPT encompassed 116 proteins and 74 proteins exhibited significantly (P<0.05, FDR <5 %) different changes in abundance between young and aged cells at early and later periods of differentiation. Young cells exhibited a steady pattern of growth, protein accretion and fusion, whereas aged cells failed to gain protein mass or undergo fusion during later differentiation. Maturation of the proteome was retarded in aged myoblasts at the onset of differentiation, but their proteome appeared to  catch up with the young cells during the early phase of the differentiation period. However, this  catch up process in aged cells was not accomplished by higher levels of protein synthesis. Instead, a lower level of protein degradation in aged cells was responsible for the elevated gains in protein abundance. Our novel data point to a loss of proteome quality as a precursor to the lack of fusion of aged myoblasts and highlights dysregulation of protein degradation, particularly of ribosomal and chaperone proteins, as a key mechanism that may contribute to age-related declines in the capacity of myoblasts to undergo differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism for embryonic dorsal-ventral (DV) symmetry breaking is idiosyncratic to the species, then converges on polarized expression of BMP signaling ligands. Here, we show that V-ATPase (VHA) activity is an early requirement for DV symmetry breaking in sea urchin embryos. In these basal deuterostomes, DV specification is mediated by ventral Nodal expression that leads to the establishment of a BMP signaling gradient. Nodal expression occurs downstream from p38 MAPK, which is transiently asymmetrically active. We show that VHA activity is required for DV symmetry breaking upstream from both p38 MAPK and Nodal. We rescue VHA-mediated ventralization by enforcing Nodal signaling asymmetry. We identify a VHA-dependent DV voltage gradient and also find that VHA activity is required for hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activation. However, neither hyperpolarization nor HIF activation account for the dorsalizing effects of VHA, implicating a third unknown pathway that connects VHA activity to p38 MAPK symmetry breaking.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/464707v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d905dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@108452org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f27a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@122b510_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Calcium (Ca2+) is a universal and versatile cellular messenger used to regulate numerous cellular processes in response to external or internal stimuli. A pivotal component of the Ca2+ signaling toolbox in cells is the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs), which mediate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), controlling cytoplasmic and organellar Ca2+ concentrations1-3. IP3Rs are activated by IP3 and Ca2+, inhibited by Ca2+ at high concentrations, and potentiated by ATP1-3. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear due to the lack of structures in the active conformation. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human type-3 IP3R in multiple gating conformations; IP3-ATP bound pre-active states with closed channels, IP3-ATP-Ca2+ bound active state with an open channel, and IP3-ATP-Ca2+ bound inactive state with a closed channel.

    "abstract": "Transcriptional variability facilitates stochastic cell diversification and can in turn underpin adaptation to stress or injury. We hypothesize that it may analogously facilitate progression of pre-malignancy to cancer. To investigate this, we initiated pre-leukemia in mouse cells with enhanced transcriptional variability due to conditional disruption of the histone lysine acetyltransferase gene Kat2a. By combining single-cell RNA-sequencing of pre-leukemia with functional analysis of transformation, we show that Kat2a loss results in global variegation of cell identity and accumulation of pre-leukemic cells. Leukemia progression is subsequently facilitated by destabilization of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, which confer a transient transformation advantage. The contribution of transcriptional variability to early cancer evolution reflects a generic role in promoting cell fate transitions, which, in the case of well-adapted malignancies, contrastingly differentiates and depletes cancer stem cells. In other words, transcriptional variability confers forward momentum to cell fate systems, with differential multi-stage impact throughout cancer evolution.\n\nOne-sentence summaryLoss of Kat2a enhances transcriptional variability of ribosome biosynthetic programs and transiently accelerates pre-leukemia",

    "abstract": "Recently developed KRASG12C inhibitory drugs are beneficial to lung cancer patients harbouring KRASG12C mutations, but drug resistance frequently develops. Due to the immunosuppressive nature of the signaling network controlled by oncogenic KRAS, these drugs can indirectly affect anti-tumour immunity, providing a rationale for their combination with immune checkpoint blockade. In this study, we have characterised how KRASG12C inhibition reverses immune suppression driven by oncogenic KRAS in a number of pre-clinical lung cancer models with varying levels of immunogenicity. Mechanistically, KRASG12C inhibition upregulates interferon signaling via Myc inhibition, leading to reduced tumour infiltration by immunosuppressive cells, enhanced infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells, and increased antigen presentation. However, the combination of KRASG12C inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade only provides synergistic benefit in the most immunogenic tumour model. KRASG12C inhibition fails to sensitize cold tumours to immunotherapy, with implications for the design of clinical trials combining KRASG12C inhibitors with anti-PD1 drugs.\n\nOne sentence summaryKRAS inhibition mobilizes anti-tumour immunity in immunogenic lung cancer models through derepressing interferon signaling via repression of Myc.",

In addition to molecular signaling, recent work has shown that physical forces regulate the immune response of vertebrates by modifying transmembrane protein conformation and cell contact. Mechanical stress and strain produced by forces constitute physical cues perceived by cells instructing gene expression. Whether mechanical cues generated by pathogens during host colonization can trigger adaptive responses in plant cells remains elusive. We found that local and progressive variations of plant cell wall tension caused by fungal pathogen attacks are transmitted to neighboring healthy tissue around the infection site and trigger immunity in distal cells. This  thigmoimmunity process requires the reorganization of cortical microtubules and contributes strongly to Arabidopsis disease resistance.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryActivation of plants immunity depends on fluctuations of mechanical tension caused by a fungal pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Microglial activation is a hall marker of Alzheimers disease (AD); its pathogenic role and regulating mechanisms are unclear. p38-MAPK, a stress-responding kinase, is activated in AD brain in early disease stages. In APP-transgenic mice, we deleted p38-MAPK in whole myeloid cells from birth or specifically in microglia from 9 months, and analysed AD pathology at the age of 4, 9 and 12 months. In both experimental settings, p38-MAPK deficiency decreased cerebral A{beta} and improved cognitive function of AD mice; however, p38-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells were more effective than p38-MAPK-deficient microglia in preventing AD pathogenesis. Deficiency of p38-MAPK in myeloid cells inhibited the inflammatory activation of individual microglia by 4 months, but enhanced it by 9 months. Inflammatory activation was essential for p38-MAPK deficiency to promote microglial internalization of A{beta}. Interestingly, p38-MAPK deficiency in peripheral myeloid cells reduced il-17a transcription in CD4-positive spleen cells. By cross-breeding APP-transgenic mice and IL-17a knockout mice, we further observed that IL-17a deficiency activated microglia and decreased A{beta} deposits in AD mouse brain. Thus, p38-MAPK deficiency in myeloid cells prevents AD pathogenesis, perhaps through reducing IL-17a-expressing T lymphocytes, and promoting A{beta} clearance in the brain. Our study supports p38-MAPK as a novel target for AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Charcot Marie Tooth diseases type 1A (CMT1A), caused by duplication of Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene, and CMT1B, caused by mutations in myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene are the two most common forms of demyelinating CMT (CMT1) and no treatments are available for either. Prior studies of the MpzSer63del mouse model of CMT1B have demonstrated that protein misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) contributed to the neuropathy. Heterozygous patients with an arginine to cysteine mutation in MPZ (MPZR98C) develop a severe infantile form of CMT1B which is modeled by MpzR98C/+ mice that also show ER-stress and an activated UPR. C3-PMP22 mice are considered to effectively model CMT1A. Altered proteostasis, ER-stress and activation of the UPR have been demonstrated in mice carrying Pmp22 mutations. To determine whether enabling the ER-stress/UPR and readjusting protein homeostasis would effectively treat these models of CMT1B and CMT1A we administered Sephin1/IFB-088/icerguestat, a UPR modulator which showed efficacy in the MpzS63del model of CMT1B, to heterozygous MpzR98C and C3-PMP22 mice. Mice were analyzed by behavioral, neurophysiological, morphological and biochemical measures. Both MpzR98C/+ and C3-PMP22 mice improved in motor function and neurophysiology. Myelination, as demonstrated by g-ratios and myelin thickness, improved in CMT1B and CMT1A mice and markers of UPR activation returned towards wild type values. Taken together our results demonstrate the capability of IFB-088 to treat a second mouse model of CMT1B and a mouse model of CMT1A, the most common form of CMT. Given the recent benefits of IFB-088 treatment in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis animal models, these data demonstrate its potential in managing UPR and ER-stress for multiple mutations in CMT1 as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Interactions among members of these complex assemblages allow hosts to adjust their physiology and metabolism to cope with environmental variation and occupy different habitats. Here, using reciprocal transplantation across depths, we studied adaptive divergence in the Caribbean corals Orbicella annularis and O. franksi. When transplanted from deep to shallow, O. franksi experienced fast photoacclimation, low mortality, and maintained a consistent bacterial community. In contrast, O. annularis experienced higher mortality, and limited photoacclimation when transplanted from shallow to deep. The photophysiological collapse of O. annularis in the deep environment was associated with an increased microbiome variability and reduction of some bacterial taxa. Differences in the symbiotic algal community were more pronounced between coral species than between depths. Our study suggests that these sibling species are adapted to distinctive light environments partially driven by the algae photoacclimation capacity and the microbiome robustness, highlighting the importance of niche specialization in symbiotic corals for the maintenance of species diversity. Our findings have implications for the management of these threatened Caribbean corals and the effectiveness of coral reef restoration efforts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundYolk sac (YS) progenitors are a source of macrophages and endothelial cells in some tissues that are thought to be maintained postnatally by self-renewal in their differentiated states. How this is achieved remains poorly understood.\n\nMethods and ResultsSingle-cell digests from mouse aortas selectively formed macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-M) in methylcellulose, which self-renewed in secondary cultures from single cells. CFU-M comprised a homogeneous population of Lin-CD45+/LoCD11b- F4/80-Sca-1+c-Kit+ progenitor cells that co-expressed fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R). These progenitors displayed high proliferative activity from adult aorta even at steady state. Flt3Cre lineage mapping revealed their independence from Flt3+ bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells. They were especially abundant in neonatal aorta, with subsequent age-related decline, suggesting prenatal seeding, which was confirmed by finding their emergence in YS after embryonic day (E) 7.5 and from aorta-gonad-mesonephros by E10.5. Inducible fate-mapping using Csf1rMer-iCre-Mer and Cx3cr1YFP-creER mice established that these progenitors originate from an E8.5 CSF1R+ and E8.5-9.5 CX3CR1+ source, together with macrophages and endothelial cells in the aortic wall. Complementary differentiation studies revealed aortic progenitors to be vasculogenic and bipotent for macrophages and endothelium, contributing to adventitial neovascularization in aortic ring assays and forming perfused blood vessels and macrophages after transfer into ischemic hindlimb. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed their relatively homogeneous myelopoietic and angiogenic gene expression profile without expression of mature myeloid or endothelial genes. Finally, we found that aortic progenitors also express angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor, AGTR2, and established regulatory roles for angiotensin II, which augmented their proliferative, self-renewal and differentiation properties in vitro and expansion in aorta in vivo.\n\nConclusionOur discovery of aortic endothelial-macrophage progenitors adds to the recognized fate of YS progenitors in postnatal tissues. These bipotent cells may help explain the local renewal of YS-derived tissue-resident macrophages and endothelial cells after birth.",

Epicardial delivery of autologous atrial appendage micrografts (AAMs) with a clinically used extracellular matrix (ECM) patch provides a straightforward therapy alternative. We evaluated the operative feasibility and the effect of micrografts on the patch-induced epicardial foreign body inflammatory response in a porcine model of myocardial infarction. Right atrial appendages were harvested and mechanically processed into AAMs. The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated to generate acute infarction. Patches of ECM matrix with or without AAMs were transplanted epicardially onto the infarcted area. Four pigs received the ECM and four received the AAMs patch. Cardiac function was studied by echocardiography both preoperatively and at three weeks follow-up. The primary outcome measures were safety and feasibility of the therapy administration and the secondary outcome was the inflammatory response to ECM. Neither AAMs nor ECM patch-related complications were detected during the follow-up time. AAMs patch preparation was feasible according to time and safety. Inflammation was greatly reduced in AAMs as compared to ECM patches as measured by the amount of infiltrated inflammatory cells and area of inflammation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an increased CD3+ cell density in the AAMs patch infiltrate. Epicardial AAMs transplantation demonstrated safety and clinical feasibility. The use of micrografts significantly inhibited ECM-induced foreign body inflammatory reactivity. Transplantation of AAMs shows good clinical applicability as adjuvant therapy to cardiac surgery and can suppress acute inflammatory reactivity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Ebolavirus is one of the deadliest viral pathogens which was first discovered in the year 1976 during two consecutive outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. Six known strains have been documented. The Bundibugyo Ebolavirus in particular first emerged in the year 2007 in Uganda. This outbreak was constituted with 116 human cases and 39 laboratory confirmed deaths. After 5 years, it re-emerged and caused an epidemic for the first time in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the year 2012 as reported by the WHO. Here, 36 human cases with 13 laboratory confirmed deaths were registered. Despite several research studies conducted in the past, there is still scarcity of knowledge available on the genetic diversity of Bundibugyo Ebolavirus. We undertook a research project to provide insights into the unique variants of Bundibugyo Ebolavirus that circulated in the two epidemics that occurred in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe Bioinformatics approaches used were; Quality Control, Reference Mapping, Variant Calling, Annotation, Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic analysis to identify genomic variants as well determine the genetic relatedness between the two epidemics. Overall, we used 41 viral sequences that were retrieved from the publicly available sequence database, which is the National Center for Biotechnology and Information Gen-bank database.\n\nResultsOur analysis identified 14,362 unique genomic variants from the two epidemics. The Uganda isolates had 5,740 unique variants, 75 of which had high impacts on the genomes. These were 51 frameshift, 15 stop gained, 5 stop lost, 2 missense, 1 synonymous and 1 stop lost and splice region. Their effects mainly occurred within the L-gene region at reference positions 17705, 11952, 11930 and 11027. For the DRC genomes, 8,622 variant sites were identified. The variants had a modifier effect on the genome occurring at reference positions, 213, 266 and 439. Examples are C213T, A266G and C439T. Phylogenetic reconstruction identified two separate and unique clusters from the two epidemics.\n\nConclusionOur analysis provided further insights into the genetic diversity of Bundibugyo Ebolavirus from the two epidemics. The Bundibugyo Ebolavirus strain was genetically diverse with multiple variants. Phylogenetic reconstruction identified two unique variants. This signified an independent spillover event from a natural reservoir, rather a continuation from the ancestral outbreak that initiated the resurgence in DRC in the year 2012. Therefore, the two epidemics were not genetically related.",

    "abstract": "The dose-dependent consumptive effect of kratom and its potential application as an alternative source of medicine to mitigate opioid withdrawal symptoms has brought considerable attention to this plant. Increased interest in the application and use of kratom has emerged globally, including North America. Although the chemistry and pharmacology of major kratom alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, are well documented, foundational information on the impact of plant production environment on growth and kratom alkaloids synthesis is unavailable. To directly address this need, kratom plant growth, leaf chlorophyll content, and alkaloid concentration were evaluated under three lighting conditions: outdoor full sun, greenhouse unshaded, and greenhouse shaded. Nine kratom alkaloids were quantified using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. Contents of six alkaloids to include: mitragynine, speciogynine, speciociliatine, mitraphylline, coynantheidine, and isocorynantheidine were not significantly impacted by lighting conditions, whereas 7-hydroxymitragynine was below the lower limit of quantification across all treatments. However, paynantheine concentration per leaf dry mass was increased by 40% and corynoxine was increased by 111% when grown under shade conditions in a greenhouse compared to outdoor full sun. Additionally, total alkaloid yield per plant was maximized when plants were under such conditions. Greenhouse cultivation generally promoted height and width extension, leaf number, leaf area, average leaf size, and total leaf dry mass, compared to outdoor full sun condition. Rapid, non-destructive chlorophyll evaluation correlated well (r2 = 0.68) with extracted chlorophyll concentrations. Given these findings, production efforts where low-light conditions can be implemented are likely to maximize plant biomass and total leaf alkaloid production.",

    "abstract": "By identifying similarity in bone and soft tissue covariation patterns in hominids, it is possible to produce facial approximation methods that are compatible with more than one species of primate. In this study, we conducted an interspecific comparison of the nasomaxillary region in chimpanzees and modern humans with the aim of producing a method for predicting the nasal protrusions of ancient Plio-Pleistocene hominids. We addressed this aim by first collecting and performing regression analyses of linear and angular measurements of nasal cavity length and inclination in modern humans (Homo sapiens; n = 72) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; n = 19), and then by performing a set of out-of-group tests. The first test was performed on two subjects that belonged to the same genus as the training sample, i.e., Homo (n = 1) and Pan (n = 1), and the second test, which functioned as an interspecies compatibility test, was performed on Pan paniscus (n = 1), Gorilla gorilla (n = 3), Pongo pygmaeus (n = 1), Pongo abelli (n = 1), Symphalangus syndactylus (n = 3), and Papio hamadryas (n = 3). We identified statistically significant correlations in both humans and chimpanzees with slopes that displayed homogeneity of covariation. Joint prediction formulae were found to be compatible with humans and chimpanzees as well as all other African great apes, i.e., bonobos and gorillas. The main conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that regression models for approximating nasal projection are homogenous among humans and African apes and can thus be reasonably extended to ancestors leading to these clades.",
