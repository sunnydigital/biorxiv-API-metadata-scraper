    "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation in the region surrounding the transcription start site is a hallmark of gene silencing in cancer. Currently approved demethylating agents lack specificity and exhibit high toxicity. Herein we show, using the p16 gene as an example, that targeted demethylation of the promoter-exon 1-intron 1 (PrExI) region initiates an epigenetic wave of local chromatin remodeling and distal long-range interactions, culminating in gene-locus specific activation. Through development of CRISPR-DiR (DNMT1-interacting RNA), in which ad hoc edited guides block methyltransferase activity in a locus-specific fashion, we demonstrate that demethylation is coupled to epigenetic and topological changes. These results suggest the existence of a specialized \"demethylation firing center (DFC)\" which can be switched on by an adaptable and selective RNA-mediated approach for locus-specific transcriptional activation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLocus demethylation via CRISPR-DiR reshapes chromatin structure and specifically reactivates its cognate gene.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic pathway inference from genomic sequence information is an integral scientific problem with wide ranging applications in the life sciences. As sequencing throughput increases, scalable and performative methods for pathway prediction at different levels of genome complexity and completion become compulsory. In this paper, we present reMap (relabeling metabolic pathway data with groups) a simple, and yet, generic framework, that performs relabeling examples to a different set of labels, characterized as groups. A pathway group is comprised of a subset of statistically correlated pathways that can be further distributed between multiple pathway groups. This has important implications for pathway prediction, where a learning algorithm can revisit a pathway multiple times across groups to improve sensitivity. The relabeling process in reMap is achieved through an alternating feedback process. In the first feed-forward phase, a minimal subset of pathway groups is picked to label each example. In the second feed-backward phase, reMaps internal parameters are updated to increase the accuracy of mapping examples to pathway groups. The resulting pathway group dataset is then be used to train a multi-label learning algorithm. reMaps effectiveness was evaluated on metabolic pathway prediction where resulting performance metrics equaled or exceeded other prediction methods on organismal genomes with improved predictive performance.",

    "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death among epilepsy patients, occurring even more frequently in cases with anti-epileptic drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanism of SUDEP remains elusive. Our previous study demonstrated that enhancement of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) significantly reduced the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in a DBA/1 mouse SUDEP model. Given that the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) plays an important role in mediating the respiration system in the brain, we hypothesized that 5-HT2AR plays a key role in S-IRA and SUDEP. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the decreased incidence of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection following 5-HTP administration will be blocked by treatment with ketanserin (KET), a selective antagonist of 5HT2AR, in the DBA/1 mouse SUDEP model. We observed that the reduction in S-IRA by 5-HTP was significantly reversed by IP or intracerebroventricular injection of KET. Considering the localization of 5-HT2AR in the pre-Botzinger complex (PBC), which plays a key role in regulating respiratory rhythm, we next examined whether KET acts on 5-HT2AR in the PBC. To test this hypothesis, we activated the neural circuit between the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and PBC using optogenetics technology. We observed that stimulation of TPH2-ChETA-expressing neurons in the DR reduced the incidence of S-IRA evoked by PTZ, and this suppressant effect was significantly reversed by administration of KET in the bilateral PBC with no changes in electroencephalogram activity. The neural circuit between the DR and PBC was confirmed by injection of cholera toxin subunit B555 (CTB-555), a nerve tracer, in the DR or PBC separately. Calcium signaling evoked by PTZ within neurons of the PBC during seizures was significantly reduced by photostimulation of the DR. Taken together, our findings suggest that 5-HT2AR plays a critical role in regulating S-IRA and targeting the serotonergic neural circuit between the DR and PBC is a promising approach to preventing SUDEP.",

Unfortunately, JP and members of the Mello lab have not been able to replicate some aspects of the study. JP has failed to independently reproduce the specific results showing RNAi-triggered relocalization of target RNA, and P granule specific accumulation of (the P granule component GLH-1) as reported. The conditions/strains analyzed by JP were as follows: (1) oma-1 FISH on WT worms [control, 6 hr and 12 hr oma-1(RNAi)]. (2) oma-1 FISH on OMA-1:GFP worms [control, 6 hr oma-1(RNAi), or 6 hr gfp(RNAi)]. (3) oma-1 FISH on WT worms [control, 4hr, 6hr, 8 hr, and 10 hr oma-1(RNAi)]. 10-23 gonads were analyzed per experiment. Fixation conditions were essentially as described, with the only known difference being that gonads were not exposed to detergent prior to fixation. Using YYs reagents and protocol the Mello lab has not observed an obvious relocalization of target RNA to P granules (marked by GFP::GLH-1) after 6 hrs oma-1(RNAi); n=92 gonads. CM, JP and DG consider that the published images accurately represent the image stacks provided by YY as representative, raw data, but JP and CM note configurations of FISH signals in germ nuclei and gonad anatomy that they consider unusual. CM, JP and DG have not detected any evidence of image manipulation.\n\nYY states that none of the raw image data were manipulated beyond standard adjustments for brightness and contrast prior to processing images for publication as described. However, YY reports that the images were not representative of the majority of sample gonads, and instead were pre-selected under low magnification for rare examples with asymmetrical, expanded P granules.\n\nEfforts to identify conditions that explain the rare gonads imaged by YY continue in the Mello lab, as do efforts to reproduce independently each of the other reported results; we plan to provide an update in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa CtpA is a carboxyl terminal-processing protease that partners with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade at least five cell wall-associated proteins, four of which are cell wall hydrolases. This activity plays an important role in supporting P. aeruginosa virulence in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. However, almost nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying CtpA and LbcA function. Here, we used structural analysis to show that CtpA alone assembles into an inactive hexamer comprising a trimer of dimers, which limits its substrate access and prevents nonspecific degradation. The adaptor protein LbcA is a right-handed open spiral with 11 tetratricopeptide repeats, which might wrap around a substrate to deliver it to CtpA for degradation. By structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, we also showed that the interfaces of the CtpA trimer-of-dimers, and an N-terminal helix of LbcA, are important for LbcA-mediated substrate degradation by CtpA both in vitro and in vivo. This work improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of a CTP within the C-terminal processing peptidase-3 group.\n\nIMPORTANCECarboxyl-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are found in all three domains of life. In bacteria, some CTPs have been associated with virulence, raising the possibility that they could be theraputic targets. However, relatively little is known about their molecular mechanisms of action. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, CtpA supports virulence by working in complex with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade cell wall hydrolases. Here, we report structure-function analyses of CtpA and LbcA, which reveals that CtpA assembles into an inactive hexamer comprising a trimer of dimers. LbcA is monomeric, with an N-terminal region important for binding to and activating CtpA, followed by a spiral structure composed of 11 tetratricopetide repeats, which could wrap around a substrate for delivery to CtpA. This work provides the first structure of a CTP-3 group member, revealing a unique mutimeric arrangement and insight into how this important proteolytic system functions.",

Bayesian logic prescribes that individuals form probabilistic beliefs about a state by integrating the likelihood of new evidence with their prior beliefs, but human neuroimaging studies on probability representations have not typically examined this integration process. We developed an inference fMRI task in which participants estimated the posterior probability of a hidden state while we parametrically modulated the prior probability of the state, the likelihood of the supporting evidence, and a monetary penalty for estimation inaccuracy. Consistent with a neural substrate for Bayesian integration, activation in left posterior parietal cortex tracked the estimated posterior probability of the solicited state and its components of prior probability and likelihood, all independently of expected value. This activation further reflected deviations in individual reports from objective probabilities. Thus, this region may provide a neural substrate for humans ability to approximate Bayesian inference.",

    "abstract": "The formation of connections within the mammalian neocortex is highly regulated by both extracellular guidance mechanisms and intrinsic gene expression programs. There are generally two types of cortical projection neurons: those that project locally and interhemispherically, and those that project to sub-cerebral structures such as the thalamus, hindbrain, and spinal cord. The regulation of cortical projection morphologies is not yet fully understood at the molecular level. Here we report a role for Mllt11 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to chromosome 11/All1 Fused Gene From Chromosome 1q) in the migration and neurite outgrowth of callosal projection neurons during brain formation. We show that Mllt11 expression is exclusive to developing neurons and is enriched in the developing cortical plate, particularly during the formation of the upper or superficial cortical layers. In cultured primary cortical neurons, Mllt11 is detected in varicosities and growth cones as well as the soma. Using conditional loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis we show that Mllt11 is a required for neuritogenesis and proper migration of upper layer cortical projection neurons. Loss of Mllt11 in the superficial cortex leads to a severe reduction in fibres crossing the corpus callosum, a progressive loss in the maintenance of upper layer projection neuron gene expression, and dysplasia of dendritic arborisation patterns. Proteomic analysis revealed that Mllt11 associates with cytoskeletal components including stabilized microtubules consistent with a role in neuronal migration and neuritogenesis. Taken together, our findings support a role for Mllt11 in promoting the formation of mature projection neuron morphologies and connectivity in the cerebral cortex.",

Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of Arpin bound to Arp2/3 complex at 3.24-[A] resolution. Unexpectedly, Arpin binds Arp2/3 complex similarly to WASP-family nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) that activate the complex. However, whereas NPFs bind to two sites on Arp2/3 complex, on Arp2-ArpC1 and Arp3, Arpin only binds to the site on Arp3. Like NPFs, Arpin has a C-helix that binds at the barbed end of Arp3. Mutagenesis studies in vitro and in cells reveal how sequence differences within this helix define the molecular basis for inhibition by Arpin vs. activation by NPFs.",

    "abstract": "Trimethyl glycine, or betaine, is an amino acid derivative found in diverse organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. It can function as an osmolyte to protect cells against osmotic stress, and building evidence suggests betaine may also play important functional roles in the nervous system. However, despite growing interest in betaines roles in the nervous system, few molecular mechanisms have been elucidated. Here we identify the expression of betaine synthesis pathway genes in the nervous system of the nematode worm, C. elegans. We show that betaine, produced in a single pair of interneurons, the RIMs, can control complex behavioural states. Moreover, we also identify and characterise a new betaine-gated inhibitory ligand gated ion channel, LGC-41, which is required for betaine related behavioural changes. Intriguingly we observed expression of LGC-41 in punctate structures across several sensory and interneurons, including those synaptically connected to the RIMs. Our data presents a neuronal molecular mechanism for the action of betaine, via a specific receptor, in the control of complex behaviour within the nervous system of C. elegans. This may suggest a much broader role for betaine in the regulation of animal nervous systems than previously recognised.",

Here, we show that IFT of radial spokes in Chlamydomonas requires ARMC2/PF27, a conserved armadillo repeat protein associated with male infertility and reduced lung function. Chlamydomonas ARMC2 was highly enriched in growing flagella and tagged ARMC2 and the spoke protein RSP3 comigrated on anterograde trains. In contrast, a cargo and an adapter of inner and outer dynein arms moved independently of ARMC2, indicating that unrelated cargoes distribute stochastically onto the IFT trains. After concomitant unloading at the flagellar tip, RSP3 attached to the axoneme whereas ARMC2 diffused back to the cell body. In armc2/pf27 mutants, IFT of radial spokes was abolished and the presence of radial spokes was limited to the proximal region of flagella. We conclude that ARMC2 is a cargo adapter required for IFT of radial spokes to ensure their assembly along flagella. ARMC2 belongs to a growing class of cargo-specific adapters that enable flagellar transport of preassembled axonemal substructures by IFT.",

    "abstract": "Cell size varies between cell types but is tightly regulated by cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Cell-size control is important for cell function and changes in cell size are frequently observed in cancer cells. Here we uncover a non-canonical role of SETD2 in regulating cell size. SETD2 is a lysine methyltransferase and a tumor suppressor protein involved in transcription regulation, RNA processing and DNA repair. At the molecular level, SETD2 is best known for associating with RNA polymerase II through its Set2-Rbp1 interacting (SRI) domain and methylating histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36) during transcription. Although most of SETD2s cellular functions have been linked to this activity, several non-histone substrates of SETD2 have recently been identified - some of which have been linked to novel functions of SETD2 beyond chromatin regulation. Using multiple, independent perturbation strategies we identify SETD2 as a negative regulator of global protein synthesis rates and cell size. We provide evidence that this function is dependent on the catalytic activity of SETD2 but independent of H3K36 methylation. Paradoxically, ectopic overexpression of a decoy SRI domain also increased cell size, suggesting that the relevant substrate is engaged by SETD2 via its SRI domain. These data add a central role of SETD2 in regulating cellular physiology and warrant further studies on separating the different functions of SETD2 in cancer development.",

    "abstract": "During development, integration of temporal patterning and spatial patterning of neural progenitors as well as Notch-dependent binary fate choice between sister neurons contribute to generation of neural diversity. How these upstream neural fate specification programs regulate downstream effector genes to control axon targeting and neuropil assembly remains less well-understood. Here we show that Notch-dependent binary fate choice in Drosophila medulla neurons regulates the expression of Netrin, and that Netrin pathway controls axon guidance of transmedullary (Tm) neurons and contributes to the organization of optic lobe neuropils. Netrins are enriched in the lobula where Tm axons target, and the attractive receptor Frazzled is expressed broadly in medulla neurons, while the repulsive receptor Unc-5 is excluded from Tm neurons and this is necessary for their correct targeting to the lobula. Frazzled is required collectively in a group of early-born Tm neurons to establish the inner optic chiasm (IOC) through which Tm axons target lobula. In addition, Frazzled acts in the layer-specific targeting step of Tm3 and Tm4 cell-autonomously, and is also required for the formation of the lobula branch of TmY3. Moreover, we show that the diffusibility of Netrins is necessary for Netrin enrichment in the lobula, the IOC formation and layer-specific targeting of Tm3 and Tm4. Netrin enrichment in the lobula is promoted by Frazzled expressed in Tm neurons, while Unc-5 appears to have an opposite role in Netrin distribution. Furthermore, we show that Netrin B is expressed in the Notch-on hemilineage of medulla neurons including most Tm and TmY neurons that target lobula, and loss of Su(H) abolished NetB expression in the medulla. Without medulla-originated NetB, Tm axons from late-born medulla columns cannot join the IOC. Therefore, the Notch-dependent binary fate choice regulates the assembly of the optic lobe neuropils by controlling the expression of Netrin.",

    "abstract": "Biomembranes adopt varying morphologies that are vital to cellular functions. Many studies use computational modeling to understand how various mechanochemical factors contribute to membrane shape transformations. Compared to approximation-based methods (e.g., finite element method), the class of discrete mesh models offers greater flexibility to simulate complex physics and shapes in three dimensions; its formulation produces an efficient algorithm while maintaining coordinate-free geometric descriptions. However, ambiguities in geometric definitions in the discrete context have led to a lack of consensus on which discrete mesh model is theoretically and numerically optimal; a bijective relationship between the terms contributing to both the energy and forces from the discrete and smooth geometric theories remains to be established. We address this and present an extensible framework, Mem3DG, for modeling 3D mechanochemical dynamics of membranes based on Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) on triangulated meshes. The formalism of DDG resolves the inconsistency and provides a unifying perspective on how to relate the smooth and discrete energy and forces. To demonstrate, Mem3DG is used to model a sequence of examples with increasing mechanochemical complexity: recovering classical shape transformations such as 1) biconcave disk, dumb-bell, and unduloid and 2) spherical bud on spherical, flat-patch membrane; investigating how the coupling of membrane mechanics with protein mobility jointly affects phase and shape transformation. As high-resolution 3D imaging of membrane ultrastructure becomes more readily available, we envision Mem3DG to be applied as an end-to-end tool to simulate realistic cell geometry under user-specified mechanochemical conditions.\n\nWhy it mattersCellular membranes have shapes and shape changes which characterize cells/organelles, and support nutrient trafficking among other critical processes. Modeling membrane shape changes using mechanical principles can provide insight into how cells robustly bend membranes to support life. Mathematical and computational strategies to solve the equations describing membrane shape evolution can be complex and challenging without simplifying assumptions. Here, we present a new, general, numerical approach to model arbitrary 3D membrane shapes in response to interaction with curvature sensing and generating membrane proteins. The accompanying implementation, Mem3DG, is a software tool to make computational membrane mechanics accessible to the general researcher.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIntroduces a discrete theory for membrane mechanics which connects with smooth theory\nC_LIO_LIDiscrete energy/force are functions of basic geometric quantities\nC_LIO_LIRecipes for extending the discrete framework with additional physics are provided\nC_LIO_LIDescribes a user-friendly software implementation called Mem3DG\nC_LIO_LIMem3DG is designed to facilitate modeling in tandem with experimental studies\nC_LI\n\nSignificance and noveltyHelfrich Hamiltonian is widely used to model biomembranes. Many numerical methods have been developed to solve the geometric PDE. Compared to approximation-based methods, discrete-mesh-based models have many advantages when incorporating multiphysics in 3D due to their flexibility, efficiency, and straightforward implementation. However, there is no consensus on which mesh-based model is optimal, and a connection between the discrete and smooth geometric theory remains obscure. In this work, we provide a unifying perspective by identifying fundamental geometric invariants of the discrete force derived from a discrete energy. As a demonstration of generality of the framework to various physics, we follow a formulaic procedure to derive additional physics such as interfacial line tension, surface-bulk adsorption, protein lateral diffusion, and curvature-dependent protein aggregation.",

    "abstract": "The robust modularity of biological components that are assembled into complex functional systems is central to synthetic biology. Here we apply modular \"plug and play\" design principles to a microscale solid phase protein display system that enables protein purification and functional assays for biotherapeutics. Specifically, we capture protein molecules from cell lysates on polyacrylamide hydrogel display beads ( PHD beads), made in microfluidic droplet generators. These monodisperse PHD beads are decorated with predefined amounts of anchors, methacrylate-PEG-benzylguanine (BG) and methacrylate-PEG-chloroalkane (CA). Anchors form covalent bonds with fusion proteins bearing cognate tag recognition (SNAP and Halo-tags) in specific, orthogonal and stable fashion. Given that these anchors are copolymerised throughout the 3D structure of the beads, proteins are also distributed across the entire bead sphere, allowing attachment of [~]109 protein molecules per bead (O 20 m). This mode of attachment reaches a higher density than possible on widely used surface-modified beads, and additionally mitigates surface effects that often complicate studies with proteins on beads. We showcase a diverse array of protein modules that enable the secondary capture of proteins, either non-covalently (IgG and SUMO-tag) or covalently (SpyCatcher, SpyTag, SnpCatcher and SnpTag). Proteins can be displayed in their monomeric forms, but also reformatted as a multivalent display (using secondary capture modules that create branches) to test the contributions of avidity and multivalency towards protein function. Finally, controlled release of modules by irradiation of light is achieved by incorporating the photocleavable protein PhoCl: irradiation severs the displayed protein from the solid support, so that functional assays can be carried out in solution. As a demonstration of the utility of valency engineering, an antibody drug screen is performed, in which an anti-TRAIL-R1 scFv protein is released into solution as monomers-hexamers, showing a [~]50-fold enhanced potency in the pentavalent format. The ease of protein purification on solid support, quantitative control over presentation and release of proteins and choice of valency make this experimental format a versatile, modular platform for large scale functional analysis of proteins, in bioassays of protein-protein interactions, enzymatic catalysis and bacteriolysis.\n\nTable of Contents Graphics\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=197 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/466587v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57ad85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@410238org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f8d6c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc4366_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we developed an algorithm to recover both shared and tumor type specific programs and used it to analyze a scRNA-seq compendium of 38,852 CD8+ T cells from 141 patients spanning nine different human cancers. We uncovered a pan-cancer T cell dysfunction program that was predictive of clinical responses to immunotherapy and highlighted CXCR6 as a pan-cancer marker of dysfunctional T cells. In mouse models, CXCR6 increased following checkpoint blockade and was repressed by TCF1. Its ligand, CXCL16, was expressed primarily by myeloid cells, and was co-regulated with antigen presentation genes. CXCR6 deletion decreased Tox, CX3CR1, and Bcl2 expression, predisposing dysfunctional PD-1+Tim3+CD8+ T cells to apoptosis, and compromising tumor growth control. Our approach discovered a TCF1:CXCR6-CXCL16 regulatory axis essential for effective anti-tumor immunity, revealing a new perspective on T cell dysfunction and new opportunities for modulating this cell state.",

    "abstract": "Productive viral infection begins with attachment to a susceptible cell, and viruses have evolved complex mechanisms to attach to and subsequently enter cells. Prior to engagement with a cellular receptor, viruses frequently interact with nonspecific attachment factors that can facilitate virus-receptor interactions and viral entry. Polyamines, small positively-charged molecules abundant in mammalian cells, mediate viral attachment, though the mechanism was not fully understood. Using the Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) enterovirus model system, we show that polyamines mediate viral attachment both directly and indirectly. The polyamine putrescine specifically enhances viral attachment to cells depleted of polyamines. Putrescines positive charge mediates its ability to enhance viral attachment, and polyamine analogs are less efficient at mediating viral attachment. In addition to this direct role of polyamines in attachment, polyamines facilitate the cellular expression of heparan sulfates, negatively-charged molecules found on the cell surface. In polyamine-depleted cells, heparan sulfates are depleted from the surface of cells, resulting in reduced viral attachment. We find that this is due to polyamines role in the process of hypusination of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A, which facilitates cellular translation. These data highlight the important role of polyamines in mediating cellular attachment, as well as their function in facilitating cellular heparan sulfate synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity monitoring is important for the conservation of natural ecosystems in general, but particularly for amphibians, whose populations are pronouncedly declining. However, amphibians ecological traits (e.g., nocturnal or aquatic) often prevent their precise monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding--analysis of extra-organismal DNA released into the environment--allows the easy and effective monitoring of the biodiversity of aquatic organisms. Here, we developed and tested the utility of original PCR primer sets. First, we conducted in vitro PCR amplification tests with universal primer candidates using total DNA extracted from amphibian tissues. Five primer sets successfully amplified the target DNA fragments (partial 16S rRNA gene fragments of 160-311 bp) from all 16 taxa tested (from the three living amphibian orders Anura, Caudata, and Gymnophiona). Next, we investigated the taxonomic resolution retrieved using each primer set. The results revealed that the universal primer set \"Amph16S\" had the highest resolution among the tested sets. Finally, we applied Amph16S to actual metabarcoding and evaluated its detection capability by comparing the species detected using eDNA and physical survey (capture-based sampling and visual survey) in multiple agricultural ecosystems across Japan (160 sites in 10 areas). The eDNA metabarcoding with Amph16S detected twice as many species as the physical surveys (16 vs. 8 species, respectively), indicating the effectiveness of Amph16S in biodiversity monitoring and ecological research for amphibian communities.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs around the world are under threat from anomalous heat waves that are causing the widespread decline of hard corals. Different coral taxa are known to have different sensitivities to heat, although variation in susceptibilities have also been observed within the same species living in different environments. Characterizing such taxa-specific variations is key to enforcing efficient reef conservation strategies.\n\nHere, we combine worldwide-reef-survey data with remote sensed environmental variables to evaluate how local differences in taxa-specific coral cover are associated with past trends of thermal anomalies, as well as of non-heat related conditions. While the association with non-heat related environmental variation was seldom significant, we found that heat stress trends matched local differences in coral cover. Coral taxa were sorted based on the different patterns of associations with heat stress.\n\nFor branching, tabular and corymbose Acroporidae, reefs exposed to recent heat stress (measured the year before the survey) had lower coral cover than locally expected; and among these reefs, those previously exposed to frequent past heat stress (measured since 1985) displayed relatively higher coral cover, compared to those less frequently exposed. For massive and encrusting Poritidae, and for meandroid Favidae and Mussidae, we observed a negative association of coral cover with recent heat stress; however, unlike with Acroporidae, these associations were weaker and did not vary with past heat exposure. For Pocilloporidae, we found a positive association between coral cover and recent heat stress for reefs frequently exposed to past heat, while we found a negative association at reefs less frequently exposed to past heat. A similar pattern was observed for the branching Poritidae, although the associations were weaker and not statistically significant.\n\nOverall, these results show taxa-specific heat association patterns that might correspond to taxa-specific responses to past heat exposure, such as shifts in the assembly of coral communities, evolutionary adaptation or physiological acclimation.",

    "abstract": "Herbarium collections shape our understanding of the worlds flora and are crucial for addressing global change and biodiversity conservation. The formation of such natural history collections, however, are not free from sociopolitical issues of immediate relevance. Despite increasing efforts addressing issues of representation and colonialism in natural history collections, herbaria have received comparatively less attention. While it has been noted that the majority of plant specimens are housed in the global North, the extent of this disparity has not been rigorously quantified to date. Here, by analyzing over 85 million specimen records and surveying herbaria across the globe, we assess the colonial legacy of botanical collections and how we may move towards a more inclusive future. We demonstrate that colonial exploitation has contributed to an inverse relationship between where plant biodiversity exists in nature and where it is housed in herbaria. Such disparities persist in herbaria across physical and digital realms despite overt colonialism having ended over half a century ago, suggesting ongoing digitization and decolonization efforts have yet to alleviate colonial-era discrepancies. We emphasize the need for acknowledging the inconvenient history of herbarium collections and the implementation of a more equitable, global paradigm for their collection, curation, and use.",

    "abstract": "In nature, populations are subjected to a wide variety of environmental conditions that affect fitness and induce adaptive or plastic responses in traits, resulting in phenotypic divergence between populations. The dimensionality of that divergence, however, remains contentious. At the extremes, some contend that populations diverge along a single axis of trait covariance with greatest availability of heritable variation, even if this does not lead a population directly to its fitness optimum. Those at the other extreme argue that selection can push populations towards their fitness optima along multiple phenotype axes simultaneously, resulting in divergence in numerous dimensions. Here, we address this debate using populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in the Cook Inlet region of southern Alaska from lakes with contrasting ecological conditions. We calculated effective dimensionality of divergence in several trait suites (defensive, swimming, and trophic) thought to be under correlated selection pressures, as well as across all traits. We also tested for integration among the trait suites and between each trait suite and the environment. We found that populations in the Cook Inlet radiation exhibit dimensionality of phenotype high enough to preclude a single axis of divergence.",

    "abstract": "Captive populations often harbor variation that is not present in the wild due to artificial selection. Recent efforts to map this variation have provided insights into the genetic and molecular basis of variation. Heliconius butterflies display a large array of pattern variants in the wild and the genetic basis of these patterns has been well-described. Here we sought to identify the genetic basis of an unusual pattern variant that is instead found in captivity, the ivory mutant, in which all scales on both the wings and body become white or yellow. Using a combination of autozygosity mapping and coverage analysis from 37 captive individuals, we identify a 78kb deletion at the cortex wing patterning locus as the ivory mutation. This deletion is undetected among 458 wild Heliconius genomes samples, and its dosage explains both homozygous and heterozygous ivory phenotypes found in captivity. The deletion spans a large 5 region of the cortex gene that includes a facultative 5UTR exon detected in larval wing disk transcriptomes. CRISPR mutagenesis of this exon replicates the wing phenotypes from coding knock-outs of cortex, consistent with a functional role of ivory-deleted elements in establishing scale color fate. Population demographics reveal that the stock giving rise to the ivory mutant has a mixed origin from across the wild range of H. melpomene, and supports a scenario where the ivory mutation occurred after the introduction of cortex haplotypes from Ecuador. Homozygotes for the ivory deletion are inviable, joining 40 other examples of allelic variants that provide heterozygous advantage in animal populations under artificial selection by fanciers and breeders. Finally, our results highlight the promise of autozygosity and association mapping for identifying the genetic basis of aberrant mutations in captive insect populations.",

Here, we leverage eDNA metabarcoding to characterize nearshore fish communities near Juneau, Alaska, USA, a high-latitude environment with large tidal swings, strong currents, and significant freshwater input. We investigated whether species richness and community composition differed across three habitat types (sand beaches, eelgrass beds, and rocky shorelines) and between high and low tides. Additionally, we tested whether replication of field samples and PCR reactions influenced either species richness or composition. We amplified a 12S mitochondrial locus in our samples and identified 188 fish amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), corresponding to 21 unique taxa, with approximately half of these resolved to single species. Species richness and composition inferred from eDNA differed substantially among habitats, with rock habitats containing fewer taxa and fewer overall detections than sand and eelgrass habitats. The effect of tide was more subtle and suggested a habitat-tide interaction, with differences in taxa between tides largely isolated to sand habitats. Power analyses indicated that additional field sampling is useful to detect subtle changes in species richness such as those due to tide. PCR replicates typically identified a small number of additional taxa. The most notable result from our study was that shore morphology appeared to substantially influence community structure. Rocky shorelines sloped quickly into deep water, while sand and eelgrass habitats descended much more gradually. We hypothesize that differences in taxa observed among habitats were largely due to lack of mixing between bottom and surface water, providing further evidence that eDNA transport is minimal and that many marine eDNA detections are derived from highly localized sampling locations. We suggest that future studies could explore the extent to which habitat and nearshore physical processes influence eDNA detections.",

    "abstract": "Beta cells intrinsically contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the genes and molecular processes that mediate beta cell survival in T1D remain largely unknown. We combined high throughput functional genomics and human genetics to identify T1D risk loci regulating genes affecting beta cell survival in response to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IFN{gamma}, and TNF. We mapped 38,931 cytokine-responsive candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) active in beta cells using ATAC-seq and single nuclear ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq), and linked cytokine-responsive beta cell cCREs to putative target genes using single cell co-accessibility and HiChIP. We performed a genome-wide pooled CRISPR loss-of-function screen in EndoC-{beta}H1 cells, which identified 867 genes affecting cytokine-induced beta cell loss. Genes that promoted beta cell survival and had up-regulated expression in cytokine exposure were specifically enriched at T1D loci, and these genes were preferentially involved in inhibiting inflammatory response, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, mitophagy and autophagy. We identified 2,229 variants in cytokine-responsive beta cell cCREs altering transcription factor (TF) binding using high-throughput SNP-SELEX, and variants altering binding of TF families regulating stress, inflammation and apoptosis were broadly enriched for T1D association. Finally, through integration with genetic fine mapping, we annotated T1D loci regulating beta cell survival in cytokine exposure. At the 16p13 locus, a T1D variant affected TF binding in a cytokine-induced beta cell cCRE that physically interacted with the SOCS1 promoter, and increased SOCS1 activity promoted beta cell survival in cytokine exposure. Together our findings reveal processes and genes acting in beta cells during cytokine exposure that intrinsically modulate risk of T1D.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke causes brain endothelial cell (BEC) death and damages tight junction integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We harnessed the innate mitochondrial load of endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and utilized mixtures of EV/exogenous heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) as a one-two punch strategy to increase BEC survival (via EV mitochondria) and preserve their tight junction integrity (via HSP27 effects). We demonstrated that the medium-to-large (m/lEV) but not small EVs (sEV) transferred their mitochondrial load, which subsequently colocalized with the mitochondrial network of the recipient primary human BECs. BECs treated with m/lEVs increased relative ATP levels and displayed superior mitochondrial function. Importantly, m/lEVs isolated from oligomycin (mitochondrial complex V inhibitor) or rotenone (mitochondrial complex I inhibitor)-exposed BECs (RTN-m/lEVs or OGM-m/lEVs) did not increase BECs ATP levels compared to naive m/lEVs. In contrast, RTN-sEV and OGM-sEV functionality in increasing cellular ATP levels was minimally impacted in comparison to naive sEVs. Intravenously administered m/lEVs showed a reduction in brain infarct sizes compared to vehicle-injected mice in a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic stroke. We formulated binary mixtures of human recombinant HSP27 protein with EVs: EV/HSP27 and ternary mixtures of HSP27 and EV with cationic polymer poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly (diethyltriamine): (PEG-DET/HSP27)/EV. (PEG-DET/HSP27)/EV and EV/HSP27 mixtures decreased the paracellular permeability of small and large molecular mass fluorescent tracers in oxygen glucose-deprived primary human BECs. This one-two-punch approach to increase BEC metabolic function and tight junction integrity is a promising strategy for BBB protection and prevention of long-term neurological dysfunction post-ischemic stroke.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/466491v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc5493org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134ad7forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a8929org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15315bc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIMedium-to-large extracellular vesicles (m/lEVs), not small EVs contain mitochondria\nC_LIO_LIm/lEVs increased ATP and mitochondrial function in brain endothelial cells (BECs)\nC_LIO_LIm/lEVs from oligomycin-exposed BECs did not increase recipient BEC ATP levels\nC_LIO_LIIntravenously injected m/lEVs reduced brain infarct sizes in a mouse stroke model\nC_LIO_LIEV/HSP27 mixtures reduced small and large dextran molecule permeability across BECs\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStructural variations (SVs) pervade the genome and contribute substantially to the phenotypic diversity of species. However, most SVs were ineffectively assayed because of the complexity of plant genomes and the limitations of sequencing technologies. Recent advancement of third-generation sequencing technologies, particularly the PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing, which generates both long and highly accurate reads, offers an unprecedented opportunity to characterize SVs and reveal their functionality. Since HiFi sequencing is new, it is crucial to evaluate HiFi reads in SV detection before applying the technology at scale.\n\nResultsWe sequenced wheat genomes using HiFi, then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of SV detection using mainstream long-read aligners and SV callers. The results showed the accuracy of SV discovery depends more on aligners rather than callers. For aligners, pbmm2 and NGMLR provided the most accurate results while detecting deletion and insertion, respectively. Likewise, cuteSV and SVIM achieved the best performance across all SV callers. We demonstrated that the combination of the aligners and callers mentioned above is optimal for SV detection. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of sequencing depth on the accuracy of SV detection. The results showed that low-coverage HiFi sequencing is capable of generating high-quality SV genotyping.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides a robust benchmark of SV discovery with HiFi reads, showing the remarkable potential of long-read sequencing to investigate structural variations in plant genomes. The high accuracy SV discovery from low-coverage HiFi sequencing indicates that skim HiFi sequencing is an ideal approach to study structural variations at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological surveillance of bacterial pathogens requires real-time data analysis with a fast turn-around, while aiming at generating two main outcomes: 1) Species level identification; and 2) Variant mapping at different levels of genotypic resolution for population-based tracking, in addition to predicting traits such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR). With the recent advances and continual dissemination of whole-genome sequencing technologies, large-scale population-based genotyping of bacterial pathogens has become possible. Since bacterial populations often present a high degree of clonality in the genomic backbone (i.e., low genetic diversity), the choice of genotyping scheme can even facilitate the understanding of ancestral relationships and can be used for prediction of co-inherited traits such as AMR. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) fits that purpose and can identify sequence types (ST) based on seven ubiquitous genome-scattered loci that aid in genotyping isolates beneath the species level. ST-based mapping also standardizes genotyping across laboratories and is used by laboratories worldwide. However, algorithms for inferring ST from Illumina paired-end sequencing data typically rely on genome assembly prior to classification. Genome assembly is computationally intensive and is a bottleneck for speed and scalability, which are important aspects of genomic epidemiology. The stringMLST program uses an assembly-free, kmer-based algorithm for inferring STs, which can overcome the speed and scalability bottlenecks. Here we have systematically studied the accuracy and scalability of stringMLST relative to the standard MLST program across a wide array of phylogenetically divergent Public Health-relevant bacterial pathogens. Our data shows that optimal kmer length for stringMLST is species-specific and that genome-intrinsic and -extrinsic features can affect performance and accuracy of the program. While suitable parameters could be identified for most organisms, there were a few instances where this program may not be directly deployable in its current format. More importantly, we integrated stringMLST into our freely available and scalable hierarchical-based population genomics platform, ProkEvo, and further demonstrated how the implementation facilitates automated, reproducible bacterial population analysis. The ProkEvo implementation provides a rapidly deployable genomic epidemiology tool for ST mapping along with other pan-genomic data mining strategies, while providing specific guidance on how to optimize stringMLST performance for a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "We present the first electronic mapping of a bacterial genome using solid-state nanopore technology. A dual-nanopore architecture and active control logic are used to produce single-molecule data that enables estimation of distances between physical tags installed at sequence motifs within double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Previously developed dual-pore \"DNA flossing\" control generates multiple scans of tagged regions of each captured DNA. The control logic was extended here in two ways: first, to automate \"zooming out\" on each molecule to progressively increase the number of tags scanned during DNA flossing; and second, to automate recapture of a molecule that exited flossing to enable interrogation of the same and/or different regions of the molecule. New analysis methods were developed to produce consensus alignments from each multi-scan event. The combined multi-scanning and multi-capture method was applied to the challenge of mapping from a heterogeneous mixture of single-molecule fragments that make up the Escherichia coli (E. coli) chromosome. Coverage of 3.1x across 2,355 resolvable sites (68% of reference sites) of the E. coli genome was achieved after 5.6 hours of recording time. The recapture method showed a 38% increase in the merged-event alignment length compared to single-scan alignments. The observed inter-tag resolution was 150 bp in engineered DNA molecules and 166 bp natively within fragments of E. coli DNA, with detection of 133 inter-site intervals shorter than 200 bp in the E. coli reference map. Proof of concept results on estimating distances in repetitive regions of the E. coli genome are also provided. With an appropriately designed array and future refinements to the control logic, higher throughput implementations can enable human-sized genome and epigenome mapping applications.",

Moreover, several single-point mutations are associated with early-onset forms of AD.

We analyzed the simulations using the Energy Landscape Visualization Method (ELViM), a reaction coordinate-free approach suited to explore the frustrated energy landscapes of intrinsically disordered proteins.

This energy is reflected in water occupancy as a function of solute surface position, which can be probed computationally using WATMD software.

We show that in this context Lp supports its hosts growth through a molecular dialog that requires functional operons encoding ribosomal and transfer RNAs (r/tRNAs) in Lp and the GCN2 kinase in Drosophilas enterocytes. Our data indicate Lps r/tRNAs are packaged in extracellular vesicles and activate GCN2 in a subset of larval enterocytes, a mechanism necessary to remodel the intestinal transcriptome and ultimately to support anabolic growth.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria transfer can rescue oocyte aging-related infertility. However, heterologous techniques are suspended due to heteroplasmy. Regarding autologous approaches, the donor source and manipulating procedures require further optimization. Here we propose a strategy using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) as mitochondria donor cells and employing intercellular mitochondria transport as the transfer method. We cryopreserved UC-MSCs of the female pup. When the female aged, its UC-MSCs were induced into granulosa cells (iGCs). The zona-weakened GV oocytes were aggregated with autologous iGCs into iGC-oocyte complexes. After cultivation in GDF9-containing media, mitochondria migrated from iGCs into the GV oocyte via transzonal filopodia. The maturation rate, quality, and developmental potential of these oocytes were substantially increased. Furthermore, the birth rate after embryo transfer has been improved. This approach utilized noninvasive procedures to collect mitochondria donor cells and optimized mitochondria transfer manipulations, so may represent a promising advance towards the improvement of aging-related infertility.",

    "abstract": "Avian vocal individuality carries information that can be utilized as an alternative to physical tagging of individuals. However, it is rarely used in conservation tasks despite rapidly-expanding use of passive acoustic monitoring techniques. Reliable acoustic individual recognizers and accurate quantifiers of population size remain elusive, which discourages the use of vocal individuality for monitoring, wildlife management, and ecological research. We propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that allows discrimination of individuals by their calls, the discovery of unexpected individuals in a set of recordings, and estimation of population size using solely sound. Our method, tested using data collected in the wild, allows rapid individual identification and even acoustic censusing without prior information from the recorded individuals. We achieve this by integrating a fuzzy classification and clustering methodology (LAMDA) into a Convolutional Deep Clustering Neural Network (CDCN). Our approach will benefit monitoring for conservation, and paves the way towards robust individual acoustic identification in species whose handling is time-consuming, culturally or ethically problematic, or logistically difficult.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo better understand the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we used sequence data from patients seen at the University of Utah to identify novel disease-associated loci. We utilized both in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the biological effect of patient mutations in MFN2.\n\nMethodSequence data for a total of 140 patients were run through VAAST and Phevor to determine genes that were more burdened with rare, nonsynonymous variants compared to control longevity cohort. Variants identified in MFN2 were expressed in Mfn2 knockout cells to determine if mutant MFN2 could rescue mitochondrial morphology defects. We identified additional rare, nonsynonymous variants in MFN2 in ALSdb that were expressed in knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Membrane potential was measured to quantify mitochondrial health upon mutant MFN2 expression. mfn2 knockout zebrafish were used to examine movement compared to wildtype and protein aggregation in brain.\n\nResultsMFN2 mutations identified in ALS patients from our University of Utah cohort and ALSdb were defective in rescuing morphological defects in Mfn2 knockout MEFs. Selected mutants showed decreased membrane potential compared to wildtype MFN2 expression. Zebrafish heterozygous and homozygous for loss of mfn2 showed increased TDP-43 levels in their hindbrain and cerebellum.\n\nConclusionIn total, 21 rare, deleterious mutations in MFN2 were tested in Mfn2 knockout MEFs. Mutant MFN2 expression was not able to rescue the knockout phenotype, though at differing degrees of severity. Decreased membrane potential also argues for inhibited mitochondrial function. Increased TDP-43 levels in mutant zebrafish illustrates MFN2s function in ALS pathology. MFN2 variants influence ALS pathology and highlight the importance of mitochondria in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "In cell matrix adhesions, integrin receptors and associated proteins provide a dynamic coupling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton. This allows bidirectional transmission of forces between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, which tunes intracellular signaling cascades that control survival, proliferation, differentiation, and motility. The quantitative relationships between recruitment of distinct cell matrix adhesion proteins and local cellular traction forces are not known. Here, we applied quantitative superresolution microscopy to cell matrix adhesions formed on fibronectin-stamped elastomeric pillars and developed an approach to relate the number of talin, vinculin, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) molecules to the local cellular traction force. We find that FAK recruitment does not show an association with traction-force application whereas a ~60 pN force increase is associated with the recruitment of one talin, two vinculin, and two paxillin molecules on a substrate of effective stiffness of 47 kPa. On a substrate with a four-fold lower effective stiffness the stoichiometry of talin:vinculin:paxillin changes to 2:12:6 for the same ~60 pN traction force. The relative change in force-related vinculin recruitment indicates a stiffness-dependent switch in vinculin function in cell matrix adhesions. Our results reveal a substrate-stiffness-dependent modulation of the relation between cellular traction-force and the molecular stoichiometry of cell-matrix adhesions.",

    "abstract": "Karanjin, an abundantly occurring furanoflavonoid in edible and non-edible legumes, exerts diverse biological effects in vivo, and in vitro. Its potential as an anticancer agent is also gaining traction following recent demonstrations of its anti-proliferative, cell cycle inhibitory, and pro-apoptotic effects. However, the universality of its anticancer potential is yet to be scrutinized, particularly so because flavonoids can act as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Even the genomic correlates of its biological activities are yet to be examined in hormone responsive cells. This paper presents the early and direct transcriptomic footprint of 10 M karanjin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, using next generation sequencing technology (RNA-seq). We show that karanjin-modulated gene-expression repertoire is enriched in several hallmark gene sets, which include early estrogen-response, and G2/M checkpoint genes. Genes modulated by karanjin overlapped with those modulated by 1 nM 17{beta}-estradiol (E2), or 1 M tamoxifen. Karanjin altered the expression of selected estrogen-regulated genes in a cell-type, and concentration dependent manner. It downmodulated the expression of ER protein in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, ER knockdown negatively impacted karanjins ability to modulate the expression of selected E2 target genes. Our data suggest that karanjin exerts its effects on ER-positive breast cancer cells, at least in part, via ER. The apparent SERM-like effects of karanjin pose a caveat to the anticancer potential of karanjin. In-depth studies on cell-type and concentration-dependent effects of karanjin may bring out its true potential in endocrine therapies.",

    "abstract": "Heavy metals are an increasing problem due to contamination from human sources that and can enter the food chain by being taken up by plants. Understanding the genetic basis of accumulation and tolerance in plants is important for reducing the uptake of toxic metals in crops and crop relatives, as well as for removing heavy metals from soils by means of phytoremediation. Following exposure of Medicago truncatula seedlings to cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), we conducted a genome-wide association study using relative root growth (RRG) and leaf accumulation measurements. Cd and Hg accumulation and RRG had heritability ranging 0.44 - 0.72 indicating high genetic diversity for these traits. The Cd and Hg trait associations were broadly distributed throughout the genome, indicated the traits are polygenic and involve several quantitative loci. For all traits, candidate genes included several membrane associated ATP-binding cassette transporters, P-type ATPase transporters, several oxidative stress response genes and stress related UDP-glycosyltransferases. The P-type ATPase transporters and ATP-binding cassette protein-families have roles in vacuole transport of heavy metals, and our findings support their wide use in physiological plant responses to heavy metals and abiotic stresses. We also found associations between Cd RRG with the genes CAX3 and PDR3, two linked adjacent genes, and leaf accumulation of Hg associated with the genes NRAMP6 and CAX9. When plant genotypes with the most extreme phenotypes were compared, we found significant divergence in genomic regions using population genomics methods that contained metal transport and stress response gene ontologies. Several of these genomic regions show high linkage disequilibrium (LD) among candidate genes suggesting they have evolved together. Minor allele frequency (MAF) and effect size of the most significant SNPs was negatively correlated with large effect alleles being most rare. This is consistent with purifying selection against alleles that increase toxicity and abiotic stress. Conversely, the alleles with large affect that had higher frequencies that were associated with the exclusion of Cd and Hg. Overall, macroevolutionary conservation of heavy metal and stress response genes is important for improvement of forage crops by harnessing wild genetic variants in gene banks such as the Medicago HapMap collection.",

Here, we have conducted a transcriptomic study to analyse plant responses to Frankia alni at early stages of symbiosis establishment.\n\nForty-two genes were significantly activated by either with a Frankia culture supernatant or with living cells separated from the roots by a dialysis membrane permitted to identify plant genes which expression changes upon early contact with Frankia. Most of these genes encode biological processes, including oxidative stress and response to stimuli. The most upregulated gene is the non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) encoding gene with a fold change of 141. Physiological experiments showed that nsLTP increases Frankia nitrogen fixation at sub-lethal concentration. Immunohistochemistry experiments conducted at an early infection stage indicated that nsLTP protein is localized at the deformed root hair region after Frankia inoculation and later in nodules, precisely around bacterial vesicles. Taken together, these results suggest that nsLTP acts at early and late stages of symbiosis, probably by increasing nitrogen uptake by Frankia.",

Gaining a deep mechanistic understanding of the biological processes occurring in natural periphyton remains challenging due to the high complexity and variability of such communities. To address this challenge, we rationally developed a workflow to construct a synthetic community by co-culturing 26 phototrophic species (i.e., diatoms, green algae and cyanobacteria) that were inoculated in a successional sequence to create a periphytic biofilm on glass slides. We show that this community is diverse, stable and highly reproducible in terms of microbial composition, function and 3D spatial structure of the biofilm. We also demonstrate the ability to monitor microbial dynamics at the single species level during periphyton development and how their abundances are impacted by stressors such as increased temperature and a herbicide, singly and in combination. Overall, such a synthetic periphyton, grown under controlled conditions, can be used as a model system for theory testing through targeted manipulation.",
