    "abstract": "Propagation of small amyloid beta (A{beta}) aggregates (or seeds) has been suggested as a potential mechanism of Alzheimers disease progression. Monitoring the propagation of A{beta} seeds in an organism would enable testing of this hypothesis and, if confirmed, provide mechanistic insights. This requires a contrast agent for long-term tracking of the seeds. Gold nanorods combine several attractive features for this challenging task, in particular, their strong absorbance in the infrared (enabling optoacoustic imaging) and the availability of several established protocols for surface functionalization. In this work, polymer-coated gold nanorods were conjugated with anti-A{beta} antibodies and specifically attached to pre-formed A{beta} seeds. The resulting complexes were characterized for their optical properties by UV/Vis spectroscopy and multispectral optoacoustic tomography. The complexes retained their biophysical properties, i.e. their ability to seed A{beta} fibril formation. They remained stable in biological media for at least 2 days and showed no toxicity to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells up to 1.5 nM and 6 M of gold nanorods and A{beta} seeds, respectively. Taken together, this study describes the first steps in the development of probes for monitoring the spread of A{beta} seeds in animal models.",

    "abstract": "Brown planthopper resistant NBS-LRR specific R genes (Bph9, Bph14, Bph18, Bph26) have been reported in rice. BPH specific R genes were clustered with other R genes of rice on chromosome 12 (Bph9, Bph18, Bph26) and 3 (Bph14). Motif analysis of BPH specific R genes showed the predominant motifs as CC, NBS and LRR regions. Bph9, Bph18 and Bph26 R genes exhibited high degree of sequence similarity in their CC and NBS region and are considered as functional alleles of BPH resistance at chromosome 12. LRR region of BPH genes were interacting with the elicitor molecules of planthoppers and are the potential lignad binding site. Bph14 exhibited more number of LRR repeats and were interacting efficiently with all the tested salivary elictor molecules of planthoppers. Bph18 with no LRR region exhibited reduced interaction efficiency with the tested elicitor molecules of planthoppers. Our in silico studies confirms that Bph14 R gene resistance protein to be a promising candidate for providing broad spectrum resistance against planthoppers of rice. The study further provides new avenues to investigate the mechanism of receptor-ligand recognition and signaling mechanism against rice planthoppers.",

    "abstract": "The biggest challenge for the reproduction of flood-irrigated rice is to identify superior genotypes that present development of high-yielding varieties with specific grain qualities, resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses in addition to superior adaptation to the target environment.Thus, the objectives of this study were to propose a multi-trait and multi-environment Bayesian model to estimate genetic parameters for the flood-irrigated rice crop. To this end, twenty-five rice genotypes belonging to the flood-irrigated rice breeding program were evaluated. Grain yield and flowering were evaluated in the agricultural year 2017/2018. The experimental design used in all experiments was a randomized block design with three replications. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to estimate genetic parameters and genetic values. The flowering is highly heritable by the Bayesian credibility interval: h2 = 0.039-0.80, and 0.02-0.91, environment 1 and 2, respectively. The genetic correlation between traits was significantly different from zero in the two environments (environment 1: -0.80 to 0.74; environment 2: -0.82 to 0.86. The relationship of CVe and CVg higher for flowering in the reduced model (CVg/CVe= 5.83 and 13.98, environments 1 and 2, respectively). For the complete model, this trait presented an estimate of the relative variation index of: CVe= 4.28 and 4.21, environments 1 and 2, respectively. In summary, the multi-trait and multi-environment Bayesian model allowed a reliable estimate of the genetic parameter of flood-irrigated rice. Bayesian analyzes provide robust inference of genetic parameters. Therefore, we recommend this model for genetic evaluation of flood-irrigated rice genotypes, and their generalization, in other crops. Precise estimates of genetic parameters bring new perspectives on the application of Bayesian methods to solve modeling problems in the genetic improvement of flood-irrigated rice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome often starts in puberty, and its pathogenesis is not clear. This study aimed to explore the pathogenesis of pubertal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and assess the therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture on pubertal PCOS.\n\nMethodsDihydrotestosterone (DHT) was used to induce rat models of pubertal PCOS. pubertal rats with PCOS were randomly divided into a model group (M), an electroacupuncture group (EA), and a sham acupuncture group (SA). Age-matched normal rats were regarded as normal controls (N). Rats were treated with EA or SA five times a week for 25 minutes during their 6th-7th week. At the end of the experiment, we observed any changes in ovarian morphology; detected levels of metabolic indices in serum, the hypothalamus and pancreas.\n\nResultsEA significantly improved estrous cycle disorders and the ovarian polycystic morphology in pubertal rats with PCOS, but SA only improved disorders of the estrous cycle. The serum levels of insulin, neuropeptide Y(NPY) and fasting blood glucose(FBG) increased significantly, while the serum levels of ghrelin(GHRL) decreased in the model group. After treatment with EA, the levels of NPY and FBG went into decrease, whereas the levels of GHRL and insulin increased. There was few differences in the hypothalamic expression of galanin (GAL), galanin-like peptide (GALP) and ghrelin receptor(GHSR) between the four groups. The upregulation of NPY mRNA and neuropeptide Y2 receptor(NPY2R) mRNA and the downregulation of GHRL protein and mRNA in the hypothalamus, and the increased expression of NPY and NPY2R as well as the decreased expression of GHRL in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) can be rescued by EA. But, surprisingly, SA seem to make no difference to the levels of FBG and insulin, and the protein expression of ghrelin in the hypothalamus and ARC. Co-expression of kisspeptin and GHSR, and co-expression of gonadotrophin releasing hormone(GnRH) and NPY2R were observed in ARC. No differences were found between groups in protein of GAL, GALP and GHRL expression in the pancreas. Neither EA nor SA can attenuate the upregulated kisspeptin protein expression in the pancreas of PCOS model rats.\n\nConclusionsEA and SA improved the symptoms of pubertal PCOS rats, and the mechanism might be associated with regulating hypothalamic NPY and ghrelin levels.",

    "abstract": "This survey was conducted to estimate the incidence and level of potential viral contamination in commercially collected porcine plasma. Samples of spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) were collected over a 12-month period from eight spray drying facilities in Spain, England, Northern Ireland, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. In this survey, viral load for several porcine pathogens including SVA, TGEV, PRRSV (EU and US strains), PEDV, PCV2, SIV, SDCoV and PPV were determined by qPCR. Regression of Ct on TCID50 of serial diluted stock solution of each virus allowed the estimate of potential viral level in SDPP and unprocessed liquid plasma (using typical solids content of commercially collected porcine plasma). In this survey SVA, TGEV or SDCoV were not detected in any of the SDPP samples. Brazil SDPP samples were free of PRRSV and PEDV. Samples of SDPP from North America primarily contained the PRRSV-US strain while the European samples contained the PRRSV-EU strain (except for one sample from each region containing a low estimated level of the alternative PRRSV strain). Estimated viral level tended to be low ranging from <1.0 log10 TCID50 to <2.5 log10 TCID50. Estimated level of SIV was the exception with a very low incidence rate but higher estimated viral load <3.9 log10 TCID50. In summary, the incidence of potential viral contamination in commercially collected porcine plasma was variable and estimated virus level in samples containing viral DNA/RNA was low.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated a dramatic increase in our ability to conduct molecular diagnostic tests, as accurate detection of the virus is critical in preventing its spread. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, with each new variant potentially affecting widely-used nucleic acid amplification diagnostic tests. RT-LAMP has emerged as a quick, inexpensive diagnostic alternative to RT-qPCR, but has not been studied as thoroughly. Here we interrogate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 sequence mutations on RT-LAMP amplification, creating 572 single point mutation \"variants\" covering every position of the LAMP primers in 3 SARS-CoV-2 assays and analyzing their effects with over 4,500 RT-LAMP reactions. Remarkably, we observed only minimal effects on amplification speed and no effect on detection sensitivity, highlighting RT-LAMP as an extremely robust technique for viral RNA detection. Additionally, we describe the use of molecular beacons to sensitively identify variant RNA sequences. Together these data add to the growing body of knowledge on the utility of RT-LAMP and increase its potential to further our ability to conduct molecular diagnostic tests outside of the traditional clinical laboratory environment.",

Recently, several haematological models have been developed with CRISPR/Cas9, using viral vectors, because blood cells are hard to transfect. To avoid virus disadvantages, we have developed a strategy to generate CRISPR constructs, by means of PCR, which any lab equipped with basic technology can implement. These PCR-generated constructs enter easily into hard-to-transfect cells. After testing its functionality by editing MYBL2 gene in HEK293 cells, we successfully introduced the R172 mutation in IDH2 gene in NB4 cells that expresses constitutively the Cas9 nuclease. Comparing our methodology with ribonucleoprotein strategies, we found that mutation introduction efficiency was similar between both methodologies, and no off-target events were detected. Our strategy represents a valid alternative to introduce desired mutations in hard to transfect leukemic cells, avoiding using huge vectors or viral transduction.",

    "abstract": "Grain for Green project (GGP) initialed by China government since 1999 has achieved substantial achievements accompanied with surface runoff decrease in the Loess Plateau but impacts of large-scale afforestation on regional water resources are uncertain. Hence, the objective of this study is to explore the impact of land use change on generalized water resources and ecological water stress using blue and green water concept taking Yanhe River Basin as a case study. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is applied to quantify summary of green and blue water which is defined as generalized water resources, ecological water requirement of vegetation (forest and grass), agricultural water footprint and virtual water flow are considered as regional water requirements. Land use types of 1980 (scenario I), 2017 (scenario II) are input in SWAT model while keeps other parameters constant in order to isolate the influence of land use changes. Results show that average annual difference of blue, green and generalized water resources is -72.08 million m3, 24.34 million m3, -47.74 million m3 respectively when simulation results of scenario II subtracts scenario I and it presents that land use change caused by GGP leads to decrease in blue and generalized water resources whereas increase in green water resources. SURQ in scenario I is more than that in scenario IIin all the study period from 1980-2017, green water storage in scenario I is more than that in scenario II in all the study period except in 1998; whereas LATQ in scenario I is less than that in scenario II except in 2000 and 2015, GWQ in 1992, 2000 and 2015, green water flow in 1998. Blue water, green water storage and green water flow in scenario II is less than that in scenario I in the whole basin, 12.89 percent of the basin and 99.21 percent of the basin respectively. Total WF increases from 1995 to 2010 because forest WF increases significantly in this period though agricultural WF and grass WF decreases. Ecological water stress index has no obvious temporal change trend in both land use scenarios but ecological water stress index in scenario II is more than that in scenario I which illustrates that GGP leads to increase of ecological water stress from perspective of generalized water resources",

    "abstract": "We extend a two-step lottery model of Craft et al. to test the hypothesis that oak trees pursue a form of within-flower female choice to increase the diversity of fathers. Oak trees produce six ovules per flower while maturing just one acorn. When assuming a random ovule selection - which is a natural assumption in the absence of other hypotheses - observed fertilization patterns in oaks cannot be explained: long-distance fertilization is unusually common, even as nearby oak trees may be absent as pollen donors. Our model demonstrates how producing multiple ovules per flower permits selection for rare, distant fathers. The number of ovules per flower that maximizes paternal diversity increases with the number of trees. We introduce a cost function for ovule production for which six ovules per flower balance these costs with the benefits of diversifying fathers. Using data from two published field studies, 7 of 8 investigated maternal oaks had actual paternal diversity indices (average diversity index of 15.42) that fit the female choice hypothesis (estimated diversity of 14.66) significantly better than assuming a random selection from the six available ovules (estimated diversity of 7.649). A third field study permitted us to compare paternity by distance classes for two maternal trees. Both fit the female choice model better than random ovule selection.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle regulation is responsible for voluntary muscular movement in vertebrates. The genes of two essential proteins, teneurins and latrophilins (LPHN), evolving in ancestors of multicellular animals, form a ligand-receptor pair, and are now shown to be required for skeletal muscle function. Teneurins possess a bioactive peptide, termed the teneurin C-terminal associated peptide (TCAP) that interacts with the LPHNs to regulate skeletal muscle contractility strength and fatigue by an insulin-independent glucose importation mechanism. CRISPR-based knockouts and siRNA-associated knockdowns of LPHN-1 and-3 shows that TCAP stimulates an LPHN-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ signal transduction cascade to increase energy metabolism and enhance skeletal muscle function via increases in type-1 oxidative fiber formation and reduce the fatigue response. Thus, the teneurin/TCAP-LPHN system is presented as a novel mechanism likely to regulate the energy requirements and performance of skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "Direct utilization of treated effluent from natural treatment systems for irrigation can be challenging on sensitive plants due to high levels of salinity. Post-treatment of such an effluent prior to its applicability in irrigation can be of significant importance. In this study, the wastewater from a natural treatment plant was treated using a lab-scale filtration system with zeolite as a filter material. Three different column depths (0.5 m, 0.75 m, and 1 m) were used to investigate the effect of column depth on the treatment efficiency of the media. The suitability of the raw wastewater and the treated effluent from each column for irrigation purposes was investigated. The water quality parameters investigated were; electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+). From the analysis results, it was observed that the column depth had a significant influence on the removal efficiency of the pollutants. Where the removal efficiency was observed to be increasing with the increase in the column depth. The highest removal efficiency (94.58%) was achieved from the combination of electrical conductivity and 1 m column depth, while the lowest removal efficiency (10.05%) was observed from the combination of calcium and 0.5 m column depth. The raw wastewater fell mostly into a \"very high\" hazard, which is class four (C4) based on electrical conductivity and class four (S4) based sodium adsorption ratio; making it unsuitable for irrigation purposes. However, the status improved after the treatment using different column depths.",
