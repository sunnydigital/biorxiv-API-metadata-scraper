    "abstract": "Healthy neuronal networks rely on homeostatic plasticity to maintain stable firing rates despite changing synaptic drive. These mechanisms, however, can themselves be destabilizing if activated inappropriately or excessively. For example, prolonged activity deprivation can lead to rebound hyperactivity and seizures. While many forms of homeostasis have been described, whether and how the magnitude of homeostatic plasticity is constrained remains unknown. Here we uncover negative regulation of cortical network homeostasis by the PARbZIP family of transcription factors. In cortical slice cultures made from knockout mice lacking all three of these factors, the network response to prolonged activity withdrawal measured with calcium imaging is much stronger, while baseline activity is unchanged. Whole cell recordings reveal an exaggerated increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents reflecting enhanced upregulation of recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission. Genetic analyses reveal that two of the factors, Hlf and Tef, are critical for constraining plasticity and for preventing life-threatening seizures. These data indicate that transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but is also involved in restraint of the response to activity deprivation.",

    "abstract": "The human brain readily learns tasks in sequence without forgetting previous ones. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), on the other hand, need to be modified to achieve similar performance. While effective, many algorithms that accomplish this are based on weight importance methods that do not correspond to biological mechanisms. Here we introduce a simple, biologically plausible, method for enabling effective continual learning in ANNs. We show that it is possible to learn a weight-dependent plasticity function that prevents catastrophic forgetting over multiple tasks. We highlight the effectiveness of our method by evaluating it on a set of MNIST classification tasks. We further find that the use of our method promotes synaptic multi-modality, similar to that seen in biology.",

Herein, we map immune, endothelial, and neuronal cell networks within these tissues from \"normal\"/non-diseased organ donors, collected through the NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)3, using highly multiplexed CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing) imaging and 3D light sheet microscopy of cleared tissues. Building on prior reports4-6, we observed the lymph node subcapsular sinus expressing podoplanin, smooth muscle actin, and LYVE1. In the spleen, LYVE1 was expressed by littoral cells lining venous sinusoids, whereas podoplanin was restricted to arteries and trabeculae. 3D visualization of perivascular innervation revealed a subset of axonal processes expressing choline acetyl transferase in both tissues, in contrast with prior literature on human spleen7. We further report our novel observations regarding the distinct localization of GAP43 and {beta}3-tubulin within the vascular anatomy of both lymph node and spleen, with Coronin-1A+ cells forming a dense cluster around {beta}3-tubulin positive GAP43 low/negative segments of large vessels in spleen. These data provide an unprecedented 2D and 3D visualization of cellular networks within secondary lymphoid tissues, laying the groundwork for future disease-specific and system-wide studies of neural regulation of immunity in human lymphatics.",

    "abstract": "Near surface cameras, such as those in the PhenoCam network, are a common source of ground truth data in modelling and remote sensing studies. Despite having locations across numerous agricultural sites, few studies have used near surface cameras to track the unique phenology of croplands. Due to management activities, crops do not have a natural vegetation cycle which many phenological extraction methods are based on. For example, a field may experience abrupt changes due to harvesting and tillage throughout the year. A single camera can also record several different plants due to crop rotations, fallow fields, and cover crops. Current methods to estimate phenology metrics from image time series compress all image information into a relative greenness metric, which discards a large amount of contextual information. This can include the type of crop present, whether snow or water is present on the field, the crop phenology, or whether a field lacking green plants consists of bare soil, fully senesced plants, or plant residue. Here we developed a modelling workflow to create a daily time series of crop type and phenology, while also accounting for other factors such as obstructed images and snow covered fields. We used a mainstream deep learning image classification model, VGG16. Deep learning classification models do not have a temporal component, so to account for temporal correlation among images our workflow incorporates a hidden markov model in the post-processing. The initial image classification model had out of sample F1 scores of 0.83-0.85, which improved to 0.86-0.91 after all post-processing steps. The resulting time series show the progression of crops from emergence to harvest, and can serve as a daily, local scale dataset of field states and phenological stages for agricultural research.",

    "abstract": "Cell shape changes from locomotion to cytokinesis are, to a large extent, driven by myosin-driven remodeling of cortical actin patterns. Passive crosslinkers such as -actinin and fascin as well actin nucleator Arp2/3 complex largely determine the architecture and connectivity of actin network patterns; consequently, they regulate network remodeling and membrane shape changes. Membrane constriction in animal cell cytokinesis proceeds by assembly and contraction of a contractile ring pattern rich in -actinin and myosin at the equator of the cell cortex, with which the ring is contiguous. Here we reconstitute actomyosin networks inside cell-sized lipid bilayer vesicles and show that, depending on vesicle size and concentrations of -actinin and fascin, actomyosin networks assemble into ring and aster-like patterns. Anchoring actin to the membrane enhances the interaction of the contractile networks with lipid membrane but does not change the architecture of the patterns. A membrane-bound actomyosin ring exerts force and constricts the membrane. An Arp2/3 complex-mediated actomyosin cortex is shown to assemble a ring-like pattern at the equatorial cortex and contribute to myosin-driven clustering of the cortex and consequently membrane deformation. An active gel theory unifies a model for the observed membrane constriction and protrusion induced by the membrane-bound actomyosin networks.",

However, the model development process is complicated and often unintuitive, requiring iteration on various computational tasks and comparisons with experimental data. Ad hoc model development can pose a barrier to reproduction and critical analysis of the development process itself, reducing potential impact and inhibiting further model development and collaboration. To help practitioners manage these challenges, we introduce GAMES: a workflow for Generation and Analysis of Models for Exploring Synthetic systems that includes both automated and human-in-the-loop processes. We systematically consider the process of developing dynamic models, including model formulation, parameter estimation, parameter identifiability, experimental design, model reduction, model refinement, and model selection. We demonstrate the workflow with a case study on a chemically responsive transcription factor. The generalizable workflow presented in this tutorial can enable biologists to more readily build and analyze models for various applications.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=129 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/465216v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b1c8feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29d13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1967eb7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1593bdd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has suggested that the carotid bodies might act as immunological sensors, detecting pro-inflammatory mediators and signalling to the central nervous system, which, in turn, orchestrates autonomic responses. Here, we demonstrated that the TNF- receptor type I is expressed in the carotid bodies of rats. The systemic administration of TNF- increased carotid body afferent discharge and activated glutamatergic neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) that project to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), where the majority of pre-sympathetic neurons reside. The activation of these neurons was accompanied by generalized activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Carotid body ablation blunted the TNF--induced activation of RVLM-projecting NTS neurons and the increase in splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity. Finally, plasma and spleen levels of cytokines after TNF- administration were higher in rats subjected to either carotid body ablation or splanchnic sympathetic denervation. Collectively, our findings indicate that the carotid body detects circulating TNF- to activate a counteracting sympathetic anti-inflammatory mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying memory loss associated with Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear, and no effective treatments exist. Fundamental studies have shown that a set of transcriptional regulatory proteins of the nuclear receptor 4a (Nr4a) family serve as molecular switches for long-term memory. Here, we show that Nr4a proteins regulate the transcription of a group of genes encoding chaperones that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which function to traffic plasticity-related proteins to the cell surface during long lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Nr4a transcription factors and ER chaperones are linked to ADRD in human samples as well as mouse models, and overexpressing Nr4a1 or the ER chaperone Hspa5 ameliorates the long-term memory deficits in a tau-based mouse model of ADRD, pointing towards novel therapeutic approaches for treating memory loss. Thus, our findings establish protein folding in the ER as a novel molecular concept underlying long-term memory, providing new insights into the mechanistic basis of cognitive deficits in dementia.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryMolecular approaches establish protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum as a novel molecular concept underlying synaptic plasticity and memory, serving as a switch to regulate protein folding and trafficking, and driving cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "The human immune system is compromised in microgravity (MG) conditions during an orbital flight and upon return to Earth. T cells are critical for the immune response and execute their functions via actin mediated immune cell-cell interactions that could be disturbed by MG conditions. Here, we have applied two rotational platforms to simulate MG conditions: fast rotating clinostat (CL) and random positioning machine (RPM) followed by global T cell transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. We demonstrate that the T cell transcriptome profile in response to simulated MG treatment was clearly distinguishable from the T cell transcriptome response to hydrodynamic stress (HS) induced by shear forces upon cell movement in cultural medium. Gene expression profiling of genes related to or involved in actin cytoskeleton networks using RT-qPCR confirmed two sets of differentially regulated genes in the T cell response to MG or to HS. Several key genes potentially involved in T cell gravisensing (Fam163b, Dnph1, Trim34, Upk-1b) were identified. A number of candidate biomarker genes of the response to MG (VAV1, VAV2, VAV3, and NFATC2) and of the response to HS (ITGAL, ITGB1, ITGB2, RAC1 and RAC2) could be used to distinguish between these processes on the gene transcription level. Together, MG induces changes in the overall transcriptome of T cells leading to specific shifts in expression of cytoskeletal network genes.",

The fish were caught by pole and line, and bottom trawl at different geographical positions. The MPs in pelagic fish (39.1 %) were higher than demersal fish (10.3 %) and of larger sizes. The MPs correlated with habitat depth and type. There was species variation in the shape and polymer composition of MPs. These results increase our understanding of the heterogeneous uptake of MPs by fishes.",

    "abstract": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is spreading rapidly in Asia. It is transmitted by Haemaphysalis longicornis (Asian longhorned tick, ALT), which has both parthenogenetically and sexually reproducing populations. Parthenogenetic populations were found in at least 15 provinces in China and strongly correlated with the distribution of SFTS. The distribution of SFTS cases was however poorly correlated with the distribution of populations of bisexual ALTs. Phylogeographic analysis suggested that the parthenogenetic population spread much faster than bisexual population because colonization is independent of sexual reproduction. A higher proportion of parthenogenetic ALTs were collected from migratory birds captured at an SFTS endemic area, implicating the contribution to the long-range movement of ALTs in China. The SFTSV susceptibility of parthenogenetic females was like that of bisexual females under laboratory conditions. These results suggest that parthenogenetic ALT, probably transported by migratory birds, play a major role in the rapid spread of SFTSV.\n\nArticle Summary LineThe parthenogenetic population of Asian longhorned tick is broadly distributed in China and plays a major role in the long-distance spread of SFTSV and perhaps future invasion of countries outside of Asia.",

    "abstract": "Automated behavior quantification requires accurate tracking of animals. Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals, particularly those lacking visual identifiers, is particularly challenging. Problems of mistaken identities and lost information on key anatomical features are common in existing methods. Here we propose a markerless video-based tool to simultaneously track two socially interacting mice of the same appearance. It incorporates conventional handcrafted tracking and deep learning based techniques, which are trained on a small number of labeled images from a very basic, uncluttered experimental setup. The output consists of body masks and coordinates of the snout and tail-base for each mouse. The method was tested on a series of cross-setup videos recorded under commonly used experimental conditions including bedding in the cage and fiberoptic or headstage implants on the mice. Results obtained without any human intervention showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach, evidenced by a near elimination of identities switches and a 10% improvement in tracking accuracy over a pure deep-learning-based keypoint tracking approach trained on the same data. Finally, we demonstrated an application of this approach in studies of social behaviour of mice, by using it to quantify and compare interactions between pairs of mice in which some are anosmic, i.e. unable to smell. Our results indicated loss of olfaction impaired typical snout-directed social recognition behaviors of mice, while non-snout-directed social behaviours were enhanced. Together, these results suggest that the hybrid approach could be valuable for studying group behaviors in rodents, such as social interactions.",

    "abstract": "Protein conformational switches are widely used in biosensing. They are typically composed of an input domain (which binds a target ligand) fused to an output domain (which generates an optical readout). A central challenge in designing such switches is to develop mechanisms for coupling the input and output signals via conformational change. Here, we create a biosensor in which binding-induced folding of the input domain drives a conformational shift in the output domain that results in a 6-fold green-to-yellow ratiometric fluorescence change in vitro, and a 35-fold intensiometric fluorescence increase in cultured cells. The input domain consists of circularly permuted FK506 binding protein (cpFKBP) that folds upon binding its target ligand (FK506 or rapamycin). cpFKBP folding induces the output domain, an engineered GFP variant, to replace one of its {beta}-strands (containing T203 and specifying green fluorescence) with a duplicate {beta}-strand (containing Y203 and specifying yellow fluorescence) in an intramolecular exchange reaction. This mechanism employs the loop-closure entropy principle, embodied by folding of the partially disordered cpFKBP domain, to couple ligand binding to the GFP color shift. This proof-of-concept design has the advantages of full genetic encodability, ratiometric or intensiometric response, and potential for modularity. The latter attribute is enabled by circular permutation of the input domain.",

For example, while sexually naive male mice are aggressive to the conspecific young, they start to provide caregiving to infants around the time when their own young are expected. How such behavioral plasticity is implemented at the level of neural connections remains poorly understood. Using viral-genetic approaches, here we establish hypothalamic oxytocin neurons as key regulators of parental caregiving behaviors of male mice. We then used rabies virus-mediated unbiased screen to identify excitatory neural connections originating from the lateral hypothalamus to the oxytocin neurons to be drastically strengthened when male mice become fathers. These connections are functionally relevant, as their activation suppresses pup-directed aggression in virgin males. These results demonstrate the life-stage associated, long-distance, and cell-type-specific plasticity of neural connections in the hypothalamus, the brain region classically assumed to be hard-wired.\n\nHighlight- OT is indispensable for parental caregiving behavior of male mice\n- Activation of OT neurons triggers paternal caregiving behavior in otherwise infanticidal sexually-naive male mice partly via OT ligand\n- Unbiased rabies virus-mediated screening reveals enhanced connectivity originated from excitatory LHA neurons to OT neurons in fathers.\n- This structural plasticity can support behavioral plasticity",

The focus of this study is to evaluate cross-protective efficacy and immune correlates by the rCpa1- based vaccine against both species of Coccidioides. DNA sequence analyses of the homologous genes for the rCpa1 antigen were conducted for 39 and 17 clinical isolates of Cp and Ci, respectively. Protective efficacy and vaccine-induced immunity were evaluated for both C57BL/6 and human HLA-DR4 transgenic mice against 5 highly virulent isolates of Cp and Ci. There are a total of 7 amino acid substitutions in the rCpa1 antigen between Cp and Ci. Both C57BL/6 and HLA-DR4 mice that were vaccinated with a rCpa1 vaccine resulted in significant reduction of fungal burden and increased numbers of IFN-{gamma}- and IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells in the first 2 weeks post-challenge.

The Cdc48 complex recognizes primarily polyubiquitin chains, rather than the attached substrate. Cdc48 and Ufd1/Npl4 cooperatively bind the polyubiquitin chain, resulting in the unfolding of one ubiquitin molecule (initiator). Next, the ATPase pulls on the initiator ubiquitin and moves all ubiquitin molecules linked to its C-terminus through the central pore of the hexameric double-ring, causing transient ubiquitin unfolding. When the ATPase reaches the isopeptide bond of the substrate, it can translocate and unfold both N- and C-terminal segments. Ubiquitins linked to the branchpoint of the initiator dissociate from Ufd1/Npl4 and move outside the central pore, resulting in the release of unfolded, polyubiquitinated substrate from Cdc48.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of enzymatic allosteric regulation requires the structural characterization of key functional states and also their time evolution toward the formation of the allosterically activated ternary complex. The transient nature and usually slow millisecond timescale interconversion between these functional states hamper their detailed experimental and computational characterization. Here, we design a computational strategy tailored to reconstruct millisecond timescale events to describe the graded allosteric activation of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) in the ternary complex. IGPS is a heterodimeric bienzyme complex responsible for the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate in the HisH subunit and delivering ammonia for the cyclase activity in HisF. Despite significant advances in understanding the underlying allosteric mechanism, essential molecular details of the long-range millisecond allosteric activation pathway of wild-type IGPS remain hidden. Without using a priori information of the active state, our simulations uncover how IGPS, with the allosteric effector bound in HisF, spontaneously captures glutamine in a catalytically inactive HisH conformation, subsequently attains a closed HisF:HisH interface, and finally forms the oxyanion hole in HisH for efficient glutamine hydrolysis. We show that effector binding in HisF dramatically decreases the conformational barrier associated with the oxyanion hole formation in HisH, in line with the experimentally observed 4500-fold activity increase in glutamine production. The formation of the allosterically active state is controlled by time-evolving dynamic communication networks connecting the effector and substrate binding sites. This computational strategy can be generalized to study other unrelated enzymes undergoing millisecond timescale allosteric transitions.",

We show that hepatocyte-specific Socs1-deficient livers upregulate Socs3 expression following genotoxic stress. Whereas deletion of Socs1 or Socs3 increased HCC susceptibility, ablation of both genes attenuated HCC growth. SOCS3 promotes p53 activation in SOCS1-deficient livers, leading to increased expression of CDKN1A (p21WAF1/CIP1), which coincides with elevated expression and transcriptional activity of NRF2. Deleting Cdkn1a in SOCS1-deficient livers diminished NRF2 activation, oxidative stress and HCC progression. Elevated CDKN1A expression and enrichment of antioxidant response genes also characterized SOCS1-low/SOCS3-high HCC. SOCS1 expression in HCC cell lines reduced oxidative stress, p21 expression and NRF2 activation.

    "abstract": "Spotted fever group Rickettsia species are arthropod-borne obligate intracellular bacteria that can cause mild to severe human disease. These bacteria invade host cells, replicate in the cell cytosol, and then spread from cell to cell. To access the host cytosol and avoid detection by immune surveillance mechanisms, these pathogens must have evolved efficient ways to escape membrane-bound vacuoles. Although Rickettsia are predicted to express factors that disrupt host membranes, little is known about how and when these proteins function during infection. Here, we investigated the role of a Rickettsia patatin-like phospholipase A2 enzyme (Pat1) during host cell infection by characterizing a Rickettsia parkeri mutant with a transposon insertion in the pat1 gene. We show that Pat1 is important for infection in a mouse model and in host cells. We further show that Pat1 is critical for efficiently escaping from the single and double membrane-bound vacuoles into the host cytosol, and for avoiding host galectins that mark damaged membranes. In the host cytosol, Pat1 is important for avoiding host polyubiquitin, preventing recruitment of autophagy receptor p62, and promoting actin-based motility and cell-cell spread. Our results show that Pat1 plays critical roles in escaping host membranes and promoting cell-cell spread during R. parkeri infection and suggest diverse roles for patatin-like phospholipases in facilitating microbial infection.\n\nImportanceSpotted fever group Rickettsia are bacteria that reside in ticks and can be transmitted to mammalian hosts, including humans. Severe disease is characterized by high fever, headache, and rash, and results in occasional mortality despite available treatment. Rickettsia interact with host cell membranes while invading cells, escaping into the cytosol, and evading cellular defenses. Bacterial phospholipase enzymes have been proposed as critical factors for targeting host cell membranes, however the specific roles of rickettsial phospholipases are not well defined. We investigated the contribution of one conserved patatin-like phospholipase, Pat1, in Rickettsia parkeri. We observed that Pat1 is important for virulence in an animal model. Moreover, Pat1 plays critical roles in host cells by facilitating access to the cell cytosol, inhibiting detection by host defense pathways, and promoting cell-cell spread. Our study indicates that Pat1 performs several critical functions, suggesting a broad role for phospholipases throughout the Rickettsia lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "The beta-glucosidase BglC fulfills multiple functions in both primary metabolism and induction of pathogenicity of Streptomyces scabiei, the causative agent of the common scab disease of root and tuber crops. Indeed, this enzyme hydrolyzes cellobiose and cellotriose to directly feed glycolysis with glucose, but also modifies the intracellular concentration of these cello-oligosaccharides which are the virulence elicitors. The inactivation of bglC also led to unexpected phenotypes such as the constitutive overproduction of thaxtomin A, the main virulence determinant of S. scabiei. In this work we revealed a new target substrate of BglC, the phytoalexin scopolin. Removal of the glucose moiety of scopolin generates scopoletin, a potent inhibitor of thaxtomin A production. The hydrolysis of scopolin by BglC presents substrate inhibition kinetics which contrasts with the typical Michaelis-Menten saturation curve previously observed for the degradation of its natural substrate cellobiose. Our work therefore reveals that BglC targets both cello-oligosaccharide elicitors emanating from the hosts of S. scabiei, and the scopolin phytoalexin generated by the host defense mechanisms, thereby occupying a key position to fine-tune the production of the main virulence determinant thaxtomin A.",

    "abstract": "S100A8 and S100A9 are members of the Alarmin family; these proteins are abundantly expressed in neutrophils and form a heterodimer complex. Recently, both proteins were identified as novel biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection and were shown to play key roles in inducing an aggressive inflammatory response by mediating the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, called the \"cytokine storm.\" Although co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in people living with HIV-1 may result in an immunocompromised status, the role of the S100A8/A9 complex in HIV-1 replication in primary T cells and macrophages is still unclear. Here, we evaluated the roles of the proteins in HIV replication to elucidate their functions. We found that the complex had no impact on virus replication in both cell types; however, the subunits of S100A8 and S100A9 inhibits HIV in macrophages. These findings provide important insights into the regulation of HIV viral loads in SARS-CoV2 co-infection.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive DNA elements are packaged in heterochromatin, but many require bursts of transcription to initiate and maintain long-term silencing. The mechanisms by which these heterochromatic genome features are transcribed remain largely unknown. Here, we show that DOT1L, a conserved histone methyltransferase that modifies lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79), has a specialized role in transcription of major satellite repeats to maintain pericentromeric heterochromatin and genome stability. We discover that H3K79me3 is enriched at repetitive elements, that DOT1L loss specifically compromises pericentromeric satellite transcription, and that this function depends on interaction between DOT1L and the chromatin remodeler SMARCA5. Activation of pericentromeric repeats by DOT1L drives the first establishment of heterochromatin structures in cleavage-stage embryos and is required for preimplantation viability. Our findings uncover a vital instructive role for DOT1L as a bridge between transcriptional activation of heterochromatic repeats and maintenance of genome integrity, and illuminate global chromatin dynamics during early development.",

    "abstract": "Cells adopt highly polarized shapes and form distinct subcellular compartments largely due to the localization of many mRNAs to specific areas, where they are translated into proteins with local functions. This mRNA localization is mediated by specific cis-regulatory elements in mRNAs, commonly called \"zipcodes.\" Their recognition by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) leads to the integration of the mRNAs into macromolecular complexes and their localization. While there are hundreds of localized mRNAs, only a few zipcodes have been characterized. Here, we describe a novel neuronal zipcode identification protocol (N-zip) that can identify zipcodes across hundreds of 3UTRs. This approach combines a method of separating the principal subcellular compartments of neurons - cell bodies and neurites - with a massively parallel reporter assay. Our analysis identifies the let-7 binding site and (AU)n motif as de novo zipcodes in mouse primary cortical neurons and suggests a strategy for detecting many more.",

Unexpectedly, we uncovered extensive MRE11- and CtIP-dependent DNA end resection at DSBs in G0 mammalian cells. A whole genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen revealed the DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) complex as a key factor in promoting DNA end resection in G0 cells. In agreement, depletion of FBXL12, which promotes ubiquitylation and removal of the KU70/KU80 subunits of DNA-PK from DSBs, promotes even more extensive resection in G0 cells. In contrast, a requirement for DNA-PK in promoting DNA end resection in proliferating cells at the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle was not observed. Our findings establish that DNA-PK uniquely promotes DNA end resection in G0, but not in G1 or G2 phase cells, and has important implications for DNA DSB repair in quiescent cells.",

Using whole-genome sequencing of geographically distributed worms collected from human and other primate hosts, together with ancient samples preserved in archaeologically-defined latrines and deposits dated up to one thousand years old, we present the first population genomics study of T. trichiura. We describe the continent-scale genetic structure between whipworms infecting humans and baboons relative to those infecting other primates. Admixture and population demographic analyses support a stepwise distribution of genetic variation that is highest in Uganda, consistent with an African origin and subsequent translocation with human migration. Finally, genome-wide analyses between human samples and between human and non-human primate samples reveal local regions of genetic differentiation between geographically distinct populations. These data provide insight into zoonotic reservoirs of human-infective T. trichiura and will support future efforts toward the implementation of genomic epidemiology of this globally important helminth.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic resistance to pyrethroids is a menace to the continued effectiveness of malaria vector controls. Its molecular basis is complex and varies geographically across Africa. Here, we used a multi-omics approach, followed-up with functional validation to show that a directionally selected haplotype of a cytochrome P450, CYP9K1 is a major driver of resistance in Anopheles funestus.\n\nA PoolSeq GWAS using mosquitoes alive and dead after permethrin exposure, from Malawi and Cameroon, detected candidate genomic regions, but lacked consistency across replicates. Targeted deep sequencing of candidate resistance genes and genomic loci detected several SNPs associated with known pyrethroid resistance QTLs. The most significant SNP was in the cytochrome P450 CYP304B1 (Cameroon), CYP315A1 (Uganda) and the ABC transporter gene ABCG4 (Malawi). However, when comparing field resistant mosquitoes to laboratory susceptible, the pyrethroid resistance locus rp1 and SNPs around the ABC transporter ABCG4 were consistently significant, except for Uganda where CYP9K1 P450 was markedly significant. In vitro heterologous metabolism assays with recombinant CYP9K1 revealed that it metabolises type II pyrethroid (deltamethrin; 64% depletion) but not type I (permethrin; 0%), while moderately metabolising DDT (17%). CYP9K1 exhibited a drastic reduction of genetic diversity in Uganda, in contrast to other locations, highlighting an extensive selective sweep. Furthermore, a glycine to alanine (G454A) amino acid mutation located between the meander and cysteine pocket of CYP9K1 was detected in all Ugandan mosquitoes.\n\nThis study sheds further light on the complex evolution of metabolic resistance in a major malaria vector, by adding further resistance genes and variants that can be used to design field applicable markers to better track this resistance Africa-wide.\n\nAuthor SummaryMetabolic resistance to pyrethroids is a menace to the continued effectiveness of malaria vector controls. Its molecular basis is complex and varies geographically across Africa. Here, we used several DNA based approach to associate genomic differences between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes from several field and laboratory populations of the malaria vector Anopheles funestus. We followed-up our genomic analyses with functional validation of a candidate resistance gene in East Africa. This gene (CYP9K1) is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene-family that helps to metabolise, and thereby detoxify, pyrethroid insecticides. We show that this gene is a major driver of resistance to a specific sub-class of pyrethroid insecticides only, with moderate to no effects on other insecticides used against Anopheles funestus. We were able to link resistance in this gene to a mutation that changes the amino acid glycine to alanine that may impact how the protein-product of this gene binds to target insecticides. In addition to demonstrating the biochemical specificity of an evolutionary response, we have broadened the available pool of genes can be used to monitor the spread of insecticide resistance in this species.",

This model suggests that a function of the nucleoprotein filament could be at least partly attributed to the lowering of transition energy of duplex DNA structure having the E-type sugar puckers. Key events during homologous recombination such as sequence recognition, base pair switching and elongation/contraction of the helical pitch may correlate with the pseudo-rotation angle of sugar puckers along the N-, E-, S- and W-types. A conformational change of sugar puckers during the reaction is resolved into two motions by introducing a pair of parameters, 1 and {nu}3, which defines a swing orientation of bases and a torsional angle of phosphate backbones, respectively.",

Once on DNA the MSH sliding clamps provide a platform for the assembly of MMR strand-specific excision components beginning with the highly conserved MutL homologs (MLH/PMS). Previous studies with short mismatch-containing oligonucleotides revealed an MSH ATP hydrolysis (ATPase) cycle that included mismatch recognition, the formation of an ATP-bound sliding clamp and dissociation from the end of a mismatched DNA that ultimately recovers the mismatch binding conformation. We found that ATP-bound MSH complexes on blocked-end or very long DNA are extremely stable under a range of ionic conditions.

However, there is no information on how oncohistone mutations and other PTMs affect NatD-catalyzed acetylation. Herein, we determined how changes of local chemical environment on the N-terminal SGRGK sequence regulate NatD-catalyzed N acetylation on histone H4/H2A. Our studies indicate that all oncohistone mutations at SGRG suppressed the catalytic efficiency of NatD. Meanwhile, H4 serine 1 phosphorylation and arginine 3 methylation also negatively affect the NatD activity, but the lysine 5 acetylation has a marginal effect on NatD. This work reveals the impacts of oncohistone mutations on NatD activity and unravels the crosstalk between NatD and PTMs. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the potential regulatory mechanism of NatD, highlighting different revenues to interrogate the NatD-mediated pathway in the future.",

    "abstract": "The p53 transcription factor, encoded by the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis in response to stress signals. The mechanisms through which p53 promotes downstream tumor suppressive gene expression programs remain, however, only superficially understood. Here, we used tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to reveal new components of the p53 response. This approach uncovered Mettl3, a component of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex (MTC), as a p53-interacting protein. Analysis of Mettl3- deficient cells revealed that Mettl3 promotes p53 protein stabilization and target gene expression in response to DNA damage. Mettl3 acts in part by competing with the p53 negative regulator, Mdm2, for binding to the p53 transactivation domains to promote methyltransferase-independent stabilization of p53. In addition, Mettl3 relies on its catalytic activity to augment p53 responses, with p53 recruiting Mettl3 to p53 target genes to co-transcriptionally direct m6A modification of p53 pathway transcripts to enhance their expression. Mettl3 also promotes p53 activity downstream of oncogenic signals in vivo, in both allograft and autochthonous lung adenocarcinoma models, suggesting cooperative action of p53 and Mettl3 in tumor suppression. Accordingly, we found in diverse human cancers that mutations in MTC components perturb expression of p53 target genes and that MTC mutations are mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations, suggesting that the MTC enhances the p53 transcriptional program in human cancer. Together, these studies reveal a fundamental role for Mettl3 in amplifying p53 signaling through protein stabilization and epitranscriptome regulation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial leaf blight, a devastating disease of rice. Among the type-3 effectors secreted by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae to support pathogen virulence, the Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE) family plays a critical role. Some TALEs are major virulence factors that activate susceptibility (S) genes, overexpression of which contributes to disease development. Host incompatibility can result from TALE-induced expression of so-called executor (E) genes leading to a strong and rapid resistance response that blocks disease development. In that context, the TALE functions as an avirulence (Avr) factor. To date no such avirulence factors have been identified in African strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.\n\nResultsWith respect to the importance of TALEs in the Rice-Xoo pathosystem, we aimed at identifying those that may act as Avr factor within African Xoo. We screened 86 rice accessions, and identified 12 that were resistant to two African strains while being susceptible to a well-studied Asian strain. In a gain of function approach based on the introduction of each of the nine tal genes of the avirulent African strain MAI1 into the virulent Asian strain PXO99A, four were found to trigger resistance on specific rice accessions. Loss-of-function mutational analysis further demonstrated the avr activity of two of them, talD and talI, on the rice varieties IR64 and CT13432 respectively. Further analysis of TalI demonstrated the requirement of its activation domain for triggering resistance in CT13432. Resistance in 9 of the 12 rice accessions that were resistant against African Xoo specifically, including CT13432, could be suppressed or largely suppressed by trans-expression of the truncTALE tal2h, similarly to resistance conferred by the Xa1 gene which recognizes TALEs generally independently of their activation domain.\n\nConclusionWe identified and characterized TalD and TalI as two African Xoo TALEs with avirulence activity on IR64 and CT13432 respectively. Resistance of CT13432 against African Xoo results from the combination of two mechanisms, one relying on the TalI-mediated induction of an unknown executor gene and the other on an Xa1-like gene or allele.",

When testing CAF09b as a potential pan-viral prophylaxis, we observed that intranasal administration of CAF09b to mice resulted in an influx of innate immune cells into the nose and lungs and upregulation of IFN-I related gene expression. When CAF09b was administered prior to challenge with mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus, it protected from severe disease, although virus was still detectable in the lungs. However, when CAF09b was administered after influenza challenge, the mice had a similar disease course to controls. In conclusion, CAF09b may be a suitable candidate as a pan-viral prophylactic treatment for epidemic viruses, but must be administered prior to virus exposure to be effective.",

    "abstract": "Type I interferons (IFN) exert a broad range of biological effects important in coordinating immune responses. Host and microbial factors regulate IFN production, triggering a signaling cascade that has classically been studied in the context of pathogen clearance. In particular, commensal bacteria have been shown to induce IFN to protect against viral infections. Yet, whether immunomodulatory bacteria operate through IFN pathways to support immune tolerance remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate microbiota-dependent IFN signaling is required for priming tolerogenic T regulatory cells (Tregs) by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs). DCs deficient in IFN signaling through deletion of IFNAR-1 display dysregulated cytokine production in response to the commensal bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, resulting in blunted downstream Treg responses. Single cell RNA sequencing of gut tissues demonstrated that colonization with B. fragilis promotes a distinct type I IFN gene signature in Tregs during homeostasis and intestinal inflammation. Moreover, B. fragilis-mediated protection during experimental colitis was abrogated in IFNAR1-deficient mice. Altogether, our findings demonstrate an important role of microbiota-mediated immune tolerance via tonic type I IFN signaling.",

However, their industrial application is limited by their ligand promiscuity, low sensitivity, and narrow detection range. Alcohols exhibit similar structures, and no reported TFB can distinguish a specific alcohol from its analogs. Here, we engineered an alcohol-regulated transcription factor, BmoR, and obtained various mutants with remarkable properties. For example, the generated signal-molecule-specific BmoRs could distinguish the constitutional isomers n-butanol and isobutanol, with insensitivity up to an ethanol concentration of 800 mM (36.9 g/L). Linear detection of 0-60 mM of a specific higher alcohol could be achieved in the presence of up to 500 mM (23.0 g/L) ethanol as background noise. Notably, two mutants with raised outputs and over 1.0 x 107-fold higher sensitivity, and one mutant with an increased upper detection limit (14.8 g/L n-butanol or isobutanol) were screened out. Using BmoR as an example, this study systematically explored the ultimate detection limit of a TFB towards its small-molecule ligands, paving the way for in situ detection in the biofuel and wine industries.",

    "abstract": "Properly responding to DNA damage is vital for eukaryotic cells, including the induction of DNA repair, growth arrest and, as a last resort to prevent neoplastic transformation, cell death. Besides being crucial for ensuring homeostasis, the same pathways and mechanisms are at the basis of chemoradiotherapy in cancer treatment, which involves therapeutic induction of DNA damage by chemical or physical (radiological) measures. Apart from typical DNA damage response mediators, the relevance of cell-intrinsic antiviral signaling pathways in response to DNA breaks has recently emerged. Originally known for combatting viruses via expression of antiviral factors including IFNs and establishing of an antiviral state, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) were found to be critical for adequate induction of cell death upon the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks. We here show that presence of IRF3 is crucial in this process, most likely through direct activation of pro-apoptotic factors rather than transcriptional induction of canonical downstream components, such as IFNs. Investigating genes reported to be involved in both DNA damage response and antiviral signaling, we demonstrate that IRF1 is an obligatory factor for DNA damage-induced cell death. Interestingly, its regulation does not require activation of RLR signaling, but rather sensing of DNA double strand breaks by ATM and ATR. Hence, even though independently regulated, both RLR signaling and IRF1 are essential for proper induction/execution of intrinsic apoptosis. Our results not only support more broadly developing IRF1 as a biomarker predictive for the effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy, but also suggest investigating a combined pharmacological stimulation of RLR and IRF1 signaling as a potential adjuvant regimen in tumor therapy.",

    "abstract": "Proven roles for haemocytes (blood cells) have expanded beyond the control of infections in Drosophila. Despite this, the critical role of haemocytes in post-embryonic development has long been thought to be limited to control of microorganisms during metamorphosis. This has previously been shown by rescue of adult development in haemocyte-ablation models under germ-free conditions. Here we show that haemocytes have a critical role in post-embryonic development beyond their ability to control the microbiota. Using a newly generated, strong haemocyte-specific driver line for the GAL4/UAS system, we show that specific ablation of haemocytes is pupal lethal, even under axenic conditions. Genetic rescue experiments prove that this is a haemocyte-specific phenomena. RNA-seq data suggests that dysregulation of the midgut is a critical consequence of haemocyte ablation. We believe this novel role of haemocytes during metamorphosis is a major finding for the field. This is an exciting new Drosophila model to study the precise mechanisms in which haemocytes regulate tissue development, findings from which could have far reaching implications beyond invertebrate biology.\n\nSummary StatementHaemocyte-ablation in Drosophila melanogaster with a strong haemocyte-specific driver causes pupal lethality",

We previously reported that one such factor is the epigenetic repressor SMCHD1, whose maternal supply controls autosomal imprinted expression in mouse preimplantation embryos and mid-gestation placenta. In mouse preimplantation embryos, X chromosome inactivation is also an imprinted process. Combining genomics and imaging, we show that maternal SMCHD1 is required not only for the imprinted expression of Xist in preimplantation embryos, but also for the efficient silencing of the inactive X in both the preimplantation embryo and mid-gestation placenta. These results expand the role of SMCHD1 in enforcing the silencing of Polycomb targets. The inability of zygotic SMCHD1 to fully restore imprinted X inactivation further points to maternal SMCHD1s role in setting up the appropriate chromatin environment during preimplantation development, a critical window of epigenetic remodelling.",

We highlighted how the whole IN C-terminal domain, once bound to TAR, can change its structure assisting the binding of Tat, the HIV trans-activator protein, which finally displaces IN from TAR. Our results are consistent with the emerging role of IN in early stage of proviral transcription and suggest new steps of HIV-1 life cycle that can be considered as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication, and the related processes of genome expression, require binding, assembly, and function of protein complexes at and near single-stranded (ss) - double-stranded (ds) DNA junctions. These central protein-DNA interactions are likely influenced by thermally induced conformational fluctuations of the DNA scaffold across an unknown distribution of functionally relevant states to provide regulatory proteins access to properly conformed DNA binding sites. Thus, characterizing the nature of conformational fluctuations and the associated structural disorder at ss-dsDNA junctions is likely critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of these central biological processes. Here we describe spectroscopic studies of model ss-dsDNA fork constructs that contain dimers of  internally labeled cyanine (iCy3) chromophore probes that have been rigidly inserted within the sugar-phosphate backbones of the DNA strands. Our combined analyses of absorbance, circular dichroism (CD) and two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (2DFS) permit us to characterize the local conformational parameters and conformational distributions. We find that the DNA sugar-phosphate backbones undergo abrupt successive changes in their local conformations - initially from a right-handed and ordered DNA state to a disordered splayed-open structure and then to a disordered left-handed conformation - as the dimer probes are moved across the ss-dsDNA junction. Our results suggest that the sugar-phosphate backbones at and near ss-dsDNA junctions adopt specific position-dependent local conformations and exhibit varying extents of conformational disorder that deviate widely from the Watson-Crick structure. We suggest that some of these conformations are likely to function as secondary-structure motifs for interaction with protein complexes that bind to and assemble at these sites.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia and degeneration of specific neuronal populations, including Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for various evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways in cerebellar patterning, such as the Wnt-{beta}-catenin pathway; however, the roles of these pathways in adult cerebellar function and cerebellar neurodegeneration are largely unknown. In this study, we found that Wnt-{beta}-catenin activity was progressively enhanced in multiple cell types in the adult SCA1 mouse cerebellum, and that activation of this signaling occurs in an ataxin-1 polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion-dependent manner. Genetic manipulation of the Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in specific cerebellar cell populations revealed that activation of Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling in PCs alone was not sufficient to induce SCA1-like phenotypes, while its activation in astrocytes including Bergmann glia (BG) resulted in gliosis and disrupted BG localization, which was replicated in SCA1 mouse models. Our studies identify a novel mechanism in which polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 positively regulates Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling, and demonstrate that different cell types have distinct responses to the enhanced Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling in the SCA1 cerebellum, underscoring an important role of BG in SCA1 pathogenesis.\n\nSignificance statementThe mechanisms underlying the degeneration of specific cellular populations in various neurodegenerative disorders remain unknown. Here, we show that the polyQ expansion of ataxin-1 activates the Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in various cell types, including Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia, in the cerebellum of SCA1 mouse models. We used conditional mouse genetics to activate and silence this pathway in different cell types and found elevated activity of this signaling pathway impacted Bergmann glia and Purkinje cell populations differently.

    "abstract": "In developing Xenopus tadpoles, the optic tectum begins to receive patterned visual input while visuomotor circuits are still undergoing neurogenesis and circuit assembly. This visual input regulates neural progenitor cell fate decisions such that maintaining tadpoles in the dark increases proliferation, expanding the progenitor pool, while visual stimulation promotes neuronal differentiation. To identify regulators of activity-dependent neural progenitor cell fate, we used RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptomes of proliferating neural progenitor cells and newly-differentiated immature neurons. Out of 1,130 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts, we identified six DE transcription factors which are predicted to regulate the majority of the other DE transcripts. Here we focused on Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and the ETS-family transcription factor, ELK-1. BRCA1 is known for its role in cancers, but relatively little is known about its potential role in regulating neural progenitor cell fate. ELK-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor which regulates immediate early gene expression. We investigated the effect of BRCA1 and ELK-1 on activity-regulated neurogenesis in the tadpole visual system using in vivo time-lapse imaging to monitor the fate of turbo-GFP-expressing SOX2+ neural progenitor cells in the optic tectum. Our longitudinal in vivo imaging analysis shows that knockdown of either BRCA1 or ELK-1 altered the fates of neural progenitor cells, and furthermore that the effects of visual experience on neurogenesis depend on BRCA1 expression, while the effects of visual experience on neuronal differentiation depend on ELK-1 expression. These studies provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which neural activity affects neural progenitor cell fate.",

Computational analysis provides evidence that RGC type identity is not specified at mitotic exit, but acquired by gradual, asynchronous fate restriction of postmitotic multipotential precursors. Some types are not identifiable until a week after they are generated. Immature RGCs may be specified to project ipsilaterally or contralaterally to the rest of the brain before their type identity has been determined.

Reliable identification of fetal cardiac cell types using protein markers is important for understanding cardiac development and delineating the cellular composition of the human heart during early development, which remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to use immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry and RT-PCR analyses to investigate the expression and specificity of commonly used cardiac cell markers in the early human fetal heart (8-12 post-conception weeks). The expression of previously reported protein markers for the detection of cardiomyocytes (Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) and Troponin I (cTnI)), fibroblasts (DDR2, Thy1, Vimentin), endothelial cells (CD31) and smooth muscle cells (-SMA) were assessed. Flow cytometry revealed two distinct populations of cTnI expressing cells based on fluorescence intensity: cTnIHigh and cTnILow. MHC positive cardiomyocytes were cTnIHigh, whereas MHC negative non-myocyte cells were cTnILow. cTnI expression in non-myocytes was further confirmed by IHC and RT-PCR analyses, suggesting troponins are not cardiomyocyte-specific and may play distinct roles in non-muscle cells during early development. Vimentin was confirmed to be enriched in cultured fibroblast populations and flow cytometry revealed VimHigh and VimLow cell populations in the fetal heart. MHC positive cardiomyocytes were VimLow whilst CD31 positive endothelial cells were VimHigh. Based on the markers investigated, we estimate fetal human cardiomyocyte populations comprise 75-80% of total cardiac cells and exhibit the following marker profile: -MHC+/cTnIHigh/VimLow. For the non-cardiomyocyte population, we estimate they comprise 20-25% of total cardiac cells and exhibit the following marker profile: -MHC-/cTnILow/VimHigh. Our study suggests the marker profiles and proportions of fetal cardiac populations are distinct from that of the adult heart.",

However, the phenotypic effects of most such polymorphisms are unknown because only larger CNVs (spanning tens of kilobases) have been ascertainable from the SNP-array data generated by large biobanks. We developed a new computational approach that leverages abundant haplotype-sharing in biobank cohorts to more sensitively detect CNVs co-inherited within extended SNP haplotypes. Applied to UK Biobank, this approach achieved 6-fold increased CNV detection sensitivity compared to previous analyses, accounting for approximately half of all rare gene inactivation events produced by genomic structural variation. This extensive CNV call set enabled the most comprehensive analysis to date of associations between CNVs and 56 quantitative traits, identifying 269 independent associations (P < 5 x 10-8) - involving 97 loci - that rigorous statistical fine-mapping analyses indicated were likely to be causally driven by CNVs. Putative target genes were identifiable for nearly half of the loci, enabling new insights into dosage-sensitivity of these genes and implicating several novel gene-trait relationships. CNVs at several loci created extended allelic series including deletions or duplications of distal enhancers that associated with much stronger phenotypic effects than SNPs within these regulatory elements. These results demonstrate the ability of haplotype-informed analysis to empower structural variant detection and provide insights into the genetic basis of human complex traits.",

The goal of this study was to identify the discriminative genes between improved and repressed ethanol production as well as clarifying the molecular responses to this process through mining the transcriptomic data. Through 11 machine learning based algorithms from RapidMiner employed on available microarray datasets related to yeast fermentation performance under Mg2+ and Cu2+ supplementation, 172 probe sets were identified by at least 5 AWAs. Some have been identified as being involved in carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and ethanol fermentation. Principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmap clustering were also validated the top-ranked selective probe sets. According to decision tree models, 17 roots with 100% performance were identified. OLI1 and CYC3 were identified as the roots with the best performance, demonstrated by the most weighting algorithms and linked to top two significant enriched pathways including porphyrin biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. ADH5 and PDA1 are also recognized as differential top-ranked genes that contribute to ethanol production. According to the regulatory clustering analysis, Tup1 has a significant effect on the top-ranked target genes CYC3 and ADH5 genes. This study provides a basic understanding of the S. cerevisiae cell molecular mechanism and responses to two different medium conditions (Mg2+ and Cu2+) during the fermentation process.",

    "abstract": "Serum-containing medium is widely used to support cell attachment, stable growth and serial passaging of various cancer cell lines. However, the presence of cholesterols and lipids in serum greatly hinders the analysis of the effects of cholesterol depletion on cells in culture. In this study, we develop a defined serum-free culture condition accessible to a variety of different types of adherent cancer cells. We tested different factors that are considered essential for cell culture and various extracellular matrix for plate coating, and found cells cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) basal media supplemented with Albumin (BSA) and insulin-transferrin-selenium-ethanolamine (ITS-X) on fibronectin-precoated well (called as \"DA-X condition\") showed comparable proliferation and survival to those in a serum-containing medium. Interestingly, we observed that DA-X condition could be adapted to a wide variety of adherent cancer cell lines, which enabled the analysis of how cholesterol depletion affected cancer cells in culture. Mechanistically, we found the beneficial effects of the DA-X condition in part can be attributed to the appropriate level of membrane cholesterol, and fibronectin-mediated signaling plays an important role in the suppression of cholesterol production.",

As host resistance is an efficient tool to control diseases, the findings of a previous report showed that some corn hybrids are resistant to D. maidis. In this work, we assessed the probing behavior of D. maidis on susceptible and resistant corn hybrids using EPG (Electrical Penetration Graph) technology. Fifteen-day-old females were monitored for 20 hours, with access to hybrids DK390, DK670, DK79-10, and DK72-10. Hybrids DK390 and DK72-10 showed resistance to D. maidis in phloem, since insects feeding on these hybrids presented more salivation events in phloem without subsequent ingestion, which are seen as failed attempts to ingest. A reduction of the total duration of phloem ingestion was observed, and accordingly of the time spent by insects with access to these hybrids on xylem ingestion. The hybrid DK390 also had mesophyll resistance, seen as less probing time and a higher number of probes of short duration. These findings support and are consistent with previous research, providing useful information to characterize maize hybrids resistant to D. maidis, and so to corn stunt.",

Strikingly, while machine learning algorithms are constantly refined, the human brain emerges as an ancestral biological example of such complex procedure. However, how it transforms sequences of single objects into meaningful temporal patterns remains elusive. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we discovered and mathematically modelled an inedited dual simultaneous processing responsible for pattern recognition in the brain. Indeed, while the objects of the temporal pattern were independently elaborated by a local, rapid brain processing, their combination into a meaningful superordinate pattern depended on a concurrent global, slower processing involving a widespread network of sequentially active brain areas. Expanding the established knowledge of neural information flow from low- to high-order brain areas, we revealed a novel brain mechanism based on simultaneous activity in different frequency bands within the same brain regions, highlighting its crucial role underlying complex cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "1Thyroid hormones clearly play a role in the seasonal regulation of reproduction, but any role they might play in song behavior and the associated seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds remains to be elucidated. To pursue this question, we first established seasonal patterns in the expression of thyroid hormone regulating genes in male European starlings employing in situ hybridization methods. Thyroid hormone transporter LAT1 expression in the song nucleus HVC was elevated during the photosensitive phase, pointing towards an active role of thyroid hormones during this window of possible neuroplasticity. In contrast DIO3 expression was high in HVC during the photostimulated phase, limiting the possible effect of thyroid hormones to maintain song stability during the breeding season. Next, we studied the effect of hypothyroidism on song behavior and neuroplasticity using in vivo MRI. Hypothyroidism inhibited the photostimulation-induced increase in testosterone, confirming the role of thyroid hormones in activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Surprisingly, apart from the myelination of several tracts during the photostimulated phase, most neuroplasticity related to song production was unaffected by hypothyroidism. Remarkably, T3 plasma concentrations were negatively correlated to the microstructural changes in several song control nuclei. Potentially, a global reduction of circulating thyroid hormones during the photosensitive period is necessary to lift the brake imposed by the photorefractory period, whereas local fine-tuning of thyroid hormone concentrations through LAT1 could activate underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms. Given the complexity of thyroid hormone effects, this study is a steppingstone to disentangle the influence of thyroid hormones on seasonal neuroplasticity.",

    "abstract": "Perception is linked to a calcium-dependent dendritic spiking mechanism that enables the major output cells of the cerebral cortex - layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons - to combine inputs from different information streams. Which circuits activate this mechanism upon sensory input is unclear. Here we found that thalamocortical axons, which provide sensory input to cortex, target specifically the dendritic domains in pyramidal tract neurons that initiate calcium spikes. Sensory input thereby enables distal dendritic inputs preceding the stimulus to transform the first responses that leave cortex into bursts of action potentials. Thus, thalamus can drive active dendritic coupling of sensory with prestimulus information streams to modulate cortical output. Our findings indicate that thalamocortical coupling is first in a cascade of mechanisms that transform sensory input into perception.",

Safe food and dish handling guidelines are not easily evidenced for pet owners. The study was designed to investigate dog owners feeding habits and evaluate the impact of the Food and Drug Association (FDA) hygiene protocols on dog food dish contamination. Procedures and surveys were approved by NCSU-IACUC and -IRB. Pet feeding and food dish hygiene data were collected from 417 dog owner surveys and 68 food dish swabs. Total aerobic cell counts (TAC) were performed on 68 dishes and randomly assigned into Group A (FDA pet food handling and dish hygiene guidelines), Group B (FDA pet and human food handling and dish hygiene guidelines), or Group C (no guidelines). Hygiene protocols were instituted in-home for 1 week, followed by a second TAC and follow-up survey. Survey from dog owners-households indicated: 4.7% were aware of FDA pet food handling and dish hygiene guidelines; 36% have individuals [&le;] 13 years old and/or immunocompromised; 43% store dog food 0-5 feet from human food; 34% wash their hands after feeding; and 33% prepare their dog food on human food preparation surfaces. The hygiene protocols followed by Groups A and B resulted in significant decreases in food dish TAC (P<0.001; 1.40; p=0.026; 0.604, respectively), as compared to Group C (p=0.373). Hot water (>160F) washing decreased TAC (p=0.005) over cold/lukewarm water. In the follow-up survey, 8% of Group A and B respondents reported likely to adhere to protocols long-term. This study suggests a need for pet food handling and dish hygiene guideline education to minimize bacterial contamination of dishes, especially in high-risk households.",

Five Mycoplasma strains, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides (Mmm), Mycoplasma bovis (Mb), Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg) and Mycoplasma synoviae (Ms) were isolated from various parts of the country. The initial titers of the strains determined by the agar plate count before storage were 42.4x107 UFC/ml (8.6 log UFC/ml) for Mmm strain; 32.4x108 UFC/ml (9.51 log UFC/ml) for M.bovis strain; 12.4x109 UFC/ml (10.09 log UFC/ml) for Ma strain; 2.4x109 UFC/ml (9.38 log UFC/ml) for Mg and 2.8x109 UFC/ml (9.45 log UFC/ml) for Ms strain. After 3 weeks of storage, no viable mycoplasmas were detected in all the conservation media at +37{degrees}C and after 3 months of storage at +4{degrees}C except for the lyophilized cultures in which an average viability rate of 17.81% was observed. Overall, the mycoplasma strains remained viable at freezing temperatures after 24 months regardless of the storage medium, but with decreasing titers, which was noticeable with mycoplasma complete media, and mycoplasma media with horse serum. Conversely, at -20{degrees}C the average viability rates after 24 months of storage were 84.36% (with glycerol) and 90.04% (lyophilized cultures). At -85{degrees}C after 24 months of storage, this was 87.98% (with glycerol) and 91.44% (lyophilized cultures). These findings suggest that, in the absence of the lysophylisation process, the addition of glycerol may be recommended for long-term storage of frozen mycoplasma isolates.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteriophages are phages that interact with mycobacteria resulting in their killing. Although lysis is the major mechanism by which mycobacteriophages cause cell death, other mechanisms may also be involved. The present study was initiated with the objective of investigating the changes that take place at the cellular level following the infection of mycobacterial cells by phage D29. To investigate this issue, we took recourse to performing immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies. Transmission electron microscopic examination revealed the adsorption of phages on to the surface of mycobacteria, following which penetration of the tail through the thick mycoloic acid layer was seen. At later time points discrete populations of cells at different stages of lysis were observed, which comprised of completely lysed cells, in which the cells were fragmented and those at the early onset stage exhibited formation of membrane pores through which the phages and intracellular contents were released. SEM results also indicated that phages may come out through the entire surface of the cell, or alternatively through gaps in the surface. In some of the images we observed structures that apparently resembled membrane blebs which are normally encountered when cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD). In addition, we observed significant increase in DNA fragmentation as well as membrane depolarization, which are also indicative of occurrence of PCD. As several bacterial PCD pathways are mediated by the toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules, the expression profile of all the TA systems was examined before and after phage infection. Apart from specifically addressing the issue of PCD in mycobacteriophage infected cells, this investigation has led to the development of facile tools necessary for investigating mycobacteriophage-mycobacteria interactions by means of microscopic methods.",

    "abstract": "Isoprenoids are the largest group of natural products, found in all living organisms and play an essential role in numerous cellular processes. These compounds are synthesized by prenyltransferases, catalyzing the condensation reaction between an allylic diphosphate primer and a variable number of isopentenyl diphosphate (C5) units. This superfamily of enzymes can be subdivided into trans- or cis-prenyltransferases according to the stereoisomerism of the product. The cis branch can be further classified according to product length. While the active site volume was suggested to determine the final length in enzymes synthesizing short- and medium-chain products (up to C60), long-chain enzymes (up to C120) and rubber synthases (>C10,000) fail to conform to this paradigm. Here, to resolve the structural basis for long-chain isoprenoid synthesis, we focused on the human cis-prenyltransferase complex (hcis-PT). This enzyme, peripheral to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, produces the precursor for dolichol phosphate, a membrane residing glycosyl carrier. In line with its crucial role in the cellular protein glycosylation machinery, disease-causing mutations in hcis-PT were shown to result in a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. The crystallographic structures of hcis-PT in four different substrate/product-bound conformations revealed an outlet enabling product elongation into the bulk solvent. Moreover, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analysis in solution showed that the hydrophobic active site core is flanked by dynamic regions consistent with separate inlet and outlet orifices. Finally, using a fluorescent substrate analog and a fluorescently-labeled lipid nanodiscs, we show that product elongation and membrane association are closely correlated. Together, our results support directional product synthesis in long-chain enzymes and rubber synthases, with a distinct substrate inlet and product outlet, allowing direct membrane insertion of the elongating isoprenoid during catalysis. This mechanism uncouples active site volume from product length and circumvents the need to expulse hydrophobic product into a polar environment prior to membrane insertion.",

Recent work suggests that SChLAP1 may bind the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to promote prostate cancer metastasis, though the exact role of SWI/SNF recognition is debated. To date, there are no detailed biochemical studies of apo SChLAP1 or SChLAP1:protein complexes. Herein, we report the first secondary structure model of SChLAP1 using SHAPE-MaP and DMS-MaPseq both in vitro and in cellulo. Comparison of the in vitro and in cellulo data via {Delta}SHAPE identified putative protein binding sites within SChLAP1, specifically to evolutionarily conserved exons of the transcript. We also demonstrate that global SChLAP1 secondary structure is sensitive to both purification method and magnesium concentration. Furthermore, we identified a 3'-fragment of SChLAP1 (SChLAP1Frag) that harbors multiple potential protein binding sites and presents a robustly folded secondary structure, supporting a functional role for this region.

In lung tumors, a network of neutrophils states with graded protumorigenic properties is conserved between mouse and humans and include a subset of mature, long lived cells expressing the sialic-acid-binding protein SiglecF (SiglecFhigh neu). The mechanism of recruitment of SiglecFhigh neu into tumor tissues and the impact on local anti-tumor T cell responses and interference with immunotherapy is still elusive.\n\nMethodsWe used an immunogenic model of KrasG12D Tp53 null adenocarcinoma of the lung to screen for factors inducing the recruitment of SiglecFhigh neu, followed by gene editing to delete selected candidates. We analyzed frequencies and effector functions of endogenous CD8 T cell responses in controls and SiglecFhigh neu depleted tumors by flow cytometry and functional assays. Tissues fluorescence and confocal imaging of lung sections was used to explore the relative distribution of neu and CD8 T cells. To establish the impact of SiglecFhigh neu on anti-tumoral immune responses we treated cohort of animals with anti-PD-L1 antibodies to evaluate tumor growth in control conditions and under therapy.\n\nResultsWe found that tumor tissues express high levels of CXCL5, mapping to cancer cells. Upon deletion of chemokine expression by gene editing, the recruitment of SiglecFhigh neu was almost entirely abrogated. In tumors depleted of SiglecFhigh neu, the density of tumor specific endogenous CD8 T cells was 3-fold higher than in controls and showed significantly enhanced activation and effector functions. Importantly, checkpoint blockade with anti PD-L1 antibodies was ineffective in control tumors but showed a significant benefit in SiglecFhigh neu depleted tumors.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates that SiglecFhigh neu differentiating in lung tumor tissues inhibit local CD8 T cell responses and interfere with the success of checkpoint blockade. These data suggest that blocking selectively tissue resident neu may promote better responses to immunotherapy.",

Tubular carriers play major roles in the flux of membrane lipids and proteins to acceptor organelles. However, how lipids and proteins impose a tubular geometry on the carriers is incompletely understood. By exploiting imaging approaches at different scales on cells and in vitro membrane systems, we show that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1) govern the formation, stability and functions of recycling endosomal tubules. Endosomal PI4P production by type II PI4-kinases is needed to form nascent curved tubules through binding of BLOC-1 that stabilize and elongate them. Membrane remodeling by the PI4P/ BLOC-1 module functions not only in the recycling of endosomal cargoes, but also in the lifecycles of intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia bacteria and influenza virus. This study demonstrates how a phospholipid and a protein complex coordinate as a minimal machinery to remodel cellular membranes into functional tubes.",
