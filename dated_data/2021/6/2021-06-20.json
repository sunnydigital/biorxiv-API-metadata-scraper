    "abstract": "Populations are shaped by their history. It is crucial to interpret population structure in an evolutionary context. Pairwise FST measures population structure, whereas population-specific FST measures deviation from the ancestral population. To understand the current population structure and a populations history of range expansion, we propose a representation method that overlays population-specific FST estimates on a sampling location map, and on an unrooted neighbor-joining tree and a multi-dimensional scaling plot inferred from a pairwise FST distance matrix. We examined the usefulness of our procedure using simulations that mimicked population colonization from an ancestral population and by analyzing published human, Atlantic cod, and wild poplar data. Our results demonstrated that population-specific FST values identify the source population and trace the evolutionary history of its derived populations. Conversely, pairwise FST values represent the current population structure. By integrating the results of both estimators, we obtained a new picture of the population structure that incorporates evolutionary history. The generalized least squares of genome-wide population-specific FST indicated that the wild poplar population expanded its distribution to the north, where daylight hours are long in summer, to seashores with abundant rainfall, and to the south with dry summers. Genomic data highlight the power of the bias-corrected moment estimators of FST, whether global, pairwise, or population-specific, that provide unbiased estimates of FST. All FST moment estimators described in this paper have reasonable process times and are useful in population genomics studies. The R codes for our method and simulations are available in the Supplemental Material.",

    "abstract": "Since Kepler (1604) and Descartes (1637), its been suggested that  vergence (the angular rotation of the eyes) plays a key role in size constancy. However, this has never been tested divorced from confounding cues such as changes in the retinal image. In our experiment participants viewed a target which grew or shrank over 5 seconds. At the same time the fixation distance specified by vergence was reduced from 50cm to 25cm. The question was whether the reduction in the viewing distance specified by vergence biased the participants judgements of whether the target grew or shrank? We found no evidence of any bias, and therefore no evidence that eye movements affect perceived size. If this is correct, then this finding has three implications: First, perceived size is much more reliant on cognitive influences than previously thought. This is consistent with the argument that visual scale is purely cognitive in nature (Linton, 2017; 2018). Second, it leads us to question whether the vergence modulation of V1 contributes to size constancy. Third, given the interaction between vergence, proprioception, and the retinal image in the Taylor illusion, it leads us to ask whether this cognitive approach could also be applied to multisensory integration.",

    "abstract": "Animal studies revealed a mood-regulating neural pathway linking intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. As humans too have luminance-encoding ipRGCs, we asked whether a similar pathway exist in humans. Here, fMRI was used to identify PFC regions and other areas exhibiting luminance-dependent signals. We report 29 human brain regions where activation either monotonically decreased or increased with luminance. Luxotonic activity was identified across the cerebral cortex, in diverse subcortical structures, and in the cerebellum, regions that have functions related to visual image formation, motor control, cognition, emotion, and reward processing. Light suppressed PFC activation level, the activation monotonically decreasing with increasing luminance. The sustained time course of light-evoked PFC responses, and their susceptibility to prior light exposure, most closely resembled those of ipRGCs. These findings offer a functional link between light exposure and PFC-mediated cognitive and affective phenomena.",

MEF of type Ube1L-/- are composed of two distinct sub-populations, the strong type that sustains a strong viral infection and the weak type, sustaining a weak viral load. We present new data on the virus load infection of Ube1L-/-, which have been micro-printed in a checker board pattern of different sizes of the inner squares. Surprisingly, the total viral load at one day after inoculation significantly depends on the sizes of the inner squares. We explain this observation by using a reaction diffusion model and we show that mathematical homogenization can explain the observed inhomogeneities. If the individual patches are large, then the growth rate and the carrying capacity will be the arithmetic means of the patches. For finer and finer patches the average growth rate is still the arithmetic mean, however, the carrying capacity uses the harmonic mean. While fitting the PDE to the experimental data, we also predict that a discrepancy in virus load would be unobservable after only half a day. Furthermore, we predict the viral load in different inner squares that had not been measured in our experiment and the travelling distance the virions can reach after one day.",

    "abstract": "The subcellular membrane-trafficking system plays many roles in cell growth and morphogenesis, from bulk membrane provision to targeted delivery of membrane proteins and other cargos. In tracheal terminal cells of the Drosophila respiratory system, endocytosis and trafficking through late endosomes balances membrane delivery between the basal plasma membrane and the apical membrane that forms a subcellular tube, but it has been unclear how the direction of growth of the subcellular tube with the overall growth of the cell is coordinated. We show here that endosomes are involved in this process as coordinators of F-actin. Actin assembles around late endocytic vesicles in the growth cone of the cell, reaching from the tip of the subcellular tube to the leading filopodia of the basal membrane. Preventing actin nucleation at late endosomes disturbs the directionality of tube growth, uncoupling it from the direction of cell elongation. Severing actin in this area affects tube integrity. Our findings show a new role for late endosomes in directing cell morphogenesis by organizing actin, in addition to their known role in membrane and protein trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The design of genetic circuits typically relies on characterization of constituent modules in isolation to predict the behavior of modules composition. However, it has been shown that the behavior of a genetic module changes when other modules are in the cell due to competition for shared resources. In order to engineer multi-module circuits that behave as intended, it is thus necessary to predict changes in the behavior of a genetic module when other modules load cellular resources. Here, we introduce two characteristics of circuit modules: the demand for cellular resources and the sensitivity to resource loading. When both are known for every genetic module in a circuit library, they can be used to predict any modules behavior upon addition of any other module to the cell. We develop an experimental approach to measure both characteristics for any circuit module using a resource sensor module. Using the measured resource demand and sensitivity for each module in a library, the outputs of the modules can be accurately predicted when they are inserted in the cell in arbitrary combinations. These resource competition characteristics may be used to inform the design of genetic circuits that perform as predicted despite resource competition.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGroup living is beneficial for individuals, but also comes with costs. One such cost is the increased possibility of pathogen transmission because increased numbers or frequencies of social contacts are often associated with increased parasite abundance or diversity. The social structure of a group or population is paramount to patterns of infection and transmission. Yet, for various reasons, studies investigating the links between sociality and parasitism in animals, especially in primates, have only accounted for parts of the group (e.g., only adults), which is likely to impact the interpretation of results. Here, we investigated the relationship between social network centrality and an estimate of gastrointestinal helminth infection intensity in a whole group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We then tested the impact of omitting parts of the group on this relationship. We aimed to test: (1) whether social network centrality - in terms of the number of partners (degree), frequency of interactions (strength), and level of social integration (eigenvector) - was linked to parasite infection intensity (estimated by eggs per gram of faeces, EPG); and, (2) to what extent excluding portions of individuals within the group might influence the observed relationship. We conducted social network analysis on data collected from one group of Japanese macaques over three months on Koshima Island, Japan. We then ran a series of knock-out simulations. General linear mixed models showed that, at the whole-group level, network centrality was positively associated with geohelminth infection intensity. However, in partial networks with only adult females, only juveniles, or random subsets of the group, the strength of this relationship - albeit still generally positive - lost statistical significance. Furthermore, knock-out simulations where individuals were removed but network metrics were retained from the original whole-group network showed that these changes are partly a power issue and partly an effect of sampling the incomplete network. Our study indicates that sampling bias can thus hamper our ability to detect real network effects involving social interaction and parasitism. In addition to supporting earlier results linking geohelminth infection to Japanese macaque social networks, this work introduces important methodological considerations for research into the dynamics of social transmission, with implications for infectious disease epidemiology, population management, and health interventions.",

In the ovary, acutely induced PGR is the key determinant of ovulation through transcriptional control of a unique set of genes that culminates in follicle rupture. However, the molecular mechanisms for PGRs specialised function in ovulation is poorly understood. To address this, we assembled a detailed genomic profile of PGR action through combined ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis in wildtype and isoform-specific PGR null mice. We demonstrated the unique action of PGR-A isoform in the ovary through a transcriptional complex involving physical interaction with RUNX and JUN/FOS transcription factors. The assembly of this unique complex directs targeting of PGR binding to proximal promoter regions and enables chromatin accessibility, leading to ovulatory gene induction. This PGR signalling mechanism is specific to ovulation and provides potential targets for infertility treatments as well as new contraceptives that block ovulation.",

Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of Ycf1 at 3.4[A] and 4.0[A] in distinct inward-facing open conformations capturing a previously unobserved ordered state of the intrinsically disordered regulatory domain (R-domain). R-domain phosphorylation is clearly evident and induces a topology promoting electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with Nucleotide Binding Domain 1 (NBD1) and the lasso domain. These interactions stay constant between the structures and are related by rigid body movements of the NBD1/R-domain complex. Biochemical data further show R-domain phosphorylation reorganizes the Ycf1 architecture and is required for maximal ATPase activity. Together, we provide long-sought after insights into how R-domains control ABCC transporter activity.",

    "abstract": "Electron microscopy of biological tissue has recently seen an unprecedented increase in imaging throughput moving the ultrastructural analysis of large tissue blocks such as whole brains into the realm of the feasible. However, homogeneous, high quality electron microscopy staining of large biological samples is still a major challenge. To date, assessing the staining quality in electron microscopy requires running a sample through the entire staining protocol end-to-end, which can take weeks or even months for large samples, rendering protocol optimization for such samples to be inefficient.\n\nHere we present an in situ time-lapsed X-ray assisted staining procedure that opens the \"black box\" of electron microscopy staining and allows observation of individual staining steps in real time. Using this novel method we measured the accumulation of heavy metals in large tissue samples immersed in different staining solutions. We show that the measured accumulation of osmium in fixed tissue obeys empirically a quadratic dependence between the incubation time and sample size. We found that potassium ferrocyanide, a classic reducing agent for osmium tetroxide, clears the tissue after osmium staining and that the tissue expands in osmium tetroxide solution, but shrinks in reduced osmium solution.\n\nX-ray assisted staining gave access to the in situ staining kinetics and allowed us to develop a diffusion-reaction-advection model that accurately simulates the measured accumulation of osmium in tissue. These are first steps towards in silico staining experiments and simulation-guided optimization of staining protocols for large samples. Hence, X-ray assisted staining will be a useful tool for the development of reliable staining procedures for large samples such as entire brains of mice, monkeys or humans.",

    "abstract": "1Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives microglia motility and cytokine production by activating P2X- and P2Y- class purinergic receptors with extracellular ATP and its metabolites. Purinergic receptor activation gives rise to diverse intracellular Ca2+ signals, or waveforms, that differ in amplitude, duration, and frequency. Whether and how these diverse waveforms influence microglia function is not well established. We developed a computational model trained with published primary murine microglia studies. We simulate how purinoreceptors influence Ca2+ signaling and migration and how purinoreceptor expression modifies these processes. Our simulation confirmed that P2 receptors encode the amplitude and duration of the ATP-induced calcium waveforms. Our simulations also implicate CD39, an ectonucleotidase that rapidly degrades ATP, as a regulator of purinergic receptor-induced Ca2+ responses. We, therefore, next evaluated how purinoreceptors and ectonucleotidase work in tandem. Our modeling results indicate that small transients are sufficient to promote motility, while large and sustained transients are needed for cytokine responses. Lastly, we predict how these phenotypical responses vary in a BV2 microglia cell line using published P2 receptor mRNA data to illustrate how our computer model can be extrapolated to diverse microglia subtypes. These findings provide important insights into how differences in purinergic receptor expression influence the microglias responses to ATP.",

    "abstract": "The recently published mitochondrial genome of the fingerprint oyster Alectryonella plicatula (Gmelin, 1791) with GenBank accession number MW143047 was resolved in an unexpected phylogenetic position, as sister to the Pacific cupped oyster Magallana gigas (Thunberg, 1793) and share with this species three typical gene duplications that represent robust synapomorphies of the Magallana clade. In this study, we verified the identity of MW143047 using direct comparisons of single gene sequences, DNA barcoding and phylogenetic analyses. BLAST searches using each of the 12 protein coding genes and rRNA genes extracted from MW143047 as query retrieved M. gigas as best hit with 100% sequence identity. MW143047 is nested within the clade formed by M. gigas sequences, with virtually no difference between their terminal branch lengths, both in the cox1 gene tree (based on 3639 sequences) and in the 16S gene tree (based on 1839 sequences), as well as in the Maximum Likelihood mitogenomic tree based on concatenated sequence of 12 PCGs. Our findings suggest that the original specimen used for mitogenome sequencing was misidentified and represents an individual of M. gigas. This study reinforces the notion that morphological shell analysis alone is not sufficient for oyster identification, not even at high taxonomic ranks such as subfamilies. While it is well established that morphological identification of oysters should be validated by molecular data, this study emphasizes that also molecular data should be taxonomically validated by means of DNA barcoding and phylogenetic analyses. The implications of the publication of taxonomically misidentified sequences and mitogenomes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Several reviews have strongly implicated prefrontal cortical engagement in expectation-based placebo analgesia. We recently found a robust placebo analgesic response and associated decreases in pain-related cortical activations, without observable prefrontal engagement. We hypothesized our substantial conditioning and weak verbal instructions diminished expectation-related prefrontal activation. To test this, we examined the same subjects during a conditioning procedure, in which expectancy of pain relief was high. In two conditioning sessions, noxious heat was applied to a leg region treated with an \"analgesic\" cream and another treated with a \"moisturizing\" cream. In reality, both creams were inert, but the temperature applied to the moisturizing-cream area was 2{degrees}C higher than that applied to the analgesic-cream area.\n\nFunctional MRI was acquired during the second conditioning session. Pain ratings were lower for the low heat than the high heat, with corresponding reduced activations in pain-related regions. Similar to previous studies with strong expectation for pain relief, we observed more prefrontal activations during the \"analgesic\" than the control condition. Nevertheless, contrary to the idea of active prefrontal engagement, the relative activation was based on differences in negative BOLD signals. A literature review revealed that only a few studies conclusively showed active engagement of prefrontal cortex, i.e. increased positive BOLD signal during high expectation compared to a control, with variable timing and spatial-specificity. We suggest that this variability is due to the heterogeneous influence of cognitive, emotional and motivational factors. Future studies should attempt to unravel the multiple contributions to placebo responsiveness in the prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Peristalsis, the coordinated contraction - relaxation of the muscles of the stomach is important for normal gastric motility and is impaired in motility disorders. Coordinated electrical depolarizations that originate and propagate within a network of interconnected layers of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and smooth muscle (SM) cells of the stomach wall as a slow-wave, underly peristalsis. Normally, the gastric slow-wave oscillates with a single period and uniform rostrocaudal lag, exhibiting network entrainment. Understanding of the integrative role of neurotransmission and intercellular coupling in the propagation of an entrained gastric slow-wave, important for understanding motility disorders, however, remains incomplete. Using a computational framework constituted of a novel gastric motility network (GMN) model we address the hypothesis that engaging biological oscillators (i.e., ICCs) by constitutive gap junction coupling mechanisms and enteric neural stimulus activated signals can confer a robust entrained gastric slow-wave. We demonstrate that while a decreasing enteric neural stimulus gradient that modulates the intracellular IP3 concentration in the ICCs can guide the aboral slow-wave propagation essential for peristalsis, engaging ICCs by recruiting the exchange of second messengers (inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+) ensures a robust entrained longitudinal slow-wave, even in the presence of biological variability in coupling strengths. Our GMN with the distinct intercellular coupling in conjunction with the intracellular feedback pathways and a rostrocaudal enteric neural stimulus gradient allows gastric slow waves to oscillate with a moderate range of frequencies and to propagate with a broad range of velocities, thus preventing decoupling observed in motility disorders. Overall, the findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of decoupled slow waves associated with motility impairments of the stomach, offer directions for future experiments and theoretical work, and can potentially aid in the design of new interventional pharmacological and neuromodulation device treatments for addressing gastric motility disorders.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe coordinated contraction and relaxation of the muscles of the stomach, known as peristalsis is important for normal gastric motility and primarily governed by electrical depolarizations that originate and propagate within a network of interconnected layers of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and smooth muscle cells of the stomach wall as a slow-wave. Under normal conditions, a gastric slow-wave oscillates with a single period and uniform rostrocaudal lag, exhibiting network entrainment. However, the understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that ensure propagation of a robust entrained slow-wave remains incomplete. Here, using a computational framework, we show that in conjunction with an enteric neural stimulus gradient along the rostrocaudal ICC chain, and intercellular electrical coupling, the intercellular exchange of inositol trisphosphate between ICCs prevents decoupling by extending the longitudinal entrainment range along the stomach wall, even when variability in intercellular coupling exists. The findings from our study indicate ways that ensure the rostrocaudal spread of a robust gastric slow-wave and provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of decoupled slow waves associated with motility impairments of the stomach.",

    "abstract": "Opioids are the frontline analgesics for managing various types of pain. Paradoxically, repeated use of opioid analgesics may cause an exacerbated pain state known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), which significantly contributes to dose escalation and consequently opioid overdose. Neuronal malplasticity in pain circuits has been the predominant proposed mechanism of OIH expression. Although glial cells are known to become reactive in OIH animal models, their biological contribution to OIH remains to be defined and their activation mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that reactive astrocytes (a.k.a. astrogliosis) are critical for OIH development in both male and female mice. Genetic ablation of astrogliosis inhibited the expression of OIH and morphine-induced neural circuit polarization (NCP) in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH). We found that Wnt5a is a neuron-to-astrocyte signal that is required for morphine-induced astrogliosis. Conditional knock-out of Wnt5a in neurons or its co-receptor ROR2 in astrocytes blocked not only morphine-induced astrogliosis but also OIH and NCP. Furthermore, we showed that the Wnt5a-ROR2 signaling-dependent astrogliosis contributes to OIH via inflammasome-regulated IL-1{beta}. Our results reveal an important role of morphine-induced astrogliosis in OIH pathogenesis and elucidate a neuron-to-astrocyte intercellular Wnt signaling pathway that controls the astrogliosis.",

In this study, we combined single molecule sequencing of long reads (Pacific Sciences) with Chromatin Conformation Capture sequencing (Hi-C) data to provide the first chromosome-level genome reference for this species. The high-quality assembly encompassed more than 598 Megabases (Mb) assigned to 1 594 scaffolds (scaffold N50 = 25 Mb) with 96 % of its total length distributed among 24 chromosomes. The investigation of its syntenic relationships with other economically important flatfish species revealed a high conservation of synteny blocks among members of this phylogenetic clade. Sex determination analysis revealed that flatfishes do not escape the rule applied to other teleost fish and exhibit a high level of plasticity and turnover in sex-determination mechanisms. A whole-genome sequence analysis of 198 individuals allowed us to draw a full picture of the molecular sex determination (SD) system for Greenland Halibut, revealing that this species possesses a very nascent male heterogametic XY system, with a putative major effect of the sox2 gene, also described as the main SD driver in two other flatfishes. Interestingly, our study also suggested for the first time in flatfishes that a putative Y-autosomal fusion could be associated with a reduction of recombination typical of early steps of sex chromosome evolution.",

The LH1 complex forms a C-shaped structure composed of 14 {beta}-polypeptides around the RC with a large ring opening. From the cryo-EM density map, a previously unrecognized integral membrane protein, referred to as protein-U, was identified. Protein-U has a U-shaped conformation near the LH1-ring opening and was annotated as a hypothetical protein in the Rba. sphaeroides genome. Deletion of protein-U resulted in a mutant strain that expressed a much-reduced amount of the dimeric LH1-RC, indicating an important role for protein-U in dimerization of the LH1-RC complex. PufX was located opposite protein-U on the LH1-ring opening, and both its position and conformation differed from that of previous reports of dimeric LH1-RC structures obtained at low-resolution. Twenty-six molecules of the carotenoid spheroidene arranged in two distinct configurations were resolved in the Rba. sphaeroides LH1 and were positioned within the complex to block its pores.

    "abstract": "Engineered nanoparticles are advantageous for numerous biotechnology applications, including biomolecular sensing and delivery. However, testing the compatibility and function of nanotechnologies in biological systems requires a heuristic approach, where unpredictable biofouling via protein corona formation often prevents effective implementation. Moreover, rational design of biomolecule-nanoparticle conjugates requires prior knowledge of such interactions or extensive experimental testing. Toward better applying engineered nanoparticles in biological systems, herein, we develop a random forest classifier (RFC) trained with proteomic mass spectrometry data that identifies proteins that adsorb to nanoparticles, based solely on the proteins amino acid sequence. We model proteins that populate the corona of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based optical nanosensor and study whether there is a relationship between the proteins amino acid-based properties and the proteins adsorption to SWCNTs. We optimize the classifier and characterize the classifier performance against other models. To evaluate the predictive power of our model, we apply the classifier to rapidly identify proteins with high binding affinity to SWCNTs, followed by experimental validation. We further determine protein features associated with increased likelihood of SWCNT binding: high content of solvent-exposed glycine residues and non-secondary structure-associated amino acids. Conversely, proteins with high content of leucine residues and beta-sheet-associated amino acids are less likely to form the SWCNT protein corona. The classifier presented herein provides a step toward undertaking the otherwise intractable problem of predicting protein-nanoparticle interactions, which is needed for more rapid and effective translation of nanobiotechnologies from in vitro synthesis to in vivo use.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=66 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/449132v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bbc175org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a0b94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e22e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b40a84_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Extracellular glycans, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), provide an essential regulatory component during the development and maintenance of tissues. GAGs, which harbor binding sites for a range of growth factors and other morphogens, help establish gradients of these molecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and promote the formation of active signaling complexes when presented at the cell surface. As such, GAGs have been pursued as biologically active components for the development of biomaterials for cell-based regenerative therapies. However, their structural complexity and compositional heterogeneity make establishing structure-function relationships for this class of glycans difficult. Here, we describe a stem cell array platform, in which GAG polysaccharides are conjugated to adhesion proteins and introduced into a polyacrylamide hydrogel network to directly measure their contributions to the activation of growth factor signaling pathways in cells. With the recent emergence of powerful synthetic and recombinant technologies to produce well-defined GAG structures, a platform for analyzing both growth factor binding and signaling in response to the presence of these biomolecules will provide a powerful tool for integrating glycans into biomaterials to advance their biological properties and applications.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=170 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/448747v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@42584forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3defcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4796borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f6e23_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The present study describes the integration of glycosaminoglycan-protein conjugates into a hydrogel-supported stem cell microarray platform to analyze the activity of extracellular glycans in growth factor signaling.

HA was functionalized with photoreactive norbornene groups to create hydrogel networks that rapidly crosslink via thiol-ene click chemistry with tailored mechanics. Mechanical properties were controlled by modulating the amount of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable peptide crosslinker to produce hydrogels with increasing elastic moduli of 1.1 {+/-} 0.002, 3.0 {+/-} 0.002, and 10.6 {+/-} 0.006 kPa mimicking a relevant range of developing and mature muscle stiffnesses. Functional muscle recovery was assessed following implantation of the HA hydrogels by in situ photopolymerization into rat latissimus dorsi (LD) VML defects at 12 and 24 weeks post-injury. After 12 weeks, muscles treated with medium stiffness (3.0 kPa) hydrogels produced maximum isometric forces most similar to contralateral healthy LD muscles. This trend persisted at 24 weeks post-injury, suggestive of sustained functional recovery. Histological analysis revealed a significantly larger zone of regeneration with more de novo muscle fibers following implantation of medium stiffness hydrogels in VML-injured muscles compared to other experimental groups. Lower (low and medium) stiffness hydrogels also appeared to attenuate the chronic inflammatory response characteristic of VML injuries, displaying similar levels of macrophage infiltration and polarization to healthy muscle. Together these findings illustrate the importance of hydrogel mechanical properties in supporting functional repair of VML injuries.",

    "abstract": "Cells are enticingly complex systems. The identification of feedback regulation is critically important for understanding this complexity. Network motifs defined as small graphlets that occur more frequently than expected by chance have revolutionized our understanding of feed-back circuits in cellular networks. However, with their definition solely based on statistical over-representation, network motifs often lack biological context, which limits their usefulness. Here, we define functional network motifs (FNMs) through the systematic integration of genetic interaction data that directly informs on functional relationships between genes and encoded proteins. Occurring two orders of magnitude less frequently than conventional network motifs, we found FNMs significantly enriched in genes known to be functionally related. Moreover, our comprehensive analyses of FNMs in yeast showed that they are powerful at capturing both known and putative novel regulatory interactions, thus suggesting a promising strategy towards the systematic identification of feedback regulation in biological networks. Many FNMs appeared as excellent candidates for the prioritization of follow-up biochemical characterization, which is a recurring bottleneck in the targeting of complex diseases. More generally, our work highlights a fruitful avenue for integrating and harnessing genomic network data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscription factor(TF) interactions are known to regulate target gene(TG) expression in eukaryotes via TF regulatory modules(TRMs). Such interactions can be formed due to co-localizing TFs binding proximally to each other in the DNA sequence or over long distances between distally binding TFs via chromatin looping. While the former type of interaction has been characterized extensively, long distance TF interactions are still largely understudied. Furthermore, most prior approaches have focused on characterizing physical TF interactions without accounting for their effects on TG expression regulation. Understanding TRM based TG expression regulation could aid in understanding diseases caused by disruptions to these mechanisms. In this paper, we present a novel neural network based TRM detection approach that consists of using multi-omics TF based regulatory mechanism information to generate features for building non-linear multilayer perceptron TG expression prediction models in the GM12878 immortalized lymphoblastoid cells.\n\nResultsWe estimated main effects of 149 individual TFs and interaction effects of 48 distinct combinations of TFs forming TRMs based on their influence on TG expression. We identified several well-known and discovered multiple previously uncharacterized TF interactions within our detected set of TRMs. We further characterized the pairwise TRMs using long distance chromatin looping and motif co-occurrence data. We found that nearly all the TFs constituting TRMs detected by our approach interacted via chromatin looping, and that these TFs further interacted with promoters to influence TG expression through one of four possible regulatory configurations.\n\nConclusionHere, we have provided a framework for detecting TRMs using neural network models containing multi-omics TF based regulatory features. We have also described these TRMs based on their regulatory potential along with presenting evidence for the possibility of TF interactions forming the TRMs occurring via chromatin looping.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAccurate prediction of protein contact-map is essential for accurate protein structure and function prediction. As a result, many methods have been developed for protein contact map prediction. However, most methods rely on protein-sequence-evolutionary information, which may not exist for many proteins due to lack of naturally occurring homologous sequences. Moreover, generating evolutionary profiles is computationally intensive. Here, we developed a contact-map predictor utilizing the output of a pre-trained language model ESM-1b as an input along with a large training set and an ensemble of residual neural networks.\n\nResultsWe showed that the proposed method makes a significant improvement over a single-sequence-based predictor SSCpred with 15% improvement in the F1-score for the independent CASP14-FM test set. It also outperforms evolutionary-profile-based methods TrRosetta and SPOT-Contact with 48.7% and 48.5% respective improvement in the F1-score on the proteins without homologs (Neff=1) in the independent SPOT-2018 set. The new method provides a much faster and reasonably accurate alternative to evolution-based methods, useful for large-scale prediction.\n\nAvailabilityStand-alone-version of SPOT-Contact-Single is available at https://github.com/jas-preet/SPOT-Contact-Single.

    "abstract": "Read alignment to genomes is a fundamental computational step used in many bioinformatic analyses, and often, it is the computational bottleneck. Therefore, it is desirable to perform the alignment step as fast as possible without compromising accuracy. Most alignment algorithms consider a seed-and-extend approach, where the time-consuming seeding step identifies and decides on candidate mapping locations. Recently, several advances have been made on seeding methods for fast sequence comparison.\n\nWe combine two such methods, syncmers and strobemers, in a novel seeding approach for constructing dynamic-sized fuzzy seeds and implement the method in a short-read aligner, strobealign. Firstly, we show that our seeding is fast to construct and effectively reduces repetitiveness in the seeding step using a novel metric E-hits. Secondly, we benchmark strobealign to traditional and recently proposed aligners on simulated and biological data and show that strobealign is several times faster than traditional aligners such as BWA and Bowtie2 at similar and sometimes higher accuracy while being both faster and more accurate than more recently proposed aligners. Our aligner can free up substantial time and computing resources needed for read alignment in many pipelines.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ksahlin/strobealign.",

    "abstract": "The differential expression pattern of Carboxy terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein (CHIP, alias STIP1 Homology and U-box Containing Protein 1 or STUB1) in cancers is associated with ubiquitination mediated degradation of its client proteins. Emerging evidences suggest its abundant expression of CHIP in colorectal cancer compared to normal tissues, but the mechanistic detail of this augmented expression pattern is unclear. The signature driver of canonical Wnt pathway, {beta}-catenin, and its co-activator RNA helicase p68, are also overexpressed in colorectal cancer. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of Wnt/{beta}-catenin and p68 mediated transcriptional activation of CHIP gene leading to enhanced proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Wnt3A treatment and pharmacological activation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway resulted in increased nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin and elevated expression of CHIP. Likewise, overexpression and knockdown of {beta}-catenin and p68 upregulated and downregulated CHIP expression, respectively, at both mRNA and protein levels. After cloning CHIP promoter, the increased and decreased promoter activities of CHIP induced by overexpression and knockdown of either {beta}-catenin or p68 further confirmed transcriptional regulation of CHIP gene by Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling cascade. p68 along with {beta}-catenin were found to occupy Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) binding sites on endogenous CHIP promoter and regulate its transcription. Finally, enhanced cellular propagation and migration of colorectal cancer cells induced by  Wnt/{beta}-catenin-p68-CHIP axis established the significance of this pathway in oncogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report elucidating the mechanistic details of transcriptional regulation of CHIP (STUB1) gene expression.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation influences gene expression and is altered in many cancers, but the relationship between DNA methylation and cancer outcomes is not yet fully understood. If methylation of specific genes is associated with better or worse outcomes, it could implicate genes in driving cancer and suggest therapeutic strategies. To advance our understanding of DNA methylation in cancer biology, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of the relationship between methylation and overall survival. Using data on 28 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified genes and genomic regions whose methylation was recurrently associated with survival across multiple cancer types. While global DNA methylation levels are associated with outcome in some cancers, we found that the gene-specific associations were largely independent of these global effects. Genes with recurrent associations across cancer types were enriched for certain biological functions, such as immunity and cell-cell adhesion. While these recurrently associated genes were found throughout the genome, they were enriched in certain genomic regions, which may further implicate certain gene families and gene clusters in affecting survival. By finding common features across cancer types, our results link DNA methylation to patient outcomes, identify biological mechanisms that could explain survival differences, and support the potential value of treatments that modulate the methylation of tumor DNA.",

    "abstract": "The genus Saxicolella Engl. (Podostemaceae) are African rheophytes, restricted to rapids and waterfalls as are all members of the family. Previously, Saxicolella sensu lato was shown to be polyphyletic with two separate clades in the molecular phylogenetic study of Koi et al. (2012). The name Pohliella Engl. was recently resurrected for one clade that is sister to the American genera Ceratolacis (Tul.)Wedd., Podostemum Michx. and all Old World Podostemoideae (podostemoids) (Cheek 2020). Pohliella has distichous phyllotaxy, bilocular ovaries, filiform roots with paired holdfasts, and rootcaps. The second clade, Saxicolella sensu stricto, including the type of the generic name, has spiral phyllotaxy, unilocular ovaries, ribbon-like or crustose roots that lack both holdfasts and rootcaps. Saxicolella sensu stricto, sampled from the type species, S. nana Engl. of Cameroon, is embedded within and near the base of the major clade of African podostemoids and is sister to all other African genera apart from Inversodicraea R.E.Fr. and Monandriella Engl. Recently reduced to three species in Cameroon and S.E. Nigeria by the resurrection of Pohliella (3 - 4 species in Ghana and Nigeria-Cameroon), Saxicolella sensu stricto is expanded to eight species in this monograph by description of five new taxa. Saxicolella futa Cheek and S. deniseae Cheek are newly described from Guinea, S. ijim Cheek from Cameroon, the informally named S. sp. A from Gabon, and S. angola Cheek from Angola. The known geographic range of the genus is thus expanded c. 2,500 km westwards to Guinea from eastern Nigeria and c.1,500 km southeastwards from near Yaounde to Cuanza do Sul, Angola. The greatest concentration of species occurs in the Cross-Sanaga interval of western Cameroon and eastern Nigeria, with three species. Cameroon (3 species) followed by Nigeria and Guinea (2 species each) are the countries with highest species diversity. The genus can be expected to be found in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Congo Republic. A classification is proposed grouping the species into three subgenera (Saxicolella, Butumia (G.Taylor) Cheek comb. et. stat. nov. and Kinkonia Cheek subgen. nov.) based on root morphology and shoot position and morphology.\n\nThe discovery, morphology, circumscription, distribution, and ecology of Saxicolella is reviewed, an identification key to the species is presented, together with descriptions, synonymy, links to illustrations, and extinction risk assessments for each of the eight species now recognised. All of the species are provisionally assessed as either Endangered or Critically Endangered using the IUCN 2012 standard, making this genus among the most threatened of its size globally. The major threats, above all, are hydro-electric projects. Saxicolella deniseae may already be globally extinct, and two of the four known locations of S. angola appear lost, S. sp. A of Gabon is threatened at at least one of its three locations, while Saxicolella futa is threatened at all three locations, all due to incipient or active hydro-electric projects. Contamination of watercourses by increased turbidity from silt-load due anthropic changes and by eutrophication from pollution are also threats for the majority of the species.",

    "abstract": "Decoding brain states of the underlying cognitive processes via learning discriminative feature representations has recently gained a lot of interest in brain imaging studies. Particularly, there has been an impetus to encode the dynamics of brain functioning by analyzing temporal information available in the fMRI data. Long-short term memory (LSTM), a class of machine learning model possessing a \"memory\" component, is increasingly being observed to perform well in various applications with dynamic temporal behavior, including brain state decoding. Because of the dynamics and inherent latency in fMRI BOLD responses, future temporal context is crucial. However, it is neither encoded nor captured by the conventional LSTM model. This paper performs robust brain state decoding via information encapsulation from both the past and future instances of fMRI data via bi-directional LSTM. This allows for explicitly modeling the dynamics of BOLD response without any delay adjustment. The two hidden activations of forward and reverse directions in bi-LSTM are collated to build the \"memory\" of the model and are used to robustly predict the brain states at every time instance. Working memory data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) is utilized for validation and was observed to perform 18% better than its unidirectional counterpart in terms of accuracy in predicting the brain states.",

While it has been established that MHb cholinergic projections co-release glutamate, no direct evidence has demonstrated a role for this specific glutamate projection in nicotine consumption. In the present study, a novel floxed Slc17a7 (VGLUT1) mouse was generated and used to create conditional knockout (cKO) mice that lack VGLUT1 in MHb cholinergic neurons. Histochemical approaches and optogenetics-assisted electrophysiology were used to validate the disruption of VGLUT1 from cholinergic MHb to IPN projections. The mice displayed no gross phenotypic abnormalities and exhibited normal exploratory and locomotor behavior in the open-field assay. However, the loss of VGLUT1-mediated glutamate co-release led to increased nicotine self-administration. These findings indicate that glutamate co-release from ventral MHb cholinergic neurons opposes nicotine consumption and provide additional support for targeting this synapse to develop potential treatments to nicotine addiction.",

    "abstract": "A series of studies in which monkeys chose between two juices offered in variable amounts identified in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) different groups of neurons encoding the value of individual options (offer value), the binary choice outcome (chosen juice) and the chosen value. These variables capture both the input and the output of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. However, in previous experiments offers were presented simultaneously, raising the question of whether current notions generalize to when goods are presented or are examined in sequence. Recently, Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa (2019) examined OFC activity under sequential offers. An analysis of neuronal responses across time windows revealed that a small number of cell groups encoded specific sequences of variables. These sequences appeared analogous to the variables identified under simultaneous offers, but the correspondence remained tentative. Thus in the present study we examined the relation between cell groups found under sequential versus simultaneous offers. We recorded from the OFC while monkeys chose between different juices. Trials with simultaneous and sequential offers were randomly interleaved in each session. We classified cells in each choice modality and we examined the relation between the two classifications. We found a strong correspondence - in other words, the cell groups measured under simultaneous offers and under sequential offers were one and the same. This result indicates that economic choices under simultaneous or sequential offers rely on the same neural circuit.\n\nSignificance StatementResearch in the past 20 years has shed light on the neuronal underpinnings of economic choices. A large number of results indicates that decisions between goods are formed in a neural circuit within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In most previous studies, subjects chose between two goods offered simultaneously. Yet, in daily situations, goods available for choice are often presented or examined in sequence. Here we recorded neuronal activity in the primate OFC alternating trials under simultaneous and under sequential offers. Our analyses demonstrate that the same neural circuit supports choices in the two modalities. Hence current notions on the neuronal mechanisms underlying economic decisions generalize to choices under sequential offers.",

    "abstract": "When making decisions in real-life, we may receive discrete evidence during a time period. Although participants can integrate information from separate cues to improve their accuracy, it is still debatable how confidence changes after receiving discrete information. Nevertheless, based on the strong positive relationship between accuracy and confidence, we predicted that similar to what is observed in accuracy, confidence would improve following the integration of separate pieces of information. We used a Random-dot-motion discrimination task in which one or two brief stimuli (i.e., pulse[s]) were presented, and participants had to indicate the predominant direction of dot motions by saccadic eye movement. Two pulses intervals (up to 1s) were randomly selected, where color-coded targets facilitated indicating confidence simultaneously. Using behavioral data, computational models, pupillometry, and EEG methodology, our data revealed that compared to single-pulse trials, in double-pulse trials, participants improve their confidence resolution rather than reporting higher confidence and that the EEG signal (centro-parietal-positivity) and pupil dynamics appear to follow confidence levels but only in double-pulse trials. Overall, our findings suggest that evidence integration helps to improve the associations between confidence and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "It has been widely assumed that internal forward models use efference copies to create predictions about the sensory consequences of our own actions. While these predictions had been frequently associated with reduced neural processing in sensory cortices, the timing and duration of the hemodynamic response of self-generated as opposed to externally generated movements is poorly investigated. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that predictive mechanisms for self-generated actions lead to early and shorter neural processing compared with externally generated movements. Using a first and second-order Taylor approximation in terms of the temporal (TD) and dispersion (DD) derivatives of a canonical hemodynamic response function, we investigated the timing and duration of activation for self-generated and externally generated movements using a custom-made fMRI-compatible movement device. Visual video feedback of the active and passive hand movements were presented in real time or with variable delays (0 - 417 ms). Participants had to judge, whether the feedback was delayed. We found earlier feedback processing for self-generated compared to externally generated movements in several regions including the supplementary motor area, cerebellum, subcortical structures such as the putamen and visual cortices. Shorter processing was found in areas, which show also lower blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) amplitudes, such as the SMA, occipital and parietal cortex. Specifically, earlier activation in the putamen, of self-generated movements was associated with worse performance in detecting delays. These findings support our hypothesis, that efference copy based predictive mechanisms enable earlier processing of action feedback, as potential source for behavioral effects.",

    "abstract": "Investigating neural interactions is essential to understanding the neural basis of behavior. Many statistical methods have been used for analyzing neural activity, but estimating the direction of network interactions correctly and efficiently remains a difficult problem (1). Here, we derive dynamical differential covariance (DDC), a new method based on dynamical network models that detects directional interactions with low bias and high noise tolerance under nonstationarity conditions. The method was first validated and compared with other methods on networks with false positive motifs and multiscale neural simulations where the ground truth connectivity was known. When applied to recordings of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) recordings, DDC consistently detected regional interactions with strong structural connectivity in over 1,000 individual subjects obtained by diffusion MRI (dMRI). DDC is a promising new family of methods for estimating functional connectivity that can be generalized to a wide range of dynamical models and recording techniques and to other applications where system identification from sparse data is needed.\n\nSignificance StatementThrough dynamical interactions with each other, neurons make it possible for us to sense, move and think. It is now possible to simultaneously record from many individual neurons and brain regions. Methods for analyzing these large-scale recordings are needed that can reveal how the patterns of activity give rise to behavior. We developed an efficient, intuitive and robust way to analyze these recordings and validated it on simulations of model neural networks where the ground truth was known. We called this method dynamical differential covariance (DDC) because it can estimate not only the presence of a connection but also which direction the information is flowing in a network between neurons or cortical areas. We also successfully applied DDC to brain imaging data from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",

    "abstract": "Experience-dependent modulation of neuronal responses is a key attribute in sensory processing. In the mammalian retina, the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell (On-Off DSGC) is well known for its robust direction selectivity. However, how the On-Off DSGC light responsiveness dynamically adjusts to the changing visual environment is underexplored. Here, we report that the On-Off DSGC can be transiently sensitized by prior stimuli. Notably, distinct sensitization patterns are found in dorsal and ventral DSGCs that receive visual inputs from lower and upper visual fields respectively. Although responses of both dorsal and ventral DSGCs to dark stimuli (Off responses) are sensitized, only dorsal cells show sensitization of responses to bright stimuli (On responses). Visual stimulation to the dorsal retina potentiates a sustained excitatory input from Off bipolar cells, leading to tonic depolarization of dorsal DSGCs. Such tonic depolarization propagates from the Off to the On dendritic arbor of the DSGC to sensitize its On response. We also identified a previously overlooked feature of DSGC dendritic architecture that can support direct electrotonic propagation between On and Off dendritic layers. By contrast, ventral DSGCs lack a sensitized tonic depolarization and thus do not exhibit sensitization of their On responses. Our results highlight a topographic difference in Off bipolar cell inputs underlying divergent sensitization patterns of dorsal and ventral On-Off DSGCs. Moreover, substantial crossovers between dendritic layers of On-Off DSGCs suggest an interactive dendritic algorithm for processing On and Off signals before they reach the soma.",

    "abstract": "Animals make adaptive food choices to acquire nutrients that are essential for survival. In reinforcement learning (RL), animals choose by assigning values to options and update these values with new experiences. This framework has been instrumental for identifying fundamental learning and decision variables, and their neural substrates. However, canonical RL models do not explain how learning depends on biologically critical intrinsic reward components, such as nutrients, and related homeostatic regulation. Here, we investigated this question in monkeys making choices for nutrient-defined food rewards under varying reward probabilities. We found that the nutrient composition of rewards strongly influenced monkeys choices and learning. The animals preferred rewards high in nutrient content and showed individual preferences for specific nutrients (sugar, fat). These nutrient preferences affected how the animals adapted to changing reward probabilities: the monkeys learned faster from preferred nutrient rewards and chose them frequently even when they were associated with lower reward probability. Although more recently experienced rewards generally had a stronger influence on monkeys choices, the impact of reward history depended on the rewards specific nutrient composition. A nutrient-sensitive RL model captured these processes. It updated the value of individual sugar and fat components of expected rewards from experience and integrated them into scalar values that explained the monkeys choices. Our findings indicate that nutrients constitute important reward components that influence subjective valuation, learning and choice. Incorporating nutrient-value functions into RL models may enhance their biological validity and help reveal unrecognized nutrient-specific learning and decision computations.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative descriptions of animal behavior are essential to understand the underlying neural substrates. Many behavioral analyses are performed by hand or with expensive and inflexible commercial software that often fail on animals with attached head implants, such as those used for in vivo optogenetics and calcium imaging. With the development of machine learning algorithms that can estimate animal positions across time and space, it is becoming easier for users with no prior coding experience to perform automated animal tracking in behavioral video recordings. Yet classifying discrete behaviors based on positional tracking data remains a significant challenge. To achieve this, we must start with reliable ground truth definitions of behavior, a process that is hindered by unreliable human annotations. To overcome these barriers, we developed BehaviorDEPOT (DEcoding behavior based on POsitional Tracking), a MATLAB-based application comprising six independent modules and a graphical user interface. In the Analysis Module we provide hard-coded classifiers for freezing and rearing. Optionally applied spatiotemporal filters allow users to analyze behaviors in varied experimental designs (e.g. cued tasks or optogenetic manipulations). Even inexperienced users can generate organized behavioral data arrays that can be seamlessly aligned with neurophysiological recordings for detailed analyses of the neural substrates. Four additional modules create an easy-to-use pipeline for establishing reliable ground-truth definitions of behaviors as well as custom behavioral classifiers. Finally, our Experiment Module runs fear conditioning experiments using an Arduino-based design that interfaces with commercialhardware and significantly reduces associated costs. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility of BehaviorDEPOT in widely used behavioral assays including fear conditioning, avoidance, and decision-making tasks. We also demonstrate the robustness of the BehaviorDEPOT freezing classifier across multiple camera types and in mice and rats wearing optogenetic patch cables and head-mounted Miniscopes. BehaviorDEPOT provides a simple, flexible, automated pipeline to move from pose tracking to reliably quantifying a wide variety of task-relevant behaviors.",

The complex relationships between these counteracting processes - community reassembly and spatial self-organization - have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to imposed water stress of increasing degrees. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial re-patterning buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure.",

    "abstract": "Culex pipiens form pipiens and Cx. pipiens form molestus differ in their ability to produce eggs without a bloodmeal. Autogenous mosquitoes, such as the molestus bioform of Cx. pipiens, depend on nutrition acquired as larvae instead of a bloodmeal to fuel the energy intensive process of vitellogenesis, which requires abundant production of yolk proteins. In anautogenous mosquito systems, ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone (OEH) and insulin-like peptides (ILPs) transduce nutritional signals and trigger egg maturation in response to a bloodmeal. It is unclear to what extent the process is conserved in autogenous mosquitoes and how the bloodmeal trigger has been replaced by teneral reserves. Here, we measured the effects of a series of nutritional regimens on autogeny, time to pupation, and survival in Cx. pipiens form molestus and form pipiens. We find that abundant nutrients never result in autogenous form pipiens and extremely poor food availability rarely eliminates autogeny from form molestus. However, the number of autogenous eggs generated increases with nutrient availability. Similarly, using qPCR to quantify gene expression, we find several differences in the expression levels of ilps between bioforms that are reduced and delayed by poor nutrition, but not extinguished. Changes in OEH expression do not explain bioform-specific differences in autogeny. Surprisingly, the source of most of the gene expression differences correlated with autogeny is the abdomen, not the brain. Overall, our results suggest that autogeny is modulated by nutritional availability, but the trait is encoded by genetic differences between forms and these impact the expression of ILPs.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a versatile technique to evaluate the intracellular molecular exchange called turnover. Physicochemical models of FRAP typically consider the molecular diffusion and chemical reaction that simultaneously occur on a time scale of seconds to minutes. Particularly for long-term measurements, however, an advection effect can no longer be ignored, which transports the proteins in specific directions within the cells and accordingly shifts the spatial distribution of the local chemical equilibrium. Nevertheless, existing FRAP models have not considered the spatial shift, and as such, the turnover rate is often analyzed without considering the spatiotemporally updated chemical equilibrium. Here we develop a new FRAP model aimed at long-term measurements to quantitatively determine the two distinct effects of the advection and chemical reaction, i.e., the different major sources of the change in fluorescence intensity. To validate this approach, we carried out FRAP experiments on actin in stress fibers over a time period of more than 900 s, and the advection rate was shown to be comparable in magnitude to the chemical dissociation rate. We further found that the actin-myosin interaction and actin polymerization differently affect the advection and chemical dissociation. Our results thus suggest that the distinction between the two effects is indispensable to extract the intrinsic chemical properties of the actin cytoskeleton from the observations of complicated turnover in cells.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to psychosocial stress disrupts reproductive function and interferes with pulsatile luteinising hormone (LH) secretion in mammals. The posterodorsal sub-nucleus of the medial amygdala (MePD) is part of the limbic brain and is an upstream modulator of the reproductive axis as well as stress and anxiety states. Corticotropin releasing factor type-2 receptors (CRFR2) are activated in the presence of psychosocial stress together with an increased expression of the CRFR2 ligand Urocortin3 (Ucn3) in MePD of rodents. We investigate whether Ucn3 signalling in the MePD is involved in mediating the suppressive effect of psychosocial stress exposure on LH pulsatility. Firstly, we administered Ucn3 into the MePD and monitored the effect on pulsatile LH secretion in ovariectomised mice. Next, we delivered Astressin2B, a highly selective CRFR2 antagonist, intra-MePD in the presence of predator odor, 2,4,5-Trimethylthiazole (TMT) and examined the effect on LH pulses. Subsequently, we virally infected ovariectomised Ucn3-cre-tdTomato mice with inhibitory DREADDs targeting the MePD Ucn3 neurons while exposing the mice to TMT or restraint stress and examined the effect on LH pulsatility as well as corticosterone (CORT) release. Administration of Ucn3 into the MePD dose-dependently inhibited pulsatile LH secretion and intra-MePD administration of Astressin2B blocked the suppressive effect TMT on LH pulsatility. Additionally, DREADDs inhibition of MePD Ucn3 neurons blocked TMT and restraint stress-induced inhibition of LH pulses as well as CORT release in the presence of TMT. These results demonstrate for the first time that Ucn3 neurons in the MePD mediate psychosocial stress-induced suppression of the GnRH pulse generator and psychosocial stress-induced CORT secretion. Ucn3 signalling in the MePD plays a fundamental role in modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ganadal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes, and this brain locus may represent a nodal centre in the crosstalk between the reproductive and stress axes.",

Whether these experience-dependent changes involve plasticity in visual cortex remains unclear.

Using a conditional knockout of NMDA receptors and a photoactivatable inhibitor of CaMKII, we locally perturbed plasticity in V1 during first visual experience, recorded neuronal activity in V1, and tested the mice in a visuomotor task. We found that perturbing plasticity before, but not after, first visuomotor experience reduces responses to unpredictable stimuli, diminishes the suppression of predictable feedback in V1, and impairs visuomotor skill learning later in life. Our results demonstrate that plasticity in the local V1 circuit during early life is critical for shaping visuomotor integration.\n\n*** Dear reader, please note this manuscript is formatted in a standard submission format, and all statistical information is provided in Table S1. ***\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a9283org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d903beorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84b2f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@37d9b8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_FLOATNOTable S1.C_FLOATNO O_TABLECAPTIONStatistics All values are rounded to two significant decimals, except values smaller than 10-5.

LD buildup in islets was principally observed after roughly 11 years of age, increasing throughout adulthood under physiologic conditions, and also enriched in type 2 diabetes. To obtain insight into the role of LDs in human islet {beta} cell function, the levels of a key LD structural protein, perilipin2 (PLIN2), were manipulated by lentiviral-mediated knock-down (KD) or over-expression (OE) in EndoC{beta}H2-Cre cells, a human cell line with adult islet {beta}-like properties. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was blunted in PLIN2KD cells and improved in PLIN2OE cells. An unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed that limiting LD formation induced effectors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that compromised the expression of critical {beta} cell function and identity genes. These changes were aggravated by exogenous treatment with FFAs toxic to islet {beta} cells, and essentially reversed by PLIN2OE or using the ER stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid. These results strongly suggest that LDs are essential for adult human islet {beta} cell activity by preserving FFA homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The protein MakA was discovered as a motility-associated secreted toxin from Vibrio cholerae, Here, we show that MakA is part of a gene cluster encoding four additional proteins: MakB, MakC, MakD and MakE. The MakA, MakB and MakE proteins were readily detected in culture supernatants of wild type V. cholerae whereas secretion was very much reduced from a flagellum deficient mutant. Crystal structures of MakA, MakB and MakE revealed structural relationship to a superfamily of bacterial pore-forming proteins. Cloning and expression of MakA/B/E in Escherichia coli resulted in toxicity of the bacteria towards Caenorhabditis elegans used as a predatory organism model. None of these Mak proteins alone or in pairwise combinations were cytolytic but an equimolar mixture of MakA, MakB and MakE acted as a tripartite cytolytic toxin in vitro causing lysis of erythrocytes and cytotoxicity on cultured human colon carcinoma cells. Formation of oligomeric complexes on liposomes was observed by electron microscopy. Oligomer interaction with membranes was initiated by MakA membrane binding followed by MakB and MakE joining in formation of a pore structure. A predicted membrane insertion domain of MakA was shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be essential for toxicity towards C. elegans. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the makCDBAE gene cluster is present as a novel genomic island in the vast majority of sequenced genomes of V. cholerae and the fish pathogen V. anguillarum. We suggest that the hitherto unrecognized cytolytic MakA/B/E toxin can contribute to Vibrionaceae fitness and virulence potential in different host environments and organisms.\n\nSignificance StatementVibrio cholerae, responsible for outbreaks and pandemics of cholera disease, is a highly motile organism by virtue of a single flagellum. We describe that the flagellum facilitates the secretion of three V. cholerae proteins encoded by a hitherto unrecognized novel genomic island. The proteins MakA/B/E can form a tripartite cytolytic toxin that lyses erythrocytes and is cytotoxic to cultured human cells. A structural basis for the Mak protein cytolytic activity was obtained by X-ray crystallography. Flagellum-facilitated secretion, remarkably ensuring spatially co-ordinated delivery of Mak proteins, revealed a new role for the V. cholerae flagellum considered of particular significance for the bacterial environmental persistence. Our findings will pave the way for the development of new diagnostics and therapeutic strategies against pathogenic Vibrionaceae.",

However, CatSpers complex subunit composition has impeded its reconstitution in vitro and structural elucidation. Here, we applied cryo-electron tomography to visualize the macromolecular organization of the native CatSper channel complex in intact mammalian sperm, as well as identified three additional CatSper-associated proteins. The repeating CatSper units form long zigzag-rows in four nanodomains along the flagella. In both mouse and human sperm, each CatSper repeat consists of a tetrameric pore complex. Murine CatSper contains an additional outwardly directed wing-structure connected to the tetrameric channel. The majority of the extracellular domains form a canopy above each pore-forming channel that interconnects to a zigzag-shaped roof. The intracellular domains link two neighboring channel complexes to a diagonal array. The loss of this intracellular link in Efcab9-/- sperm distorts the longitudinally aligned zigzag pattern and compromises flagellar movement. This work offers unique insights into the mechanisms underlying the assembly and transport of the CatSper complex to generate the nanodomains and provides a long-sought structural basis for understanding CatSper function in the regulation of sperm motility.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and portends poorer prognosis and higher mortality. To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) damages the heart, it is critical to elucidate the biology of CoV-2 encoded proteins, each of which may play multiple pathological roles. For example, CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (CoV-2-S) not only engages ACE2 to mediate virus infection, but also directly impairs endothelial function and can trigger innate immune responses in cultured murine macrophages. Here we tested the hypothesis that CoV-2-S damages the heart by activating cardiomyocyte (CM) innate immune responses. HCoV-NL63 is another human coronavirus with a Spike protein (NL63-S) that also engages ACE2 for virus entry but is known to only cause moderate respiratory symptoms. We found that CoV-2-S and not NL63-S interacted with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a crucial pattern recognition receptor that responsible for detecting pathogen and initiating innate immune responses. Our data show that the S1 subunit of CoV-2-S (CoV-2-S1) interacts with the extracellular leucine rich repeats-containing domain of TLR4 and activates NF-kB. To investigate the possible pathological role of CoV-2-S1 in the heart, we generated a construct that expresses membrane-localized CoV-2-S1 (S1-TM). AAV9-mediated, selective expression of the S1-TM in CMs caused heart dysfunction, induced hypertrophic remodeling, and elicited cardiac inflammation. Since CoV-2-S does not interact with murine ACE2, our study presents a novel ACE2-independent pathological role of CoV-2-S, and suggests that the circulating CoV-2-S1 is a TLR4-recognizable alarmin that may harm the CMs by triggering their innate immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Root parasitic weeds of the Orobanchaceae, such as witchweeds (Striga spp.) and broomrapes (Orobanche and Phelipanche spp.), cause serious losses in agriculture worldwide. No practical method to control these parasitic weeds has been developed to date. Understanding the characteristic physiological processes in the life cycles of root parasitic weeds is particularly important to identify specific targets for growth modulators. In our previous study, planteose metabolism was revealed to be activated soon after the perception of strigolactones in germinating seeds of O. minor. Nojirimycin inhibited planteose metabolism and impeded seed germination of O. minor, indicating that planteose metabolism is a possible target for root parasitic weed control. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of planteose in dry seeds of O. minor by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging. Planteose was detected in tissues surrounding--but not within--the embryo, supporting its suggested role as a storage carbohydrate. Biochemical assays and molecular characterization of an -galactosidase family member, OmAGAL2, indicated the enzyme is involved in planteose hydrolysis in the apoplast around the embryo after the perception of strigolactones to provide the embryo with essential hexoses for germination. These results indicated that OmAGAL2 is a potential molecular target for root parasitic weed control.\n\nHighlightPlanteose accumulated in tissues surrounding the embryo in Orobanche minor dry seeds and was indicated to be hydrolyzed in the apoplast around the embryo by -galactosidase during germination.",

    "abstract": "Implicit motor recalibration allows us to flexibly move in novel and changing environments. Conventionally, implicit recalibration is thought to be driven by errors in predicting the sensory outcome of movement (i.e., sensory prediction errors). However, recent studies have shown that implicit recalibration is also influenced by errors in achieving the movement goal (i.e., task errors). Exactly how sensory prediction errors and task errors interact to drive implicit recalibration and, in particular, whether task errors alone might be sufficient to drive implicit recalibration remain unknown. To test this, we induced task errors in the absence of sensory prediction errors by displacing the target mid-movement. We found that task errors alone failed to induce implicit recalibration. In additional experiments, we simultaneously varied the size of sensory prediction errors and task errors. We found that implicit recalibration driven by sensory prediction errors could be continuously modulated by task errors, revealing an unappreciated dependency between these two sources of error. Moreover, implicit recalibration was attenuated when the target was simply flickered in its original location, even though this manipulation did not affect task error - an effect likely attributed to attention being directed away from the feedback cursor. Taken as a whole, the results were accounted for by a computational model in which sensory prediction errors and task errors, modulated by attention, interact to determine the extent of implicit recalibration.\n\nAuthors summaryWhat information does the brain use to maintain precise calibration of the sensorimotor system? Using a reaching task paired with computational modeling, we find that movements are implicitly recalibrated by errors in predicting both the sensory outcome of movement (i.e., sensory prediction errors) as well as errors in achieving the movement goal (i.e., task errors). Even though task errors alone do not elicit implicit recalibration, they nonetheless modulate implicit recalibration when sensory prediction error is present. The results elucidate an unappreciated interaction between these two sources of error in driving implicit recalibration.",

To understand how the brain plans movements in the presence of unstable cues, we recorded gaze-related activity in the frontal cortex of two monkeys engaged in a quasi-predictable cue-conflict task. Animals were trained to look toward remembered visual targets in the presence of a landmark that shifted with fixed amplitude but randomized direction. As simulated by a probabilistic model based on known physiology/behavior, gaze end points assumed a circular distribution around the target, mirroring the possible directions of the landmark shift. This predictive strategy was reflected in frontal cortex activity (especially supplementary eye fields), which anticipated future gaze distributions before the actual landmark shift. In general, these results implicate prefrontal cortex in the predictive integration of environmental cues and their learned statistical properties to mitigate spatial uncertainty.",

However, a complete understanding of the factors that coordinate early reprogramming events in vivo remain to be determined. In this study, we examined the initial reprogramming by IRF4 in activated B cells using an adoptive transfer system and mice with a B cell-specific deletion of IRF4. IRF4-deficient B cells responding to influenza, NP-Ficoll and LPS divided, but stalled during the proliferative response. Gene expression profiling of IRF4-deficient B cells at discrete divisions revealed IRF4 was critical for inducing MYC target genes, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. Moreover, IRF4-deficient B cells maintained an inflammatory gene expression signature. Complementary chromatin accessibility analyses established a hierarchy of IRF4 activity and identified networks of dysregulated transcription factor families in IRF4-deficient B cells, including E-box binding bHLH family members. Indeed, B cells lacking IRF4 failed to fully induce Myc after stimulation and displayed aberrant cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, IRF4-deficient B cells showed reduced mTORC1 activity and failed to initiate the B cell-activation unfolded protein response and grow in cell size. Myc overexpression in IRF4-deficient was sufficient to overcome the cell growth defect. Together, these data reveal an IRF4-MYC-mTORC1 relationship critical for controlling cell growth and the proliferative response during B cell differentiation.",

In this study, we compared the microbiomes and immune repertoire of two sponge species, the demosponge, Neopetrosia compacta and the calcareous sponge, Leucetta chagosensis, under varying levels of acidification and warming stress. Neopetrosia compacta harbors a diverse bacterial assemblage and possesses a rich repertoire of scavenger receptors while L. chagosensis has a less diverse microbiome and an expanded range of pattern recognition receptors and proteins with immunological domains. Upon exposure to warming and acidification, the microbiome and host transcriptome of N. compacta remained stable, which correlated with high survival. In contrast, the bacterial community of L. chagosensis exhibited drastic restructuring and widespread downregulation of host immune-related pathways, which accompanied tissue necrosis and mortality.

Surprisingly, Pol II, TFIIF, and TFIIE can pre-assemble on enhancer-bound activators before loading into PICs, and multiple Pol II complexes can bind simultaneously to create a localized cluster. Unlike TFIIF and TFIIE, TFIIH binding is singular and dependent on the basal promoter. Activator-tethered factors exhibit dwell times on the order of seconds.

FERRY displays preferential binding to certain groups of transcripts, including mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins. Deletion of FERRY subunits reduces the endosomal localization of transcripts in cells and has a significant impact on mRNA and protein levels. Clinical studies show that genetic disruption of FERRY causes severe brain damage. We found that, in neurons, FERRY co-localizes with mRNA on early endosomes and mRNA loaded FERRY-positive endosomes are in close proximity of mitochondria.

Typically, these microscopic floral and fauna are sampled by collecting substrates from nature and then separating organisms from substrates in the laboratory. In many cases, diverse organisms can be identified to the species-level using molecular barcodes. To facilitate large-scale ecological sampling of microscopic organisms, we used a geographic data-collection platform for mobile devices called Fulcrum that streamlines the organization of geospatial sampling data, substrate photographs, and environmental data at natural sampling sites. These sampling data are then linked to organism isolation data from the laboratory. Here, we describe the easyFulcrum R package, which can be used to clean, process, and visualize ecological field sampling and isolation data exported from the Fulcrum mobile application. We developed this package for wild nematode sampling, but it is extensible to other organisms. The advantages of using Fulcrum combined with easyFulcrum are (1) the elimination of transcription errors by replacing manual data entry and/or spreadsheets with a mobile application, (2) the ability to clean, process, and visualize sampling data using a standardized set of functions in the R software environment, and (3) the ability to join disparate data to each other, including environmental data from the field and the molecularly defined identities of individual specimens isolated from samples.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide that can facilitate prosocial behavior and decrease social stress and anxiety. We investigated whether acute pulses of intranasal (IN) OXT influenced social behavior during social challenges that are likely to occur throughout the lifespan of a wild mouse. To test this, we examined the acute effects of IN OXT in the male California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), a monogamous, biparental, and territorial rodent, using a within-subjects longitudinal design. Social challenges included a pre-courtship male-female encounter conducted during the initial aggressive and not the following affiliative phase of courtship, same-sex resident intruder test, and parental care test, with each test and dose separated by at least two weeks. Males were treated with intranasal infusions of 0.8 IU/kg OXT or saline controls 5-min before each behavioral test, receiving a total of three treatments of either IN OXT or saline control. We predicted that IN OXT would 1) decrease aggression and increase affiliation during the pre-courtship aggression phase, 2) increase aggression during resident intruder paradigms and 3) increase paternal care and vocalizations during a paternal care test. As predicted, during pre-courtship aggression with a novel female, IN OXT males displayed less contact aggression than control males, although with no change in affiliative behavior. However, post-pairing, during the resident intruder test, IN OXT males did not differ from control males in contact aggression. During the paternal care test, IN OXT males were quicker to approach their pups than control males but did not differ in vocalizations produced, unlike our previous research demonstrating an effect on vocalizations in females. In summary, during pre-courtship aggression and the paternal care test, IN OXT promoted prosocial approach; however, during the resident intruder test IN OXT did not alter social approach. These data suggest that IN OXT promotes prosocial approach specifically in social contexts that can lead to affiliation.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIN OXT attenuates male aggression during pre-courtship encounters\nC_LIO_LIIN OXT does not attenuate male aggression during resident intruder encounters\nC_LIO_LIIN OXT increases paternal responsiveness during a paternal care challenge\nC_LIO_LIIN OXT in fathers does not influence total paternal care or vocalizations\nC_LI\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=52 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/449160v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@63bf1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@97d8e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12147d8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f3f71c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "There is a growing appreciation of the importance of drug-target binding kinetics for lead optimization. For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which mediate signaling over a wide range of timescales, the drug dissociation rate is often a better predictor of in vivo efficacy than binding affinity, although it is more challenging to compute. Here, we assess the ability of the {tau}-Random Acceleration Molecular Dynamics ({tau}RAMD) approach to reproduce relative residence times and reveal dissociation mechanisms and the effects of allosteric modulation for two important membrane-embedded drug targets: the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2. The dissociation mechanisms observed in the relatively short RAMD simulations (in which molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using an additional force with an adaptively assigned random orientation applied to the ligand) are in general agreement with much more computationally intensive conventional MD and metadynamics simulations. Remarkably, although decreasing the magnitude of the random force generally reduces the number of egress routes observed, the ranking of ligands by dissociation rate is hardly affected and agrees well with experiment. The simulations also reproduce changes in residence time due to allosteric modulation and reveal associated changes in ligand dissociation pathways.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS GRAPHIC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/449151v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@743dcdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1857381org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@62359aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad38a3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Membrane fusion is a critical step for many essential processes, from neurotransmission to fertilization. For over 40 years protein-free fusion driven by calcium or other cationic species has provided a simplified model of biological fusion, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Cation-mediated membrane fusion and permeation are essential in their own right to drug delivery strategies based on cell-penetrating peptides or cation-bearing lipid nanoparticles. Experimental studies suggest calcium drives anionic membranes to a hemifused intermediate which constitutes a hub in a network of pathways, but the pathway selection mechanism is unknown. Here we develop a mathematical model that identifies the network hub as a highly dynamical hemifusion complex. Multivalent cations drive expansion of this high tension hemifusion interface between interacting vesicles during a brief transient. The fate of this interface determines the outcome, either fusion, dead-end hemifusion or vesicle lysis. The model reproduces the unexplained finding that calcium-driven fusion of vesicles with planar membranes typically stalls at hemifusion, and we show the equilibrated hemifused state is a novel lens-shaped complex. Thus, membrane fusion kinetics follow a stochastic trajectory within a network of pathways, with outcome weightings set by a hemifused complex intermediate.\n\nSignificanceCells use multicomponent machineries to fuse membranes for neurotransmitter and hormone release and other fundamental processes. Protein-free fusion using calcium or other multivalent cationic fusogens has long been studied as a simplifying model. Cation-mediated membrane fusion or permeation are key events for a number of current drug delivery strategies. However, the mechanisms determining outcomes are unknown. Here we develop a mathematical model that identifies a dynamic hemifusion complex as the decision hub that stochastically sets the outcome in a network of pathways. Cations transiently grow a high tension hemifusion interface between membrane-enclosed compartments, whose fate governs whether fusion, dead-end hemifusion or vesicle lysis occurs. The model provides a systematic framework to predict outcomes of cationic fusogen-mediated interactions between membrane-enclosed compartments.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional MRI has yielded seemingly disparate insights into large-scale organization of the human brain. The brains large-scale organization can be divided into two broad categories - zero-lag representations of functional connectivity structure and time-lag representations of traveling wave or propagation structure. Here we sought to unify observed phenomena across these two categories in the form of three low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns composed of a mixture of standing and traveling wave dynamics. We showed that a range of empirical phenomena, including functional connectivity gradients, the task-positive/task-negative anti-correlation pattern, the global signal, time-lag propagation patterns, the quasiperiodic pattern, and the functional connectome network structure are manifestations of these three spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns account for much of the global spatial structure that underlies functional connectivity analyses, and unifies phenomena in resting-state functional MRI previously thought distinct.",
