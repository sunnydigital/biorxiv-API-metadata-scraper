    "abstract": "A novel, rapid and specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction has been developed for the diagnosis of hemo-parasitic infection in bovine blood by three of the most common hemo-parasites. The reported method relied on the detection of the three different bovine hemoparasites isolated from red blood cells (RBCs) of cattle by conventional Giemsa stained blood smear (GSBS) and confirmed by multiplex PCR. The designed multiplex primer sets can amplify 205, 313 and 422 bp fragments of apocytochrome b, sporozoite and macroschizont 2 (spm2) and 16S rRNA gene for Babesia bigemina, Theileria annulata and Anaplasma marginale, respectively. This multiplex PCR was sensitive with the ability to detect the presence of 150 ng of genomic DNA. The primers used in this multiplex PCR also showed highly specific amplification of specific gene fragments of each respective parasite DNA without the presence of non-specific and non-target PCR products. This multiplex PCR system was used to diagnose GSBS confirmed blood samples (N=12) found infected or co-infected with hemoparasites. A comparison of the two detection methods revealed that 58.33% of specimens showed concordant diagnoses with both techniques. The specificity, positive predictive value and kappa coefficient of agreement was highest for diagnosis of B. bigemina and lowest for A. marginale. The overall Kappa coefficient for diagnosis based on GSBS for multiple pathogen compared to multiplex PCR was 0.56 slightly behind the threshold of 0.6 of agreement. Therefore, confirmation should always be made based on PCR to rule out false positive due to differences in subjective observations, stain particles and false negative due to low level of parasitaemia. The simplicity and rapidity of this specific multiplex PCR method make it suitable for large-scale epidemiological studies and for follow-up of drug treatments.",

    "abstract": "Reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton at mitotic entry is essential to increase membrane tension for cell rounding1,2. This spherical shape is necessary for the biogenesis and organization of the mitotic spindle2-6. Proteins of the Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin (ERM) family play essential roles in mitotic morphogenesis by linking actomyosin forces to the plasma membrane2,3,7-10. While ERMs drive metaphase cell rounding, the cell-cycle signals that prompt their conformational activation in mitosis are unknown11. We screened a library of small molecules using novel ERM biosensors12 and we unexpectedly found that drugs that disassemble microtubules promote ERM activation. Remarkably, cells disassemble their interphase microtubules while entering mitosis13. We further discovered that this disassembly of microtubules acts as a cell-cycle signal that directs ERM activation and metaphase cell rounding. We show that GEF-H1, a Rho-GEF inhibited by microtubule binding, acts downstream of microtubule disassembly to activate ERMs via RhoA and its kinase effector SLK. In addition, we demonstrate that GEF-H1 and Ect2, another Rho-GEF responsible for the generation of mitotic actomyosin forces6,14, act together to drive metaphase ERM activation and cell rounding. In summary, we report microtubule disassembly as a cell cycle signal that triggers a signaling network ensuring that actomyosin forces are efficiently integrated at the plasma membrane to promote cell rounding at mitotic entry.",

    "abstract": "The karyotype, or number and arrangement of chromosomes, has varying levels of stability across both evolution and disease. Karyotype changes often originate from DNA breaks near the centromeres of chromosomes, which generally contain long arrays of tandem repeats or satellite DNA. Drosophila virilis possesses among the highest relative satellite abundances of studied species, with almost half its genome composed of three related 7bp satellites. We discovered a strain of D. virilis that we infer recently underwent three independent chromosome fusion events involving the X and Y chromosomes, in addition to one subsequent fission event. Here we isolate, characterize and propose a timeline for the chromosome fusions in this strain which we believe demonstrates a remarkable karyotype instability. We discovered that one of the substrains with an X-autosome fusion has a X-to-Y chromosome nondisjunction rate 20x higher than the D. virilis reference strain (21% vs. 1%). Finally, we found an overall higher rate of DNA breakage in the substrain with higher satellite DNA compared to a genetically similar substrain with less satellite DNA. This suggests satellite DNA abundance may play a role in the risk of genome instability. Overall, we introduce a novel system consisting of a single strain with four different karyotypes, which we believe will be useful for future studies of genome instability, centromere function, and sex chromosome evolution.",

As clinical sequencing becomes more prevalent in cancer management, the need for cancer variant interpretation has grown beyond the capability of any single institution. With nearly 300 contributors, CIViC contains peer-reviewed, published literature curated and expert-moderated into structured data units (Evidence Items) that can be accessed globally and in real time, reducing barriers to clinical variant knowledge sharing. We have extended CIViCs functionality to support emergent variant interpretation guidelines, increase interoperability with other variant resources, and promote widespread dissemination of structured curated data. To support the full breadth of variant interpretation from basic to translational, including integration of somatic and germline variant knowledge and inference of drug response, we have enabled curation of three new evidence types (predisposing, oncogenic and functional).

In the DNA damage field, CRISPR has brought an alternative to induce endogenous double-strand breaks (DSB) at desired genomic locations and study the DNA damage response and its consequences. Many systems for sgRNA delivery have been reported in order to efficiency generate this DSB, including lentiviral vectors. However, some of the consequences of these systems are yet not well understood. Here we report that lentiviral-based sgRNA vectors can integrate into the endogenous genomic target location, leading to undesired activation of the target gene. By generating a DSB in the regulatory region of the ABCB1 gene using a lentiviral sgRNA vector, we can induce the formation of taxol-resistant colonies. We show that these colonies upregulated ABCB1 via integration of the EEF1A1 and the U6 promoters from the sgRNA vector. We believe that this is an unreported CRISPR/Cas9 artefact that researchers need to be aware of when using lentiviral vectors for genome editing.",

    "abstract": "The yield of many crop plants can be substantially reduced by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. The infection strategy of many Xanthomonas strains is based on transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), which are secreted into the host cells and act as transcriptional activators of plant genes that are beneficial for the bacteria.\n\nThe modular DNA binding domain of TALEs contains tandem repeats, each comprising two hyper-variable amino acids. These repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs) bind to a continuous DNA stretch (a target box) and determine the specificity of a TALE. All available tools for the prediction of TALE targets within the host plant suffer from many false positives. In this paper we propose a strategy to improve prediction accuracy by considering the epigenetic state of the host plant genome in the region of the target box. To this end, we extend our previously published tool PrediTALE by two epigenetic features: (i) We allow for filtering target boxes according to chromatin accessibility and (ii) we allow for considering the methylation state of cytosines within the target box during prediction, since DNA methylation may affect the binding specificity of RVDs. Here, we determine the epigenetic features from publicly available DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and WGBS-seq data in rice.\n\nWe benchmark the utility of both epigenetic features separately and in combination, deriving ground-truth from RNA-seq infections studies in rice. We find an improvement for each individual epigenetic feature, but especially the combination of both. Having established an advantage in TALE target predicting considering epigenetic features, we use these data for promoterome and genome-wide scans by our new tool EpiTALE, leading to several novel putative virulence targets.\n\nOur results suggest that it would be worthwhile to collect condition-specific chromatin accessibility data and methylation information when studying putative virulence targets of Xan-thomonas TALEs.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells often experience high basal levels of DNA replication stress (RS), for example due to hyperactivation of oncoproteins like MYC or RAS. Therefore, cancer cells are considered to be sensitive to drugs that exacerbate the level of RS or block the intra S-phase checkpoint. Consequently, RS-inducing drugs including ATR and CHK1 inhibitors are used or evaluated as anti-cancer therapies. However, drug resistance and lack of biomarkers predicting therapeutic efficacy limit efficient use. This raises the question what determines sensitivity of individual cancer cells to RS. Here, we report that oncogenic RAS does not only enhance the sensitivity to ATR/CHK1 inhibitors by directly causing RS. Instead, we observed that HRASG12V dampens the activation of the P53-dependent transcriptional response to drug-induced RS, which in turn confers sensitivity to RS. We demonstrate that inducible expression of HRASG12V sensitized retina pigment epithelial (RPE-hTERT) as well as osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells to ATR and CHK1 inhibitors. Using RNA-sequencing of FACS-sorted cells we discovered that P53 signaling is the sole transcriptional response to RS. However, oncogenic RAS attenuates the transcription of P53 and its target genes. Accordingly, live cell imaging showed that HRASG12V exacerbates RS in S/G2-phase, which could be rescued by stabilization of P53. Thus, our results demonstrate that transcriptional control of P53 is a prime determinant in the response to ATR/CHK1 inhibitors and show that hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway impedes this response. Our findings suggest that the level of oncogenic MAPK signaling could predict sensitivity to intra-S-phase inhibition in cancers with intact P53.",

    "abstract": "Very high risk neuroblastoma is characterised by increased MAPK signalling, and targeting MAPK signalling is a promising therapeutic strategy. We used a deeply characterised panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and found that the sensitivity to MEK inhibitors varied drastically between these cell lines. By generating quantitative perturbation data and mathematical modelling, we determined potential resistance mechanisms. We found that negative feedbacks within MAPK signalling and to the IGF receptor mediate re-activation of MAPK signalling upon treatment in resistant cell lines. By using cell-line specific models, we predict that combinations of MEK inhibitors with RAF or IGFR inhibitors can overcome resistance, and tested these predictions experimentally. In addition, phospo-proteomics profiles confirm the cell-specific feedback effects and synergy of MEK and IGFR targeted treatements. Our study shows that a quantitative understanding of signalling and feedback mechanisms facilitated by models can help to develop and optimise therapeutic strategies, and our findings should be considered for the planning of future clinical trials introducing MEKi in the treatment of neuroblastoma.",

    "abstract": "The Nash equilibrium concept has previously been shown to be an important tool to understand human sensorimotor interactions, where different actors vie for minimizing their respective effort while engaging in a multi-agent motor task. However, it is not clear how such equilibria are reached. Here, we compare different reinforcement learning models based on haptic feedback to human behavior in sensorimotor versions of three classic games, including the Prisoners Dilemma, and the symmetric and asymmetric matching pennies games. We find that a discrete analysis that reduces the continuous sensorimotor interaction to binary choices as in classical matrix games does not allow to distinguish between the different learning algorithms, but that a more detailed continuous analysis with continuous formulations of the learning algorithms and the game-theoretic solutions affords different predictions. In particular, we find that Q-learning with intrinsic costs that disfavor deviations from average behavior explains the observed data best, even though all learning algorithms equally converge to admissible Nash equilibrium solutions. We therefore conclude that it is important to study different learning algorithms for understanding sensorimotor interactions, as such behavior cannot be inferred from a game-theoretic analysis alone, that simply focuses on the Nash equilibrium concept, as different learning algorithms impose preferences on the set of possible equilibrium solutions due to the inherent learning dynamics.",

We developed and validated the first EEG-based method to investigate visual deviance detection in freely behaving mice. Mice with EEG implants were exposed to a visual deviant detection paradigm that involved changes in light intensity as standard and deviant stimuli. By subtracting the standard from the deviant evoked waveform, deviant detection was evident as bi-phasic negativity (starting around 70 ms) in the difference waveform. Additionally, deviance-associated evoked (beta/gamma) and induced (gamma) oscillatory responses were found. We showed that the results were stimulus-independent by applying a \"flip-flop\" design and the results showed good repeatability in an independent measurement. Together, we put forward a validated, easy-to-use paradigm to measure visual deviance processing in freely behaving mice.",

The introduction of long-read sequencing technologies permits to unambiguously bridge those contiguous sequences into complete genomes. However, the elevated costs associated with long-read sequencing frequently limit the number of bacterial isolates that can be long-read sequenced.\n\nHere we evaluated the recently released 96 barcoding kit from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to generate complete genomes on a high-throughput basis. In addition, we propose a long-read isolate selection strategy that optimizes a representative selection of isolates from large-scale bacterial collections.\n\nResultsDespite an uneven distribution of long-reads per barcode, near-complete chromosomal sequences (assembly contiguity = 0.89) were generated for 96 Escherichia coli isolates with associated short-read sequencing data. The assembly contiguity of the plasmid replicons was even higher (0.98) which indicated the suitability of the multiplexing strategy for studies focused on resolving plasmid sequences. We benchmarked hybrid and ONT-only assemblies and showed that the combination of ONT sequencing data with short-read sequencing data is still highly desirable: (i) to perform an unbiased selection of isolates for long-read sequencing, (ii) to achieve an optimal genome accuracy and completeness, and (iii) to include small plasmids underrepresented in the ONT library.\n\nConclusionsThe proposed long-read isolate selection ensures completing bacterial genomes of isolates that span the genome diversity inherent in large collections of bacterial isolates. We show the potential of using this multiplexing approach to close bacterial genomes on a high-throughput basis.",

We also conduct numerical simulations to test our predictions and to compare the performance of several widespread statistical methods, including direct tests of pairwise independence, matrix permutation approaches and joint species distribution modelling.\nC_LIO_LI3: We show how classical metacommunity dynamics can produce statistical associations, both positive and negative, even when species do not interact, when there is no habitat heterogeneity, and at equilibrium. This occurs as soon as there is some rate of patch disturbance (i.e. simultaneous extinction of several species in a patch) and/or a finite life-span of patches, a common feature of a broad range of plant, animal or microbial systems.\nC_LIO_LI4: Patch disturbance can compromise species co-occurrence analyses and cause the artefactual detection of species associations if not taken into account. Including patch age (i.e. the time since the last patch disturbance event) as a covariate in a joint species distribution model can resolve the artefact. However, this requires additional data that often are not available in practice. We argue that the consequences of patch disturbance should not be underestimated when analysing species distribution patterns in metacommunity-like systems.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity a major determinant for the capacity of species to persist and adapt to their environments. Unraveling the factors affecting genetic differentiation is crucial to understand how genetic diversity is shaped and species may react to changing environments. We employed genotyping by sequencing to test the influence of climate, space, latitude, altitude and land cover on genetic differentiation in a collection of 81 wild pea samples (Pisum sativum ssp. elatius) from across its distribution range from western Europe to central Asia. We also attempted to elucidate the species recent evolutionary history and its effect on the current distribution of genetic diversity. Association of single SNPs with climate variables were analyses to test for signatures of local adaptation. Genetic variation was geographically structured into six distinct genetic cluster. Two of which were associated with a taxonomic group (Pisum sativum ssp. humile) that according to some researchers does not qualify for a sub-species rank due to its alleged lack of genetic distinctness from other conspecific groups. The effect of the tested factors influencing genetic differentiation were rather variable among genetic clusters. The climate predictors were most important in all clusters. Land use was more important in clusters from areas strongly influenced by human land use, especially by agriculture. We found a statistically significant association of 3,623 SNPs (2.4 % of all SNPs) with one of the environmental predictors. Most of them were correlated with latitude followed by temperature, precipitation and altitude. Estimation of SNP effects of the candidates resulted in a missense to silent ratio of 0.45, suggesting many of the observed candidates SNPs may alter the encoded amino acid sequence. Wild peas went through a genetic bottleneck during the last glacial period followed by population recovery. Probably associated with this population recovery, we detected a range expansion, which may have led to an eastward range expansion of the European cluster to Turkey and thereof southwards and eastwards. Overall, the interplay of several environmental factors and the recent evolutionary history affected the distribution of genetic diversity in wild peas where each subpopulations were differently affected by those factors and processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide and has a poor survival, with a relative five-year survival rate of only 8.5%. In this study we investigated epigenetic marksassociated with PDAC severity and prognosis, through studying alterations in DNA methylation patterns.\n\nMethodsDNA methylome for tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples from PDAC patients (n=7) were generated using Illumina 450K bead chips. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified with |delta beta| > 0.2 and p-value<0.01 by comparing tumors with the adjacent normal tissues. Validation of differential methylation and associated gene expression at selected genes was carried out in an independent cohort PDAC patient.\n\nResultsWe identified 76 DMPs in PDAC patients that mapped to 43 genes. Among them, 44.7% (n=34) were hypo-methylated and 55.3% (n=42) were hyper-methylated DMPs in cancer samples. The trends of change in methylation at these 76 DMPs from well to moderate were like that from moderate to poorly differentiated cancer samples. The gradual trend in differential methylation was observed both in our cohort and the TCGA-PAAD cohort, suggesting methylation marks can serve as early indicators of disease pathology. Altered promoter methylation, which may affect gene expression, was observed for transcription regulators (BHLHE23, GSC2, FOXE1 and TWIST1), gated ion channels (KCNA6, and CACNB2), tumor suppressors (RASSF1, SPRED2, and NPY) and genes functioning in interferon signalling (SIGIRR, MX2, and OAS2). We also have compared the TCGA-PAAD dataset with normal pancreatic tissue data from GTEx V8 dataset leading to a confluent observation.\n\nConclusionsWe reported the first study on methylome in PDAC tumors from patients in India. We identified altered DNA methylation associated with increasing severity in PDAC among some genes like SIGIRR, MX2 along with other previously reported loci. We also concluded a confluence in our observation when comparing the TCGA-PAAD dataset with GTEx V8 dataset.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet both its prevention and early risk stratification are limited. The vaginal microbiome has been associated with PTB risk, possibly via metabolic or other interactions with its host. Here, we performed untargeted metabolomics on 232 vaginal samples, in which we have previously profiled the microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Samples were collected at 20-24 weeks of gestation from women with singleton pregnancies, of which 80 delivered spontaneously before 37 weeks of gestation. We find that the vaginal metabolome correlates with the microbiome and separates into six clusters, three of which are associated with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) in Black women. Furthermore, while we identify five metabolites that associate with sPTB, another five associate with sPTB only when stratifying by race. We identify multiple microbial correlations with metabolites associated with sPTB, including intriguing correlations between vaginal bacteria that are considered sub-optimal and metabolites that were enriched in women who delivered at term. We propose that several sPTB-associated metabolites may be exogenous, and investigate another using metabolic models. Notably, we use machine learning models to predict sPTB risk using metabolite levels, weeks to months in advance, with high accuracy. We show that these predictions are more accurate than microbiome-based and maternal covariates-based models. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential of vaginal metabolites as early biomarkers of sPTB and highlight exogenous exposures as potential risk factors for prematurity.",

To date, four vaccines have already been approved by European and American authorities for preventing COVID-19 but the development of additional vaccine platforms with improved supply and logistics profiles remains a pressing need. Here we report the preclinical evaluation of a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on the electroporation of engineered, synthetic cDNA encoding a viral antigen in the skeletal muscle, a technology previously utilized for cancer vaccines. We constructed a set of prototype DNA vaccines expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and assessed their immunogenicity in animal models. Among them, COVID-eVax - a DNA plasmid encoding a secreted monomeric form of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD - induced the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses (including against the current most common variants of concern) and a robust T cell response. Upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized K18-hACE2 transgenic mice showed reduced weight loss, improved pulmonary function and significantly lower viral replication in the lungs and brain. COVID-eVax conferred significant protection to ferrets upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In summary, this study identifies COVID-eVax as an ideal COVID-19 vaccine candidate suitable for clinical development. Accordingly, a combined phase I-II trial has recently started in Italy.",

    "abstract": "Individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus present with a wide variety of phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to severe and even lethal outcomes. Past research has revealed a genetic haplotype on chromosome 3 that entered the human population via introgression from Neanderthals as the strongest genetic risk factor for the severe COVID-19 phenotype. However, the specific variants along this introgressed haplotype that contribute to this risk and the biological mechanisms that are involved remain unclear. Here, we assess the variants present on the risk haplotype for their likelihood of driving the severe COVID-19 phenotype. We do this by first exploring their impact on the regulation of genes involved in COVID-19 infection using a variety of population genetics and functional genomics tools. We then perform an locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay to individually assess the regulatory potential of each allele on the haplotype in a multipotent immune-related cell line. We ultimately reduce the set of over 600 linked genetic variants to identify 4 introgressed alleles that are strong functional candidates for driving the association between this locus and severe COVID-19. These variants likely drive the locus impact on severity by putatively modulating the regulation of two critical chemokine receptor genes: CCR1 and CCR5. These alleles are ideal targets for future functional investigations into the interaction between host genomics and COVID-19 outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Nsp12, the catalytic subunit of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), contains two active sites that catalyze nucleotidyl-monophosphate (NMP) transfer (NMPylation). RNA synthesis is mediated by the RdRp active site that is conserved among all RNA viruses and has been a focus of mechanistic studies and drug discovery. The second active site resides in a Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain. Both catalytic reactions are essential for viral replication, but the mechanism and targets of NiRAN are poorly characterized. One recent study showed that NiRAN transfers NMP to the first residue of RNA-binding protein Nsp9. Another study reported a structure of SARS-CoV-2 replicase with an extended Nsp9 in the NiRAN active site but observed NMP transfer to RNA instead. We show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 efficiently and reversibly NMPylates the native but not the extended Nsp9. Substitutions of the invariant NiRAN residues abolish NMPylation, whereas a substitution of a catalytic RdRp Asp residue does not. NMPylation is inhibited by nucleotide analogs, pyrophosphate, and bisphosphonates, suggesting a path for rational design of NiRAN inhibitors. We hypothesize that Nsp9 remodels both active sites of Nsp12 to support initiation of RNA synthesis by RdRp and subsequent capping of the product RNA by the NiRAN domain.",

By constrast, SuFu removal has little effect in drosophila.\n\nPrevious publications showed that the crystal structures of human and drosophila SuFu consist of two ordered domains that are capable of breathing motions upon ligand binding. However, the crystal structure of human SuFu does not give information about 20 N-terminal residues (IDR1) and an eighty-residue-long disordered region (IDR2) in the C-terminus, whose function is important for the pathway repression. These two IDRs are species-dependent.\n\nWe studied SuFus structure in solution, both with circular dichroism and small angle X-ray scattering, comparing drosophila, zebrafish and human species, to better understand this considerable difference. Our studies show that, in spite of similar crystal structures restricted to ordered domains, drosophila and vertebrate SuFu have very different structures in solution. The IDR2 of vertebrates spans a large area, thus enabling it to reach for partners and be accessible for post-translational modifications. Furthermore, we show that the IDR2 region is highly conserved within phyla but varies in length and sequence, with insects having a shorter disordered region while that of vertebrates is broad and mobile. This major variation may explain the different phenotypes observed upon SuFu removal.",

Given the current lack of consensus, we aimed to elucidate how to optimally combine multi-echo gradient-recalled echo (GRE) signal phase information, either before or after applying Laplacian-base methods (LBMs) for phase unwrapping or background field removal.\n\nMethodsMulti-echo GRE data were simulated in a numerical head phantom, and multiecho GRE images were acquired at 3 T in ten healthy volunteers. To enable image-based estimation of GRE signal noise, five volunteers were scanned twice in the same session without repositioning. Five QSM processing pipelines were designed: one applied nonlinear phase fitting over echo times (TEs) before LBMs; two applied LBMs to the TE-dependent phase and then combined multiple TEs via either TE-weighted or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-weighted averaging; two calculated TE-dependent susceptibility maps via either multi-step or single-step QSM and then combined multiple TEs via magnitude-weighted averaging. Results from different pipelines were compared using visual inspection; summary statistics of susceptibility in deep gray matter, white matter, and venous regions; phase noise maps (error propagation theory); and, in the healthy volunteers, regional fixed bias analysis (Bland-Altman) and regional differences between the means (nonparametric tests).\n\nResultsNonlinearly fitting the multi-echo phase over TEs before applying LBMs provided the highest regional accuracy of{chi} and the lowest phase noise propagation compared to averaging the LBM-processed TE-dependent phase. This result was especially pertinent in high-susceptibility venous regions.\n\nConclusionFor multi-echo QSM, we recommend combining the signal phase by nonlinear fitting before applying LBMs.",

    "abstract": "Macroautophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system work as an interconnected network in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Indeed, efficient activation of macroautophagy upon nutritional deprivation is sustained by degradation of preexisting proteins by the proteasome. However, the specific substrates that are degraded by the proteasome in order to activate macroautophagy are currently unknown. By quantitative proteomic analysis we identified several proteins downregulated in response to starvation but independently of ATG5 expression. Among them, the most significant was HERPUD1, an ER protein of short-half life and a well-known substrate of the proteasome. We found that increased HERPUD1 stability by deletion of its ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) plays a negative role on basal and induced macroautophagy. Moreover, we found it triggers ER expansion by reordering the ER in crystalloid structures, but in the absence of unfolded protein response activation. Surprisingly, we found ER expansion led to an increase in the number and function of lysosomes establishing a tight network with the presence of membrane-contact sites. Importantly, a phosphomimetic S59D mutation within the UBL mimics UBL deletion on its stability and the ER-lysosomal network expansion revealing an increase of cell survival under stress conditions. Altogether, we propose stabilized HERPUD1 downregulates macroautophagy favoring instead a closed interplay between the ER and lysosomes with consequences in drug-cell stress survival.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/447273v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1136b35org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e39b7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f59211org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@148b2b0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Viruses play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities, yet they remain relatively understudied in their native environments. Despite many advancements in high-throughput whole-genome sequencing (WGS), sequence assembly, and annotation of viruses, the reconstruction of full-length viral genomes directly from metagenomic sequencing is possible only for the most abundant phages and requires long-read sequencing technologies. Additionally, the prediction of their cellular hosts remains difficult from conventional metagenomic sequencing alone. To address these gaps in the field and to accelerate the study of viruses directly in their native microbiomes, we developed an end-to-end bioinformatics platform for viral genome reconstruction and host attribution from metagenomic data using proximity-ligation sequencing (i.e., Hi-C). We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform by recovering and characterizing the metavirome of a variety of metagenomes, including a fecal microbiome that has also been sequenced with accurate long reads, allowing for the assessment and benchmarking of the new methods. The platform can accurately extract numerous near-complete viral genomes even from highly fragmented short-read assemblies and can reliably predict their cellular hosts with minimal false positives. To our knowledge, this is the first software for performing these tasks. Being significantly cheaper than long-read sequencing of comparable depth, the incorporation of proximity-ligation sequencing in microbiome research shows promise to greatly accelerate future advancements in the field.",

    "abstract": "Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are induced in the embryo by signals, including BMP emanating from extra-embryonic ectoderm, that act on cells in the post-implantation epiblast. PGC development can be recapitulated in vitro through the exposure of epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) to appropriate cytokines, resulting in differentiation into PGC-like cells (PGCLCs). Interestingly, the requirement for cytokines to induce PGCLCs can be bypassed by enforced expression of the transcription factor (TF) NANOG. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that Otx2 downregulation is essential to enable NANOG to induce PGCLC formation. Moreover, while previous work has shown that the direct NANOG target gene Esrrb can substitute for several functions of NANOG, enforced expression of ESRRB cannot promote PGCLC specification from EpiLCs. This appears to be due to differential downregulation of Otx2 by NANOG and ESRRB, since induction of ESRRB in Otx2+/- EpiLCs activates expression of the core PGC TFs, Blimp1, Prdm14 and Ap2{gamma} and emergence of PGCLCs. This study illuminates the interplay of TFs occurring at the earliest stages of PGC specification from a state of competence.",

Such constraints can be altered through developmental plasticity. Thus, in theory, plasticity in energetically costly sexually selected morphologies can promote life history flexibility in variable environments. We experimentally tested this hypothesis in bulb mites (Rhizoglyphus robini) that polyphenically develop as armed fighters with enlarged legs or as scramblers without modified legs. We found that (i) mites enter metamorphosis earlier if they develop as scramblers, (ii) mites accelerate the onset of metamorphosis when they sense resource limitation, and (iii) scrambler expression increases under increased competition for food, enabling males to mature early and escape juvenile mortality. We propose that life history plasticity can evolve through polyphenic release from sexually selected constraints, making the evolutionary dynamics of secondary sexual traits and life history traits, typically studied separately, interdependent.",

    "abstract": "Hydrolases are important molecules that are involved in a wide range of biological functions and their activities are tightly regulated in healthy or diseased states. Detecting or imaging the activities of hydrolases, therefore, can reveal underlying molecular mechanisms in the context of cells to organisms, and their correlation with different physiological conditions can therefore be used in diagnosis. Due to the nature of hydrolases, substrate-based probes can be activated in their catalytic cycles, and cleavage of covalent bonds frees reporter moieties. For test-tube type bulk detection, spatial resolution is not a measure of importance, but for cell- or organism-based detection or imaging, spatial resolution is a key factor for probe sensitivity that influences signal-to-background ratio. One strategy to improve spatial resolution of the probes is to form a covalent linkage between the reporter moiety and intracellular proteins upon probe activation by the enzyme. In this work, we developed a generalizable linker chemistry that would allow in situ labeling of various imaging moieties via quinone methide species. To do so, we synthesized probes containing a monofluoromethyl or a difluoromethyl groups for {beta}-galactosidase activation, while using fluorescein as a fluorescent reporter. The labeling efficacy of these two probes was evaluated in vitro. The probe bearing a monofluormethyl group exhibited superior labeling efficiency in imaging {beta}-galactosidase activity in living cells. This study provides a versatile linker for applying quinone methide chemistry in the development of hydrolase-targeting probes involving in situ labeling.",

Phage inhalation may serve this goal; however, it requires a careful assessment of their delivery by this approach. Here we present an in-vitro model to evaluate phage inhalation.\n\nEight phages, most of which target CF-common pathogens, were aerosolized and administered to a real-scale CT{square}derived 3D airways model with a breathing simulator. Viable phage loads reaching the output of the nebulizer and the tracheal level of the model were determined and compared to the loaded amount.\n\nPhage inhalation resulted in a diverse range of titer reduction, primarily associated with the nebulization process.

These findings highlight the need for tailored simulations of phage delivery, ideally by a patient-specific model in addition to proper phage matching, to increase the potential of phage therapy success.\n\nTake-Home MessagePhage therapy can be used against infectious diseases if personally tailored. Using a 3D airways model, we show that phage delivery by inhalation to the respiratory tract is unpredictable and also requires a precise evaluation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesFluorescence microscopy is a valuable tool to study a broad variety of bacterial cell components and dynamics thereof. For Clostridioides difficile, the fluorescent proteins CFPopt, mCherryOpt and phiLOV2.1, and the self-labelling tags SNAPCd and HaloTag, hereafter collectively referred as fluorescent systems, have been described to explore different cellular pathways. In this study, we sought to characterize previously used fluorescent systems in C. difficile cells.\n\nMethodsWe performed single cell analyses using fluorescence microscopy of exponentially growing C. difficile cells harbouring different fluorescent systems, either expressing these separately in the cytosol or fused to the C-terminus of HupA, under defined conditions.\n\nResultsWe show that the intrinsic fluorescence of C. difficile cells increases during growth, independent from sigB or spo0A. However, when C. difficile cells are exposed to environmental oxygen autofluorescence is enhanced.\n\nCytosolic overexpression of the different fluorescent systems alone, using the same expression signals, showed heterogeneous expression of the fluorescent systems. High levels of mCherryOpt were toxic for C. difficile cells limiting the applicability of this fluorophore as a transcriptional reporter. When fused to HupA, C. difficile histone-like protein, the fluorescent systems behaved similarly and did not affect the HupA overproduction phenotype.\n\nConclusionsThe present study compares several commonly used fluorescent systems for application as transcriptional or translational reporters in microscopy and summarizes the limitations and key challenges for live-cell imaging of C. difficile. Due to independence of molecular oxygen and fluorescent signal, SNAPCd appears the most suitable candidate for live-cell imaging in C. difficile to date.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/448366v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a19b90org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ec1db9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@939510org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11f623f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastids, including Trypanosoma brucei, control gene expression primarily at the posttranscriptional level. Nuclear mRNA export is an important, but understudied, step in this process. The general heterodimeric export factors, Mex67/Mtr2, function in the export of mRNAs and tRNAs in T. brucei, but RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that regulate export processes by controlling the dynamics of Mex67/Mtr2 ribonucleoprotein formation or transport have not been identified. Here, we report that DRBD18, an essential and abundant T. brucei RBP, associates with Mex67/Mtr2 in vivo, likely through its direct interaction with Mtr2. DRBD18 downregulation results in partial accumulation of poly(A)+ mRNA in the nucleus, but has no effect on localization of intron-containing or mature tRNAs. Comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes from whole cell and cytosol in DRBD18 knockdown parasites demonstrates that depletion of DRBD18 leads to impairment of nuclear export of a subset of mRNAs. CLIP experiments reveal association of DRBD18 with several of these mRNAs. Moreover, DRBD18 knockdown leads to a partial accumulation of the Mex67/Mtr2 export receptors in the nucleus. Taken together, the current study supports a model in which DRBD18 regulates the selective nuclear export of mRNAs by promoting the mobilization of export competent mRNPs to the cytosol through the nuclear pore complex.",

An underappreciated source of damage to Fe-S clusters are cuprous (Cu1+) ions. Since histone H3 enzymatically produces Cu1+ to support copper-dependent functions, we asked whether this activity could become detrimental to Fe-S clusters. Here, we report that histone H3-mediated Cu1+ toxicity is a major determinant of cellular Fe-S cluster quotient. Inadequate Fe-S cluster supply, either due to diminished assembly as occurs in Friedreichs Ataxia or defective distribution, causes severe metabolic and growth defects in S. cerevisiae. Decreasing Cu1+ abundance, through attenuation of histone cupric reductase activity or depletion of total cellular copper, restored Fe-S cluster-dependent metabolism and growth. Our findings reveal a novel interplay between chromatin and mitochondria in Fe-S cluster homeostasis, and a potential pathogenic role for histone enzyme activity and Cu1+ in diseases with Fe-S cluster dysfunction.\n\nTeaserReduction of Cu1+ production by histone H3 restores cellular deficiencies caused by insufficient supply of iron-sulfur clusters.",

    "abstract": "1.Rhodopsin (RHO) misfolding mutations are a common cause of the blinding disease autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). The most prevalent mutation, RHOP23H, results in its misfolding and retention in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Under homeostatic conditions, misfolded proteins are selectively identified, retained at the ER, and cleared via ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and/or autophagy. Overload of these degradation processes for a prolonged period leads to imbalanced proteostasis and may eventually result in cell death. ERAD of misfolded proteins like RHOP23H includes the subsequent steps of protein recognition, targeting for ERAD, retrotranslocation, and proteasomal degradation. In the present study, we investigated and compared pharmacological modulation of ERAD at these four different major steps. We show that inhibition of the VCP/proteasome activity favors cell survival and suppresses P23H-mediated retinal degeneration in RHOP23H rat retinal explants. We suggest targeting this activity as a therapeutic approach for patients with currently untreatable adRP.",

To elucidate this regulation, we further explore the spatial dynamics of Snf1 and Mig1 and how they are controlled by concentrations of hexose sugars. We utilize fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to study the movement of Snf1 and how it responds to external glucose concentrations. We show that the Snf1 pathway reacts to the presence of glucose. Furthermore, we identify a negative feedback loop regulating Snf1 activity.

Here we analyze the roles of maternally deposited and zygotically transcribed TAF15, which is essential for the proper development of dorsoanterior neural tissues. By measuring changes in exon usage and transcript abundance from TAF15-depleted embryos we found TAF15 may regulate dorsoanterior neural development through fgfr4 and ventx2.1. TAF15 uses distinct mechanisms to downregulate FGFR4 expression: 1) retention of a single intron within fgfr4 when maternal and zygotic TAF15 is depleted, and 2) reduction of total fgfr4 transcript when zygotic TAF15 alone is depleted. The two mechanisms of gene regulation (post-transcriptional vs transcriptional) suggest TAF15-mediated gene regulation is target and cofactor-dependent, depending on the milieu of factors that are present at different times of development.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal brush border is made of an array of microvilli that increases the membrane surface area for nutrient processing, absorption, and host defence. Studies on mammalian cultured epithelial cells uncovered some of the molecular players and physical constrains required to establish this apical specialized membrane. However, the building and maintenance of a brush border in vivo has not been investigated in detail yet. Here, we combined super-resolution imaging, transmission electron microscopy and genome editing in the developing nematode C. elegans to build a high-resolution and dynamic localization map of known and new markers of the brush border. Notably, we show that microvilli components are dynamically enriched at the apical membrane during microvilli outgrowth and maturation but become highly stable once microvilli are built. This new mapping tool will be instrumental to understand the molecular processes of microvilli growth and maintenance in vivo as well as the effect of genetic perturbations, notably in the context of disorders affecting brush border integrity.",

    "abstract": "Male secondary sexual traits often scale allometrically with body size. These allometries can be variable within species, and may shift depending on environmental conditions such as food quality. Such allometric plasticity has been hypothesized to initiate local adaptation and evolutionary diversification of scaling relationships, but is under-recorded, and its eco- evolutionary effects are not well understood. Here, we test for allometric plasticity in the bulb mite (Rhizoglyphus robini) in which large males tend to develop as armed adult fighters with thickened third legs, while small males become adult scramblers without thickened legs. We first examined the ontogenetic timing for size- and growth-dependent male morph determination, using experimentally amplified fluctuations in growth rate throughout juvenile development. Having established that somatic growth and body size determine male morph expression immediately before metamorphosis, we examined whether the relationship between adult male morph and size at metamorphosis shifts with food quality. We found that the threshold body size for male morph expression shifts towards lower values with deteriorating food quality, confirming food-dependent allometric plasticity. Such allometric plasticity may allow populations to track prevailing nutritional conditions, potentially facilitating rapid evolution of allometric scaling relationships.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation are post-translational modifications that play major roles in pathways like DNA damage response and infection, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. DTX3L, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, forms a heterodimer with PARP9. The complex has ubiquitin ligase activity and also ADP-ribosylates the C-terminus of ubiquitin on Gly76. NAD+-dependent ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin by DTX3L-PARP9 prevents ubiquitin from conjugating to protein substrates. By using individually produced proteins, we have studied the interaction between DTX3L and PARP9. We identify that the D3 domain (230 - 510) of DTX3L mediates interaction with PARP9 with nanomolar affinity and an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry. Our results also suggest the formation of a higher molecular weight oligomer mediated by the N-terminus of DTX3L (1-200). Furthermore, we show that ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin at Gly76 is a reversible modification that can be removed by several macrodomain-type hydrolases. Our study provides a framework to understand how DTX3L-PARP9 mediates ADP-ribosylation and ubiquitination in an inter-regulatory manner.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome-targeting antibiotics comprise over half of antibiotics used in medicine, but our fundamental knowledge of their binding sites is derived primarily from ribosome structures from non-pathogenic species. These include Thermus thermophilus, Deinococcus radiodurans and Haloarcula marismortui, as well as commensal and pathogenic Escherichia coli. Advancements in electron cryomicroscopy have allowed for the determination of more ribosome structures from pathogenic bacteria, with each study highlighting species-specific differences that had not been observed in the non-pathogenic structures. These observed differences suggest that more novel ribosome structures, particularly from pathogens, are required for a more accurate understanding of the level of diversity of the entire bacterial ribosome, potentially leading to potential advancements in antibiotic research. In this study, high accuracy covariance and hidden Markov models were used to annotate ribosomal RNA and protein sequences respectively from genomic sequence, allowing us to determine the underlying ribosomal sequence diversity using phylogenetic methods. This analysis provided evidence that the current non-pathogenic ribosome structures are not sufficient representatives of some pathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter pylori, or of whole phyla such as Bacteroidetes.\n\nSignificance StatementThe growing number of antibiotic resistance pathogenic bacteria are of critical concern to the health profession. Many of the current classes of antibiotics target the bacterial ribosome, the protein making factory for these species. However, much of our knowledge of the bacterial ribosome is based upon non-pathogenic bacteria that are highly divergent from the major pathogens of concern. We have analysed the genetic variation of the RNA and protein components of all available bacterial ribosomes. This has led us to identify the highest priority groups of bacteria that would benefit most from further analysis of their ribosome structures, from both a medical and evolutionary perspective.",

Diseases of podocytes at the kidney filtration barrier reduce the intrinsic permeability of the capillary wall resulting in albuminuria. However, direct quantitative assessment of the underlying morphological changes has previously not been possible. Here we developed a deep learning-based approach for segmentation of foot processes in images acquired with optical microscopy. Our method - Automatic Morphological Analysis of Podocytes (AMAP) - accurately segments foot processes and robustly quantifies their morphology. It also robustly determined morphometric parameters, at a Pearson correlation of r > 0.71 with a previously published semi-automated approach, across a large set of mouse tissue samples. The artificial intelligence algorithm wasWe applied the analysis to a set of human kidney disease conditions allowing comprehensive quantification of various underlying morphometric parameters. These results confirmed that when podocytes are injured, they take on a more simplified architecture and the slit diaphragm length is significantly shortened, resulting in a reduction in the filtration slit area and a loss of the buttress force of podocytes which increases the permeability of the glomerular basement membrane to albumin.",

    "abstract": "The alternation of generations in land plants occurs between the sporophyte phase and the gametophyte phase. The sporophytes of seed plants develop self-maintained, multicellular meristems, and these meristems determine plant architecture. The gametophytes of seed plants lack meristems and are heterotrophic. In contrast, the gametophytes of seed-free vascular plants, including ferns, are autotrophic and free-living, developing meristems to sustain their independent growth and proliferation. Compared to meristems in the sporophytes of seed plants, the cellular mechanisms underlying meristem development in fern gametophytes remain largely unknown. Here, using confocal time-lapse live imaging and computational segmentation and quantification, we determined different patterns of cell divisions associated with the initiation and proliferation of two distinct types of meristems in fern gametophytes. Our results reveal how the simple timing of a switch between two meristems has considerable consequences for the divergent gametophyte morphologies of two closely related ferns from Pteridaceae (Pteris and Ceratopteris). Our result provides evolutionary insight into the function and regulation of gametophyte meristems in seed-free vascular plants.\n\nHighlightLive-imaging of cell growth and division in apical initials and lateral meristems reveals that the timing of a switch between the two meristem identities drives morphology variation in fern gametophytes.",

However, it remains unclear whether this is the result of one functionally homogeneous region or whether there are functional subdivisions within the DLPFC. Here, we divided the DLPFC into seven areas along with rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically and explored their respective patterns of structural and functional connectivity. In vivo probabilistic tractography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were employed to map out the patterns of connectivity from each DLPFC subregions. Structural connectivity demonstrated graded intra-regional connectivity within the DLPFC. The patterns of structural connectivity between the DLPFC subregions and other cortical areas revealed that he dorsal-rostral subregions was restricted to connect to other frontal and limbic areas, whereas the ventral-caudal region was widely connected to frontal, temporal, parietal, and limbic cortex. Functional connectivity analysis demonstrated that subregions of DLPFC were strongly interconnected to each other. The dorsal subregions were associated with the default mode network (DMN), while middle dorsal-rostral subregions were linked with the multiple demand network (MDN), respectively. Similar to the results of structural connectivity, the ventral-caudal subregion showed increased functional coupling with both DMN and MDN. Our results suggest that DLPFC may be subdivided by the diagonal axis of the dorsal-ventral axis and rostral-caudal axis, which support the patterns of connectivity the parts of the DLPFC reflects its integrative executive function.",

Two-photon, single-cell resolution optogenetics based on holographic light-targeting approaches enables accurate spatio-temporal control of individual or multiple neurons. Yet, currently, the ability to drive asynchronous activity in distinct cells is critically limited to a few milliseconds and the achievable number of targets to several dozens. In order to expand the capability of single-cell optogenetics, we introduce an approach capable of ultra-fast sequential light targeting (FLiT), based on switching temporally focused beams between holograms at kHz rates. We demonstrate serial-parallel photostimulation strategies capable of multi-cell sub-millisecond temporal control and many-fold expansion of the number of activated cells. This approach will be important for experiments that require rapid and precise cell stimulation with defined spatio-temporal activity patterns and optical control of large neuronal ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved and dynamic lysosomal degradation process for cellular homeostasis and remodelling, which is essential for the development and maintenance of different hematopoietic fates. However, the roles of autophagy in definitive hematopoiesis remain elusive. Here, we exploited zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the effect of knocking-out unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1b and 2 (ulk1b and ulk2), homologous of human ULK1 and ULK2, respectively, on definitive hematopoiesis. Upon ulk1b or ulk2 mutation, autophagosome formation was blocked in zebrafish embryos. More importantly, pan-leukocytes (lcp1), common myeloid progenitors (spi1b), neutrophils (mpx), and macrophages (mpeg1.1) significantly elevated, while the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) (myb), erythroid progenitors (gata1), and embryonic hemoglobin (hbae1.1) significantly reduced in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) of ulk1b or ulk2 mutant zebrafish embryos. On the other hand, chemically modulated autophagy induction by calpeptin, a downstream autophagy inducer for ulk complex, was insufficient to ameliorate dysregulated hematopoiesis in both ulk1b and ulk2 mutants. Conversely, autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine functioned parallelly with the ulk mutants to maintain defective hematopoiesis. These observations raised a link between autophagy and definitive hematopoiesis and potentiates the fact that autophagy deficiency incorporates with myeloproliferation and anemia, which warrants the significance of autophagy in regulating definitive hematopoiesis.",

Using wild-type and targeted deletion strains, we measured ATP-dependent peroxisomal octanoate {beta}-oxidation, intra-peroxisomal ATP levels employing peroxisome-targeted ATP-sensing reporter proteins, and ATP uptake in proteoliposomes prepared from purified peroxisomes. We show that intra-peroxisomal ATP levels are maintained by different peroxisomal membrane proteins each with different modes of action: (1) the previously reported Ant1p protein, which catalyzes ATP/AMP exchange (2) the ABC transporter protein complex Pxa1p/Pxa2p, which mediates both acyl-CoA and ATP uptake; and; (3) the mitochondrial Aac2p protein, which catalyzes ATP/ADP exchange and was shown to have a dual localization in both mitochondria and peroxisomes.

    "abstract": "Rapidly diversifying clades are central to the study of diversification dynamics. This central importance is perhaps most apparent when rapid evolution occurs across several axes of diversification (e.g., lineage, phenotype, and niche); such clades facilitate investigations into the interplay between adaptive and non-adaptive diversification mechanisms. Yet, empirical evidence from rapidly evolving clades remains unclear about the relationships, if any, across diversification axes. This is especially apparent regarding the timing of diversification rate shifts. We address this knowledge gap through comparisons of the rate and timing of lineage, phenotypic, and niche diversification in Penstemon, a rapidly-evolving angiosperm genus. We find that diversification rate shifts in Penstemon are asynchronous; while we identify a burst and subsequent slowdown in lineage diversification rate [~]2.0-2.5 MYA, shifts in phenotypic and niche diversification rates either lagged behind temporally or did not occur at all. We posit that this asynchronicity in diversification rate shifts is the result of initial niche-neutral diversification followed by adaptive, density-dependent processes. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that asynchronous shifts in diversification rates may be common and question the applicability of expectations for diversification dynamics across disparate empirical systems.",

Here we present Repair-seq, a high-throughput screening approach that measures the effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on the distribution of mutations introduced at targeted DNA lesions. Using Repair-seq, we profiled DSB repair outcomes induced by two programmable nucleases (Cas9 and Cas12a) after knockdown of 476 genes involved in DSB repair or associated processes in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides for homology-directed repair (HDR). The resulting data enabled principled, data-driven inference of DSB end joining and HDR pathways and demonstrated that repair outcomes with superficially similar sequence architectures can have markedly different genetic dependencies. Systematic interrogation of these dependencies then uncovered unexpected relationships among DSB repair genes and isolated incompletely characterized repair mechanisms. This work provides a foundation for understanding the complex pathways of DSB repair and for optimizing genome editing across modalities.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWhile authorship plays a powerful role in the academy, research indicates many authors engage in questionable practices like honorary authorship. This suggests that authorship may be a contested space where individuals must exercise agency--a dynamic and emergent process, embedded in context--to negotiate potentially conflicting norms among published criteria, disciplines, and informal practices. This study explores how authors narrate their own and others agency in making authorship decisions.\n\nMethodWe conducted a mixed-methods analysis of 24 first authors accounts of authorship decisions on a recent multi-author paper. Authors included 14 females and 10 males in health professions education (HPE) from U.S. and Canadian institutions (10 assistant, 6 associate, and 8 full professors). Analysis took place in three phases: (1) linguistic analysis of grammatical structures shown to be associated with agency (coding for main clause subjects and verb types); (2) narrative analysis to create a \"moral\" and \"title\" for each account; and (3) integration of (1) and (2).\n\nResultsParticipants narrated other authors most frequently as main clause subjects (n = 191), then themselves (I; n = 151), inanimate nouns (it, the paper; n = 146), and author team (we; n = 105). Three broad types of agency were narrated: distributed (n = 15 participants), focusing on how resources and work were spread across team members; individual (n = 6), focusing on the first authors action; and collaborative (n = 3), focusing on group actions. These three types of agency contained four sub-types, e.g., supported, contested, task-based, negotiated.\n\nDiscussionThis study highlights the complex and emergent nature of agency narrated by authors when making authorship decisions. Published criteria offer us starting point--the stated rules of the authorship game; this paper offers us a next step--the enacted and narrated approach to the game.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive stress resistance in microbes is mostly attributed to the expression of stress response genes, such as heat shock proteins, which prevent deterioration of cellular material. Here, we report a novel response of E. coli to heat stress: induction of a growth-arrested state, caused by degradation of an enzyme in the methionine biosynthesis pathway (MetA). While MetA degradation is detrimental for proliferation, we show that the resulting growth arrest has a direct benefit for survival at high temperatures; it protects cells when temperatures rise beyond 50{degrees}C, increasing the survival chances by over 1000-fold. Using a combination of experiments and mathematical modelling, we show that degradation of MetA leads to the coexistence of growing and non-growing cells, allowing microbes to bet-hedge between continued growth if conditions remain bearable and survival if conditions worsen. We test our model experimentally and verify quantitatively how protein expression, degradation rates and environmental stresses affect the partitioning between growing and non-growing cells. Because growth arrest can be abolished with simple mutations, such as point mutations of MetA and knock-outs of proteases, we interpret the breakdown of methionine synthesis as a system that has evolved to disintegrate at high temperature and shut off growth, analogous to  thermal fuses used in engineering to shut off electricity when the device could be damaged by overheating.",

    "abstract": "Centromere structure and function are defined by the epigenetic modification of histones at centromeric and pericentromeric chromatin. The constitutive heterochromatin found at pericentromeric regions is highly enriched for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. While mis-expression of the methyltransferase enzymes, Suv39 and Suv420, that regulate these marks are common in disease, the consequences of such changes are not well understood. Our data show that increased centromere localization of Suv39 and Suv420 suppress centromere transcription and compromise localization of the mitotic kinase Aurora B: decreasing microtubule dynamics and compromising chromosome alignment and segregation. We find that inhibition of Suv420 methyltransferase activity partially restores Aurora B localization to centromeres and that restoration of the Aurora B-containing CPC to the centromere is sufficient to suppress mitotic errors that result when Suv420/H4K20me3 is enriched at centromeres. Consistent with a role for Suv39 and Suv420 in negatively regulating Aurora B, high expression of these enzymes corresponds with increased sensitivity to Aurora kinase inhibition in cancer cells suggesting that increased H3K9 and H4K20 methylation may be an underappreciated source of chromosome missegregation in cancer.",

Understanding whether the process of regeneration mirrors development is an open question in most regenerative species. Here we take a transcriptomics approach to examine to what extent leg regeneration shows the same temporal patterns of gene expression as leg development in the embryo, in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. We find that leg development in the embryo shows stereotypic temporal patterns of gene expression. In contrast, global patterns of gene expression during leg regeneration show a high degree of variation, related to the physiology of individual animals. A major driver of this variation is the molting cycle. After dissecting the transcriptional signals of individual physiology from regeneration, we obtain temporal signals that mark distinct phases of leg regeneration. Comparing the transcriptional dynamics of development and regeneration we find that, although both processes use largely the same genes, the temporal patterns in which these gene sets are deployed are different and cannot be systematically aligned.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISingle-limb data on transcriptional dynamics of leg development and regeneration\nC_LIO_LIDeveloping embryonic legs show stereotypic transcriptional profiles\nC_LIO_LIRegenerating leg transcriptomes show a high degree on individual variation\nC_LIO_LIRegenerating leg transcriptomes are influenced by adult physiology, especially molting\nC_LIO_LIRegenerating leg transcriptomes reveal distinct phases of leg regeneration\nC_LIO_LILeg development and regeneration use overlapping sets of genes in different temporal patterns\nC_LI",

Although our knowledge of nitric oxide synthases (Nos), the enzymes that synthesize NO in vivo, is substantial, the origin of a large and diversified repertoire of nos gene orthologs in fish with respect to tetrapods remains a puzzle. The recent identification of nos3 in the ray-finned fish spotted gar, which was considered lost in the ray-finned fish lineage, changed this perspective. This prompted us to explore nos gene evolution and expression in depth, surveying vertebrate species representing key evolutionary nodes. This study provides noteworthy findings: first, nos2 experienced several lineage-specific gene duplications and losses. Second, nos3 was found to be lost independently in two different teleost lineages, Elopomorpha and Clupeocephala. Third, the expression of at least one nos paralog in the gills of developing shark, bichir, sturgeon, and gar but not in arctic lamprey, suggest that nos expression in this organ likely arose in the last common ancestor of gnathostomes. These results provide a framework for continuing research on nos genes roles, highlighting subfunctionalization and reciprocal loss of function that occurred in different lineages during vertebrate genome duplications.",

To advance traditional methods for scaling the generation of sterile males, we previously described a CRISPR-mediated precision-guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT), in which Cas9 and gRNA strains are genetically crossed to generate sterile males for release. While effective at generating F1 sterile males, pgSIT requires a genetic cross between the two parental strains which requires maintenance and sexing of two strains in a factory. Therefore, to further advance pgSIT by removing this crossing step, here we describe a next-generation Temperature-Inducible pgSIT (TI-pgSIT) technology and demonstrate its proof-of-concept in Drosophila melanogaster. Importantly, we were able to develop a true-breeding strain for TI-pgSIT that eliminates the requirement for sex sorting, a feature that may help further automate production at scale.",

    "abstract": "Identification and quantitation of newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) are critical to understanding protein dynamics in development and disease. Probing the nascent proteome can be achieved using non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to selectively label the NSPs utilizing endogenous translation machinery, which can then be quantitated with mass spectrometry. Since its conception, ncAA labeling has been applied to study many in vitro systems and more recently the in vivo proteomes of complex organisms such as rodents. In vivo labeling is typically achieved by introducing ncAAs into diet, which requires extended labeling times. We have previously demonstrated that labeling the murine proteome is feasible via injection of azidohomoalanine (Aha), a ncAA and methionine (Met) analog, without the need for Met depletion. With the ability to isolate NSPs without applying stress from dietary changes, Aha labeling can address biological questions wherein temporal protein dynamics are significant. However, accessing this temporal resolution requires a more complete understanding of Aha distribution kinetics in tissues. Furthermore, studies of physiological effects of ncAA administration have been limited to gross observation of animal appearance. To address these gaps, we created a deterministic, compartmental model of the biokinetic transport and incorporation of Aha in mice. Parameters were informed from literature and experimentally. Model results demonstrate the ability to predict Aha distribution and labeling under a variety of dosing paradigms and confirms the use of the model as a tool for design of future studies. To establish the suitability of the method for in vivo studies, we investigated the impact of Aha administration on normal physiology by analyzing the plasma metabolome following Aha injection. We show that Aha administration does not significantly perturb cellular functions as reflected by an unchanged plasma metabolome compared to non-injected controls.\n\nAuthor SummaryAs the machinery of life, proteins play a key role in dynamic processes within an organism. As such, the response of the proteome to perturbation is increasingly becoming a critical component of biological and medical studies. Dysregulation of protein mechanisms following exposure to experimental treatment conditions can implicate physiological mechanisms of health and disease, elucidate toxin/drug response, and highlight potential targets for novel therapies. Traditionally, these questions have been probed by studying perturbations in total proteins following an experimental treatment. However, the proteome is expansive and noisy, often an early response can be indiscernible against the background of unperturbed proteins. Here, we apply a technique to selectively label newly synthesized proteins, which enables capturing early changes in protein behavior. We utilize an amino acid analog that naturally incorporates into proteins, and investigate the tissue distribution, protein labeling efficiency, and potential physiological impact of this analog in mice. Our results demonstrate that we can reproducibly predict protein labeling and that the administration of this analog does not significantly alter in vivo physiology over the course of our experimental study. We further present a computational model that can be used to guide future experiments utilizing this technique to study proteomic responses to stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic elements commonly found in bacterial cells that support many functional aspects including environmental adaptations. The identification of these genetic elements is vital for the further study of function and behaviour of the organisms. However it is challenging to separate these small sequences from longer chromosomes within a given species. Machine learning approaches have been successfully developed to classify assembled contigs into two classes (plasmids and chromosomes). However, such tools are not designed to directly perform classification on long and error-prone reads which have been gaining popularity in genomics studies. Assembling complete plasmids is still challenging for many long-read assemblers with a mixed input of long and error-prone reads from plasmids and chromosomes. In this paper, we present PlasLR, a tool that adapts existing plasmid detection approaches to directly classify long and error-prone reads. PlasLR makes use of both the composition and coverage information of long and error-prone reads. We evaluate PlasLR on multiple simulated and real long-read datasets with varying compositions of plasmids and chromosomes. Our experiments demonstrate that PlasLR substantially improves the accuracy of plasmid detection on top of the state-of-the-art plasmid detection tools. Moreover, we show that using PlasLR before long-read assembly helps to enhance the assembly quality in terms of plasmid recovery and near complete chromosome assembly from metagenomic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Predictive approaches such as virtual screening have been used in drug discovery with the objective of reducing developmental time and costs. Current machine learning and network- based approaches have issues related to generalization, usability, or model interpretability, especially due to the complexity of target proteins structure/function, and bias in system training datasets. Here, we propose a new computational method \"DRUIDom\" to predict bio- interactions between drug candidate compounds and target proteins by utilizing the domain modularity of proteins, to overcome problems associated with current approaches. DRUIDom is composed of two methodological steps. First, ligands/compounds are statistically mapped to structural domains of their target proteins, with the aim of identifying physical or functional interactions. As such, other proteins containing the mapped domain or domain pair become new candidate targets for the corresponding compounds. Next, a million-scale dataset of small molecule compounds, including the ones mapped to domains in the previous step, are clustered based on their molecular similarities, and their domain associations are propagated to other compounds within the same clusters. Experimentally verified bioactivity data points, obtained from public databases, are meticulously filtered to construct datasets of active/interacting and inactive/non-interacting compound-target pairs ([~]2.9M data points), and used as training data for calculating parameters of compound- domain mappings, which led to 27,032 high-confidence associations between 250 domains and 8,165 compounds, and a finalized output of [~]5 million new compound-protein interactions. DRUIDom is experimentally validated by syntheses and bioactivity analyses of compounds predicted to target LIM-kinase proteins, which play critical roles in the regulation of cell motility, cell cycle progression, and differentiation through actin filament dynamics. We showed that LIMK-inhibitor-2 and its derivatives significantly block the cancer cell migration through inhibition of LIMK phosphorylation and the downstream protein cofilin. One of the derivative compounds (LIMKi-2d) was identified as a promising candidate due to its action on resistant Mahlavu liver cancer cells. The results demonstrated that DRUIDom can be exploited to identify drug candidate compounds for intended targets and to predict new target proteins based on the defined compound-domain relationships. The datasets, results, and the source code of DRUIDom are fully-available at: https://github.com/cansyl/DRUIDom.\n\nAuthor SummaryDrug development comprises several interlinked steps from designing drug candidate molecules to running clinical trials, with the aim to bring a new drug to market. A critical yet costly and labor-intensive stage is drug discovery, in which drug candidate molecules that specifically interact with the intended biomolecular target (mostly proteins) are identified. Lately, data-centric computational methods have been proposed to aid experimental procedures in drug discovery. These methods have the ability to rapidly assess large molecule libraries and reduce the time and cost of the process; however, most of them suffer from problems related to producing reliable biologically relevant results, preventing them from gaining real-world usage. Here, we have developed a new method called DRUIDom to predict unknown interactions between drugs/drug candidate compounds and biological targets by utilizing the modular structure of proteins. For this, we identify the domains, i.e., the evolutionary and functional building blocks of proteins, where these potential drug compounds can bind, and utilize this information along with protein domain annotations to predict new drug targets. We have tested the biological relevance of DRUIDom on selected proteins that play critical roles in the progression of numerous types of cancer. Cell-based experimental results indicated that predicted inhibitors are effective even on drug-resistant cancer cells. Our results suggest that DRUIDom produces novel and biologically relevant results that can be directly used in the early steps of the drug discovery process.",

    "abstract": "Iron metabolism is crucial to maintain optimal physiological homeostasis of every organism and any alteration of the iron concentration (i.e. deficit or excess) can have adverse consequences. Transferrins are glycoproteins that play important role in iron transportation and have been widely characterized in vertebrates, and insects, but poorly studied in blood-feeding mosquitoes. Here, we characterized a 2102 bp long transcript AcTrf1a encoding putative transferrin homolog protein from mosquito An. culicifacies. A detailed in silico analysis predicts AcTrf1a (ACUA023913-RA) encodes 624 amino acid (aa) long polypeptide that carries transferrin domain. AcTrf1a also showed a putative N-linked glycosylation site, a characteristic feature of most of the mammalian transferrins and certain non-blood feeding insects. Structure modelling prediction confers the presence of an iron binding site at the N-terminal lobe of the transferrin. Our spatial and temporal expression analysis under altered pathophysiological conditions showed that AcTrf1a abundantly express in the fat-body, ovary, and its response is significantly altered (enhanced) after blood meal uptake, and exogenous bacterial challenge. Additionally, a non-heme iron supplementation of FeCl3 at 1 mM concentration not only augmented the AcTrf1a transcript expression in fat-body, also enhanced the reproductive fecundity of gravid adult female mosquitoes. RNAi mediated knockdown of AcTrf1a causes a significant reduction in the egg laying/fecundity, confirmed important role of transferrin in oocyte maturation. Further detailed characterization may help to select this transcript as a unique target to impair the mosquito reproductive outcome.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInsect transferrins are mostly glycoprotein of about 60-80 kDa molecular weight, involved in myriad physiological events and serve as a major iron transport protein.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we identified and characterized a 2102 bp long transcript encoding putative transferrin homolog of 624 aa long peptide, carrying only one fully functional transferrin domain at N-terminal from An. culicifacies.\nC_LIO_LISpatial and temporal expression analysis of AcTrf1a highlights an enriched expression in fat-body and ovary during vitellogenesis.\nC_LIO_LIIron supplementation and dsRNA mediated knockdown experiments together confer that AcTrf1a may have key role in the iron homeostasis regulation during oogenesis, and egg maturation in the gravid female mosquitoes.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=87 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/448311v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a87ec0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@197cecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1588092org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16110b4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFig 1:C_FLOATNO Schematic presentation of iron transport from midgut to ovary by transferrin1 and oocyte reduction after AcTrf1a knockdown.\n\nMosquito acquires iron either from blood meal or iron supplementation in sugar meal.

    "abstract": "The majority of olfaction studies focus on orthonasal stimulation where odors enter via the front nasal cavity, while retronasal olfaction, where odors enter the rear of the nasal cavity during feeding, is understudied. The processing of retronasal odors via coordinated spiking of neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) is largely unknown. To this end, we use multi-electrode array in vivo recordings of rat OB mitral cells (MC) in response to a food odor with both modes of stimulation, and find significant differences in evoked firing rates and spike count covariances (i.e., noise correlations). To better understand these differences, we develop a single-compartment biophysical OB model that is able to reproduce key properties of important OB cell types. Prior experiments in olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) showed retro stimulation yields slower and spatially smaller ORN inputs than with ortho, yet whether this is consequential for OB activity remains unknown. Indeed with these specifications for ORN inputs, our OB model captures the trends in our OB data. We also analyze how first and second order ORN input statistics dynamically transfer to MC spiking statistics with a phenomenological linear-nonlinear filter model, and find that retro inputs result in larger temporal filters than ortho inputs. Finally, our models show that the temporal profile of ORN is crucial for capturing our data and is thus a distinguishing feature between ortho and retro stimulation, even at the OB. Using data-driven modeling, we detail how ORN inputs result in differences in OB dynamics and MC spiking statistics. These differences may ultimately shape how ortho and retro odors are coded.\n\nAuthor summaryOlfaction is a key sense for many cognitive and behavioral tasks, and is particularly unique because odors can naturally enter the nasal cavity from the front or rear, i.e., ortho- and retro-nasal, respectively. Yet little is known about the differences in coordinated spiking in the olfactory bulb with ortho versus retro stimulation, let alone how these different modes of olfaction may alter coding of odors. We simultaneously record many cells in rat olfactory bulb to assess the differences in spiking statistics, and develop a biophysical olfactory bulb network model to study the reasons for these differences. Using theoretical and computational methods, we find that the olfactory bulb transfers input statistics differently for retro stimulation relative to ortho stimulation. Furthermore, our models show that the temporal profile of inputs is crucial for capturing our data and is thus a distinguishing feature between ortho and retro stimulation, even at the olfactory bulb. Understanding the spiking dynamics of the olfactory bulb with both ortho and retro stimulation is a key step for ultimately understanding how the brain codes odors with different modes of olfaction.",
