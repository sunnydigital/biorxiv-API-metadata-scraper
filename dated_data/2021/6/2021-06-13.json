    "abstract": "Standard economic indicators provide an incomplete picture of what we value both as individuals and as a society. Furthermore, canonical macroeconomic measures, such as GDP, do not account for non-market activities (e.g., cooking, childcare) that nevertheless impact well-being. Here, we introduce a computational tool that measures the affective value of experiences (e.g., playing a musical instrument without errors). We go on to validate this tool with neural data, using fMRI to measure neural activity in male and female human subjects performing a reinforcement learning task that incorporated periodic ratings of subjective affective state. Learning performance determined level of payment (i.e., extrinsic reward). Crucially, the task also incorporated a skilled performance component (i.e., intrinsic reward) which did not influence payment. Both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards influenced affective dynamics, and their relative influence could be captured in our computational model. Individuals for whom intrinsic rewards had a greater influence on affective state than extrinsic rewards had greater ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity for intrinsic than extrinsic rewards. Thus, we show that computational modelling of affective dynamics can index the subjective value of intrinsic relative to extrinsic rewards, a  computational hedonometer that reflects both behavior and neural activity that quantifies the affective value of experience.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTraditional economic indicators are increasingly recognized to provide an incomplete picture of what we value as a society. Standard economic approaches struggle to accurately assign values to non-market activities that nevertheless may be intrinsically rewarding, prompting a need for new tools to measure what really matters to individuals. Using a combination of neuroimaging and computational modeling, we show that despite their lack of instrumental value, intrinsic rewards influence subjective affective state and ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity. The relative degree to which extrinsic and intrinsic rewards influence affective state is predictive of their relative impacts on neural activity, confirming the utility of our approach for measuring the affective value of experiences and other non-market activities in individuals.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is characterized by protracted maturation. The cellular mechanisms controlling the early development of prefrontal circuits are still largely unknown. Our study delineates the developmental cellular processes in the mouse medial PFC (mPFC) during the second and third postnatal weeks and characterizes their contribution to the changes in network activity. We show that spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) are increased while spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) are reduced from the second to the third postnatal week. Drug application suggested that the increased sEPSC frequency in mPFC at P10 is due to depolarizing GABAA receptor (GABAAR) function. To further validate this, perforated patch-clamp recordings were obtained and the expression levels of K-Cl co-transporter 2 (KCC2) protein were examined. The reversal potential of IPSCs in response to current stimulation was significantly more depolarized at P10 compared to P20 while KCC2 expression is decreased. Moreover, the number of parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons increase from P10 to P20 in the mPFC and their intrinsic electrophysiological properties significantly mature. Using computational modeling, we show that the developmental changes in synaptic and intrinsic properties of mPFC neurons contribute to the enhanced network activity in the juvenile compared to neonatal mPFC.",

    "abstract": "Plant organ size and shape are major agronomic traits that depend on cell division and expansion, which are both regulated by complex gene networks. In several eudicot species belonging to the rosid clade, organ growth is controlled by a repressor complex consisting of PEAPOD (PPD) and KINASE-INDUCIBLE DOMAIN INTERACTING (KIX) proteins. The role of these proteins in asterids, which together with the rosids constitute most of the core eudicot species, is still unknown. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to target SlKIX8 and SlKIX9 in the asterid model species tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and analyzed loss-of-function phenotypes. We found that loss of function of SlKIX8 and SlKIX9 led to the production of enlarged, dome-shaped leaves and that these leaves exhibited increased expression of putative SlPPD target genes. Unexpectedly, kix8 kix9 mutants carried enlarged fruits with increased pericarp thickness due to cell expansion. At the molecular level, protein interaction assays indicated that SlKIX8 and SlKIX9 act as adaptors between the SlPPD and SlTOPLESS co-repressor proteins. Our results show that KIX8 and KIX9 are regulators of organ growth in asterids and can provide strategies to improve important traits in produce such as thickness of the fruit flesh.\n\nOne sentence summaryTwo transcriptional repressors negatively regulate organ growth in tomato with loss-of-function lines producing enlarged fruits due to an appearance of more expanded cells in the fruit flesh.",

    "abstract": "Processing bodies (PBs) are ribonucleoprotein granules that suppress cytokine mRNA translation that are targeted for disassembly by many viruses. Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is the etiological agent of the inflammatory endothelial cancer, Kaposis sarcoma, and a PB-regulating virus. The virus encodes Kaposin B (KapB), which induces actin stress fibres (SFs) and cell spindling as well as PB disassembly. We now show that KapB-mediated PB disassembly requires actin rearrangements, RhoA effectors and the mechanoresponsive transcription activator, YAP. Moreover, ectopic expression of active YAP or exposure of ECs to mechanical forces caused PB disassembly in the absence of KapB and mechanoresponsive PB disassembly also required YAP. Using the viral protein KapB, we identified a new consequence of the exposure of cells to mechanical forces that alter actin dynamics and activate YAP, namely the disassembly of PBs.\n\nImportanceFor the first time, we demonstrate that processing bodies (PBs), cytoplasmic sites of RNA decay, are regulated by mechanical signaling events that alter actin dynamics and that this requires the mechanoresponsive transcription factor, YAP. Using the overexpression of a viral protein called KapB, known previously to mediate PB disassembly, we show that actin stress fibers (SFs) and the mechanoresponsive transcription factor, YAP, are required for PB loss. We also show that other established mechanical signals (shear stress or stiff extracellular matrix) that lead to the formation of SFs and activate YAP also cause PB disassembly. This is important because it means that KapB activates, from the inside out, a pathway that links cell shape to post-transcriptional gene regulation via cytoplasmic PBs.",

    "abstract": "Asian soybean rust (ASR) caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi, an obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen, is the most devastating soybean production disease worldwide. Currently, timely fungicide application is the only means to control ASR in the field. We investigated cellulose nanofiber (CNF) application on ASR disease management. CNF-treated leaves showed reduced lesion number after P. pachyrhizi inoculation compared to control leaves, indicating that covering soybean leaves with CNF confers P. pachyrhizi resistance. We also demonstrated that formation of P. pachyrhizi pre-infection structures including germ-tubes and appressoria, and also gene expression related to these formations, such as chitin synthases (CHSs), were significantly suppressed in CNF-treated soybean leaves compared to control leaves. Moreover, contact angle measurement revealed that CNF converts soybean leaf surface properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. These results suggest that CNF can change soybean leaf surface hydrophobicity, conferring resistance against P. pachyrhizi, based on the reduced expression of CHSs, as well as reduced formation of pre-infection structures. This is the first study to investigate CNF application to control field disease.",

AlphaCryo4D integrates 3D deep residual learning with manifold embedding of energy landscapes, which simultaneously improves 3D classification accuracy and reconstruction resolution via an energy-based particle-voting algorithm. Applications of this methodology to six experimental datasets demonstrated its generality in breaking resolution barrier of visualizing dynamic components of functional complexes, in choreographing continuous inter-subunit motions and in exploring their  hidden conformational space. Importantly, AlphaCryo4D identified 64 conformers of the substrate-bound human 26S proteasome and reconstituted single-nucleotide-exchange dynamics of proteasomal AAA-ATPase motor during translocation initiation, which together illuminates a grand hierarchical allostery for proteasome autoregulation.",

    "abstract": "Plant root development is a complex spatial-temporal process that originates in the root apical meristem (RAM). To shape the organs structure signaling between the different cells and cell files must be highly coordinated. Thereby, diverging kinetics of chromatin remodeling and cell growth in these files need to be integrated and balanced by differential cell growth and local differences in cell proliferation frequency. Understanding the local differences in cell cycle duration in the RAM and its correlation with chromatin organization is crucial to build a holistic view on the different regulatory processes and requires a quantitative estimation of the chromatin geometry and underlying mitotic cell cycle phases timing at every cell file and every position. Unfortunately, so far precise methods for such analysis are missing.\n\nThis study presents a robust and straightforward pipeline to determine in parallel the duration of cell cycles key stages in all cell layers of a plants root and their nuclei organization. The methods combine marker-free techniques based on the detection of the nucleus, deep analysis of the chromatin phase transition, incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and mitosis with a deep-resolution plant phenotyping platform to analyze all key cell cycle events kinetics.\n\nIn the Arabidopsis thaliana L. RAM S-phase duration was found to be as short as 20-30 minutes in all cell files. The subsequent G2-phase duration however depends on the cell type/position and varies from 3.5 hours in the pericycle to more than 4.5 hours in the epidermis. Overall, S+G2+M duration in Arabidopsis under our condition is 4 hours in the pericycle and up to 5.5 hours in the epidermis.\n\nEndocycle duration was determined as the time required to achieve 100% EdU index in the transition zone and estimated to be in the range of 3-4 hours.\n\nBesides Arabidopsis, we show that the presented technique is applicable also to root tips of other dicot and monocot plants (tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).",

    "abstract": "PTPRT (receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase T), as a brain-specific type 1 transmembrane protein, plays an important function in neurodevelopment and synapse formation. However, whether PTPRT-dependent signaling is involved in Alzheimers disease (AD) remains elusive. Here, we identified that PTPRT intracellular domain (PICD), which was released from ADAM10- and presenilin 1-/{gamma}-secretase-dependent cleavage of PTPRT, efficiently translocated to the nucleus via a conserved nuclear localization signal. Inhibition of nuclear localization of PICD via the mutation of its nuclear localization signal (NLS) leads to accumulation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3), which is a substrate of PTPRT and eventually resulted in neuronal cell death. Consistently, RNA sequencing reveals that expression of the PICD alone can profoundly alter the expression of genes associated with synapse function and dephosphorylation, phosphatase and cell adhesion. Unexpectedly, the downregulated levels of Ptprt mRNA and protein were found in both human and mouse AD brains. Finally, overexpression of PICD alone not only significantly decreases the level of phosph-STAT3Y705 and A{beta} deposition in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, but also improves synaptic function and behavioral deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings suggest that a novel role of the ADAM 10- and presenilin 1-/{gamma}-secretase-dependent cleavage of PTPRT in the events can mitigate neurodegeneration of AD and moderate Alzheimers pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure and dynamics can be probed using X-ray crystallography. Whereas the Bragg peaks are only sensitive to the average unit-cell electron density, the signal between the Bragg peaks -- diffuse scattering -- is sensitive to spatial correlations in electron-density variations. Although diffuse scattering contains valuable information about protein dynamics, the diffuse signal is more difficult to isolate from the background compared to the Bragg signal, and the reproducibility of diffuse signal is not yet well understood. We present a systematic study of the reproducibility of diffuse scattering from isocyanide hydratase (ICH) in three different protein forms. Both replicate diffuse datasets and datasets obtained from different mutants were similar in pairwise comparisons (Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) [&ge;]0.8). The data were processed in a manner inspired by previously published methods using custom software with modular design, enabling us to perform an analysis of various data processing choices to determine how to obtain the highest quality data as assessed using unbiased measures of symmetry and reproducibility. The diffuse data then were used to characterize atomic mobility using a liquid-like motions (LLM) model. This characterization was able to discriminate between distinct anisotropic atomic displacement parameter (ADP) models arising from different anisotropic scaling choices that agreed comparably with the Bragg data. Our results emphasize the importance of data reproducibility as a model-free measure of diffuse data quality, illustrate the ability of LLM analysis of diffuse scattering to select among alternative ADP models, and offer insights into the design of successful diffuse scattering experiments.",

Our DLearnMS framework learns the clinical state of LC-MS data instances using convolutional neural networks.

This enables detecting discriminating regions of the data and the design of more robust networks. One of the main advantages over other established methods is that no explicit preprocessing step is needed in our DLearnMS framework.\n\nOur evaluation shows that DLearnMS outperforms conventional LC-MS biomarker detection approaches in identifying fewer false positive peaks while maintaining a comparable amount of true positives peaks.\n\nCode availabilityThe code is available from the following GIT repository: https://github.com/SaharIravani/DlearnMS",

Considering the numerous homologous genes across the human and mouse genomes, misalignment errors should be evaluated, and a new algorithm is required. We assessed the extents and effects of misalignment errors when using human and mouse combined reference data and developed a new bioinformatics pipeline with expression-based species deconvolution to minimize errors. We also evaluated false-positive signals for a species presumed to originate from ambient RNA of the other species and applied a computational method to remove them. Misaligned reads account for an average of 0.5% of total reads, but such reads were concentrated to few genes that were greatly affected. Human and mouse mixed single-cell data, analyzed using our pipeline, clustered well with unmixed data and showed higher k-nearest-neighbor batch effect test and Local Inverse Simpsons Index scores than those derived from Cell Ranger. We also applied our pipeline to multispecies multisample single-cell library containing breast cancer xenograft tissue and successfully identified all samples using genomic array and expression. Moreover, diverse cell types in the tumor microenvironment were well captured.

We detected more than 70 ARGs, out of which rpoB mutants conferring resistance to rifampicin, tet(W/N/W) and potentially extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) coding TEM-116 were the most common. Numerous ARGs were associated with integrated mobile genetic elements, plasmids or phages promoting the HGT. Our findings raise clinical and public health concerns as the consumption of probiotic products may lead to the transfer of ARGs to human gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Many cell regulatory systems implicate nonlinearity and redundancy among components. The regulatory network governing lamellipodial and lamellar actin structures is prototypical of such a system, containing tens of actin-nucleating and -modulating molecules with functional overlap and feedback loops. Due to instantaneous and long-term compensation, phenotyping the system response to perturbation provides limited information on the roles the targeted component plays in the unperturbed system. Accordingly, how individual actin regulators contribute to lamellipodial dynamics remains ambiguous. Here, we present a perturbation-free reconstruction of cause-effect relations among actin regulators by applying Granger-causal inference to constitutive image fluctuations that indicate regulator recruitment as a proxy for activity. Our analysis identifies distinct zones of actin regulator activation and of causal effects on filament assembly and delineates actin-dependent and actin-independent regulator roles in controlling edge motion. We propose that edge motion is driven by assembly of two independently operating actin filament systems.

    "abstract": "DRD2 is a neuronal cell surface protein involved in brain development and function. Variations in the Drd2 gene have clinical significance since DRD2 is a pharmacotherapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia. Despite numerous studies on the disease association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intronic regions, investigation into the coding regions is surprisingly limited. In this study, we aimed at identifying potential functionally and pharmaco-therapeutically deleterious non-synonymous SNPs of Drd2. A wide array of bioinformatics tools was used to evaluate the impact of nsSNPs on protein structure and functionality. Out of 260 nsSNPs retrieved from the dbSNP database, initially 9 were predicted as deleterious by 15 tools. Upon further assessment of their domain association, conservation profile, homology models and inter-atomic interaction, the mutant F389V was considered as the most impactful. In-depth analysis of F389V through Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation revealed a decline in affinity for its native agonist dopamine and an increase in affinity for the antipsychotic drug risperidone. Remarkable alterations in binding interactions and stability of the protein-ligand complex in simulated physiological conditions were also noted. These findings will improve our understanding of the consequence of nsSNPs in disease-susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTargeted therapies seek to selectively eliminate a pathogen without disrupting the resident microbial community. This is even more important when a pathogen like H. pylori resides in stomach, a sensitive microbial ecosystem. Using a probiotic like Lactococcus lactis and bioengineering it to release a guided Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) targeted towards the pathogen offers a pathway to specifically knock-out the deleterious species and not disturbing the stomach microbiome.\n\nResultsThree AMPs, Alyteserin, CRAMP and Laterosporulin, were genetically fused to a guiding peptide MM1, which selectively binds to Vacuolating Toxin A (VacA) of H. pylori and cloned into an excretory vector pTKR inside L. lactis. When cultured together in vitro, the L. lactis bioengineered with guided AMPs selectively killed H. pylori when compared to E. coli or Lactobacillus plantarum, as determined by qPCR. Chemically synthesized Alyteserin and MM1-Alyteserin showed similar preferential inhibition of H. pylori when compared against E. coli, with the MIC of MM1-Alyteserin becoming significantly higher for E. coli than Alytserin whereas no such effet was observed against H. pylori.\n\nConclusionsProbiotics bioengineered to excrete guided AMPs can be a novel and useful approach for combating pathogens without endangering the natural microbial flora. Given the wealth of AMPs and guiding ligands, both natural and synthetic, this approach can be adapted to develop a diverse array of chimeric guided AMPs and can be cloned into probiotics to create a safe and effective alternative to conventional chemical antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) lies at the interface between perceptual and memory networks in the brain and mediates between these, although it is not yet known how. It has two distinct subregions, granular (gRSC) and dysgranular (dRSC). The present study investigated how these subregions differ with respect to their electrophysiology and connections, as a step towards understanding their functions. gRSC is more closely connected to the hippocampal system, in which theta-band local field potential oscillations are prominent. We therefore compared theta-rhythmic single-unit activity between the two RSC subregions and found, mostly in gRSC, a subpopulation of non-directional cells with spiking activity strongly entrained by theta oscillations, suggesting a stronger coupling of gRSC to the hippocampal system. We then used retrograde tracers to examine whether differences in neural coding between RSC subregions might reflect differential inputs from the anterior thalamus, which is a prominent source of RSC afferents. We found that gRSC and dRSC differ in their afferents from two AV subfields: dorsomedial (AVDM) and ventrolateral (AVVL). AVVL targets both gRSC and dRSC, while AVDM provides a selective projection to gRSC. These combined results suggest the existence of two distinct but interacting RSC subcircuits: one connecting AVDM to gRSC that may comprise part of the cognitive hippocampal system, and the other connecting AVVL to both RSC regions that may link hippocampal and perceptual regions. We suggest that these subcircuits are distinct to allow for differential weighting during integration of converging sensory and cognitive computations: an integration that may take place in thalamus, RSC or both.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe two retrosplenial cortex subregions, gRSC and dRSC, differ in their temporal firing characteristics and relation to theta oscillations.\nC_LIO_LIThere are differential afferents from the anteroventral thalamic nucleus to gRSC and dRSC, with the dorsomedial subnucleus projecting selectively to gRSC.\nC_LIO_LIThe anteroventral thalamus-retrosplenial cortex circuitry thus comprises two functionally and anatomically distinct but connected circuits, differentially connected to the hippocampal system, that may support the integration of cognitive and perceptual information.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial damage triggers cell death signaling with catastrophic consequences in long-lived and irreplaceable cells, such as cardiac myocytes. Sensing of leaked mitochondrial DNA upon mitochondrial damage is also a potent trigger of inflammation. Whether the innate immune response pathways monitor mitochondrial damage in mitochondria-rich cardiac myocytes to prevent inflammation and cell death, remains unknown. TRAF2, an adaptor protein downstream of innate immune receptors, localizes to the mitochondria in the unstressed heart, with increased mitochondrial targeting in cardiomyopathic human hearts and after cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Inducible cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of TRAF2 in young adult mice impairs mitophagy with rapid decline in mitochondrial quality, upregulates TLR9 expression in cardiac myocytes, and results in inflammation and cell death manifesting as a fulminant cardiomyopathy. Preventing TLR9-mediated mitochondrial DNA sensing and resultant inflammation provides a short-term reprieve from cardiomyopathy, but persistence of damaged mitochondria results in long-term recrudescence. Restoration of wild-type TRAF2, but not the E3 ubiquitin ligase deficient mutant, improves mitochondrial quality and rescues cardiomyopathy to restore homeostasis. Thus, the innate immune response acts via TRAF2 as the first line of defense against mitochondrial damage by orchestrating homeostatic mitophagy to dampen myocardial inflammation and prevent cell death.",

    "abstract": "During development, neural stem cells are temporally patterned to sequentially generate a variety of neural types before exiting the cell cycle. Temporal patterning is well-studied in Drosophila, where neural stem cells called neuroblasts sequentially express cascades of Temporal Transcription Factors (TTFs) to control the birth-order dependent neural specification. However, currently known TTFs were mostly identified through candidate approaches and may not be complete. In addition, many fundamental questions remain concerning the TTF cascade initiation, progression, and termination. It is also not known why temporal progression only happens in neuroblasts but not in their differentiated progeny. In this work, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of Drosophila medulla neuroblasts of all ages to study the temporal patterning process with single-cell resolution. Our scRNA-seq data revealed that sets of genes involved in different biological processes show high to low or low to high gradients as neuroblasts age. We also identified a list of novel TTFs, and experimentally characterized their roles in the temporal progression and neural fate specification. Our study revealed a comprehensive temporal gene network that patterns medulla neuroblasts from start to end. Furthermore, we found that the progression and termination of this temporal cascade also require transcription factors differentially expressed along the differentiation axis (neuroblasts -> -> neurons). Lola proteins function as a speed modulator of temporal progression in neuroblasts; while Nerfin-1, a factor required to suppress de-differentiation in post-mitotic neurons, acts at the final temporal stage together with the last TTF of the cascade, to promote the switch to gliogenesis and the cell cycle exit. Our comprehensive study of the medulla neuroblast temporal cascade illustrated mechanisms that might be conserved in the temporal patterning of neural stem cells.",

We show that neuronal and fibroblast membranes deflect about 150 nm upon ultrasound stimulation. Next, we develop a biomechanical model that predicts changes in membrane voltage after ultrasound exposure. Finally, we validate our model predictions using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology on primary neurons. Collectively, we show that ultrasound stimulation directly defects the neuronal membrane leading to a change in membrane voltage and subsequent depolarization. Our model is consistent with existing data and provides a mechanism for both ultrasound-evoked neurostimulation and sonogenetic control.",

Due to the large number of possible evolutionary relationships between clones and the fundamental uncertainty of the mutational composition of subclones, elucidating the most probable evolutionary relationships poses statistical and computational challenges. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model called PICTograph to model uncertainty in the assignment of mutations to subclones and an approach to reduce the space of possible graphical models that postulate their evolutionary origin. Compared to available methods, our approach provided more consistent and accurate estimates of cancer cell fractions and better tree topology reconstruction over a range of simulated clonal diversity. Application of PICTograph to whole exome sequencing data of individuals with pancreatic cancer precursor lesions confirmed known early occurring mutations and indicated substantial molecular diversity, including multiple distinct subclones (range 6 - 12) and intra-sample mixing of subclones. As the complete evolutionary history for some patients was not identifiable, we used ensemble-based visualizations to distinguish between highly probable evolutionary relationships recovered in multiple models from uncertain relationships occurring in a small subset of models. These analyses indicate that PICTograph provides a useful approximation to evolutionary inference, particularly when the evolutionary course of a patients cancer is complex.",

    "abstract": "Single cell SNV analysis is an emerging and promising strategy to connect cell-level genetic variation to cell phenotypes. At the present, SNV detection from 10x Genomics scRNA-seq data is typically performed on the pooled sequencing reads across all cells in a sample. Here, we assess the gain of information of SNV assessments from individual cell scRNA-seq data, where the alignments are split by barcode prior to the variant call. For our analyses we use publicly available sequencing data on the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 cell line generated at consequent time-points during anti-cancer treatment. We analyzed SNV calls by three popular variant callers - GATK, Strelka2 and Mu-tect2, in combination with a method for cell-level tabulation of the sequencing read counts bearing SNV alleles - SCReadCounts. Our analysis shows that variant calls on individual cell alignments identify at least two-fold higher number of SNVs as compared to the pooled scRNA-seq. We demonstrate that scSNVs exclusively called in the single cell alignments (scSNVs) are substantially enriched in novel genetic variants and in coding functional annotations, in particular, stop-codon and missense substitutions. Furthermore, we find that the expression of some scSNVs correlates with the expression of their harbouring gene (cis-scReQTLs).\n\nOverall, our study indicates an immense potential of SNV calls from individual cell scRNA-seq data and emphasizes on the need of cell-level variant detection approaches and tools. Given the growing accumulation of scRNA-seq datasets, cell-level variant assessments are likely to significantly contribute to the understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and the relationship between genetics variants and functional phenotypes. In addition, cell-level variant assessments from scRNA-seq can be highly informative in cancer where they can help elucidate somatic mutations evolution and functionality.",

    "abstract": "The relative contribution of selection and neutrality in shaping species genetic diversity is one of the most central and controversial questions in evolutionary theory. Genomic data provide growing evidence that linked selection, i.e. the modification of genetic diversity at neutral sites through linkage with selected sites, might be pervasive over the genome. Several studies proposed that linked selection could be modelled as first approximation by a local reduction (e.g. purifying selection, selective sweeps) or increase (e.g. balancing selection) of effective population size (Ne). At the genome-wide scale, this leads to variations of Ne from one region to another, reflecting the heterogeneity of selective constraints and recombination rates between regions. We investigate here the consequences of such genomic variations of Ne on the genome-wide distribution of coalescence times. The underlying motivation concerns the impact of linked selection on demographic inference, because the distribution of coalescence times is at the heart of several important demographic inference approaches. Using the concept of Inverse Instantaneous Coalescence Rate, we demonstrate that in a panmictic population, linked selection always results in a spurious apparent decrease of Ne along time. Balancing selection has a particularly large effect, even when it concerns a very small part of the genome. We also study more general models including genuine population size changes, population structure or transient selection and find that the effect of linked selection can be significantly reduced by that of population structure. The models and conclusions presented here are also relevant to the study of other biological processes generating apparent variations of Ne along the genome.",

To avoid complications associated with immune suppression and to protect transplanted ovarian allografts from immune-mediated injury, we have developed an immuno-isolating hydrogel-based capsule that supports the function of ovarian allografts without triggering an immune response. Encapsulated ovarian allografts implanted in naive ovariectomized BALB/c mice responded to the circulating gonadotropins without direct revascularization and maintained function for 4 months, as evident by regular estrous cycles and presence of antral follicles in the retrieved grafts. Repeated implantations of encapsulated mouse ovarian allografts did not sensitize naive BALB/c mice in contrast to non-encapsulated controls, which was confirmed with undetectable levels of allo-antibody. Further, encapsulated allografts implanted in hosts previously sensitized by implantation of non-encapsulated allografts restored estrous cycles similarly to our results in naive recipients. Next, we tested the translational potential and efficiency of the immune-isolating capsule in a rhesus monkey model by implanting encapsulated ovarian auto- and allografts in young ovariectomized animals. The encapsulated ovarian grafts survived and restored basal levels of urinary estrone conjugate and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide during the approximate 4-5 month observation period. We demonstrate, for the first time, that encapsulation of ovarian allografts prevents sensitization and protects the allograft from rejection in young rhesus monkeys and in sensitized mice.",

    "abstract": "Infections disrupt host metabolism, but the factors that dictate the nature and magnitude of metabolic change are incompletely characterized. To determine how host metabolism changes in relation to disease severity in murine malaria, we performed plasma metabolomics on eight Plasmodium chabaudi-infected mouse strains with diverse disease phenotypes. We identified plasma metabolic biomarkers for both the nature and severity of different malarial pathologies. A subset of metabolic changes, including plasma arginine depletion, match the plasma metabolomes of human malaria patients, suggesting new connections between pathology and metabolism in human malaria. In our malarial mice, liver damage, which releases hepatic arginase-1 (Arg1) into circulation, correlated with plasma arginine depletion. We confirmed that hepatic Arg1 was the primary source of increased plasma arginase activity in our model, which motivates further investigation of liver damage in human malaria patients. More broadly, our approach shows how leveraging phenotypic diversity can identify and validate relationships between metabolism and the pathophysiology of infectious disease.\n\nImportanceMalaria is a severe and sometimes fatal infectious disease endemic to tropical and subtropical regions. Effective vaccines against malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites remain elusive, and malaria treatments often fail to prevent severe disease. Small molecules that target host metabolism have recently emerged as candidates for therapeutics in malaria and other diseases. However, our limited understanding of how metabolites affect pathophysiology limits our ability to develop new metabolite therapies. By providing a rich dataset of metabolite-pathology correlations, and by validating one of those correlations, our work is an important step toward harnessing metabolism to mitigate disease. Specifically, we showed that liver damage in P. chabaudi-infected mice releases hepatic arginase-1 into circulation, where it may deplete plasma arginine, a candidate malaria therapeutic that mitigates vascular stress. Our data suggest that liver damage may confound efforts to increase levels of arginine in human malaria patients.",

And yet, definitive therapies or preventive measures are not present.\n\nPurposeHerbal medicines have been a source of various antiviral compounds. An accelerated repurposing potential of antiviral herbs can provide usable drugs and identify druggable targets. In this study, we dissect the anti-coronavirus activity of Cissampelos pareira L (Cipa). using an integrative approach.\n\nMethodsWe analysed the signature similarities between predicted antiviral agents and Cipa using the connectivity map (https://clue.io/). Next, we tested the anti-SARS-COV-2 activity of Cipa in vitro. A three-way comparative analysis of Cipa transcriptome, COVID-19 BALF transcriptome and CMAP signatures of small compounds was also performed.\n\nResultsSeveral predicted antivirals showed a high positive connectivity score with Cipa such as apcidin, emetine, homoharringtonine etc. We also observed 98% inhibition of SARS-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. Some of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. Comparison of genes between BALF and Cipa showed an enrichment of biological processes like transcription regulation and response to lipids, to be downregulated in Cipa while being upregulated in COVID-19. CMAP also showed that Triciribine, torin-1 and VU-0365114-2 had positive connectivity with BALF 1 and 2, and negative connectivity with Cipa.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional reporters are reliable and time-tested tools to study gene regulation. In Staphylococcus aureus, {beta}-galactosidase (lacZ)-based genetic screens are not widely used because of the necessity of selectable markers for strain construction and the production of staphyloxanthin pigment which obfuscates results. We describe a series of vectors that allow for markerless insertion of codon-optimized lacZ-based transcriptional reporters. The vectors encode for different ribosomal binding sites allowing for tailored lacZ expression. A {Delta}crtM::kanR deletion insertion mutant was constructed that prevents the synthesis of staphyloxanthin, thereby permitting blue-white screening without the interference of carotenoid production. We demonstrate the utility of these vectors to monitor aerobic and anaerobic transcriptional activity. For the latter, we describe the use of a ferrocyanide-ferricyanide redox system (Fe(CN)63-/4-) permitting blue-white screening in the absence of oxygen. We also describe additional reporter systems and methods for monitoring transcriptional activity during anaerobic culture including a FAD-binding fluorescent protein (EcFbFP), alpha-hemolysin (hla), or lipase (geh). The systems and methods described are compatible with vectors utilized to create and screen high-density transposon mutant libraries.\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen and a leading cause of infectious disease-related illness and death worldwide. For S. aureus to successfully colonize and invade host tissues, it must tightly control the expression of genes encoding for virulence factors. Oxygen tension varies greatly at infection sites and many abscesses are devoid of oxygen. In this study, we have developed novel tools and methods to study how and when S. aureus alters transcription of genes. A key advantage to these methods and tools is that they can be utilized in the presence and absence of oxygen. A better understanding of anaerobic gene expression in S. aureus will provide important insight into the regulation of genes in low oxygen environments.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic strategies against systemic mycoses can involve antifungal resistance and significant toxicity. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches to fight fungal infections are urgent. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising tools to fight systemic mycoses. In this study, mAbs of the IgM isotype were developed against chitin oligomers. Chitooligomers derive from chitin, an essential component of the fungal cell wall and a promising therapeutic target, as it is not synthesized by humans or animals. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and cell-binding tests showed that the mAbs recognizing chitooligomers have high affinity and specificity for the chitin derivatives. In vitro tests showed that the chitooligomer mAbs increased the fungicidal capacity of amphotericin B against Cryptococcus neoformans. The chitooligomer-binding mAbs interfered with two essential properties related to cryptococcal pathogenesis: biofilm formation and melanin production. In a murine model of C. neoformans infection, the combined administration of the chitooligomer-binding mAb and subinhibitory doses of amphotericin B promoted disease control. The data obtained in this study support the hypothesis that chitooligomer antibodies are of great potential as accessory tools in the control of cryptococcosis.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing public health emergency of international concern. While a lot of efforts are being invested in vaccinating the population, there is also an emergent requirement to find potential therapeutics to effectively counter this fast mutating SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced pathogenicity. Virus-infected host cells switch their metabolism to a more glycolytic phenotype. This switch induced by the virus is needed for faster production of ATP and higher levels of anabolic intermediates, required for new virion synthesis and packaging. In this study, we used 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) to target and inhibit the metabolic reprogramming induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results showed that virus infection induces glucose influx and glycolysis resulting in selective high accumulation of the fluorescent glucose/2-DG analogue, 2-NBDG in these cells. Subsequently, 2-DG inhibits glycolysis in infected cells thereby reducing the virus multiplication and alleviates the cells from virus induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death. Herein, we demonstrate that the crucial Nglycosites (N331 and N343) of RBD in spike protein of progeny virions produced from 2-DG treated cells were found unglycosylated and defective with compromised infectivity potential. In line with earlier reported observations, our study also showed that 2-DG mediated metabolic inhibiton can attenuate SARS-COV-2 multiplication. In addition, mechanistic study revealed that the inhibition of SARS-COV-2 multiplication is attributed to 2-DG induced un-glycosylation of spike protein. Our findings strengthen the notion that 2-DG effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 multiplication. Therefore, based on its previous human trials in different types of Cancer and Herpes patients, it could be a potential molecule to study in COVID-19 patients.",

Here we produce the first Canadian human footprint map to identify intact and modified lands and ecosystems.

However, some ecosystems are experiencing very high pressure, such as the Great Lakes Plains and Prairies national ecological areas which have over 75% and 56% of their areas, respectively, with a high human footprint. In contrast, the Arctic and Northern Mountains have less than 0.02% and 0.2% under high human footprint. A validation of the final map resulted in a Cohen Kappa statistic of 0.911, signifying an  almost perfect agreement between the human footprint and the validation data set. By increasing the number and accuracy of mapped pressures, our map demonstrates much more widespread pressures in Canada than were indicated by previous global mapping efforts, demonstrating the value in specific national data applications. Ecological areas with immense anthropogenic pressure, highlight challenges that may arise when planning for ecologically representative protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Signal transduction is essential for bacteria to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Among many forms of post-translational modifications, reversible protein phosphorylation has evolved as a ubiquitous molecular mechanism of protein regulation in response to specific stimuli. The Ser/Thr protein kinase PknG modulates the fate of intracellular glutamate by controlling the phosphorylation status of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase regulator OdhI, a function that is conserved among diverse actinobacteria. PknG has a modular organization characterized by the presence of regulatory domains surrounding the catalytic domain. Here we present an investigation through in vivo experiments as well as biochemical and structural methods of the molecular bases of the regulation of PknG from C. glutamicum (CgPknG), in the light of previous knowledge available for the kinase from M. tuberculosis (MtbPknG). We found that OdhI phosphorylation by CgPknG is regulated by a conserved mechanism that depends on a C-terminal domain composed of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) essential for metabolic homeostasis. Furthermore, we identified a conserved structural motif that physically connects the TPR domain and a flexible N-terminal extension of the kinase that is involved in docking interactions with OdhI. Based on our results and previous reports, we propose a model in which the TPR domain of PknG couples signal detection to the specific phosphorylation of OdhI. Overall, the available data indicate that conserved PknG domains in distant actinobacteria retain their roles in kinase regulation in response to nutrient availability.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria control the metabolic processes by which they obtain nutrients and energy in order to adapt to the environment. In this way, the metabolic characteristics of a microorganism determine its ecological role and its usefulness in industrial processes. Here, we use genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches to study a key component in a system that regulates glutamate production in C. glutamicum, a species that is used for the industrial production of amino acids. We elucidated molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic control in C. glutamicum, which are conserved in related pathogenic bacteria. The findings have broader significance for diverse actinobacteria, including microorganisms that cause disease as well as environmental species used to produce billions of dollars of amino acids and antibiotics every year.",

    "abstract": "Choice selection strategies and decision making are typically investigated using multiple-choice gambling paradigms that require participants to maximize reward payoff. However, research shows that performance in such paradigms suffers from individual biases towards the frequency of gains to choose smaller local gains over larger longer term gain, also referred to as melioration. Here, we developed a simple two-choice reward task, implemented in 186 healthy human adult subjects across the adult lifespan to understand the behavioral, computational, and neural bases of payoff maximization versus melioration. The observed reward choice behavior on this task was best explained by a reinforcement learning model of differential future reward prediction. Simultaneously recorded and source-localized electroencephalography (EEG) showed that diminished theta-band activations in the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) correspond to greater reward payoff maximization, specifically during the presentation of cumulative reward information at the end of each task trial. Notably, these activations (greater rACC theta) predicted depressed mood symptoms, thereby showcasing a reward processing marker of potential clinical utility.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study presents cognitive, computational and neural (EEG-based) analyses of a rapid reward-based decision-making task. The research has the following three highlights. 1) It teases apart two core aspects of reward processing, i.e. long term expected value maximization versus immediate gain frequency melioration based choice behavior. 2) It models reinforcement learning based behavioral differences between individuals showing that observed performance is best explained by differential extents of reward prediction. 3) It investigates neural correlates in 186 healthy human subjects across the adult lifespan, revealing specific theta band cortical source activations in right rostral anterior cingulate as correlates for maximization that further predict depressed mood across subjects.",

Here, we show that this complexity reduction is caused by synchronous neuronal OFF-periods. We analyse in-vivo recordings from neocortical neuronal populations, finding that OFF-periods in SWS trap cortical dynamics, making the population activity more recurrent, deterministic, and less chaotic than during REM sleep or Wakefulness. Importantly, when we exclude OFF-periods, SWS becomes indistinguishable from Wakefulness or REM sleep. In fact, we show that spiking activity for all states has a universal scaling compatible with critical phenomena. We complement these results by a critical branching model that replicates our experimental findings, where we show that forcing OFF-periods to a percentage of neurons suffices to generate a decrease in complexity that replicates SWS.",

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate with each other by sending action potentials through their axons. The velocity of axonal signal propagation describes how fast electrical action potentials can travel, and can be affected in a human brain by several pathologies, including multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and channelopathies. High-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) provide unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution to extracellularly record neural electrical activity. The high density of the recording electrodes enables to image the activity of individual neurons down to subcellular resolution, which includes the propagation of axonal signals. However, axon recon-struction, to date, mainly relies on a manual approach to select the electrodes and channels that seemingly record the signals along a specific axon, while an automated approach to track multiple axonal branches in extracellular action-potential recordings is still missing.\n\nIn this article, we propose a fully automated approach to reconstruct axons from extracellular electrical-potential landscapes, so-called \"electrical footprints\" of neurons. After an initial electrode and channel selection, the proposed method first constructs a graph, based on the voltage signal amplitudes and latencies. Then, the graph is interrogated to extract possible axonal branches. Finally, the axonal branches are pruned and axonal action-potential propagation velocities are computed.\n\nWe first validate our method using simulated data from detailed reconstructions of neurons, showing that our approach is capable of accurately reconstructing axonal branches. We then apply the reconstruction algorithm to experimental recordings of HD-MEAs and show that it can be used to determine axonal morphologies and signal-propagation velocities at high throughput.\n\nWe introduce a fully automated method to reconstruct axonal branches and estimate axonal action-potential propagation velocities using HD-MEA recordings. Our method yields highly reliable and reproducible velocity estimations, which constitute an important electrophysiological feature of neuronal preparations.",

    "abstract": "Brain maps, or atlases, are essential tools for studying brain function and organization. The abundance of available atlases used across the neuroscience literature, however, creates an implicit challenge that may alter the hypotheses and predictions we make about neurological function and pathophysiology. Here, we demonstrate how parcellation scale, shape, anatomical coverage, and other atlas features may impact our prediction of the brains function from its underlying structure. We show how network topology, structure-function correlation (SFC), and the power to test specific hypotheses about epilepsy pathophysiology may change as a result of atlas choice and atlas features. Through the lens of our disease system, we propose a general framework and algorithm for atlas selection. This framework aims to maximize the descriptive, explanatory, and predictive validity of an atlas. Broadly, our framework strives to provide empirical guidance to neuroscience research utilizing the various atlases published over the last century.",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses a unique Acetyl-CoA Synthetase (PfACS) which provides acetyl moieties for different metabolic and regulatory cellular pathways. We characterized PfACS and studied its role focusing on epigenetic modifications using the var gene family as reporter genes. For this, mutant lines to modulate plasmodial ACS expression by degron-mediated protein degradation or ribozyme induced transcript decay were created. Additionally, an ACS inhibitor was tested for its effectiveness and specificity in interfering with PfACS. The knockdown of PfACS or its inhibition led to impaired parasite growth. Decreased levels of PfACS also led to differential histone acetylation patterns, altered variant gene expression and concomitantly decreased cytoadherence of infected red blood cells containing knocked-down parasites. Further, ChIP analysis revealed the presence of PfACS in many loci in ring stage parasites, underscoring its involvement in the regulation of chromatin. Due to its significant differences to human ACS, PfACS seems an interesting target for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Increased microbial activity in high-latitude soils due to climate change might lead to higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, mechanisms of microbial GHG production and consumption in tundra soils are not thoroughly understood. We analyzed 116 soil metatranscriptomes from 73 sites in the Finnish sub-Arctic to investigate how the diversity and functional potential of bacterial and archaeal communities vary across vegetation types and soil layers. Soils differed in physicochemical conditions, with meadow soils being characterized by higher pH and low soil organic matter (SOM) and carbon/nitrogen ratio whereas dwarf shrub-dominated ecosystems with high SOM and low pH. Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Planctomycetes predominated all communities but there were significant differences on genus level between vegetation types, as plant polymer degrading groups were more active in shrub-dominated soils compared to meadows. Given that climate change scenarios predict expansion in dwarf shrubs at high latitudes, our results indicate that the rate of carbon turnover in tundra soils may increase in the future. Additionally, transcripts of methanotrophs were detected in the mineral layer of all soils, potentially moderating methane fluxes from deeper layers. In all, this study provides new insights into possible shifts in tundra microbial diversity and activity with climate change.",

    "abstract": "In selective RNA processing and stabilization (SRPS) operons, the stoichiometry of encoded proteins is determined by their respective 3-end stem-loops (SLs), yet the evolution of this mechanism remains elusive. In cellulosomal operons of Clostridium spp., we show that the SLs and their associated genes form a monogamy companionship during the operon evolution. Based on {Delta}G of such SLs, we propose CoSLOE (Composite SL-based Operon Evolution) model with evolutionary ratio (ER) >1 or <1 for positive or negative selection of SRPS operons. In the composite SL-{Delta}G-based tree (CoSL-tree) of cellulosomal operons, when traversing from leafs to the root nodes, ERs reveal diversifying/positive selection towards a less efficient cellulosomal system, consistent with glycoside-hydrolase gene variation both in-operon and genome-wide. A similar pattern is followed by the ATPase operon and the majority of orthologous SRPS operons genome-wide, suggesting conservation among operons in such selection. Thus SRPS operons via their transcript-stabilizing non-coding elements are highlighting a link between operon stoichiometry and operon evolution.",

Of eight major behavioural traits related to exploration and activity in a novel arena, four were significantly altered by life in captivity. While the startle response upon introduction into the arena and overall swimming away from the walls increased after captivity, inactivity exhibited immediately after the startle and the reaction to an external disturbance decreased. We also observed behavioural syndromes between  startle responses and  horizontal wall following, and between  overall activity and  vertical wall following; however, these behavioural syndromes were not altered by maintenance in captivity. Interestingly, this blind-eel failed to learn a simple spatial task in a Y-maze apparatus. Captive-associated behavioural changes in R. digressus may influence their survival after reintroduction into natural habitats, and such changes must be taken into account while developing protocols for ex-situ conservation and subsequent release.",

    "abstract": "Standard chemotherapy for primary and secondary bone tumors typically involves systemic administration of chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX). However, non-targeted delivery increases dose requirements, and results in off-target toxicity and suboptimal chemotherapeutic efficacy. When chemotherapy is ineffective, substantial resection of tissue and/or total amputation become necessary - a debilitating outcome for any patient. In this work, we developed a proof-of-concept, non-biodegradable, mechanically robust, and refillable composite system for chemotherapeutic (i.e. DOX) delivery comprised of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement and insoluble polymeric {gamma}-cyclodextrin ({gamma}-CD) microparticles. The porosity and compressive strength of DOX-filled PMMA composites were characterized. DOX filling capacity, elution kinetics, cytotoxicity against primary osteosarcoma and lung cancer cells, and refilling capacity of composites were evaluated. PMMA composites containing up to 15wt% {gamma}-CD microparticles provided consistent, therapeutically-relevant release of DOX with ~100% of the initial DOX released after 100 days. Over the same period, only ~6% of DOX was liberated from PMMA with free DOX. Following prolonged curing, PMMA composites with up to 15wt% {gamma}-CD surpassed compressive strength requirements outlined by international standards for acrylic bone cements. Compared to DOX-filled PMMA, DOX-filled PMMA/{gamma}-CD composites provided long-term release with decreased burst effect, correlating to long-term cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Refillable properties demonstrated by the PMMA composite system may find utility for treating local recurrences, limiting chemoresistance, and altering drug combinations to provide customized treatment regimens. Overall, findings suggest that PMMA composites have the potential to serve as a platform for the delivery of combinatorial chemotherapeutics to treat bone tumors.",

Specifically, the discriminative power of individual amino acids is revisited, simulating additional proteolytic agents. These simulations show allowing missed cleavages generally increases the discriminative power of the amino acids in the proteolytic motif. Additional simulations show the effect of non-ideal conditions modelled on the number of proteins lacking proteotypic reads is very small, and that the average number of proteotypic reads per protein follow the same rule on the performance of the optimal choice of labeled amino acids as the number of distinguishable proteins in NeXtProt. The goal of this paper is to expand prior results and continue the scientific discussion on the possibilities of future proteomics technologies.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing of a diverse array of arthropod genomes is already underway and these genomes will be used to study human health, agriculture, biodiversity and ecology. These new genomes are intended to serve as community resources and provide the foundational information that is required to apply  omics technologies to a more diverse set of species. However, biologists require genome annotation to use these genomes and derive a better understanding of complex biological systems. Genome annotation incorporates two related but distinct processes: demarcating genes and other elements present in genome sequences (structural annotation); and associating function with genetic elements (functional annotation). While there are well established and freely available workflows for structural annotation of gene identification in newly assembled genomes, workflows for providing the functional annotation required to support functional genomics studies are less well understood. Genome-scale functional annotation is required for functional modeling (enrichment, networks, etc.) and a first-pass genome-wide functional annotation effort can rapidly identify under-represented gene sets for focused community annotation efforts. We present an open source, open access and containerized pipeline for genome-scale functional annotation of insect proteomes and apply it to a diverse range of arthropod species. We show that the performance of the predictions is consistent across a set of arthropod genomes with varying assembly and annotation quality.Complete instructions for running each component of the functional annotation pipeline on the command line, a high performance computing cluster and the CyVerse Discovery Environment can be found at the readthedocs site (https://agbase-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agbase/workflow.html).\n\nSimple summaryGenomic technologies are accumulating information about genes at a faster rate than ever before, and sequencing initiatives like the Earth Biogenome Project, i5k and Ag100Pest are expected to increase this rate of acquisition. However, if genomic sequencing is to be used for improvement of human health, agriculture and our understanding of biological systems, it is necessary to identify genes and understand how they contribute to biological outcomes. While there are several well-established workflows for assembling genomic sequences and identifying genes, understanding gene function is essential to create actionable knowledge. Moreover this functional annotation process must be easily accessible and provide information at a genomic scale to keep up with new sequence data. We report a well defined workflow for rapid functional annotation of whole proteomes to produce Gene Ontology and pathways information. We test this workflow on a diverse set of arthropod genomes and compare it to common arthropod reference genomes. The workflow we described is freely and publicly available via a web interface on CyVerse or as biocontainers that can be deployed scalably on local computing systems.",

This paper provides a short introduction to FiberSim and presents simulations of tension-pCa curves with and without regulation of thick filament transitions by myosin-binding protein C. The software was designed to be flexible (the user can define their own model and/or protocol) and computationally efficient (simulations can be performed on a regular laptop). We hope that other investigators will use FiberSim to explore myofilament level mechanisms and to accelerate research focusing on the contractile properties of sarcomeres.\n\nStatement of significanceMyotropes, such as omecamtiv mecarbil and mavacamten, are new therapeutics that bind directly to sarcomeric proteins.

Orientation of cell division, cell-cell interaction (i.e., attraction and repulsion), and geometrical constraints are the three major factors that define cell arrangement. Here we found that the amount and location of extra-embryonic space (ES), the empty space within the eggshell not occupied by embryonic cells, are critical to define cell arrangement in the 4-cell stage embryo of nematodes. This discovery was motivated by observations of a T-reversed-type arrangement, which was not explained by a model assuming simplified shapes of the eggshell, in our previous experiments. In this study, we incorporated the precise shape of the C. elegans eggshell in our newly developed multicellular morphology model based on the phase-field method. The new model succeeded in reproducing the T-reverse arrangement, demonstrating the importance of the precise shape of the eggshell. Further analyses revealed that the amount and location of ES is critical to develop various cell arrangements. Overall, our analyses characterized the roles of new geometrical contributors to cell arrangements, which should be considered for any multicellular system.",

    "abstract": "Genetic control over a cytoskeletal network inside lipid vesicles offers a potential route to controlled shape changes and DNA segregation in synthetic cell biology. Bacterial microtubules (bMTs) are protein filaments found in bacteria of the genus Prosthecobacter. They are formed by the tubulins BtubA and BtubB which polymerize in the presence of GTP. Here, we show that the tubulins BtubA/B can be functionally expressed from DNA templates in a reconstituted transcription-translation system, thus providing a cytosol-like environment to study their biochemical and biophysical properties. We found that bMTs spontaneously interact with lipid membranes and display treadmilling. When compartmentalized inside liposomes, de novo synthesized BtubA/B tubulins self-organize into cytoskeletal structures of different morphologies. Moreover, bMTs can exert a pushing force on the membrane and deform liposomes, a phenomenon that can be reversed by light-activated disassembly of the filaments. Our work establishes bMTs as a new building block in synthetic biology. In the context of creating a synthetic cell, bMTs could help shape the lipid compartment, establish polarity or directional transport, and assist the division machinery.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDysfunction of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) has been associated with excess intracellular cAMP concentrations, fueling pathogenic processes that are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this study was to develop a suitable PDE7-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) probe that allows non-invasive mapping of PDE7 in the mammalian brain.\n\nMethodsBased on a spiro cyclohexane-1,4-quinazolinone scaffold with known inhibitory properties towards PDE7, we designed and synthesized a methoxy analog that was suitable for carbon-11 labeling. Radiosynthesis was conducted with the respective desmethyl precursor using [11C]MeI. The resulting PET probe, codenamed [11C]26, was evaluated by cell uptake studies, ex vivo biodistribution and radiometabolite studies, as well as in vivo PET experiments in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP).\n\nResultsTarget compound 26 and the corresponding phenolic precursor were synthesized in 2-3 steps with overall yields of 49.5% and 12.4%, respectively. An inhibitory constant (IC50) of 31 nM towards PDE7 was obtained and no significant interaction with other PDE isoforms were observed. [11C]26 was synthesized in high molar activities (170 - 220 GBq/{micro}mol) with radiochemical yields of 34{+/-}7%. In vitro cell uptake of [11C]26 was 6-7 folds higher in PDE7 overexpressing cells, as compared to the controls, whereas an in vitro specificity of up to 90% was measured. Ex vivo metabolite studies revealed a high fraction of intact parent in the rat brain (98% at 5 min and 75% at 30 min post injection). Considerable brain penetration was further corroborated by ex vivo biodistribution and PET imaging studies - the latter showing heterogenic brain uptake. While marginal specific binding was observed by PET studies in rodents, a moderate, but dose-dependent, blockade was observed in the NHP brain following pretreatment with non-radioactive 26.\n\nConclusionIn this work, we report on the preclinical evaluation of [11C]26 (codename [11C]P7-2104), a PDE7-targeted PET ligand that is based on a spiroquinazolinone scaffold. [11C]26 displayed promising in vitro performance characteristics, a moderate degree of specific binding in PET studies with NHP. Accordingly, [11C]26 will serve as a valuable lead compound for the development of a new arsenal of PDE7-targeted probes with potentially improved in vivo specificity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms by which plasticity in millions of synapses in the brain is orchestrated to achieve behavioral and cognitive goals is a fundamental quest in neuroscience. In this regard, insights from learning methods in artificial neural networks (ANNs) and in particular supervised learning using backpropagation (BP) seem inspiring. However, the implementation of BP requires exact matching between forward and backward weights, which is unrealistic given the known connectivity pattern in the brain (known as \"weight transport problem\"). Notably, it has been shown that under certain conditions, error BackPropagation Through Arbitrary Weights (BP-TAW) can lead to a partial alignment between forward and backward weights (weight alignment or WA). This learning algorithm, which is also known as feedback alignment (FA), can result in surprisingly good degrees of accuracy in simple classification tasks. However, the underlying mechanisms and mathematical basis of WA are not thoroughly understood. In this work, we show that the occurrence of WA is governed by statistical properties of the output and error signals of neurons, such as autocorrelation and cross-correlation, and can happen even in the absence of learning or reduction of the loss function. Moreover, we show that WA can be improved significantly by limiting the norm of input weights to neurons and that such a weight normalization (WN) method can improve the classification accuracy of BP-TAW. The findings presented can be used to further improve the performance of BP-TAW and open new ways for exploring possible learning mechanisms in biological neural networks without exact matching between forward and backward weights.",

    "abstract": "High throughput single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has been successfully applied to characterize immune cell heterogeneity across a diverse range of settings; however, analysis of human granulocytes remains a significant challenge due to their low gene expression transcript detection. Consequently, granulocytes are typically either absent or highly under-represented and inaccurately enumerated in most human scRNA-seq datasets. Here, we apply multi-modal CITE-seq profiling to characterize granulocytes in human whole blood and bone marrow, and we show that these populations can be accurately detected and analyzed using the antibody-based modality, and that their frequencies and phenotype align well with antibody-based characterization of the same samples using CyTOF. These analyses also clearly highlight extremely low gene transcript detection across the entire granulocyte lineage including the earliest neutrophil progenitor populations when using the 10X Genomics platform. By contrast, when performing parallel analyses of the same samples using the BD Rhapsody platform, we recovered a much higher proportion of granulocyte gene transcripts, enabling true multi-modal characterization of human granulocyte heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) persists for long-duration inside the human host in both active and latent form by modulating the immune response. The mechanisms employed by M.tb to survive inside the host and evade the host immune system need to be explored in greater depth for the rational design of novel treatment strategies. The phosphorylation and methylation of biomolecules need to be addressed in mycobacteria because it has an important role in infection establishment and persistence. In the present study, we elaxborate on the role of PknJ in the slow growth of BCG and its association with mmaA4 protein during extracellular and intracellular growth. The pknJ knock-out (KO) BCG has been used to decode the functional significance in mycobacteria. The mmaA4 expression and methyltransferase activity is decreased in knocked-out BCG strain (pknJ-/-) during extracellular growth, while mmaA4 expression and methyltransferase activity is increased during intracellular growth of mycobacteria. The knocked-out BCG strain is highly sensitive to the rifampicin antibiotics during extracellular growth in compared to control. A significant association of pknJ and mmaA4 was found in our studies during the growth and intracellular persistence of mycobacteria.",

    "abstract": "PREMISEThe distribution of genetic diversity on the landscape has critical ecological and evolutionary implications. This may be especially the case on a local scale for foundation plant species since they create and define ecological communities, contributing disproportionately to ecosystem function.\n\nMETHODSWe examined the distribution of genetic diversity and clones, which we defined first as unique multi-locus genotypes (MLG), and then by grouping similar MLGs into multi-locus lineages (MLL). We used 186 markers from inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) across 358 ramets from 13 patches of the foundation grass Leymus chinensis. We examined the relationship between genetic and clonal diversities, their variation with patch-size, and the effect of the number of markers used to evaluate genetic diversity and structure in this species.\n\nRESULTSEvery ramet had a unique MLG. Almost all patches consisted of individuals belonging to a single MLL. We confirmed this with a clustering algorithm to group related genotypes. The predominance of a single lineage within each patch could be the result of the accumulation of somatic mutations, limited dispersal, some sexual reproduction with partners mainly restricted to the same patch, or a combination of all three.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe found strong genetic structure among patches of L. chinensis. Consistent with previous work on the species, the clustering of similar genotypes within patches suggests that clonal reproduction combined with somatic mutation, limited dispersal, and some degree of sexual reproduction among neighbors causes individuals within a patch to be more closely related than among patches.",

    "abstract": "IDH wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumour in adults. GBM typically has a poor prognosis, mainly due to a lack of effective treatment options leading to tumour persistence or recurrence. Tackling this, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins in GBM. Levels of anti- apoptotic BCL-xL and MCL-1 were consistently increased in GBM compared with non- malignant cells and tissue. Moreover, we found that relative to their differentiated counterparts, patient-derived GBM stem-like cells also displayed higher expression of anti- apoptotic BCL-2 family members. Surprisingly, high anti-apoptotic BCL-xL and MCL-1 expression correlated with heightened susceptibility of GBM to BCL-2 family protein- targeting BH3-mimetics. This is indicative of increased apoptotic priming. Indeed, GBM displayed an obligate requirement for MCL-1 expression in both tumour development and maintenance. Investigating this apoptotic sensitivity, we found that sequential inhibition of BCL-xL and MCL-1 led to robust anti-tumour responses in vivo, in the absence of overt toxicity. These data demonstrate that BCL-xL and MCL-1 pro-survival function is a fundamental prerequisite for GBM survival that can be therapeutically exploited by BH3- mimetics.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is widely recognized as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Abnormal cortical development may by revealed using polygenic risk scoring for schizophrenia (PRS-SCZ). We assessed PRS-SCZ and cortical morphometry in typically developing children (3-21 years) using whole genome genotyping and T1-weighted MRI (n=390) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics (PING) cohort. We contextualise the findings using (i) age-matched transcriptomics, (ii) histologically-defined cytoarchitectural types and functionally-defined networks, (iii) case-control differences of schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Higher PRS-SCZ was associated with greater cortical thickness, which was most prominent in areas with heightened gene expression of dendrites and synapses. PRS-SCZ related increases in vertex-wise cortical thickness were especially focused in the ventral attention network, while koniocortical type cortex (i.e. primary sensory areas) was relatively conserved from PRS-SCZ related differences. The large-scale pattern of cortical thickness increases related to PRS-SCZ mirrored the pattern of cortical thinning in schizophrenia and mood-related psychiatric disorders. Age group models illustrate a possible trajectory from PRS-SCZ associated cortical thickness increases in early childhood towards thinning in late adolescence, which resembles the adult brain phenotype of schizophrenia. Collectively, combining imaging-genetics with multi-scale mapping, our work provides novel insight into how genetic risk for schizophrenia impacts the cortex early in life.",
