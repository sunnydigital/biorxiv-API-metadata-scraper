    "abstract": "Collecting network interaction data is difficult. Non-exhaustive sampling and complex hidden processes often result in an incomplete data set. Thus, identifying potentially present but unobserved interactions is crucial both in understanding the structure of large scale data, and in predicting how previously unseen elements will interact. Recent studies in network analysis have shown that accounting for metadata (such as node attributes) can improve both our understanding of how nodes interact with one another, and the accuracy of link prediction. However, the dimension of the object we need to learn to predict interactions in a network grows quickly with the number of nodes. Therefore, it becomes computationally and conceptually challenging for large networks. Here, we present a new predictive procedure combining a graph embedding method with machine learning techniques to predict interactions on the base of nodes metadata. Graph embedding methods project the nodes of a network onto a--low dimensional--latent feature space. The position of the nodes in the latent feature space can then be used to predict interactions between nodes. Learning a mapping of the nodes metadata to their position in a latent feature space corresponds to a classic--and low dimensional--machine learning problem. In our current study we used the Random Dot Product Graph model to estimate the embedding of an observed network, and we tested different neural networks architectures to predict the position of nodes in the latent feature space. Flexible machine learning techniques to map the nodes onto their latent positions allow to account for multivariate and possibly complex nodes meta-data. To illustrate the utility of the proposed procedure, we apply it to a large dataset of tourist visits to destinations across New Zealand. We found that our procedure accurately predicts interactions for both existing nodes and nodes newly added to the network, while being computationally feasible even for very large networks. Overall, our study highlights that by exploiting the properties of a well understood statistical model for complex networks and combining it with standard machine learning techniques, we can simplify the link prediction problem when incorporating multivariate node metadata. Our procedure can be immediately applied to different types of networks, and to a wide variety of data from different systems. As such, both from a network science and data science perspective, our work offers a flexible and generalisable procedure for link prediction.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have led to sustained global warming over the last decades1. This is already reshaping the distribution of biodiversity across the world and can lead to the occurrence of large-scale singular events, such as the melting of polar ice sheets2,3. The potential impacts of such a melting event on species persistence across taxonomic groups - in terms of magnitude and geographic extent - remain unexplored. Here we assess impacts on biodiversity of global warming and melting of Greenlands ice sheet on the distribution of 21,146 species of vascular plants and tetrapods across twelve megadiverse countries. We show that high global warming would lead to widespread reductions in species geographic ranges (median range loss, 35-78%), which are magnified (median range loss, 95-99%) with the added contribution of Greenlands melting and its potentially large impact on oceanic circulation and regional climate changes. Our models project a decline in the geographical extent of species hotspots across countries (median reduction, 48-95%) and a substantial alteration of species composition in the near future (mean temporal dissimilarity, 0.26-0.89). These results imply that, in addition to global warming, the influence of Greenlands melting can lead to the collapse of biodiversity across the globe, providing an added domino in its cascading effects.",

    "abstract": "AimMuseum and herbarium specimen records are frequently used to assess species conservation status and responses to climate change. Typically, occurrences with imprecise geolocality information are discarded because they cannot be matched confidently to environmental conditions, and are thus expected to increase uncertainty in downstream analyses. However, using only precisely georeferenced records risks undersampling of species environmental and geographic distributions. We present two related methods to allow the use of imprecisely georeferenced occurrences in biogeographic analysis.\n\nInnovationOur two procedures assign imprecise records to the 1) locations or 2) climates that are closest to the geographic or environmental centroid of the precise records of a species. For virtual species, including imprecise records alongside precise records improved the accuracy of ecological niche models projected to the present and the future, especially for species with ~20 or fewer precise occurrences. Using only precise records underestimates loss in suitable habitat and overestimates the amount of suitable habitat in both the present and future. Including imprecise records also improves estimates of niche breadth and extent of occurrence. An analysis of 44 species of North American Asclepias (Apocynaceae) yielded similar results.\n\nMain conclusionsExisting studies examining the effects of spatial imprecision compare outcomes based on precise records to the same records with spatial error added to them. However, in real-world cases, analysts possess a mix of precise and imprecise records and must decide whether to retain or discard the latter. Discarding imprecise records can undersample species geographic and environmental distributions and lead to mis-estimation of responses to past and future climate change. Our method, for which we provide a software implementation in the enmSdmX package for R, is simple to employ and can help leverage the large number of specimen records that are typically deemed \"unusable\" because of spatial imprecision in their geolocation.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomics has enabled the identification of genes that potentially evolved de novo from non-coding sequences. Many such genes are expressed in male reproductive tissues, but their functions remain poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a functional genetic screen of over 40 putative de novo genes with testis-enriched expression in Drosophila melanogaster and identified one gene, atlas, required for male fertility. Detailed genetic and cytological analyses showed that atlas is required for proper chromatin condensation during the final stages of spermatogenesis. Atlas protein is expressed in spermatid nuclei and facilitates the transition from histone- to protamine-based chromatin packaging. Complementary evolutionary analyses revealed the complex evolutionary history of atlas. The protein-coding portion of the gene likely arose at the base of the Drosophila genus on the X chromosome but was unlikely to be essential, as it was then lost in several independent lineages. Within the last [~]15 million years, however, the gene moved to an autosome, where it fused with a conserved non-coding RNA and evolved a non-redundant role in male fertility. Altogether, this study provides insight into the integration of novel genes into biological processes, the links between genomic innovation and functional evolution, and the genetic control of a fundamental developmental process, gametogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenomes are in flux, as genes are constantly added and lost throughout evolution. New genes were once thought to arise almost exclusively via the modification or duplication of existing genes. Recently, however, interest has grown in alternative modes of new gene origination, such as de novo evolution from genetic material that previously did not encode proteins. Many de novo genes are expressed in male reproductive tissues, but their significance for fertility is not well understood. We screened likely de novo genes expressed in the Drosophila testis for reproductive roles and found one gene, atlas, essential for male fertility. We leveraged genetic and cell biological experiments to investigate roles for Atlas protein in reproduction and found that it is required during sperm development for proper packaging of DNA in the sperm nucleus. Evolutionary analyses of this gene revealed a complicated history, including loss in some lineages, movement between chromosomes, and fusion with a non-protein-coding gene. Studying both the functions and evolutionary histories of new proteins illustrates how they might evolve critical roles in biological processes despite their relative novelty. Furthermore, the study of atlas identifies an essential genetic player in the fly testis, an important model system for understanding how gametes are produced.",

Using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy we demonstrated that the loss of the DNMT5a gene correlates with a global depletion of DNA methylation and overexpression of young transposable elements in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.

    "abstract": "Dynein is a cytoskeletal motor protein that carries organelles via retrograde transport in eukaryotic cells. The motor protein belongs to the ATPase family of proteins associated with diverse cellular activities and plays a critical role in transporting cargoes to the minus end of the microtubules. The motor domain of dynein possesses a hexameric head, where ATP hydrolysis occurs. The AAA1 binding site is the leading ATP hydrolytic site, followed by the AAA3 subsite. Small-molecule ATP competitive inhibitors of dynein are thought to target the AAA1 site. The presented work elucidates the structure-activity relationship of dynapyrazole A and B, ciliobrevin A and D in their various protonated states and their 46 analogs for their binding properties in the nucleotide-binding site of the AAA1 subunit and their effects on the functionally essential subsites of the motor domain of cytoplasmic dynein 1, as there is currently no similar experimental structural data available. Ciliobrevin and its analogs bind to the ATP motifs of the AAA1, namely the Walker-A or P-loop, the Walker-B, and the sensor I and II. Ciliobrevin A shows a better binding affinity to the AAA1 binding site of dynein 1 than its D analog. Although the double bond in ciliobrevin A and D was expected to decrease the ligand potency, they show a better affinity to the AAA1 binding site than dynapyrazole A and B, lacking the bond. Protonation of the nitrogen in ciliobrevin A, D, dynapyrazole A, and B at the N9 site of ciliobrevin, and the N7 of the latter increased their binding affinity. Exploring ciliobrevin A geometrical configuration suggests the E isomer has a superior binding profile over the Z due to binding at the critical ATP motifs. Utilizing the refined structure of the motor domain obtained through protein conformational search in this study exhibits that Arg1852 of the yeast cytoplasmic dynein could involve in the \"glutamate switch\" mechanism in cytoplasmic dynein 1 in lieu of the conserved Asn in AAA+ protein family, as the guanidine moiety of the Arg engages in an H-bond with the carboxylate moiety of Glu1849.",

    "abstract": "In cells, multiple molecular motors work together as teams to carry cargoes such as vesicles and organelles over long distances to their destinations by stepping along a network of cytoskeletal filaments. How motors that typically mechanically interfere with each other, work as teams is unclear. Here we explored the possibility that purely physical mechanisms may potentially enhance teamwork, both at the single motor and cargo level. To explore these mechanisms, we developed a 3D dynamical simulation of cargo transport along microtubules by teams of canonically non-cooperative kinesin-1 motors. We accounted for cargo membrane fluidity by explicitly simulating the Brownian dynamics of motors on the cargo surface and considered both the load and ATP dependence of single motor functioning. We showed explicitly, for the first time, that surface fluidity leads to the reduction of negative mechanical interference between kinesins, enhancing load sharing thereby decreasing single motor off-rates and increasing processivity. Remarkably, we also showed that, independent of fluidity, increasing numbers of bound motors pull the cargo closer to the microtubule, increasing the on-rates of individual unbound motors, resulting in a cooperative increase in bound motor numbers that depends on 3D cargo geometry. At the cargo level, surface fluidity makes more motors available for binding, though this effect is significant only at low ATP or high motor density. Interestingly, we find that the fluidity induced reduction in mechanical interference dominates over the increased availability of motors for typical physiological and in vitro conditions, this allowing us to reconcile different experimental results in different regimes. Finally, we show that these effects can altogether result in enhanced mechanical efficiency and tunable cargo run-lengths for teams of molecular motors over physiological ranges of fluidity with implications for new experimental validation efforts, transport in vivo, artificial cargo design and multi-motor-driven mechanical processes in general.\n\nAuthor summaryIn cells, multiple molecular motors work together as teams to carry cargoes such as vesicles and organelles over long distances to their destinations by stepping along a network of protein filaments. How do intrinsically non-cooperative motors function as teams within cells? In this paper, we show, using computer simulations, that the fluid surfaces of cellular cargo reduce the mechanical interference between motors allowing better load sharing and decreasing their detachment rates, thereby increasing the distance over which they can carry cargo. We additionally found that motors pull cargo closer to the filament increasing the attachment rates of other unbound motors. These effects act synergistically with an increased availability of motors due to fluidity to further increase travel distances. Our simulation model accounted for the dynamics of the motors on the cargo surface and their load and ATP dependent kinetics, allowing us to connect single motor properties to overall transport. Our work on understanding how teamwork arises in mechanically coupled motors sheds new light on cellular processes, reconciles existing observations, encourages new experimental validation efforts and can also suggest new ways of improving mechanical efficiency and transport of artificial cargo powered by motor teams.",

This research tested whether metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized MRI could detect changes in tumor progression faster than conventional anatomic MRI in patient-derived glioblastoma murine models. To capture the dynamic nature of cancer metabolism, hyperpolarized MRI, NMR spectroscopy, and immunohistochemistry were performed at several time-points during tumor development, regression, and recurrence. Hyperpolarized MRI detected significant changes of metabolism throughout tumor progression whereas conventional MRI was less sensitive. This was accompanied by aberrations in amino acid and phospholipid lipid metabolism and MCT1 expression. Hyperpolarized MRI can help address clinical challenges such as identifying malignant disease prior to aggressive growth, differentiating pseudoprogression from true progression, and predicting relapse. The individual evolution of these metabolic assays as well as their correlations with one another provides context for further academic research.",

Current studies focus on alternative treatment approaches that target or normalize the abnormal microenvironment of pancreatic tumors, which among others, is responsible for elevated mechanical stress in the tumor interior. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms by which mechanical stress regulates pancreatic cancer metastatic potential remain elusive. Herein, we used a large-scale proteomic assay to profile mechanical stress-induced signaling cascades that drive the motility of pancreatic cancer cells. Proteomic analysis, together with selective protein inhibition and siRNA treatments, revealed that mechanical stress enhances cell migration through activation of the p38 MAPK/HSP27 and JNK/c-Jun signaling axes, and activation of the actin cytoskeleton remodelers: Rac1, cdc42, and Myosin II. Our results highlight targeting aberrant signaling in cancer cells that are adapted to the mechanical tumor microenvironment as a novel approach to effectively limit pancreatic cancer cell migration.",

    "abstract": "All Asian woody bamboo species of economic importance are semelparous. They remain vegetative during time intervals that are specific to each species and range from three to 120 years, with notable concentrations around a series of values (3, 7-8, 14-17, 29-36, 42-48, 61-64, and 120 years). Then, they flower gregariously within a short period. Entire forests temporarily disappear during these periods, and the dates of these dramatic events have been recorded over the last 200 years.\n\nWhile searching for a correlated environmental cue, I have found that the concentrations of flowering cycles were highly correlated with the series of successive returns of almost the same sun-moon phasing as at seedling emergence. On basis of knowledge on plant photoperiod sensitivity, I hypothesize that bamboo plants i) run a lunar cellular clock that is set at the full moon, ii) retain in their cellular memory the exact sun-moon phasing of the year of their emergence as seedlings, and iii) inhibit flowering until the occurrence of a unique, species-specific sun-moon phasing that is shifted by a precise amount from the sun-moon phasing at their emergence. Recent evidence of plant responses to lunar cycles supports this hypothesis, for which experimental evidence is now anticipated.\n\nHighlightThe long-standing enigma of the triggering of the gregarious flowering of bamboos is possibly solved. Flowering would be inhibited until the occurrence of the species-specific sun-moon phasing.",

    "abstract": "Sensory experiences are often driven by an animals self-motion and locomotion is known to modulate neural responses in the mouse visual system. This modulation is hypothesised to improve the processing of behaviourally relevant visual inputs, which may change rapidly during locomotion. However, little is known about how locomotion modulates the temporal dynamics (time courses) of visually-evoked neural responses. Here, we analysed the temporal dynamics of single neuron and population responses to dot field stimuli moving at a range of visual speeds using the Visual Coding dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science1. Single neuron responses had diverse temporal dynamics that varied between stationary and running sessions. Increased dynamic range and more reliable responses in running sessions enabled faster, stronger and more persistent encoding of visual speed. Population activity reflected the temporal dynamics of single neuron responses, including their modulation by locomotor state - neural trajectories of population activity made more direct transitions between baseline and stimulus steady states in running sessions. The structure of population coding also changed with locomotor state - population activity prioritised the encoding of visual speed in running, but not stationary sessions. Our results reveal a profound influence of locomotion on the temporal dynamics of neural responses. We demonstrate that during locomotion, mouse visual areas prioritise the encoding of potentially fast-changing, behaviourally relevant visual features.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination and phosphorylation are reversible post-translational protein modifications regulating physiological and pathological processes. MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-1 regulates innate and adaptive immunity. The multifaceted roles of MKP-1 were attributed to dephosphorylation of p38 and JNK mitogen activated kinases (MAPKs). We show that the lack of MKP-1 modulates the landscape of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs). MKP-1 deficient mice showed an aberrant regulation of several DUBs and increased expression of proteins and genes involved in IL-1/TLR signaling upstream of MAPK, including IL-1R1, IRAK1, TRAF6, phosphorylated TAK1 and an increased K63-polyubiquitination on TRAF6. Increased K63-polyubiquitination on TRAF6 was associated with an enhanced phosphorylated form of A20. Among abundant DUBs, Ubiquitin-specific-protease-13 (USP13), which cleaves polyubiquitin- chains on client proteins, was substantially enhanced in murine MKP-1 deficient BMDMs. An inhibitor of USP13 decreased the K63-polyubiquitination on TRAF6, TAK1-phosphorylation, IL-1{beta} and TNF- induction in response to LPS in BMDMs. Our data show for the first time that MKP-1 modulates the ligase activity of TRAF6 through modulation of specific DUBs.",

    "abstract": "The study of insular populations was key in the development of evolutionary theory. The successful colonisation of an island depends on the geographic context, and specific characteristics of the organism and the island, but also on stochastic processes. As a result, apparently identical islands may harbour populations with contrasting histories. Here, we use whole genome sequences of 65 barn owls to investigate the patterns of inbreeding and genetic diversity of insular populations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We focus on Crete and Cyprus, islands with similar size, climate and distance to mainland, that provide natural replicates for a comparative analysis of the impacts of microevolutionary processes on isolated populations. We show that barn owl populations from each island have a separate origin, Crete being genetically more similar to other Greek islands and mainland Greece, and Cyprus more similar to the Levant. Further, our data show that their respective demographic histories following colonisation were also distinct. On the one hand, Crete harbours a small population and maintains very low levels of gene flow with neighbouring populations. This has resulted in low genetic diversity, strong genetic drift, increased relatedness in the population and remote inbreeding. Cyprus, on the other hand, appears to maintain enough gene flow with the mainland to avoid such an outcome. Our work provides a comparative population genomic analysis of the effects of neutral processes on a classical island-mainland model system. It provides empirical evidence for the role of stochastic processes in determining the fate of diverging isolated populations.",

    "abstract": "The frequency domain of electroencephalography (EEG) data has developed as a particularly important area of EEG analysis. EEG spectra have been analyzed with explainable machine learning and deep learning methods. However, as deep learning has developed, most studies use raw EEG data, which is not well-suited for traditional explainability methods. Several studies have introduced methods for spectral insight into classifiers trained on raw EEG data. These studies have provided global insight into the frequency bands that are generally important to a classifier but do not provide local insight into the frequency bands important for the classification of individual samples. This local explainability could be particularly helpful for EEG analysis domains like sleep stage classification that feature multiple evolving states. We present a novel local spectral explainability approach and use it to explain a convolutional neural network trained for automated sleep stage classification. We use our approach to show how the relative importance of different frequency bands varies over time and even within the same sleep stages. Furthermore, to better understand how our approach compares to existing methods, we compare a global estimate of spectral importance generated from our local results with an existing global spectral importance approach. We find that the {delta} band is most important for most sleep stages, though {beta} is most important for the non-rapid eye movement 2 (NREM2) sleep stage. Additionally, {theta} is particularly important for identifying Awake and NREM1 samples. Our study represents the first approach developed for local spectral insight into deep learning classifiers trained on raw EEG time series.",

Variations in the Drd2 gene have clinical significance since DRD2 is a pharmacotherapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia. Despite numerous studies on the disease association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intronic regions, investigation into the coding regions is surprisingly limited. In this study, we aimed at identifying potential functionally and pharmaco-therapeutically deleterious non-synonymous SNPs of Drd2. A wide array of bioinformatics tools was used to evaluate the impact of nsSNPs on protein structure and functionality. Out of 260 nsSNPs retrieved from the dbSNP database, initially 9 were predicted as deleterious by 15 tools. Upon further assessment of their domain association, conservation profile, homology models and inter-atomic interaction, the mutant F389V was considered as the most impactful. In-depth analysis of F389V through Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation revealed a decline in affinity for its native agonist dopamine and an increase in affinity for the antipsychotic drug risperidone. Remarkable alterations in binding interactions and stability of the protein-ligand complex in simulated physiological conditions were also noted. These findings will improve our understanding of the consequence of nsSNPs in disease-susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal epithelium is one of the fastest renewing tissues in mammals. It shows a hierarchical organisation, where intestinal stem cells at the base of crypts give rise to rapidly dividing transit amplifying cells that in turn renew the pool of short-lived differentiated cells. Upon injury and stem-cell loss, cells can also dedifferentiate. Tissue homeostasis require a tightly regulated balance of differentiation and stem cell proliferation, and failure can lead to tissue extinction or to unbounded growth and cancerous lesions. Here, we present a two-compartment mathematical model of intestinal epithelium population dynamics that includes a known feedback inhibition of stem cell differentiation by differentiated cells. The model shows that feedback regulation stabilises the number of differentiated cells as these become invariant to changes in their apoptosis rate. Stability of the system is largely independent of feedback strength and shape, but specific thresholds exist after unbounded growth occurs. When dedifferentiation is added to the model, we find that the system can recover more gracefully after certain external perturbations. However, dedifferentiation makes the system more prone to loosing homoeostasis. Taken together, our mathematical model shows how a feedback-controlled hierarchical tissue can maintain homeostasis and can be robust to many external perturbations.",

    "abstract": "The genus Amaranthus is composed of numerous annual herbs, several of which are primary driver weeds within annual production agricultural systems. In particular, Amaranthus tuberculatus, a dioecious species, is noteworthy for rapid growth rates, high fecundity, and an expanding geographic distribution. Interspecific hybridization within and between the subgenera Amaranthus and Acnidia is reported both in controlled environment and field studies, however a gap in knowledge exists with the subgenus Albersia. Interspecific hybridization may contribute to genetic diversity, and may contribute to the current range expansion of A. tuberculatus. Recently, a herbicide resistance survey of A. tuberculatus across five Midwestern states reported alleles of PPX2 similar to sequences of Amaranthus albus, a monoecious species. Here, we seek to generate empirical data for the hybridization potential of A. albus and A. tuberculatus through replicated, controlled crosses in a greenhouse. Of 65,000 progeny screened from A. albus grown with A. tuberculatus males, three were confirmed as hybrids. Hybrids were dioecious, possessed phenotypic traits of both species, and had limited to no fertility. DNA content analysis of backcross progeny suggested a polyploid state may be required for hybrid formation. Screening of 120 progeny of A. tuberculatus females grown with A. albus identified no hybrids, though a skew to female progeny was observed. The female skew may be due to apomixis or auto-pollination, the spontaneous generation of male flowers on otherwise female plants. Our results indicate that introgression between A. albus and A. tuberculatus will occur less frequently than what has often been reported from hybridization studies with different pairs of Amaranthus species.",

First, we used a multiplexed ChIP-exo assay to characterize genome-wide binding sites for these candidate TFs; 34 of them were found to be DNA-binding protein. We then compared the relative location between binding sites and RNA polymerase (RNAP). We found 48% (283/588) overlap between the TFs and RNAP. Finally, we used these data to infer potential functions for 10 of the 34 TFs with validated DNA binding sites and consensus binding motifs. These TFs were found to have various roles in regulating primary cellular processes in E. coli.

We compared the Center of cancellation (CoC) measure of right hemisphere stroke patients with spatial neglect in two cancellation tasks across different modalities (paper-and-pencil vs. digital) and display sizes (small, medium, large). We found that the CoC measure did neither vary considerably between paper-and-pencil versus digital versions, nor between different digital size formats. The CoC derived from cancellation tasks thus seems robust to test digitization. A further aim of the present study was to evaluate three additional parameters of search behavior which became available through digitization. We observed slower search behavior, increased distance between two consecutively identified items, and signs of a more strategic search for neglect patients than control patients without neglect. Machine learning classifications indicated that - beyond the CoC measure - the latter three variables can help to differentiate stroke patients with spatial neglect from thosewithout.",

    "abstract": "Innate immunity constitutes the first line of defense against viruses, in which mitochondria play an important role in the induction of the interferon (IFN) response. BHRF1, a multifunctional viral protein expressed during Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, modulates mitochondrial dynamics and disrupts the IFN signaling pathway. Mitochondria are mobile organelles that move through the cytoplasm thanks to the cytoskeleton and in particular the microtubule (MT) network. MTs undergo various post-translational modifications, among them tubulin acetylation. In this study, we demonstrated that BHRF1 induces MT hyperacetylation to escape innate immunity. Indeed, the expression of BHRF1 induces the clustering of shortened mitochondria next to the nucleus. This \"mito-aggresome\" is organized around the centrosome and its formation is MT-dependent. We also observed that the -tubulin acetyltransferase ATAT1 interacts with BHRF1. Using ATAT1 knockdown or a non-acetylatable -tubulin mutant, we demonstrated that this hyperacetylation is necessary for the mito-aggresome formation. Similar results were observed during EBV reactivation. We investigated the mechanism leading to the clustering of mitochondria, and we identified dyneins as motors that are required for mitochondrial clustering. Finally, we demonstrated that BHRF1 needs MT hyperacetylation to block the induction of the IFN response. Moreover, the loss of MT hyperacetylation blocks the localization of autophagosomes close to the mito-aggresome, impeding BHRF1 to initiate mitophagy, which is essential to inhibiting the signaling pathway. Therefore, our results reveal the role of the MT network, and its acetylation level, in the induction of a pro-viral mitophagy.",

Comparison of gene expression patterns in M. acetivorans grown in co-culture versus pure culture growth on acetate revealed that transcripts for the outer-surface, multi-heme, c-type cytochrome MmcA were higher during DIET-based growth. Deletion of mmcA inhibited DIET. The high aromatic amino acid content of M. acetivorans archaellins suggests that they might assemble into electrically conductive archaella. A mutant that could not express archaella was deficient in DIET. However, this mutant grew in DIET-based co-culture as well as the archaella-expressing parental strain in the presence of granular activated carbon, which was previously shown to serve as a substitute for electrically conductive pili as a conduit for long-range interspecies electron transfer in other DIET-based co-cultures. Transcriptomic data suggesting that the membrane-bound Rnf, Fpo, and HdrED complexes also play a role in DIET were incorporated into a charge-balanced model illustrating how electrons entering the cell through MmcA can yield energy to support growth from carbon dioxide reduction. The results are the first genetics-based functional demonstration of likely outer-surface electrical contacts for DIET in a methanogen.\n\nImportanceThe conversion of organic matter to methane plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and is an effective strategy for converting wastes to a useful biofuel. The reduction of carbon dioxide to methane accounts for approximately a third of the methane produced in anaerobic soils and sediments as well as waste digesters. Potential electron donors for carbon dioxide reduction are H2 or electrons derived from direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between bacteria and methanogens. Elucidating the relative importance of these electron donors has been difficult due to a lack of information on the electrical connects on the outer surface of methanogens and how they process the electrons received from DIET. Transcriptomic patterns and gene deletion phenotypes reported here provide insight into how a group of Methanosarcina that play an important role in methane production in soils and sediments participate in DIET.",

This can be facilitated by introducing conditional female-lethality to EGI strains to generate a sex-sorting incompatible male system (SSIMS). Here we demonstrate a proof of concept by combining tetracycline-controlled female lethality constructs with a pyramus-targeting EGI line in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. We show that both functions (incompatibility and sex-sorting) are robustly maintained in the SSIMS line and that this approach is effective for population suppression in cage experiments.

    "abstract": "Ligand binding of membrane proteins triggers many important cellular signaling events by the lateral aggregation of ligand-bound and other membrane proteins in the plane of the plasma membrane. This local clustering can lead to the co-enrichment of molecules that create an intracellular signal or bring sufficient amounts of activity together to shift an existing equilibrium towards the execution of a signaling event. In this way, clustering can serve as a cellular switch. The underlying uneven distribution and local enrichment of the signaling cluster's constituting membrane proteins can be used as a functional readout. This information is obtained by combining single-molecule fluorescence microscopy with cluster algorithms that can reliably and reproducibly distinguish clusters from fluctuations in the background noise to generate quantitative data on this complex process.\n\nCluster analysis of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy data has emerged as a proliferative field, and several algorithms and software solutions have been put forward. However, in most cases, such cluster algorithms require multiple analysis parameters to be defined by the user, which may lead to biased results. Furthermore, most cluster algorithms neglect the individual localization precision connected to every localized molecule, leading to imprecise results. Bayesian cluster analysis has been put forward to overcome these problems, but so far, it has entailed high computational cost, increasing runtime drastically. Finally, most software is challenging to use as they require advanced technical knowledge to operate.\n\nHere we combined three advanced cluster algorithms with the Bayesian approach and parallelization in a user-friendly GUI and achieved up to an order of magnitude faster processing than for previous approaches. Our work will simplify access to a well-controlled analysis of clustering data generated by SMLM and significantly accelerate data processing. The inclusion of a simulation mode aids in the design of well-controlled experimental assays.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are expected to play a critical role in achieving precision medicine. Currently, PRS predictors are generally based on linear models using summary statistics, and more recently individual-level data. However, these predictors mainly capture additive relationships and are limited in data modalities they can use. Here, we developed a deep learning framework (EIR) for PRS prediction which includes a model, genome-local-net (GLN), specifically designed for large scale genomics data. The framework supports multi-task (MT) learning, automatic integration of other clinical and biochemical data, and model explainability. When applied to individual level data in the UK Biobank, we found that GLN outperformed LASSO for a wide range of diseases and in particularly autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we show that this was likely due to modelling epistasis, and we showcase this by identifying widespread epistasis for Type 1 Diabetes. Furthermore, we trained PRS by integrating genotype, blood, urine and anthropometrics and found that this improved performance for 93% of 290 diseases and disorders considered. Finally, we found that including genotype data provided better calibrated PRS models compared to using measurements alone. EIR is available at https://github.com/arnor-sigurdsson/EIR.",

    "abstract": "The biological functions of proteins are traditionally thought to depend on well-defined three-dimensional structures, but many experimental studies have shown that disordered regions lacking fixed three-dimensional structures also have crucial biological roles. In some of these regions, disorder-order transitions are also involved in various biological processes, such as protein-protein interaction and ligand binding. Therefore, it is crucial to study disordered regions and structural transitions for further understanding of protein functions and folding. Owing to the costs and time requirements of experimental identification of natively disordered or transitional regions, the development of effective computational methods is a key research goal. In this study, we used overall residue dependencies and deep representation learning for prediction and reused the obtained disordered regions for the prediction of disorder-order transitions. Two similar and related prediction tasks were combined. Firstly, we developed a novel deep learning method, Res-BiLstm, for residue-wise disordered region prediction. Our method outperformed other predictors with respect to almost all criteria, as evaluated using an independent test set. For disorder-order transition prediction, we proposed a transfer learning method, Res-BiLstm-NN, with an acceptable but unbalanced performance, yielding reasonable results. To grasp underlining biophysical principles of disorder-order transitions, we performed qualitative analyses on the obtained results and discovered that most transitions have strong disordered or ordered preferences, and more transitions are consistent with the ordered state than the disordered state, different from conventional wisdom. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sizable-scale study of transition prediction.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/Yanzziang/Transition_Disorder_Prediction\n\nContactkengo@ecei.tohoku.ac.jp",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies of prostate cancer have identified >250 significant risk loci, but the causal variants and mechanisms for these loci remain largely unknown. Here, we sought to identify and characterize risk harboring regulatory elements by integrating epigenomes from primary prostate tumor and normal tissues of 27 patients across the H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K4me2 histone marks and FOXA1 and HOXB13 transcription factors.\n\nResultsWe identified 7,371 peaks with significant allele-specificity (asQTL peaks). Showcasing their relevance to prostate cancer risk, H3K27ac T-asQTL peaks were the single annotation most enriched for prostate cancer GWAS heritability (40x), significantly higher than corresponding non-asQTL H3K27ac peaks (14x) or coding regions (14x). Surprisingly, fine-mapped GWAS risk variants were most significantly enriched for asQTL peaks observed in tumors, including asQTL peaks that were differentially imbalanced with respect to tumor-normal states. These data pinpointed putative causal regulatory elements at 20 GWAS loci, of which 11 were detected only in the tumor samples. More broadly, tumor-specific asQTLs were enriched for expression QTLs in benign tissues as well as accessible regions found in stem cells, supporting a hypothesis where some germline variants become reactivated during/after transformation and can be captured by epigenomic profiling of the tumor.\n\nConclusionOur study demonstrates the power of allele-specificity in chromatin signals to uncover GWAS mechanisms, highlights the relevance of tumor-specific regulation in the context of cancer risk, and prioritizes multiple loci for experimental follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The role of time (i.e. taxa ages) in phylogeny has been a source of intense debate within palaeontology for decades and has not yet been resolved fully. The fossilised birth-death range process is a model that explicitly accounts for information about species through time. It presents a fresh opportunity to examine the role of stratigraphic data in phylogenetic inference of fossil taxa. Here, we apply this model in a Bayesian framework to an exemplar dataset of well-dated conodonts from the Late Devonian. We compare the results to those obtained using traditional unconstrained tree inference. We show that the combined analysis of morphology and stratigraphic data under the FBD range process reduces overall phylogenetic uncertainty, compared to unconstrained tree inference. We find that previous phylogenetic hypotheses based on parsimony and stratophenetics are closer to trees generated under the FBD range process. However, the results also highlight that irrespective of the inclusion of age data, a large amount of topological uncertainty will remain. Bayesian inference provides the most intuitive way to represent the uncertainty inherent in fossil datasets and new flexible models increase opportunities to refine hypotheses in palaeobiology.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral autoregulation, the physiological capability to regulate cerebral blood flow, may be assisted by short-term mean arterial pressure control via baroreflex, which, among several effects, modulates total peripheral resistance. It is unclear, however, whether the resistance of the head and neck vasculatures is also affected by baroreflex and whether these extracranial vessels assist autoregulation. Since sensing technologies such as functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and noninvasive intracranial pressure monitoring by strain gauge may be influenced by superficial tissue, it is clinically relevant to understand the relations between intracranial and extracranial hemodynamics. Therefore, we created an autoregulation model consisting of arteries and arterioles regulated by the intralumial pressure and microcirculation regulated by local blood flow. As the first critical step to quantify the signal deterioration introduced by the extracranial circulation on superficial sensors, the extracranial peripheral circulation of the head and neck and baroreflex regulation of the peripheral vasculature and of heart rate were also included. During simulations of a bout of acute hypotension, the model predicts a rapid return of cerebral blood flow to baseline levels and a prolonged suppression of the blood flow to the external carotid vasculature, in accordance with experimental evidence. The inclusion of peripheral control via baroreflex at the external carotid vasculature did not assist cerebral autoregulation, thus we raise the hypothesis that baroreflex may act on the head and neck vasculatures but this action has negligible effects on regulation of cerebral blood flow. When autoregulation is impaired, results suggest that the blood flow of the brain and of the head and neck present similar dynamics, while they are weakly coupled when autoregulation is intact. The model also provides a mechanistic explanation of the protection brought by cerebral autoregulation to the microvasculature and to the brain parenchyma. Our model forms the foundation for predicting the interference introduced by the superficial tissue to nonivasive sensors.",

    "abstract": "Domestic pigs produce twice as many offspring as wild boars, but little is known about the effects of selection pressures for increased productivity on pig behavior and welfare. From an evolutionary perspective, producing larger litters is expected to increase parent-offspring conflict, which may help to explain why piglets from larger litters are more likely to die by starvation or infant-crushing. Our goals were to identify behavioral and physiological correlates of variation in maternal care that may be useful as selection criteria in breeding programs to improve pig welfare. We observed eleven sows regularly during their lactational period and recorded their hourly postural changes and the proportion of time that piglets had contact with teats (nursing contact) or any physical contact with the sow (social contact). As a potential physiological indicator of maternal care, we measured oxytocin concentrations in 119 saliva samples from sows following observations. Samples were extracted and measured in an Enzyme Immunoassay. As a biological validation, we measured changes in salivary oxytocin during parturition in an additional eleven sows. Laboratory validations confirmed that the assay is suitable for measuring salivary oxytocin in pigs, and oxytocin increased almost three-fold during parturition. Sows nursing contact was positively correlated with social contact and negatively correlated with postural changes. Sow oxytocin concentrations were predicted by their nursing contact, but not by their overall social contact with piglets. We compare our results with current evidence regarding best practice methods for salivary oxytocin measurements and discuss the potential to use indicators of maternal care as selection criteria to improve pig welfare.",

    "abstract": "How traits evolve to produce novelty or stasis is an open question in biology. We investigate this question in Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana that employs explosive fracture to disperse its seeds. This trait evolved through key morphomechanical innovations that distinguish the otherwise very similar, dehiscent fruit of these two species. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we show that dehiscence zone formation is absolutely required for explosive fracture in C. hirsuta, and is controlled by the bHLH transcription factor INDEHISCENT (IND). Using mutant screens, we identified the MADS-box transcription factor FRUITFULL (FUL) as a negative regulator of IND in C. hirsuta. Although FUL function is conserved in C. hirsuta, the consequences of IND mis-expression differ in ful mutants of C. hirsuta versus A. thaliana. In ful mutants of both species, valve tissue is replaced by dehiscence zone tissue, which comprises two distinct cell types: lignified layer and separation layer cells. While A. thaliana ful mutants develop stunted fruit with ectopic lignified layer cells, C. hirsuta ful mutants have elongated fruit with ectopic separation layer cells. We show that IND dose determines the proportion of these two cell types in ectopic dehiscence zones. We also show that the extent of ectopic lignification caused by IND mis-expression determines fruit length. Our findings indicate developmental system drift in the conserved gene network patterning dehiscent fruit in two related Brassicaceae species.",

Such rewiring may be understood as resource re-allocation under cellular constraints. Eukaryal cells contain metabolically active organelles such as mitochondria, competing for cytosolic space and resources, and the nature of the relevant cellular constraints remain to be determined for such cells. Here we developed a comprehensive metabolic model of the yeast cell, based on its full metabolic reaction network extended with protein synthesis and degradation reactions (16304 reactions in total). The model predicts metabolic fluxes and corresponding protein expression by constraining compartment-specific protein pools and maximising growth rate. Comparing model predictions with quantitative experimental data revealed that under glucose limitation, a mitochondrial constraint limits growth at the onset of ethanol formation - known as the Crabtree effect. Under sugar excess, however, a constraint on total cytosolic volume dictates overflow metabolism. Our comprehensive model thus identifies condition-dependent and compartment-specific constraints that can explain metabolic strategies and protein expression profiles from growth rate optimization, providing a framework to understand metabolic adaptation in eukaryal cells.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is the most prominent intrinsic connectivity network, serving as a key architecture of the brains functional organization. Conversely, dysregulated DMN is characteristic of major neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the field still lacks mechanistic insights into the regulation of the DMN and effective interventions for DMN dysregulation. The current study approached this problem by manipulating neural synchrony, particularly, alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations, a dominant intrinsic oscillatory activity that has been increasingly associated with the DMN in both function and physiology. Using high-definition (HD) alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (-tACS) to stimulate the cortical source of alpha oscillations, in combination with simultaneous EEG-fMRI, we demonstrated that -tACS (vs. sham control) not only augmented EEG alpha oscillations but also strengthened fMRI and (source-level) alpha connectivity within the core of the DMN. Importantly, increase in alpha oscillations mediated the DMN connectivity enhancement. These findings thus identify a mechanistic link between alpha oscillations and DMN functioning. That transcranial alpha modulation can upregulate the DMN further highlights an effective non-invasive intervention to normalize DMN functioning in various disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the brains functional organization, the default mode network (DMN) represents a key architecture, whose dysregulation is involved in a host of major neuropsychiatric disorders. However, insights into the regulation of the DMN remain scarce. Through neural synchrony, the alpha-frequency oscillation represents another key underpinning of the brains organization and is thought to share an inherent interdependence with the DMN. Here, we demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation of alpha oscillations (-tACS) not only augmented alpha activity but also strengthened connectivity of the DMN, with the former serving as a mediator of the latter. These findings reveal that alpha oscillations can support DMN functioning. In addition, they identify an effective non-invasive approach to regulate the DMN via -tACS.",

    "abstract": "Insects adapt their response to stimuli, such as odours, according to their pairing with positive or negative reinforcements, such as sugar or shock. Recent electrophysiological and imaging findings in Drosophila melanogaster allow detailed examination of the neural mechanisms supporting the acquisition, forgetting and assimilation of memories. We propose that this data can be explained by the combination of a dopaminergic plasticity rule that supports a variety of synaptic strength change phenomena, and a circuit structure (derived from neuroanatomy) between dopaminergic and output neurons that creates different roles for specific neurons. Computational modelling shows that this circuit allows for rapid memory acquisition, transfer from short-term to long-term, and exploration/exploitation trade-off. The model can reproduce the observed changes in the activity of each of the identified neurons in conditioning paradigms and can be used for flexible behavioural control.",

Despite the positive effects, several issues regarding the way that levodopa changes brain activities have remained unclear.\n\nMethodsA combined strategy using EEG data and graph theory was used for investigating how levodopa changed connectome and processing hubs of the brain during resting-state. Obtained results were subjected to ANOVA test and multiple-comparison post-hoc correction procedure.\n\nResultsResults showed that graph topology of PD patients was not significantly different with the healthy group during eyes-closed condition while in eyes-open condition statistical significant differences were found. The main effect of levodopa medication was observed for gamma-band activity of the brain in which levodopa changed the brain connectome toward a star-like topology. Considering the beta subband of EEG data, graph leaf number increased following levodopa medication in PD patients. Enhanced brain connectivity in gamma band and reduced beta band connections in basal ganglia were also observed after levodopa medication.

However, loss of Tfh cells and GCs has been observed in patients with severe COVID-19. As T cell-B cell interactions and immunoglobulin class switching still occur in these patients, non-canonical pathways of antibody production may be operative during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that both Tfh-dependent and -independent antibodies were induced against SARS-CoV-2 as well as influenza A virus. Tfh-independent responses were mediated by a population we call lymph node (LN)-Th1 cells, which remain in the LN and interact with B cells outside of GCs to promote high-affinity but broad-spectrum antibodies. Strikingly, antibodies generated in the presence and absence of Tfh cells displayed similar neutralization potency against homologous SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.351 variant of concern. These data support a new paradigm for the induction of B cell responses during viral infection that enables effective, neutralizing antibody production to complement traditional GCs and even compensate for GCs damaged by viral inflammation.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryComplementary pathways of antibody production mediate neutralizing responses to SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough progressive COVID-19 vaccinations provide a significant reduction of infection rate in the short-to mid-term, effective COVID-19 treatments will continue to be an urgent need.\n\nMethodsWe have functionally characterized the anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hIG) prepared from human COVID-19 convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization was evaluated by four different methodologies (plaque reduction, virus induced cytotoxicity, TCID50 reduction and immunofluorimetry-based methodology) performed at four different laboratories and using four geographically different SARS-CoV-2 isolates (one each from USA and Italy; two from Spain). Two of the isolates contained the D614G mutation. Neutralization capacity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 straom and variants (D614G mutant, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants) was evaluated using a pseudovirus platform expressing the corresponding spike (S) protein. The capacity to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was also evaluated.\n\nResultsAll the SARS-CoV-2 isolates tested were effectively neutralized by hIG solutions. This was confirmed by all four methodologies showing potent neutralization capacity. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were effectively neutralized as demonstrated using the pseudovirus platform. The hIG solutions had the capacity to induce ADCC and ADCP against SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins but not the E protein. Under our experimental conditions, very low concentrations (25-100 {micro}g IgG/mL) were required to induce both effects. Besides the S protein, we observed a clear and potent effect triggered by antibodies in the hIG solutions against the SARS-CoV-2 N protein.\n\nConclusionsThese results show that, beyond neutralization, other IgG Fc-dependent pathways may play a role in the protection from and/or resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection when using hIG COVID-19 products. This could be especially relevant for the treatment of more neutralization resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",

Syncytia form when SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expressed on the surface of infected cells interacts with the ACE2 receptor on neighbouring cells. The syncytia forming potential of spike variant proteins remain poorly characterized. Here, we first assessed Alpha and Beta spread and fusion in cell cultures. Alpha and Beta replicated similarly to D614G reference strain in Vero, Caco-2, Calu-3 and primary airway cells. However, Alpha and Beta formed larger and more numerous syncytia. Alpha, Beta and D614G fusion was similarly inhibited by interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs).

    "abstract": "The change of dietary habits in Western societies, including reduced consumption of fiber, is linked to alterations in gut microbial ecology. Nevertheless, mechanistic connections between diet-induced microbiota changes that affect colonization resistance and enteric pathogen susceptibility are still emerging. We sought to investigate how a diet devoid of soluble plant fibers impacts the structure and function of a conventional gut microbiota in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice and how such changes alter susceptibility to a rodent enteric pathogen. We show that absence of dietary fiber intake leads to shifts in the abundances of specific taxa, microbiome-mediated erosion of the colonic mucus barrier, a reduction of intestinal barrier-promoting short-chain fatty acids, and increases in markers of mucosal barrier integrity disruption. Importantly, our results highlight that these low fiber diet-induced changes in the gut microbial ecology collectively contribute to a lethal colitis by the mucosal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which is used as a mouse model for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively). Our study indicates that modern, low-fiber Western diets might make individuals more prone to infection by enteric pathogens via the disruption of mucosal barrier integrity by diet-driven changes in the gut microbiota, illustrating possible implications for EPEC and EHEC infections.",

PON have previously been reported to inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in mammalian airways and skin. An innate immune role for PON in urinary tract infection has not previously been reported. We performed western blots for PON1 in urine from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI), and also tested UTI urine for the presence of AHLs using a cellular reporter system. Urine sample microbiota was assessed through sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker gene. We report here that PON1 was not found in the urine of control subjects, however, in patients with UTI, PON1 was associated with the presence of E. coli in urine. AHLs, but not PON, were found in the bulk urine of those with P. aeruginosa UTI. Microbial consortia of PON positive UTI urine was found to be distinct from PON negative UTI urine; differentially over-represented bacteria in PON positive samples included a number of environmental opportunists. We hypothesize that PON may inhibit the quorum sensing activity of AHLs in UTI, as has previously described in skin and airways.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTargeted therapies seek to selectively eliminate a pathogen without disrupting the resident microbial community. This is even more important when a pathogen like H. pylori resides in stomach, a sensitive microbial ecosystem. Using a probiotic like Lactococcus lactis and bioengineering it to release a guided Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) targeted towards the pathogen offers a pathway to specifically knock-out the deleterious species and not disturbing the stomach microbiome.\n\nResultsThree AMPs, Alyteserin, CRAMP and Laterosporulin, were genetically fused to a guiding peptide MM1, which selectively binds to Vacuolating Toxin A (VacA) of H. pylori and cloned into an excretory vector pTKR inside L. lactis. When cultured together in vitro, the L. lactis bioengineered with guided AMPs selectively killed H. pylori when compared to E. coli or Lactobacillus plantarum, as determined by qPCR. Chemically synthesized Alyteserin and MM1-Alyteserin showed similar preferential inhibition of H. pylori when compared against E. coli, with the MIC of MM1-Alyteserin becoming significantly higher for E. coli than Alytserin whereas no such effet was observed against H. pylori.\n\nConclusionsProbiotics bioengineered to excrete guided AMPs can be a novel and useful approach for combating pathogens without endangering the natural microbial flora. Given the wealth of AMPs and guiding ligands, both natural and synthetic, this approach can be adapted to develop a diverse array of chimeric guided AMPs and can be cloned into probiotics to create a safe and effective alternative to conventional chemical antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "The skin patterns of vertebrates are formed by complex interactions between pigment-producing cells during development. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), a model organism for investigating the underlying patterning processes, display alternating horizontal blue and golden stripes, generated by the self-organisation of three pigment cell-types. Mathematical studies in which these cells are modelled as individual agents communicating via short- and long-range interactions have produced breakthroughs in the understanding of pattern development. These models, incorporating all experimentally evidenced cell-cell interactions, replicate many aspects of wild-type and mutant zebrafish patterns. Although received wisdom suggested that initial iridophore distribution was pivotal in orienting patterning, here we show that growth can override its influence. Altered growth sequences can generate further pattern modulation, including vertical stripes and maze-like patterns. We demonstrate that ventrally-biased (asymmetric) growth of the skin field explains two key zebrafish pattern development features which are otherwise obscure (dorso-ventral pattern asymmetry, and predominant ventral-to-dorsal migration of melanophores) in wild-type and multiple zebrafish mutants, and in the related species Danio nigrofasciatus. By identifying biased growth as a novel patterning mechanism, our study will inform future investigations into the mechanisms and evolution of fish pigment patterning and vertebrate pigment pattern formation. Furthermore, our work has implications for the mechanistic basis of human pigmentation defects.",

The timing of extinctions of these three taxa and of their component lineages supports the idea that the biological crisis in the late Kungurian/early Roadian consisted of a progressive decline in biodiversity throughout the Kungurian.",

This work investigates the evolutionary relationships among these yeasts from a mitochondrial (mt) genomic perspective. A comparative study of 141 yeast mt genomes representing all major phylogenetic lineages of Saccharomycotina was performed, including genome size and content variability, intron and intergenic regions diversity, genetic code alterations and syntenic variation. Findings from this study suggest that mt genome size diversity is the result of a ceaseless random process mainly based on genetic recombination and intron mobility. Gene order analysis revealed conserved syntenic units and many occurring rearrangements, which can be correlated with major evolutionary events as shown by the phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated mt protein matrix. For the first time, molecular dating indicated a slower mt genome divergence rate in the early stages of yeast evolution, in contrast with a faster rate in the late evolutionary stages, compared to their nuclear time divergence. Genetic code reassignments of mt genomes are a perpetual process happening in many different parallel evolutionary steps throughout Saccharomycotina evolution. Overall, this work shows that phylogenetic studies that employ the mt genome of yeasts highlight major evolutionary events.",

TAD boundaries frequently coincide with genome breaks while their deletion is under negative selection, suggesting that TADs facilitate genome rearrangements and evolution. Here, we discovered that genes co-localise by evolutionary age in the human and mouse genomes, resulting in TADs having different proportions of younger and older genes. A major transition in the age co-localisation patterns is observed between the genes born as a result of the vertebrate whole genome duplications (WGDs) or before, and those born afterwards. We also found that primate- and rodent-specific genes are more frequently essential when they are located in  aged TADs and interact to genes that have not duplicated since the WGD. Therefore, the evolutionary success of recent genes may increase when located in TADs with established regulatory networks. Our data suggests that TADs can play a role organising ancestral functions and evolutionary novelty.",

Here, we report a transcription initiation-centric, in-depth characterization of the transposon-derived regulatory landscape of mouse embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that a substantial number of transposable elements, in particular endogenous retroviral elements, carry open chromatin regions that are divergently transcribed into unstable RNAs in a cell-type specific manner, and that these elements contribute to a sizable proportion of active enhancers and gene promoters. We further show that transposon subfamilies contribute differently and distinctly to the pluripotency regulatory program through their repertoires of transcription factor binding sites, shedding light on the formation of regulatory programs and the origins of regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic fermentation with mixed cultures has gained momentum as a bioprocess for its promise to produce platform carboxylates from low-value biomass feedstocks. Anaerobic fermenters are net carbon emitters and their carboxylate yields are limited by electron donor availability. In a new approach to tackle these two disadvantages, we operated two bioreactors fed with acetate and lactate as a model feedstock while recirculating H2/CO2 to stimulate concomitant autotrophic activity. After 42 days of operation, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was predominant and ethylene ([&ge;]1.3 kPa) was added to one of the reactors, inhibiting methanogenesis completely and recovering net carbon fixation (0.20 g CO2 L-1 d-1). When methanogenesis was inhibited, exogenous H2 accounted for 17% of the consumed electron donors. Lactate-to-butyrate selectivity was 101% (88% in the control without ethylene) and lactate-to-caproate selectivity was 17% (2.3% in the control). Community analysis revealed that ethylene caused Methanobacterium to be washed out, giving room to acetogenic bacteria. In contrast to 2-bromoethanosulfonate, ethylene is a scalable methanogenesis inhibition strategy that did not collaterally block i-butyrate formation. By favoring the bacterial share of the community to become mixotrophic, the concept offers a way to simultaneously increase selectivity to medium-chain carboxylates and to develop a carbon-fixing chain elongation process.",

    "abstract": "The worsening obesity epidemic has driven a parallel increase in incidence of type-2 diabetes (T2D) found in 13% of the adult US population. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) is the golden standard surgical treatment for obesity-related T2D. However, over 70% of T2D patient do not meet the NIH criteria for surgery, and many that do, are reluctant to consider such an invasive intervention. Mechanisms behind the antidiabetic effect of RYGB are not clearly understood, but isolation of proximal bowel from nutrient exposure plays a critical role. In this study, we tested the impact of daily administration of an oral gut coating agent, LuCI (Luminal Coating of the Intestine), in controlling weight and insulin resistance. LuCI is not systemically absorbed and provides a transient coating of the proximal intestines and excludes the coated bowel from nutrient contact, thus mimicking the effects of RYGB. We demonstrate that LuCI results in weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity in a rat DIO model. LuCI also appears to replicate hormonal changes seen after RYGB, by increasing post-prandial GLP-1 and GIP levels. LuCI has the potential to replicate the metabolic benefit of surgery and be a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity associated T2D.",

For optimal APDT efficacy, photosensitizers with cationic charges that can permeate bacteria cells and bind intracellular targets are desired to not limit oxidative damage to the outer bacterial structure. Here we report the application of brominated DAPI (Br-DAPI), a water-soluble, DNA-binding photosensitizer for eradication of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (as demonstrated on N99 E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively). We observe intracellular uptake of Br-DAPI, ROS-mediated bacterial cell death via 1- and 2-photon excitation, and selective photocytotoxicity of bacteria over mammalian cells. Photocytotoxicity of both N99 E. coli and B. subtilis occurred at sub-micromolar concentrations (IC50 = 0.2 M - 0.4 M) and low light doses (5-minute irradiation times, 4.5 J cm-2 dose) making it superior to commonly employed APDT phenothiazinium photosensitizers such as methylene blue.

In vivo studies have revealed that exposure to triclosan results in a decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. However mechanistic insights into AChE inhibition by triclosan are missing. Using in vitro AChE activity assay with purified AChE, we show that triclosan acts as a direct inhibitor of AChE and inhibits AChE activity in a dose-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial roles in various aspects of post-transcriptional gene expression; their functions can vary between tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. Identifying RBP target RNAs and investigating whether they are differentially bound by RBPs in different cell types, stages, or conditions could shed light on RBP functions. Although several strategies have been designed to identify RBP targets, they involve complicated biochemical steps and require large quantities of material, and only a few studies using these techniques have been performed in plants. The TRIBE (targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing) method was recently developed to identify RBP targets using a RBP coupled to the catalytic domain of a Drosophila RNA editing enzyme and expressing this fusion protein in vivo. The resulting novel editing events can be identified by sequencing. This technique uses little material and does not require complex biochemical steps, however it is not yet adapted for use in plants.\n\nResultsWe successfully applied an optimized genome-wide TRIBE method in plants. We selected the splicing regulator polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) as a model protein for testing the TRIBE system in the moss Physcomitrium patens. We demonstrated that 13.81% of protein-coding gene transcripts in P. patens are targets of PTB. Most potential PTB binding sites are located in coding sequences and 3 untranslated regions, suggesting that PTB performs multiple functions besides pre-mRNA splicing in this moss. In addition, TRIBE showed reproducible results compared to other methods.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed an alternative method based on the TRIBE system to identify RBP targets in plants globally, and we provide guidance here for its application in plants.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel methodology, namely CRISPR-Engineered Attestation of Mammalian Cells using Physical Unclonable Functions (CREAM-PUFs), which can serve as the cornerstone for formally verifying transactions in human cell line distribution networks. A PUF is a physical entity which provides a measurable output that can be used as a unique and irreproducible identifier for the artifact wherein it is embedded. Popularized by the electronics industry, silicon PUFs leverage the inherent physical variations of semiconductor manufacturing to establish intrinsic security primitives for attesting integrated circuits. Owing to the stochastic nature of these variations and the multitude of steps involved, photo-lithographically manufactured silicon PUFs are impossible to reproduce (thus unclonable). Inspired by the success of silicon PUFs, we sought to exploit a combination of sequence-restricted barcodes and the inherent stochasticity of CRISPR-induced non-homologous end joining DNA error repair to create the first generation of genetic physical unclonable functions in three distinct human cells (HEK293, HCT116, and HeLa). We demonstrate that these CREAM-PUFs are robust (i.e., they repeatedly produce the same output), unique (i.e., they do not coincide with any other identically produced PUF), and unclonable (i.e., they are virtually impossible to replicate). Accordingly, CREAM-PUFs can serve as a foundational principle for establishing provenance attestation protocols for protecting intellectual property and confirming authenticity of engineered cell lines.",

    "abstract": "1.Bacterial quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication system in which specific signals are activated to coordinate, for example, pathogenic behaviors and help bacteria collectively respond to perturbations. QS in Gram-negative bacteria is typically regulated by a N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules-mediated system, homologous of Vibrio fischeri LuxI-R. In many cases, bacteria possess more than one QS system, based on different types of molecules, that interact through a complex regulatory network. Presumably, these configurations have emerged over time from simpler ones through the acquisition of novel players (e.g. transcription factors) that have been successfully integrated into the native regulatory systems. However, the advantages provided by these alternative/additional configurations on QS-related phenotypes is poorly predictable only based on their underlying network structure. Here, we have adopted a modelling approach to infer the possible improvements conferred by the acquisition of additional control over bacterial regulation of QS. We use the Burkholderia genus as a case study because some of these strains, besides the LuxIR-like system (named CepIR), possess an integrated regulatory module named CciIR that interferes with the CepIR system through the implementation of several positive and negative control loops. Being associated to a genomic island (cci island), this additional module is prone to being horizontally transferred, giving rise to a potentially patchy genomic distribution and, in turn, to a complete (CepIR and CciIR systems together) vs. core (CepIR only) organization of QS regulation in this group of microorganisms. By using both deterministic and stochastic modelling we show that, upon their activation, the two regulatory schemes may lead to different phenotypes and to distinct responses to the extracellular concentration of signalling molecules. In particular, our simulations show that the presence of the additional regulatory module may confer specific improvements, including a faster response time and optimized control of QS regulation. Interestingly, some of these features may be particularly advantageous during host invasion, thus highlighting once more the importance of QS in the establishment and maintenance of bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Most known SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), including those approved by the FDA for emergency use, inhibit viral infection by targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Variants of concern (VOC) carrying mutations in the RBD or other regions of S reduce the effectiveness of many nAbs and vaccines by evading neutralization. Therefore, therapies that are less susceptible to resistance are urgently needed. Here, we characterized the memory B-cell repertoire of COVID-19 convalescent donors and analyzed their RBD and non-RBD nAbs. We found that many of the non-RBD-targeting nAbs were specific to the N-terminal domain (NTD). Using neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein (rVSV-SARS2), we defined a panel of potent RBD and NTD nAbs. Next, we used a combination of neutralization-escape rVSV-SARS2 mutants and a yeast display library of RBD mutants to map their epitopes. The most potent RBD nAb competed with hACE2 binding and targeted an epitope that includes residue F490. The most potent NTD nAb epitope included Y145, K150 and W152. As seen with some of the natural VOC, the neutralization potencies of COVID-19 convalescent sera were reduced by 4-16-fold against rVSV-SARS2 bearing Y145D, K150E or W152R spike mutations. Moreover, we found that combining RBD and NTD nAbs modestly enhanced their neutralization potential. Notably, the same combination of RBD and NTD nAbs limited the development of neutralization-escape mutants in vitro, suggesting such a strategy may have higher efficacy and utility for mitigating the emergence of VOC.\n\nImportanceThe US FDA has issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for multiple investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. These mAb therapeutics are solely targeting the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, the N-terminal domain of the spike protein also carries crucial neutralizing epitopes. Here, we show that key mutations in the N-terminal domain can reduce the neutralizing capacity of convalescent COVID-19 sera. We report that a combination of two neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor binding and N-terminal domains may have higher efficacy and is beneficial to combat the emergence of virus variants.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn unicellular organisms such as bacteria and in most viruses, mutations mainly occur during reproduction. Thus, genotypes with a high birth rate should have a higher mutation rate. However, standard models of asexual adaptation such as the  replicator-mutator equation often neglect this generation-time effect. In this study, we investigate the emergence of a positive dependence between the birth rate and the mutation rate in models of asexual adaptation and the consequences of this dependence. We show that it emerges naturally at the population scale, based on a large population limit of a stochastic time-continuous individual-based model with elementary assumptions. We derive a reaction-diffusion framework that describes the evolutionary trajectories and steady states in the presence of this dependence. When this model is coupled with a phenotype to fitness landscape with two optima, one for birth, the other one for survival, a new trade-off arises in the population. Compared to the standard approach with a constant mutation rate, the symmetry between birth and survival is broken. Our analytical results and numerical simulations show that the trajectories of mean phenotype, mean fitness and the stationary phenotype distribution are in sharp contrast with those displayed for the standard model. The reason for this is that the usual weak selection limit does not hold in a complex landscape with several optima associated with different values of the birth rate. Here, we obtain trajectories of adaptation where the mean phenotype of the population is initially attracted by the birth optimum, but eventually converges to the survival optimum, following a hook-shaped curve which illustrates the antagonistic effects of mutation on adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The phylum Perkinsozoa is an aquatic parasite lineage that has devastating effects on commercial and natural mollusc populations, and also comprises parasites of algae, fish and amphibians. They are related to, and share much of their biology with, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans and thus offer excellent genetic models for both parasitological and evolutionary studies. Genetic transformation has been previously achieved for select Perkinsus spp. but with few tools for transgene expression and only limited selection efficacy. We thus sought to expand the power of experimental genetic tools for Perkinsus marinus -- the principal perkinsozoan model to date. We constructed a modular plasmid assembly system that enables expression of multiple genes simultaneously. We developed an efficient selection system for three drugs, puromycin, bleomycin and blasticidin, that achieves transformed cell populations in as little as three weeks. We developed and quantified eleven new promoters of variable expression strength. Furthermore, we identified that genomic integration of transgenes is predominantly via non-homologous recombination and often involves transgene fragmentation including deletion of some introduced elements. To counter these dynamic processes, we show that bi-cistronic transcripts using the viral 2A peptides can couple selection systems to the maintenance of the expression of a transgene of interest. Collectively, these new tools and insights provide new capacity to efficiently genetically modify and study Perkinsus as an aquatic parasite and evolutionary model.",

    "abstract": "A decline in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function is associated with the loss of skeletal muscle size and function during knee osteoarthritis (OA). We have recently reported that the 12-weeks of dietary rapamycin (Rap, 14ppm), with or without metformin (Met, 1000ppm), increased plasma glucose and OA severity in male Dunkin Hartley (DH) guinea pigs, a model of naturally occurring, age-related OA. The purpose of the current study was to determine if increased OA severity after dietary Rap and Rap+Met was accompanied by impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emissions were evaluated in permeabilized muscle fibers via high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry using either a saturating bolus or titration of ADP. Rap and Rap+Met decreased complex I (CI)-linked respiration and increased ADP sensitivity, consistent with previous findings in patients with end-stage OA. Rap also tended to decrease mitochondrial H2O2 emissions, however, this was no longer apparent after normalizing to respiration. The decrease in CI-linked respiration was accompanied with lower CI protein abundance. This is the first inquiry into how lifespan extending treatments Rap and Rap+Met can influence skeletal muscle mitochondria in a model of age-related OA. Collectively, our data suggest that Rap with or without Met inhibits CI-linked capacity and increases ADP sensitivity in DH guinea pigs that have greater OA severity.",

DExD/H box proteins constitute the largest family of trans-acting protein factors involved in this process. Several members of this protein family have been directly implicated in ribosome biogenesis in yeast. In trypanosomes, ribosome biogenesis differs in several features from the process described in yeast. Here, we have identified the DExD/H box helicase Hel66 as being involved in ribosome biogenesis. The protein is unique to Kinetoplastida, localises to the nucleolus and its depletion via RNAi caused a severe growth defect. Loss of the protein resulted in a decrease of global translation and accumulation of rRNA processing intermediates for both the small and large ribosomal subunits. Only a few factors involved in trypanosome rRNA biogenesis have been described so far and our findings contribute to gaining a more comprehensive picture of this essential process.",

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the cause of several human cancers including the endothelial cell (EC) malignancy, Kaposis sarcoma. Unique KSHV genes absent from other human herpesvirus genomes, the \"K-genes\", are important for KSHV replication and pathogenesis. Among these, the kaposin transcript is highly expressed in all phases of infection, but its complex polycistronic nature has hindered functional analysis to date. At least three proteins are produced from the kaposin transcript: Kaposin A (KapA), B (KapB), and C (KapC). To determine the relative contributions of kaposin proteins during KSHV infection, we created a collection of mutant viruses unable to produce kaposin proteins individually or in combination. Kaposin-deficient latent iSLK cell lines displayed reduced viral genome copy number and often exhibited small LANA nuclear bodies; despite this, all were capable of progeny virion production. Primary infection with {Delta}KapB virus revealed decreased LANA expression and viral genome copy number, yet providing KapB protein in trans failed to complement these defects, suggesting a requirement for the kaposin locus in cis. Our previous work showed that KapB was sufficient to recapitulate the elevated proinflammatory cytokine transcripts associated with KS via the disassembly of RNA granules called processing bodies (PBs). We now show that KapB is necessary for PB disassembly during latent KSHV infection. These findings demonstrate that our panel of kaposin-deficient viruses enables precise analysis of the respective contributions of individual kaposin proteins to KSHV replication. Moreover, our mutagenesis approach serves as a guide for the functional analysis of other complex multicistronic viral loci.\n\nImportanceKaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) expresses high levels of the kaposin transcript during both latent and lytic phases of replication. Due to its repetitive, GC-rich nature and polycistronic coding capacity, until now no reagents existed to permit a methodical analysis of the role of individual kaposin proteins in KSHV replication. We report the creation of a panel of recombinant viruses and matched producer cell lines that delete kaposin proteins individually or in combination. We demonstrate the utility of this panel by confirming the requirement of one kaposin translation product to a key KSHV latency phenotype. This study describes a new panel of molecular tools for the KSHV field to enable precise analysis of the roles of individual kaposin proteins during KSHV infection.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway is highly conserved throughout evolution and it plays crucial roles in several developmental and pathological processes. Wnt ligands can act at a considerable distance from their sources and it is therefore necessary to examine not only the Wnt-producing but also the Wnt-receiving cells and tissues to fully appreciate the many functions of this pathway. To monitor Wnt activity, multiple tools have been designed which consist of multimerized Wnt signaling response elements (TCF/LEF binding sites) driving the expression of fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g. GFP, RFP) or of LacZ. The high stability of those reporters leads to a considerable accumulation in cells activating the pathway, thereby making them easily detectable. However, this makes them unsuitable to follow temporal changes of the pathways activity during dynamic biological events. Even though fluorescent transcriptional reporters can be destabilized to shorten their half-lives, this dramatically reduces signal intensities, particularly when applied in vivo. To alleviate these issues, we developed two transgenic quail lines in which high copy number (12x or 16x) of the TCF/LEF binding sites drive the expression of destabilized GFP variants. Translational enhancer sequences derived from viral mRNAs were used to increase signal intensity and specificity. This resulted in transgenic lines efficient for the characterisation of TCF/{beta}-catenin transcriptional dynamic activities during embryogenesis, including using in vivo imaging. Our analyses demonstrate the use of this transcriptional reporter to unveil novel aspects of Wnt signaling, thus opening new routes of investigation into the role of this pathway during amniote embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal uptake or metabolism of folate increases risk of human pregnancy complications, though the mechanism is unclear. Here, we explore how defective folate metabolism influences early development by analysing mice with an Mtrrgt hypomorphic mutation. MTRR is necessary for methyl group utilisation from the folate cycle, and the Mtrrgt allele disrupts this process. We show that the spectrum of phenotypes previously observed in Mtrrgt/gt conceptuses at embryonic day (E) 10.5 is apparent from E8.5 including developmental delay, congenital malformations, and placental phenotypes (e.g., eccentric chorioallantoic attachment). Notably, we report misalignment of some Mtrrgt conceptuses within their implantation sites from E6.5. The degree of skewed growth occurs across a continuum, with eccentric chorioallantoic attachment now re-characterised as a severe form of conceptus misalignment. Additionally, some Mtrrgt/gt conceptuses display twinning. Therefore, we implicate folate metabolism in blastocyst orientation and spacing at implantation. Embryo development is influenced by skewed growth since developmental delay and heart malformations (but not neural tube defects) associate with severe misalignment of Mtrrgt/gt conceptuses. Patterning of trophoblast lineage markers is largely unaffected in skewed Mtrrgt/gt conceptuses at E8.5 indicating trophoblast differentiation was normal when misaligned. Typically, the uterus guides conceptus orientation. Accordingly, we manipulate the maternal Mtrr genotype and assess conceptus alignment. Mtrr+/gt, and Mtrrgt/gt mothers, plus Mtrr+/+ mothers, exhibit misaligned conceptuses at E6.5. While progesterone and/or BMP2 signalling required for decidualisation might be disrupted, normal gross decidual morphology, patterning, and blood perfusion is evident regardless of conceptus alignment, arguing against a uterine defect. Given the important finding that Mtrr+/+ mothers also display conceptus misalignment, a grandparental effect is explored. Multigenerational phenotype inheritance is characteristic of the Mtrrgt model, though the mechanism remains unclear. Genetic pedigree analysis reveals that severe skewing associates with the Mtrr genotype of either maternal grandparent. Moreover, misalignment is independent of the uterus and instead is attributed to an embryonic mechanism based on blastocyst transfer experiments. Overall, our data indicates that abnormal folate metabolism influences conceptus orientation over multiple generations with implications for subsequent development. Our study casts light on the complex role of folate metabolism during development beyond a direct maternal effect.",

Using whole transcriptome sequencing in three species of Viscaceae: V. album, V. crassulae, and Phoradendron leucarpum we were able to confirm transcription of all previously identified genes. However, we did not detect any nad gene transcripts, thus, providing further evidence of the complete loss of complex I in Viscaceae. The results from transcriptome sequencing also revealed that levels and patterns of RNA editing were not different from those found in autotrophic plant species. Hence, RNA editing is not a means of restoring conserved domains or folding sites of the proteins coded for by the divergent mitochondrial genes. Since we were able to recover mitochondrial genes transcripts following a sequencing protocol targeted towards polyadenylated mRNA molecules, it is suggested that mitochondrial genes undergo post-transcriptional polyadenylation in Viscaceae.",

    "abstract": "Alport syndrome (AS) is characterized by glomerular basement membrane (GBM) abnormalities leading to progressive glomerulosclerosis. Mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4 or COL4A5 genes encoding type IV collagen 345 cause AS. Truncated 3, 4, and 5 chains lacking an intact COOH-terminal noncollagenous domain due to a premature termination codon (PTC) cannot assemble into heterotrimers or incorporate into the GBM. Therefore, achieving full-length protein expression is a potential therapy for AS caused by truncating nonsense mutations. Small molecule-based PTC readthrough (PTC-RT) therapy has been well studied in other genetic diseases, but whether PTC-RT is applicable to AS is unexplored. To investigate the feasibility of PTC-RT therapy in AS, we made a cDNA to express COL4A5 fused to a C-terminal NanoLuc luciferase (NLuc) to monitor full-length translation. Full-length COL4A5-NLuc produces luminescence, but mutants truncated due to a PTC do not. To screen for COL4A5 nonsense mutants susceptible to PTC-RT, we introduced 49 individual nonsense mutations found in AS patients into the COL4A5-NLuc cDNA. Luciferase assays revealed that 11 mutations (C29X, S36X, E130X, C1521X, R1563X, C1567X, W1594X, S1632X, R1683X, C1684X and K1689X) were susceptible to PTC-RT induced by G418, which is known to have high readthrough activity. Moreover, we found that some next-generation \"designer\" PTC-RT drugs induced RT, and RT enhancer compounds increased the efficacy of PTC-RT in a G418-susceptible PTC mutant. These results suggest that PTC-RT therapy is a feasible approach for some patients with AS. Our luciferase-based COL4A5 translation reporter system will contribute to further development of PTC-RT therapies in a personalized medicine approach to treating AS.",

DUF1775 domains are found across bacterial phylogeny and bioinformatics analyses indicate that they frequently neighbor domains implicated in copper homeostasis and transport. Here, we investigated whether YcnI can interact with copper and, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) find that it can bind a single Cu(II) ion. We determine the structure of both the apo and copper-bound forms of the protein by X-ray crystallography, uncovering a copper binding site featuring a unique mono-histidine brace ligand set that is highly conserved among DUF1775 domains. These data suggest a possible role for YcnI as a copper chaperone and that DUF1775 domains in other bacterial species may also function in copper homeostasis.",

The margin is immune-cold and preferentially follows developmental-like trajectories to produce astrocyte-like cells. In contrast, injury-like programmes dominate in the bulk, are associated with immune infiltration and generate lowly-proliferative injured neural progenitor-like (iNPCs) cells. In vivo label-retention approaches further demonstrate that iNPCs account for a significant proportion of dormant glioblastoma cells and are induced by interferon signalling within T-cell niches.

We found that HOXB8 acts as a tumor suppressor, counteracting ERK-induced neoplasia. HOXB8 tumor suppressor function in this model relies on a large reversion of the oncogenic transcriptome induced by ERK.

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal dysfunction is an age-related syndrome associated with impaired mitochondrial function and proteostasis. However, few interventions have tested targeting two drivers of musculoskeletal decline. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that stimulates transcription of cytoprotective genes and improves mitochondrial function. We hypothesized daily treatment with a Nrf2 activator in Hartley guinea pigs, a model of age-related musculoskeletal dysfunction, attenuates the progression of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired proteostasis, preserving musculoskeletal function. We treated 2-month- and 5-month-old male and female Hartley guinea pigs for 3 and 10 months, respectively, with the phytochemical Nrf2 activator PB125 (Nrf2a). Longitudinal assessments of voluntary mobility were measured using Any-Maze open-field enclosure monitoring. Cumulative skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates were measured using deuterium oxide over the final 30 days of treatment. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption in permeabilized soleus muscles was measured using ex vivo high resolution respirometry. In both sexes, Nrf2a 1) increased electron transfer system capacity; 2) attenuated the disease/age-related decline in coupled and uncoupled mitochondrial respiration; and 3) attenuated declines in protein synthesis in the myofibrillar, mitochondrial, and cytosolic subfractions of the soleus. These improvements were not associated with statistically significant prolonged maintenance of voluntary mobility in guinea pigs. Collectively, these results demonstrate that treatment with an oral Nrf2 activator contributes to maintenance of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and proteostasis in a pre-clinical model of musculoskeletal decline. Further investigation is necessary to determine if these improvements are also accompanied by slowed progression of other aspects of musculoskeletal decline.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic accumulation of the RNA/DNA binding protein, fused in sarcoma (FUS), into inclusions is a common hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology. We have previously shown that DNA damage can trigger the cytoplasmic accumulation of an N-terminally phosphorylated FUS. However, the functional consequences of N-terminal FUS phosphorylation are unknown. To gain insight into this question, we utilized proximity-dependent biotin labeling via ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2) paired with mass-spectrometry (MS) to investigate whether N-terminal phosphorylation shifts the FUS protein-protein interaction network (interactome), and subsequently, its function. We report the first comparative analysis of the interactomes for three FUS variants: homeostatic wild-type FUS (FUS WT), a phosphomimetic variant of FUS (a proxy for N-terminally phosphorylated FUS, FUS PM), and a toxic FUS P525L mutant (a mutation that causes juvenile ALS, FUS P525L). Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026578. We demonstrate that compared to FUS WT and FUS P525L, the FUS PM interactome uniquely enriches for a set of cytoplasmic proteins that mediate mRNA metabolism and translation and nuclear proteins involved in spliceosome and DNA repair functions, respectively. We further identify and validate three proteins, VPS35, MOV10, and CLTA, as novel interacting partners of all three FUS variants. Lastly, we provide functional evidence that N-terminally phosphorylated FUS may disrupt homeostatic translation and steady state levels of specific mRNA transcripts. Taken together, these results highlight phosphorylation as a unique modulator of the FUS interactome and function.",

    "abstract": "The neuropilin receptors and their secreted semaphorin ligands play key roles in brain circuit development by regulating numerous crucial neuronal processes, including the maturation of synapses and migration of GABAergic interneurons. Consistent with its developmental roles, the neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) locus contains polymorphisms in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Nrp2 deficient mice show autism-like behavioral deficits and propensity to develop seizures. In order to determine the pathophysiology in Nrp2 deficiency, we examined the hippocampal numbers of interneuron subtypes and inhibitory regulation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in mice lacking one or both copies of Nrp2. Immunostaining for interneuron subtypes revealed that Nrp2-/- mice have reduced number of parvalbumin, somatostatin and Neuropeptide Y cells, mainly in CA1. Whole cell recordings identified reduced firing and hyperpolarized shift in resting membrane potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons from Nrp2+/- and Nrp2-/- mice compared to age-matched wild-type controls indicating decrease in intrinsic excitability. Simultaneously, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) are reduced in Nrp2 deficient mice. A convulsive dose of kainic acid evoked electrographic and behavioral seizures with significantly shorter latency, longer duration and higher severity in Nrp2-/- compared to Nrp2+/+ animals. Finally, Nrp2+/- and Nrp2-/-, but not Nrp2+/+, mice have impaired cognitive flexibility demonstrated by reward-based reversal learning, a task associated with hippocampal circuit function. Together these data demonstrate a broad reduction in interneuron subtypes and compromised inhibition in CA1 of Nrp2-/- mice, which could contribute to the heightened seizure susceptibility and behavioral deficits consistent with an ASD/epilepsy phenotype.",

Oncomodulin (OCM) is a Ca2+ binding protein preferentially expressed in outer hair cells of the cochlea and few other specialized cell types. Here, we expand on our previous reports and show that OCM prevents early progressive hearing loss in mice of two different genetic backgrounds: CBA/CaJ and C57BI/6J. In both backgrounds, genetic disruption of Ocm leads to early progressive hearing loss as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). In both strains, loss of Ocm reduced hearing across lifetime (hearing span) by more than 50% relative to wild type (WT). Even though the two WT strains have very different hearing spans, OCM plays a considerable and similar role within their genetic environment to regulate hearing function. The accelerated ARHL of the Ocm KO illustrates the importance of Ca2+ signaling in maintaining hearing health.",

    "abstract": "Over 99% of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) are teleosts, a clade that comprises half of all living vertebrates that have diversified across virtually all fresh and saltwater ecosystems. This ecological diversity raises the question of how the immunogenetic diversity required to persist under heterogeneous pathogen pressures evolved. The teleost genome duplication (TGD) has been hypothesized as the evolutionary event that provided the genomic substrate for rapid genomic evolution and innovation. However, studies of putative teleost-specific innate immune receptors have been largely limited to comparisons either among teleosts or between teleosts and distantly related vertebrate clades such as tetrapods. Here we describe and characterize the receptor diversity of two clustered innate immune gene families in the teleost sister lineage: Holostei (bowfin and gars). Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we provide a detailed investigation of the phylogenetic history and conserved synteny of gene clusters encoding diverse immunoglobulin domain-containing proteins (DICPs) and novel immune-type receptors (NITRs). These data demonstrate an ancient linkage of DICPs to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and reveal an evolutionary origin of NITR variable-joining (VJ) exons that predate the TGD by at least 50 million years. Further characterizing the receptor diversity of Holostean DICPs and NITRs illuminates a sequence diversity that rivals the diversity of these innate immune receptor families in many teleosts. Taken together, our findings provide important historical context for the evolution of these gene families that challenge prevailing expectations concerning the consequences of the TGD during actinopterygiian evolution.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTargeted therapies seek to selectively eliminate a pathogen without disrupting the resident microbial community. This is even more important when a pathogen like H. pylori resides in stomach, a sensitive microbial ecosystem. Using a probiotic like Lactococcus lactis and bioengineering it to release a guided Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) targeted towards the pathogen offers a pathway to specifically knock-out the deleterious species and not disturbing the stomach microbiome.\n\nResultsThree AMPs, Alyteserin, CRAMP and Laterosporulin, were genetically fused to a guiding peptide MM1, which selectively binds to Vacuolating Toxin A (VacA) of H. pylori and cloned into an excretory vector pTKR inside L. lactis. When cultured together in vitro, the L. lactis bioengineered with guided AMPs selectively killed H. pylori when compared to E. coli or Lactobacillus plantarum, as determined by qPCR. Chemically synthesized Alyteserin and MM1-Alyteserin showed similar preferential inhibition of H. pylori when compared against E. coli, with the MIC of MM1-Alyteserin becoming significantly higher for E. coli than Alytserin whereas no such effet was observed against H. pylori.\n\nConclusionsProbiotics bioengineered to excrete guided AMPs can be a novel and useful approach for combating pathogens without endangering the natural microbial flora. Given the wealth of AMPs and guiding ligands, both natural and synthetic, this approach can be adapted to develop a diverse array of chimeric guided AMPs and can be cloned into probiotics to create a safe and effective alternative to conventional chemical antibiotics.",

While deep-learning-based methods improved in sophistication recently, time-consuming human intervention processes remain major roadblocks for efficient and accurate analysis of organelle ultrastructure. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed a deep-learning image analysis platform called Python-based Human-In-the-LOop Workflows (PHILOW). Our implementation of an iterative segmentation algorithm and Three-Axis-Prediction method not only improved segmentation speed, but also provided unprecedented ultrastructural detail of whole mitochondria and cristae. Using PHILOW, we found that 42% of cristae surface exhibits tubular structures that are not recognizable in light microscopy and 2D electron microscopy. Furthermore, we unraveled a fundamental new regulatory function for the dynamin-related GTPase Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) in controlling the balance between lamellar versus tubular cristae subdomains.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsCell-cell adhesion structures (desmosomes and, especially, tight junctions) are known to play important roles in control of transepithelial permeability in the colon. The involvement of cell-matrix interactions in permeability control is less clear. The goals of the present study were to: i) determine if disruption of colon epithelial cell interactions with the extracellular matrix alters permeability control and ii) determine if increasing the elaboration of protein components of cell-matrix adhesion complexes improves permeability control and mitigates the effects of cell-matrix disruption.\n\nMethodsHuman colon organoids were interrogated for transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) under control conditions (0.25 mM calcium) and in the presence of Aquamin(R), a multi-mineral product, at a level providing 1.5 mM calcium. The effects of Aquamin(R) on cell-matrix adhesion protein expression were determined in a proteomic screen and by Western blotting. In parallel, TEER was assessed in the presence of a function-blocking antibody directed at an epitope in the C-terminal region of laminin 3 chain.\n\nResultsTreatment of colon organoids with Aquamin(R) increased the expression of multiple basement membrane and hemidesmosomal proteins as well as keratin 8 and 18. TEER values were higher in the presence of Aquamin(R) than they were under control conditions. Anti-laminin antibody reduced TEER values under all conditions but was most effective in the absence of Aquamin(R), where laminin expression was low and TEER values were lower to begin with.\n\nConclusionsThese findings provide evidence that cell-matrix interactions contribute to permeability control in the colon. They suggest that the elaboration of proteins important to cell-matrix interactions can be increased in human colon organoids by exposure to a multi-mineral natural product. Increasing the elaboration of such proteins may help to mitigate the consequences of disrupting cell-matrix interactions on permeability control.",

To test whether these mutations have differential effects on otic gene expression, we engineered four BOR mutations in Xenopus six1 and targeted mutant protein expression to the neural crest and cranial placode precursor cells in wild-type embryos. Changes in the otic expression of putative Six1 targets and/or co-factors were monitored by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. We found that each mutant had a different combination of effects. The V17E mutant reduced eya2, tspan13, zbtb16 and pa2g4 otic vesicle expression at a frequency indistinguishable from wild-type Six1, but reduced prdm1 more and spry1 less compared to wild-type Six1. For most of these genes, the R110W, W122R and Y129C mutants were significantly less repressive compared to wild-type Six1. Their individual effects varied according to the level at which they were expressed. The R110W, W122R and Y129C mutants also often expanded prdm1 otic expression. Since previous studies showed that all four mutants are transcriptionally deficient and differ in their ability to interact with co-factors such as Eya1, we propose that altered co-factor interactions at the mutated sites differentially interfere with their ability to drive otic gene expression.",

The binding of the potent CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor, at a site in the central aqueous cavity is mediated by transmembrane -helices 3,6,10,11 & 12.

    "abstract": "Flapping, flexible insect wings deform during flight from aerodynamic and inertial forces. This deformation is believed to enhance aerodynamic and energetic performance. However, the predictive models used to describe flapping wing fluid-structure interaction (FSI) often rely on high fidelity computational solvers such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). Such models require lengthy solution times and may obscure the physical insights available to analytical models. In this work, we develop a reduced order model (ROM) of a wing experiencing single-degree-of-freedom flapping. The ROM is based on deformable blade element theory and the assumed mode method. We compare the ROM to a high-fidelity CFD/FEA model and a simple experiment comprised of a mechanical flapper actuating a paper wing. Across a range of flapping-to-natural frequency ratios relevant to flying insects, the ROM predicts wingtip deflection five orders of magnitude faster than the CFD/FEA model. Both models are resolved to predict wingtip deflection within 30% of experimentally measured values. The ROM is then used to identify how the physical forces acting on the wing scale relative to one another. We show that, in addition to inertial and aerodynamic forces, added mass and aerodynamic damping influence wing deformation nontrivially.",

Oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a common event, driving aggressive tumour growth, drug resistance, and shorter survival in patients1-4. Currently, the impact of non-chromosomal oncogene inheritance--random identity by descent--is not well understood. Neither is the impact of ecDNA on variation and selection. Here, integrating mathematical modeling, unbiased image analysis, CRISPR-based ecDNA tagging, and live-cell imaging, we identify a set of basic \"rules\" for how random ecDNA inheritance drives oncogene copy number and distribution, resulting in extensive intratumoural ecDNA copy number heterogeneity and rapid adaptation to metabolic stress and targeted cancer treatment. Observed ecDNAs obligatorily benefit host cell survival or growth and can change within a single cell cycle. In studies ranging from well-curated, patient-derived cancer cell cultures to clinical tumour samples from patients with glioblastoma and neuroblastoma treated with oncogene-targeted drugs, we show how these ecDNA inheritance \"rules\" can predict, a priori, some of the aggressive features of ecDNA-containing cancers. These properties are entailed by their ability to rapidly change their genomes in a way that is not possible for cancers driven by chromosomal oncogene amplification. These results shed new light on how the non-chromosomal random inheritance pattern of ecDNA underlies poor outcomes for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Most TP53 mutations are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain, which in addition to loss of canonical p53 activity, frequently confer gain-of-function (GOF) aberrant transcriptional activity through mutant p53 localization to non-canonical genes. GOF phenotypes differ by mutation and cell identity and are reported to include increased proliferation, migration, metabolic reprogramming, and therapy resistance. We found that several recurring p53 mutations exhibit a sex-bias in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). In vitro and in vivo analysis of three mutations, p53R172H, p53Y202C, and p53Y217C revealed sex differences in each mutations ability to transform primary mouse astrocytes. p53R172H exhibited a far greater ability to transform female astrocytes than males, p53Y202C transformed both male and female astrocytes with a small male bias, and p53Y217C only exhibited GOF transformation effects in male astrocytes. These phenotypic differences reflect an interaction between sex and GOF mutation to drive unique gene expression patterns in cancer pathways. We found that mutant p53 exhibits sex and mutation specific aberrant genomic localization to the transcriptional start sites of upregulated genes, whose promoter regions were enriched for different sets of transcription factor DNA-binding motifs. Together, our data establish a novel paradigm for sex specific mutant p53 GOF activity in GBM with implications for all cancer.",

We demonstrate that this novel degradation-based biosensor accurately reports on cellular changes in GA levels and perception during development. We used this biosensor to map GA signalling activity in the SAM. We show that high GA signalling is found primarily in cells located between organ primordia that are the precursors of internodes. By gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we further demonstrate that GAs regulate cell division plane orientation to establish the typical cellular organisation of internodes, thus contributing to internode specification in the SAM.",

    "abstract": "The speed of development, versatility and efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines have been amply demonstrated in the case of SARS-CoV-2. DNA vaccines represent an important alternative since they induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in human trials. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co- immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site, the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal/intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly, the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.\n\nAuthor summaryAnti-Spike neutralizing antibodies provide strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models, and correlate with protection in humans, supporting the notion that induction of strong humoral immunity is key to protection. We show induction of robust antibody and T cell responses by different Spike DNA-based vaccine regimens able to effectively mediate protection and to control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rhesus macaque model. This study provides the opportunity to compare vaccines able to induce different humoral and cellular immune responses in an effort to develop durable immunity against the SARS-CoV-2. A vaccine regimen comprising simultaneous co-immunization of DNA and Protein at the same anatomical site showed best neutralizing abilities and was more effective than DNA alone in inducing protective immune responses and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, an expansion of the DNA vaccine regimen to include co-immunization with Spike protein may be of advantage also for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Efficient replication of HIV-1 depends on balanced levels of host cell components, including cellular splicing factors. Type I interferons (IFN-I), playing a crucial role in the innate immune defense against viral infections, are well known to induce the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) including potent host restriction factors. Not so well known is, that IFN-repressed genes (IRepGs) also affect viral infections by downregulating host dependency factors that are essential for viral replication. So far, knowledge about IRepGs involved in HIV-1 infection is very limited. Here, we demonstrate that expression levels of the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) were repressed upon treatment with IFN subtypes in HIV-1 susceptible cell lines as well as primary cells. Furthermore, we could demonstrate in two independent patient cohorts that HIV-1 infection and the concomitant inflammation during the acute and chronic phase, resulted in the strong induction of ISGs, but at the same time significantly repressed SRSF1. 4sU-labeling of newly transcribed mRNAs revealed that IFN-mediated repression of SRSF1 originated from a transcriptional shutdown. Experimental downregulation as well as overexpression of SRSF1 expression levels resulted in crucial changes in HIV-1 LTR-transcription, alternative splice site usage and virus production. While lower SRSF1 levels resulted in low vif mRNA levels and thus severely reduced viral infectivity, higher levels of SRSF1 impaired LTR-Tat-activity and HIV-1 particle production.\n\nOur data highlight the so far undescribed role of SRSF1 acting as an IFN-repressed cellular dependency factor decisively regulating HIV-1 post integration steps.\n\nAuthor SummaryIFN-I play a central role in the innate immune defense against viral infections by regulating the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and interferon repressed genes (IRepGs). The stimulation of host restriction factors and the reduction of host dependency factors decisively affects the efficiency of HIV-1 replication. After the stable integration of the provirus into the host chromosome, HIV-1 exploits the host cell transcription and splicing machinery for its replication. A network of conserved splice sites and splicing regulatory elements maintain balanced levels of viral transcripts essential for virus production and immune evasion.\n\nWe demonstrate the so far undescribed role of the splicing factor SRSF1 as an IRepG crucially involved in HIV-1 RNA processing. In HIV-1 infected individuals, we observed inversely proportional expression of high ISG15 and low SRSF1 levels, which were restored in ART treated patients. We could demonstrate, that IFN-I stimulation of HIV-1 target cells resulted in a significant repression of SRSF1 RNA and protein levels. Since low SRSF1 expression decisively reduced HIV-1 vif mRNA levels, a severe impairment of viral replication was observed in APOBEC3G expressing cells. As overexpression negatively affected HIV-1 LTR transcription and virus production, balanced levels of SRSF1 are indispensable for efficient replication.",

    "abstract": "Stress responses have evolved to quickly and appropriately deal with environmental stressors in order to secure or restore homeostasis. Since the regulation of stress hormones plays a key adaptive role, the regulatory processes controlling stress hormones levels may be under high selective pressure. The social environment during early life (parents and litter characteristics) strongly affects ontogeny of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In cooperative breeders, offspring are also confronted with helpers but whether and how variation in the helping context can affect HPA axis responsiveness of offspring remains unanswered. Combining dexamethasone suppression and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests, we investigated the link between the social environment and the characteristics of the HPA axis at the early stages of life in wild Alpine marmots. We show that when raised in the presence of helpers, marmot pups exhibit a greater capacity not only to mount, but also to turn off a stress response. The capacity to mount a stress response was also higher as the pups were raised in large litters. Determining impacts of such social modulation of the HPA axis functioning on individual fitness would make an important contribution to our understanding of the evolution of cooperative breeding.",

    "abstract": "Transposable element insertions (TEIs) are an important source of genomic innovation by contributing to plant adaptation, speciation, and the production of new varieties. The often large, complex plant genomes make identifying TEIs from short reads difficult and expensive. Moreover, rare somatic insertions that reflect mobilome dynamics are difficult to track using short reads. To address these challenges, we combined Cas9-targeted Nanopore sequencing (CANS) with the novel pipeline NanoCasTE to trace both genetically inherited and somatic TEIs in plants. We performed CANS of the EVADE (EVD) retrotransposon in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and rapidly obtained up to 40x sequence coverage. Analysis of hemizygous T-DNA insertion sites and genetically inherited insertions of the EVD transposon in the ddm1 genome uncovered the crucial role of DNA methylation in shaping EVD insertion preference. We also investigated somatic transposition events of the ONSEN transposon family, finding that genes that are downregulated during heat stress are preferentially targeted by ONSENs. Finally, we detected hypomethylation of novel somatic insertions for two ONSENs. CANS and NanoCasTE are effective tools for detecting TEIs and exploring mobilome organization in plants in response to stress and in different genetic backgrounds, as well as screening T-DNA insertion mutants and transgenic plants.",

    "abstract": "Beta human papillomavirus ({beta}-HPV) are hypothesized to make DNA damage more mutagenic and potentially more carcinogenic. Double strand breaks in DNA (DSBs) are the most deleterious DNA lesion. They are typically repaired by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR occurs after DNA replication while NHEJ can occur at any point in the cell cycle. They are not thought to occur in the same cell at the same time. By destabilizing p300, {beta}-HPV type 8 protein E6 ({beta}-HPV8 E6) attenuates both repair pathways. However, {beta}-HPV8 E6 delays rather than abrogates DSB repair. Thus, {beta}-HPV8 E6 may cause DSBs to be repaired through a more mutagenic process. To evaluate this, immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect colocalization, formation, and resolution of DSB repair complexes following damage. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to determine the cell cycle distribution of repair complexes. The resulting data show that {beta}-HPV8 E6 causes HR factors (RPA70 and RAD51) to colocalize with a persistent NHEJ factor (pDNA-PKcs). RPA70 complexes gave way to RAD51 complexes as in canonical HR, but RAD51 and pDNA-PKcs colocalization did not resolve within 32 hours of damage. The persistent RAD51 foci occur in G1 phase, consistent with recruitment after NHEJ fails. Chemical inhibition of p300, p300 knockout cells, and an {beta}-HPV8 E6 mutant demonstrate that these phenotypes are the result of {beta}-HPV8 E6-meidated p300 destabilization. Mutations associated with DSB repair were identified using next generation sequencing after a CAS9-induced DSB. {beta}-HPV8 E6 increases the frequency of mutations (>15 fold) and deletions (>20 fold) associated with DSB repair. These data suggest that {beta}-HPV8 E6 causes abnormal DSB repair where both NHEJ and HR occur at the same lesion and that his leads to deletions as the single stranded DNA produced during HR is removed by NHEJ.\n\nAuthor SummaryOur previous work shows that a master transcription regulator, p300, is required for two major DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). By degrading p300, beta genus Human Papillomavirus 8 protein E6 ({beta}-HPV8 E6) hinders DNA-PKcs activity, which is a key factor of NHEJ. {beta}-HPV8 E6 also stalls HR via p300 degradation resulting in the persistence of a core factor, RAD51. NHEJ and HR are known competitive to each other and only one pathway can be initiated to repair a DSB. Particularly, NHEJ tends to be used in G1 phase and HR occurs in S/G2 phase. Here, we show that {beta}-HPV8 E6 allows NHEJ and HR to occur at the same break site. This is expected to be mutagenic because HR generates overhangs while NHEJ removes them. Further, we show that {beta}-HPV8 E6 allows HR to occur in G1, which cannot be finished due to the lack of homologous templates. Finally, our sequencing results show that {beta}-HPV8 E6 significantly increases genomic variations including deletions and insertions following CAS9 induced DSB. This study supports the hypothesis that {beta}-HPV8 infections increases genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "The lissencephaly 1 gene, LIS1, is mutated in patients with the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly. The Lis1 protein is conserved from fungi to mammals and is a key regulator of cytoplasmic dynein-1, the major minus-end-directed microtubule motor in many eukaryotes. Lis1 is the only dynein regulator that binds directly to dyneins motor domain, and by doing so alters dyneins mechanochemistry. Lis1 is required for the formation of fully active dynein complexes, which also contain essential cofactors: dynactin and an activating adaptor. Here, we report the first high-resolution structure of the yeast dynein-Lis1 complex. Our 3.1[A] structure reveals, in molecular detail, the major contacts between dynein and Lis1 and between Lis1s {beta}-propellers. Structure-guided mutations in Lis1 and dynein show that these contacts are required for Lis1s ability to form fully active human dynein complexes and to regulate yeast dyneins mechanochemistry and in vivo function. We present a model for the conserved role of Lis1 in regulating dynein from yeast to humans.",
