    "abstract": "Anatomical and physiological compartmentalization of neurons is a mechanism to increase the computational capacity of a circuit, and a major question is what role axonal compartmentalization plays. Axonal compartmentalization may enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter neuronal output in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. Here we show that olfactory learning generates compartmentalized, bidirectional plasticity of acetylcholine release that varies across the longitudinal compartments of Drosophila mushroom body (MB) axons. The directionality of the learning-induced plasticity depends on the valence of the learning event (aversive vs. appetitive), varies linearly across proximal to distal compartments following appetitive conditioning, and correlates with learning-induced changes in downstream mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that modulate behavioral action selection. Potentiation of acetylcholine release was dependent on the CaV2.1 calcium channel subunit cacophony. In addition, contrast between the positive conditioned stimulus and other odors required the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R), which was required to maintain responsivity to odors in untrained conditions. Downstream from the mushroom body, a set of MBONs that receive their input from the {gamma}3 MB compartment were required for normal appetitive learning, suggesting that they represent a key node through which discriminative effects influence appetitive memory and decision-making. These data demonstrate that learning drives valence-correlated, compartmentalized, bidirectional potentiation and depression of synaptic neurotransmitter release, which rely on distinct mechanisms and are distributed across axonal compartments in a learning circuit.",

    "abstract": "In the past decades, there has been a growing scientific interest in characterizing neural correlates of meditation training. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying meditation remain elusive. In the present work, we investigated meditation-related changes in structural and functional connectivities (SC and FC, respectively). For this purpose, we scanned experienced meditators and control (naive) subjects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to acquire structural and functional data during two conditions, resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). In this way, we aimed to characterize and distinguish both short-term and long-term modifications in the brains structure and function. First, we performed a network-based analysis of anatomical connectivity. Then, to analyze the fMRI data, we calculated whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) estimates, relying on a dynamical network model to replicate BOLD signals spatio-temporal structure, akin to FC with lagged correlations. We compared the estimated EC, FC, and SC links as features to train classifiers to predict behavioral conditions and group identity. The whole-brain SC analysis revealed strengthened anatomical connectivity across large-scale networks for meditators compared to controls. We found that differences in SC were reflected in the functional domain as well. We demonstrated through a machine-learning approach that EC features were more informative than FC and SC solely. Using EC features we reached high performance for the condition-based classification within each group and moderately high accuracies when comparing the two groups in each condition. Moreover, we showed that the most informative EC links that discriminated between meditators and controls involved the same large-scale networks previously found to have increased anatomical connectivity. Overall, the results of our whole-brain model-based approach revealed a mechanism underlying meditation by providing causal relationships at the structure-function level.",

To date, there is limited information about swine IAV circulating in Latin America. We identified two swine H1N2 and one divergent swine H3N2 viruses that co-circulated in Chilean swine together with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain (A(H1N1)pdm09). Phylogenetic analysis revealed several human-to-swine IAV introductions occurring as early as the mid-1980s, and since 2009, several introductions of the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain. Antigenic cartography confirmed that these viruses were antigenically unique and identified drifted variants within the clusters. Human sera from the Chilean general population showed an age dependent mid to low-level antibody mediated protection against swine H1N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09-like viruses and a poor protection against the swine H3N2 virus, highlighting the zoonotic potential of this strain. Our results underscore the epidemiological importance of studying swine IAV in Latin America for epidemic and pandemic preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen of immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. To successfully establish an infection, A. fumigatus needs to use host carbon sources, such as acetate, present in the body fluids and peripheral tissues. However, utilisation of acetate as a carbon source by fungi in the context of infection has not been investigated. This work shows that acetate is metabolised via different pathways in A. fumigatus and that acetate utilisation is under the regulatory control of a transcription factor (TF), FacB. A. fumigatus acetate utilisation is subject to carbon catabolite repression (CCR), although this is only partially dependent on the TF and main regulator of CCR CreA. The available extracellular carbon source, in this case glucose and acetate, significantly affected A. fumigatus virulence traits such as secondary metabolite secretion and cell wall composition, with the latter having consequences for resistance to oxidative stress, to anti-fungal drugs and to human neutrophil-mediated killing. Furthermore, deletion of facB significantly impaired the in vivo virulence of A. fumigatus in both insect and mammalian models of invasive aspergillosis. This is the first report on acetate utilisation in A. fumigatus and this work further highlights the importance of available host-specific carbon sources in shaping fungal virulence traits and subsequent disease outcome, and a potential target for the development of anti-fungal strategies.\n\nImportanceAspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen in humans. During infection, A. fumigatus is predicted to use host carbon sources, such as acetate, present in body fluids and peripheral tissues, to sustain growth and promote colonisation and invasion. This work shows that A. fumigatus metabolises acetate via different pathways, a process that is dependent on the transcription factor FacB. Furthermore, the type and concentration of the extracellular available carbon source were determined to shape A. fumigatus virulence determinants such as secondary metabolite secretion and cell wall composition. Subsequently, interactions with immune cells are altered in a carbon source-specific manner. FacB is required for A. fumigatus in vivo virulence in both insect and mammalian models of invasive aspergillosis. This is the first report that characterises acetate utilisation in A. fumigatus and highlights the importance of available host-specific carbon sources in shaping virulence traits and potentially subsequent disease outcome.",

    "abstract": "Quality control of mRNA represents an important regulatory mechanism for gene expression in eukaryotes. One component of this quality control is the nuclear retention and decay of misprocessed RNAs. Previously, we demonstrated that mature mRNAs containing a 5 splice site (5SS) motif, which is typically found in misprocessed RNAs such as intronic polyadenylated (IPA) transcripts, are nuclear retained and degraded. Here we demonstrate that these transcripts require the zinc finger protein ZFC3H1 for their decay and nuclear retention into nuclear speckles. Furthermore, we find that U1-70K, a component of the U1 snRNP spliceosomal complex, is also required for their nuclear retention and likely functions in the same pathway as ZFC3H1. Finally, we show that the disassembly of nuclear speckles impairs the nuclear retention of mRNAs with 5SS motifs. Together, our results suggest a model where mRNAs with 5SS motifs are recognized by U1 snRNP, which then acts with ZFC3H1 to both promote their decay and prevent nuclear export of these mRNAs by sequestering them in nuclear speckles. Our results highlight a splicing independent role of U1 snRNP and indicate that it works in conjunction with ZFC3H1 in preventing the nuclear export of misprocessed mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a major source of skin damage, resulting in inflammation, premature ageing and cancer. While several UVR-induced changes, including extracellular matrix reorganisation and epidermal DNA damage, have been documented, the role of different fibroblast lineages and their communication with immune cells has not been explored. We show that acute and chronic UVR exposure led to selective loss of fibroblasts from the upper dermis in human and mouse skin. Lineage tracing and in vivo live imaging revealed that repair following acute UVR is predominantly mediated by papillary fibroblast proliferation and migration. In contrast, chronic UVR exposure led to a permanent loss of papillary fibroblasts, with expansion of fibroblast membrane protrusions partially compensating for the reduction in cell number. Although UVR strongly activated Wnt-signalling in skin, stimulation of fibroblast proliferation by epidermal {beta}-catenin stabilisation did not support papillary dermis repair. Acute UVR triggered an infiltrate of neutrophils and T cell subpopulations and increased pro-inflammatory prostaglandin signalling in skin. Depletion of CD4 and CD8 positive cells resulted in increased papillary fibroblast depletion, which correlated with an increase in DNA damage and reduction in fibroblast proliferation. Conversely, topical COX-2 inhibition prevented fibroblast depletion and neutrophil infiltration after UVR. We conclude that loss of papillary fibroblasts is primarily induced by a deregulated inflammatory response, with infiltrating T cells supporting fibroblast survival upon UVR-induced environmental stress.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/447606v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d246bborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@121b5faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@324114org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14e9eb7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Background/ObjectivesWhile direct additive and dominance effects on complex traits have been mapped repeatedly, additional genetic factors contributing to the heterogeneity of complex traits have been scarcely investigated. To assess genetic background effects, we investigated transmission ratio distortions (TRDs) of alleles from parent to offspring using an advanced intercross line (AIL) of an initial cross between the mouse inbred strains C57BL/6NCrl (B6N) and BFMI860-12 (BFMI).\n\nSubjects/Methods341 males of generation 28 and their respective 61 parents and 66 grandparents were genotyped using Mega Mouse Universal Genotyping Arrays (MegaMUGA). TRDs were investigated using allele transmission asymmetry tests, and pathway overrepresentation analysis was performed. Sequencing data was used to test for overrepresentation of non-synonymous SNPs in TRD regions. Genetic incompatibilities were tested using the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller two-locus model.\n\nResults62 TRD regions were detected, many in close proximity to the telocentric centromere. TRD regions contained 44.5% more non-synonymous SNPs than randomly selected regions (182 vs. 125.9 {+/-} 17.0, P < 1x10-4). Testing for genetic incompatibilities between TRD regions identified 29 genome-wide significant incompatibilities between TRD regions (P(BF) < 0.05). Pathway overrepresentation analysis of genes in TRD regions showed that DNA methylation, epigenetic regulation of RNA, and meiotic/meiosis regulation pathways were affected independent of the parental origin of the TRD. Paternal BFMI TRD regions showed overrepresentation in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis and in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. Maternal B6N TRD regions harbored genes involved in meiotic recombination, cell death, and apoptosis pathways. The analysis of genes in TRD regions suggests the potential distortion of protein-protein interactions influencing obesity and diabetic retinopathy as a result of disadvantageous combinations of allelic variants in Aass, Pgx6 and Nme8.\n\nConclusionsUsing an AIL significantly improves the resolution at which we can investigate TRD. Our analysis implicates distortion of protein-protein interactions as well as meiotic drive as the underlying mechanisms leading to the observed TRD in our AIL. Furthermore, genes with large amounts of non-synonymous SNPs located in TRD regions are more likely to be involved in pathways that are related to the phenotypic differences between the parental strains. Genes in these TRD regions provide new targets for investigating genetic adaptation, protein-protein interactions, and determinants of complex traits such as obesity.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models used for the representation of (bio)-chemical processes can be grouped into two broad paradigms: white-box or mechanistic models, completely based on knowledge or black-box data-driven models based on patterns observed in data. However, in the past two-decade, hybrid modeling that explores the synergy between the two paradigms has emerged as a pragmatic compromise. The data-driven part of these have been largely based on conventional machine learning algorithm (e.g., artificial neural network, support vector regression), which prevents interpretability of the finally learnt model by the domain-experts. In this work we present a novel hybrid modeling framework, the Functional-Hybrid model, that uses the ranked domain-specific functional beliefs together with symbolic regression to develop dynamic models. We demonstrate the successful implementation of these hybrid models for four benchmark systems and a microbial fermentation reactor, all of which are systems of (bio)chemical relevance. We also demonstrate that compared to a similar implementation with the conventional ANN, the performance of Functional-Hybrid model is at least two times better in interpolation and extrapolation. Additionally, the proposed framework can learn the dynamics in 50% lower number of experiments. This improved performance can be attributed to the structure imposed by the functional transformations introduced in the Functional-Hybrid model.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation is prone to occur when positively charged proteins interact with nucleic acids. Here, we studied biophysical properties of Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) virus capsid proteins to understand the process of RNA genome encapsidation. In this route, the capsid proteins efficiently recruit the viral RNA at the ER membrane to yield nascent viral particles. However, little is known either about the molecular mechanisms by which multiple copies of capsid proteins assemble into nucleocapsids or how the nucleocapsid is recruited and wrapped by the ER membrane during particle morphogenesis. Here, we measured relevant interactions concerning the viral process using purified DENV and ZIKV capsids proteins, membranes mimicking the ER lipid composition and nucleic acids at in vitro conditions. We found that both ZIKV and DENV capsid proteins bound to liposomes at liquid-disordered phase regions and docked exogenous membranes and RNA molecules. When the proteins bound nucleic acids, droplet liquid-liquid phase separation was observed. We characterized these liquid condensates by measuring nucleic acid partition constant and the extent of water dipolar relaxation observing a cooperative process for the formation of the new phase that involves a distinct water organization. Our data supports a new model in which capsid-RNA complexes directly bind the ER membrane, seeding the process of RNA recruitment for viral particle assembly. These results contribute to understand the viral nucleocapsid formation as a stable liquid-liquid phase transition, which could be relevant for Dengue and Zika gemmation, opening new avenues for antiviral intervention.",

    "abstract": "Viral infections impose extraordinary RNA stress on a cell, triggering cellular RNA surveillance pathways like RNA decapping, nonsense-mediated decay and RNA silencing. Viruses need to maneuver between these pathways to establish infection and succeed in producing high amounts of viral proteins. Processing bodies (PBs) are integral to RNA triage in eukaryotic cells with several distinct RNA quality control pathways converging for selective RNA regulation. In this study, we investigate the role of Arabidopsis thaliana PBs during Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) infection. We find that several PB components are co-opted into viral replication factories and support virus multiplication. This pro-viral role was not associated with RNA decay pathways but instead, we could establish PB components as essential helpers in viral RNA translation. While CaMV is normally resilient to RNA silencing, PB dysfunctions expose the virus to this pathway, similar to previous observations on transgenes. Transgenes, however, undergo RNA Quality Control dependent RNA degradation, whereas CaMV RNA remains stable but becomes translationally repressed through decreased ribosome association, revealing a unique dependence between PBs, RNA silencing and translational repression. Together, our study shows that PB components are co-opted by the virus to maintain efficient translation, a mechanism not associated with canonical PB functions.",

    "abstract": "A number of inhibitors have been developed for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) as potential COVID-19 medications but little is known about their selectivity. Using enzymatic assays, we characterized inhibition of TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsins B/K/L by more than a dozen of previously developed MPro inhibitors including MPI1-9, GC376, 11a, 10-1, 10-2, and 10- 3. MPI1-9, GC376 and 11a all contain an aldehyde for the formation of a reversible covalent hemiacetal adduct with the MPro active site cysteine and 10-1, 10-2 and 10-3 contain a labile ester to exchange with the MPro active site cysteine for the formation of a thioester. Our data revealed that all these inhibitors are inert toward TMPRSS2 and furin. Diaryl esters also showed low inhibition of cathepsins. However, all aldehyde inhibitors displayed high potency in inhibiting three cathepsins. Their determined IC50 values vary from 4.1 to 380 nM for cathepsin B, 0.079 to 2.3 nM for cathepsin L, and 0.35 to 180 nM for cathepsin K. All aldehyde inhibitors showed similar inhibition levels toward cathepsin L. A cellular analysis indicated high potency of MPI5 and MPI8 in inhibiting lysosomal activity, which is probably attributed to their inhibition of cathepsins. Among all aldehyde inhibitors, MPI8 shows the best selectivity toward cathepsin L. With respect to cathepsins B and K, the selective indices are 192 and 150, respectively. MPI8 is the most potent compound among all aldehyde inhibitors in cellular MPro inhibition potency and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in Vero E6 cells. Cathepsin L has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. By selectively inhibiting both SARS-CoV-2 MPro and the host cathepsin L, MPI8 potentiates dual inhibition effects to synergize its overall antiviral potency and efficacy. Due to its high selectivity toward cathepsin L that reduces potential toxicity toward host cells and high cellular and antiviral potency, we urge serious consideration of MPI8 for preclinical and clinical investigations for treating COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Due to an inability to ethically access developing human brain tissue as well as identify prospective cases, early-arising neurodevelopmental and cell-specific signatures of Schizophrenia (Scz) have remained unknown and thus undefined. To overcome these challenges, we utilized Scz patient-derived stem cells to generate 3D cerebral organoids to model neuropathology of Scz during this critical period. We discovered that Scz organoids exhibited ventricular neuropathology resulting in altered progenitor survival and disrupted neurogenesis. This ultimately yielded fewer neurons within developing cortical fields of Scz organoids. Single-cell sequencing revealed that Scz progenitors were specifically depleted of neuronal programming factors leading to a remodeling of cell-lineages, altered differentiation trajectories, and distorted cortical cell-type diversity. While Scz organoids were 99.95% similar in their macromolecular diversity to Ctrls, four GWAS factors (PTN, COMT, PLCL1, and PODXL) and peptide fragments belonging to the POU-domain transcription factor family (e.g. POU3F2/BRN2) were altered. This revealed that Scz organoids principally differed not in their proteomic diversity, but specifically in their total quantity of disease and neurodevelopmental factors at the molecular level. Single-cell sequencing also subsequently identified cell-type specific alterations in neuronal programming factors and growth factors, and specifically replicated the depletion of POU3F2 (BRN2) and PTN in both Scz progenitors and neurons. Consequently, in two mechanistic rescue experiments we identified that the transcription factor POU3F2 (BRN2) and growth factor PTN operate as mechanistic substrates of neurogenesis and cellular survival, respectively, in Scz organoids. This suggests that multiple mechanisms of Scz exist in patient-derived organoids, and that these disparate mechanisms converge upon primordial brain developmental pathways such as neuronal differentiation, survival, and growth factor support, which may amalgamate to elevate intrinsic risk of Scz.",

    "abstract": "Slow oscillations in the sleeping and anesthetized brain invariantly emerge as an alternation between Up (high firing) and Down (almost quiescent) states. In cortex, they occur simultaneously in cell assemblies in different layers and propagate as traveling waves, a concerted activity at multiple scales whose interplay and role is still under debate. Slow oscillations have been reported to start in deep layers, more specifically in layer 5. Here, we studied the laminar organization of slow oscillations in the anesthetized rat cortex and we found that the activity leading to Up states actually initiates in layer 6, then spreads towards upper layers. Layer 5 cell assemblies have a threshold-like activation that can persist after layer 6 inactivation, giving rise to hysteresis loops like in \"flip-flop\" computational units. We found that such hysteresis is finely tuned by the columnar circuitry depending on the recent history of the local ongoing activity. Furthermore, thalamic inactivation reduced infragranular excitability without affecting the columnar activation pattern. We propose a role for layer 6 acting as a hub unraveling a hierarchy of cortical loops.",

    "abstract": "Helminth infections, including hookworms and Schistosomes, can cause severe disability and death. Infection management and control would benefit from identification of biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. While animal models suggest that Trefoil Factor Family proteins (TFF2 and TFF3) and interleukin-33 (IL-33) -driven type 2 immune responses are critical mediators of tissue repair and worm clearance in the context of hookworm infection, very little is known about how they are modulated in the context of human helminth infection. We measured TFF2, TFF3, and IL-33 levels in serum from patients in Brazil infected with Hookworm and/or Schistosomes, and compared them to endemic and non-endemic controls. TFF2 was specifically elevated by Hookworm infection, not Schistosoma or co-infection. This elevation was more strongly correlated with age than with worm burden. To determine if this might apply more broadly to other species or regions, we measured TFFs and cytokine levels in both the serum and urine of Nigerian school children infected with S. haematobium. We found that serum levels of TFF2 and 3 were reduced by infection, but urine cytokine levels were increased (IL-1{beta}, TNF, IL-13, and IL-10). Finally, to determine if TFF2 and 3 might have immunosuppressive effects, we treated stimulated or unstimulated PMBCs with recombinant human TFF2 or TFF3 and measured proinflammatory cytokine levels. We found that rhTFF2, but not rhTFF3, was able to suppress TNF alpha and IFN gamma release from stimulated human PMBCs. Taken together, these data support a role for TFF proteins in human helminth infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryBillions of people are infected with parasitic helminths across the globe, especially in resource poor regions. These infections can result in severe developmental delay, disability, and death. Adequate management of helminth infection would benefit from the identification of host biomarkers in easily obtained samples (e.g. serum or urine) that correlate to infection state. Our goal was to determine if specific proteins involved in tissue repair and immune modulation are altered by infection with specific helminth species in Brazil (hookworm) or Nigeria (blood fluke). One of these proteins, Trefoil Factor 2 (TFF2), was elevated in the serum of hookworm infected individuals, and decreased in the serum of blood fluke infected children. In the blood fluke-infected children, there were also significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the urine, where the eggs burst from host tissue. Further, in laboratory experiments, Trefoil Factor 2 reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from human blood cells. This suggests that at high levels TFF2 may suppress inflammation and could serve as a biomarker for infection or treatment efficacy.",

Immunization at two different doses (3 {micro}g or 5 {micro}g per dose) elicited a high level of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and non-human primates. The results show the safety profile in studied animals (include guinea pig, rabbit, mice, and monkeys). Rhesus macaques were immunized with the two-dose of 5 {micro}g and 3 {micro}g of the COVIran Barekat vaccine and showed highly efficient protection against 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 intratracheal challenge compared with the control group.

Our system entitled Candescence automatically detects C. albicans cells from Differential Image Contrast microscopy, and labels each detected cell with one of nine vegetative, mating-competent or filamentous morphologies. The software is based upon a fully convolutional one-stage object detector and exploits a novel cumulative curriculum-based learning strategy that stratifies our images by difficulty from simple vegetative forms to more complex filamentous architectures. Candescence achieves very good performance on this difficult learning set which has substantial intermixing between the predicted classes. To capture the essence of each C. albicans morphology, we develop models using generative adversarial networks and identify subcomponents of the latent space which control technical variables, developmental trajectories or morphological switches. We envision Candescence as a community meeting point for quantitative explorations of C. albicans morphology.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional modifications by RNA editing are essential for neurodevelopment, yet their developmental and regulatory features remain poorly resolved. We constructed a full temporal view of base-specific RNA editing in the developing human cortex, from early progenitors through fully mature cells found in the adult brain. Developmental regulation of RNA editing is characterized by an increase in editing rates for more than 10,000 selective editing sites, shifting between mid-fetal development and infancy, and a massive expansion of RNA hyper-editing sites that amass in the cortex through postnatal development into advanced age. These sites occur disproportionally in 3UTRs of essential neurodevelopmental genes. These profiles are preserved in non-human primate and murine models, illustrating evolutionary conserved regulation of RNA editing in mammalian cortical development. RNA editing levels are commonly genetically regulated (editing quantitative trait loci, edQTLs) consistently across development or predominantly during prenatal or postnatal periods. Both consistent and temporal-predominant edQTLs co-localize with risk loci associated with neurological traits and disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and sleep disorders. These findings expand the repertoire of highly regulated RNA editing sites in the brain and provide insights of how epitranscriptional sequence diversity by RNA editing contributes to neurodevelopment.",

FD patients have small trigeminal nerves and impaired perception of facial pain and temperature. These signals are relayed by nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, a structure comprised of both neural crest- and placode-derived cells. Mice lacking Elp1 in neural crest derivatives (\"Elp1 CKO\") are born with smaller trigeminal ganglia, suggesting Elp1 is important for trigeminal ganglion development, yet the function of Elp1 in this context is unknown. We demonstrate Elp1 expression in both neural crest- and placode-derived trigeminal neurons, which our data suggest give rise to primarily TrkA- and TrkB/C-expressing neurons, respectively. While Elp1 is not required for initial trigeminal ganglion formation, Elp1 CKO trigeminal neurons exhibit abnormal axon outgrowth and decreased target innervation. Developing nociceptors that express the receptor TrkA are especially vulnerable to Elp1 loss. TrkA expression is decreased in Elp1 CKO trigeminal nerve endings, coinciding with increased cell death. Subsequently, fewer TrkA neurons are present in the Elp1 CKO trigeminal ganglion, indicating Elp1 supports the target innervation and survival of trigeminal nociceptors. These findings explain the loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle fibers rely upon either oxidative phosphorylation or glycolytic pathway to achieve muscular contractions that power mechanical movements. Species with energy-intensive adaptive traits that require sudden bursts of energy have a greater dependency on fibers that use the glycolytic pathway. Glycolytic fibers have decreased reliance on OXPHOS and lower mitochondrial content compared to oxidative fibers. Hence, we hypothesized that adaptive gene loss might have occurred within the OXPHOS pathway in lineages that largely depend on glycolytic fibers. The protein encoded by the COA1/MITRAC15 gene with conserved orthologs found in budding yeast to humans promotes mitochondrial translation. We show that gene disrupting mutations have accumulated within the COA1/MITRAC15 gene in the cheetah, several species of galliforms, and rodents. The genomic region containing COA1/MITRAC15 is a well-established evolutionary breakpoint region in mammals. Careful inspection of genome assemblies of closely related species of rodents and marsupials suggests two independent COA1/MITRAC15 gene loss events co-occurring with chromosomal rearrangements. Besides recurrent gene loss events, we document changes in COA1/MITRAC15 exon structure in primates and felids. The detailed evolutionary history presented in this study reveals the intricate link between skeletal muscle fiber composition and dispensability of the chaperone-like role of the COA1/MITRAC15 gene.",

    "abstract": "The small intestine is the first organ that is exposed to and absorbs dietary glucose and thus represents the first of a continuum of events that modulates normal systemic glucose homeostasis. A better understanding of the regulation of intestinal glucose transporters is therefore pertinent to our efforts in curbing metabolic disorders. However, so far, the mechanisms known to regulate SGLT1, the primary intestinal glucose transporter, are mainly elucidated from in vitro studies. The Drosophila midgut, functional equivalence of the small intestine, could serve as an efficient in vivo model system for studying intestinal glucose transporter regulation; however, no glucose transporter has yet been identified in the midgut. Here, we report that the Drosophila Solute Carrier 5A5 (dSLC5A5) is homologous to SGLT1 and is highly expressed in the midgut. The knockdown of dSLC5A5 decreases systemic and circulating sugar levels and decreases glucose uptake into the enterocytes. In contrary, the overexpression of dSLC5A5 elevates systemic and circulating sugar levels and promotes glucose uptake into the enterocytes. We show that dSLC5A5 undergoes dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the enterocyte apical membrane, and that dSLC5A5 endocytosis is essential for the glucose uptake capability of dSLC5A5. Moreover, we provide evidence supporting that intracellular lysosomal degradation of endocytosed dSLC5A5 plays a significant role in the maintenance of dSLC5A5 level in the enterocyte apical membrane. We further show that short-term exposure to glucose upregulates SLC5A5 abundance in the enterocyte apical membrane. Finally, we show that the loss or gain of dSLC5A5 ameliorates or exacerbates the high sugar diet (HSD)-mediated glucose metabolic defects. Together, our studies uncovered the first Drosophila glucose transporter in the midgut and reveal new mechanisms that regulate glucose transporters in the enterocyte apical membranes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA full understanding of circuits and cellular mechanisms governing health and disease requires the dissection and multi-faceted study of discrete cell subtypes in developing and adult animal models. Recombinase-driven expression of transgenic response alleles represents a significant and powerful approach to delineate cell populations for functional, molecular, and anatomical study. In addition to single recombinase systems, the expression of two recombinases in distinct, but partially overlapping, populations allow for more defined target expression. Although the application of this method is becoming increasingly popular, the expense and difficulty associated with production of customized intersectional mouse lines have limited widespread application to more common allele manipulations that are often commercially produced at great expense.\n\nResultsWe present a simplified CRISPR toolkit for rapid, inexpensive, and facile intersectional allele production. Briefly, we produced 7 intersectional mouse lines using a dual recombinase system, one mouse line with a single recombinase system, and three embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that are designed to study how functional, molecular, and anatomical features relate to each other in building circuits that underlie physiology and behavior. As a proof-of-principle, we applied three of these lines to different neuronal populations for anatomical mapping and functional in vivo investigation of respiratory control. We also generated a mouse line with a single recombinase-responsive allele that controls the expression of the calcium sensor Twitch-2B. This mouse line was applied globally to study the effects of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) on calcium release in the ovarian follicle.\n\nConclusionsLines presented here are representative examples of outcomes possible with the successful application of our genetic toolkit for the facile development of diverse, modifiable animal models. This toolkit will allow labs to create single or dual recombinase effector lines easily for any cell population or subpopulation of interest when paired with the appropriate Cre and FLP recombinase mouse lines or viral vectors. We have made our tools and derivative intersectional mouse and ES cell lines openly available for non-commercial use through publicly curated repositories for plasmid DNA, ES cells, and transgenic mouse lines.",

    "abstract": "Long-term multi-functional imaging and analysis of live cells require streamlined functional coordination of various hardware and software platforms. However, manual control of various equipment produced by different manufacturers is labor-intensive and time-consuming, potentially decreasing the accuracy, reproducibility, and quality of acquired data. Therefore, an all-in-one and user-programmable system that enables automatic, multi-functional, and long-term image acquisition and is compatible with most fluorescent microscopy platforms can desirably benefit the scientific community. In this paper, we introduce the full operating protocols of utilizing a novel integrated software system that consists of (1) a home-built software program, titled \"Automatic Multi-functional Integration Program (AMFIP)\", which enables automatic multi-channel imaging acquisition, and (2) a suite of quantitative imaging analysis and cell traction computation packages. We applied this integrated system to reveal the previously unknown relationship between the spatial-temporal distribution of mechano-sensitive Yes-associated protein (YAP) and the cell mechanics, including cell spreading and traction, in human normal cells (B2B) and lung cancer cells (PC9). Leveraging our systems capability of multi-channel control and readout, we found: (1) B2B normal cells and PC9 cancer cells show distinct YAP expression, traction, and cell dynamics relationship during cell spreading and migration processes; and (2) PC9 cancer cells apply noticeable peri-nuclear forces on substrates. In summary, this paper presents a detailed stepwise protocol on how to utilize an integrated user-programmable system that enables automatic multi-functional imaging and analysis to elucidate YAP mechanosensitivity. These tools open the possibility for detailed explorations of multifaceted signaling dynamics in the context of cell physiology and pathology.\n\nSUMMARYThis paper presents a detailed stepwise protocol on how to utilize an integrated user-programmable system that enables all-optical electro-mechanobiology interrogation to elucidate YAP mechanosensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Natural products acting on our central nervous systems are in utmost demand to fight against pain and mental disorders. Cannabinoids (CBDs) are proven neuroactive agents to treat anxiety, depression, chronic pain diseases, seizure, strokes and neurological disorders. The scarcity of the hemp-sourced CBD products and the prohibitive manufacturing cost limit the wide application of CBDs. Yeast metabolic engineering offers the flexibility to meet the ever-increasing market demand. In this work, we took a retrosynthetic approach and sequentially identified the rate-limiting steps to improve the biosynthesis of the CBD precursor olivetolic acid (OLA) in Yarrowia lipolytica. We debottlenecked the critical enzymatic steps to overcome the supply of hexanoyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, NADPH and ATPs to redirect carbon flux toward OLA. Implementation of these strategies led to an 83-fold increase in OLA titer in shaking flask experiment. This work may serve as a baseline for engineering CBD biosynthesis in oleaginous yeast species.",

    "abstract": "Unlike many single-celled organisms, the growth of fission yeast cells within a cell cycle is not exponential. It is rather characterized by three distinct phases (elongation, septation and fission), each with a different growth rate. Experiments also show that the distribution of cell size in a lineage is often bimodal, unlike the unimodal distributions measured for the bacterium Escherichia coli. Here we construct a detailed stochastic model of cell size dynamics in fission yeast. The theory leads to analytic expressions for the cell size and the birth size distributions, and explains the origin of bimodality seen in experiments. In particular our theory shows that the left peak in the bimodal distribution is associated with cells in the elongation phase while the right peak is due to cells in the septation and fission phases. We show that the size control strategy, the variability in the added size during a cell cycle and the fraction of time spent in each of the three cell growth phases have a strong bearing on the shape of the cell size distribution. Furthermore we infer all the parameters of our model by matching the theoretical cell size and birth size distributions to those from experimental single cell time-course data for seven different growth conditions. Our method provides a much more accurate means of determining the cell size control strategy (timer, adder or sizer) than the standard method based on the slope of the best linear fit between the birth and division sizes. We also show that the variability in added size and the strength of cell size control of fission yeast depend weakly on the temperature but strongly on the culture medium.\n\nAuthor summaryAdvances in microscopy enable us to follow single cells over long timescales from which we can understand how their size varies with time and the nature of innate strategies developed to control cell size. This data shows that in many cell types growth is exponential and the distribution of cell sizes has one peak, namely there is a single characteristic cell size. However data for fission yeast shows remarkable differences: growth is non-exponential and the distribution of cell sizes has two peaks, meaning two characteristic cell sizes exist. Here we construct the first mathematical model of this organism; by solving the model analytically we show that it is able to predict the two peaked distributions of cell size seen in data and provides an explanation for each peak in terms of the various growth phases of the single-celled organism. Furthermore by fitting the model to the data, we infer values for the rates of all microscopic processes in our model. This method is shown to provide a much more reliable inference than current methods and sheds light on how the strategy used by fission yeast cells to control their size varies with external conditions.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mood disorder characterized by alternating manic and depressive episodes, often in conjunction with cognitive deficits. Dysregulation of neuroplasticity and calcium homeostasis as a result of complex genetic environment interactions are frequently observed in BD patients, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that a BD-associated microRNA, miR-499-5p, regulates neuronal dendrite development and cognitive function by downregulating the BD risk gene CACNB2. miR-499-5p expression is increased in peripheral blood of BD patients and healthy subjects at risk of developing the disorder due to a history of childhood maltreatment. This up-regulation is paralleled in the hippocampus of rats which underwent juvenile social isolation. Elevating miR-499-5p levels in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons impairs dendritogenesis and reduces surface expression and activity of the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel Cav1.2. We further identified CACNB2, which encodes a regulatory {beta}-subunit of Cav1.2, as a direct target of miR-499-5p in neurons. CACNB2 downregulation is required for the miR-499-5p dependent impairment of dendritogenesis, suggesting that CACNB2 is an important downstream target of miR-499-5p in the regulation of neuroplasticity. Finally, elevating miR-499-5p in the hippocampus in vivo is sufficient to induce short-term memory impairments in rats haploinsufficient for the Cav1.2 pore forming subunit Cacna1c. Taken together, we propose that stress-induced upregulation of miR-499-5p contributes to dendritic impairments and deregulated calcium homeostasis in BD, with specific implications for the neurocognitive dysfunction frequently observed in BD patients.",

    "abstract": "While viremia in the vertebrate host is a major determinant of arboviral reservoir competency, transmission efficiency, and disease severity, immune mechanisms that control arboviral viremia are poorly defined. Here, we identify critical roles for the scavenger receptor MARCO in controlling viremia during arthritogenic alphavirus infections in mice. Following subcutaneous inoculation, alphavirus particles drain via the lymph and are rapidly captured by MARCO+ lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the draining lymph node (dLN), limiting viral spread to the bloodstream. Upon reaching the bloodstream, alphavirus particles are cleared from the circulation by MARCO-expressing Kupffer cells in the liver, limiting viremia and further viral dissemination. MARCO-mediated accumulation of alphavirus particles in the dLN and liver is an important host defense mechanism as viremia and viral tissue burdens are elevated in MARCO-/- mice and disease is more severe. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized arbovirus scavenging role for LECs and improve our mechanistic understanding of viremia control during arboviral infections.",

Despite the expected T cell infiltration, we observed only 1-10 pathogenic T cell cytokine per skin section. Cytokine expression was limited to lesional skin and presented in a disease-specific pattern. In fact, we identified responder signatures in direct proximity of cytokines, and showed that single cytokine transcripts initiate amplification cascades of thousands of specific responder transcripts forming localized epidermal clusters.

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are key cellular organelles that metabolize extra- and intracellular substrates. Alterations in lysosomal metabolism are implicated in aging-associated metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, how lysosomal metabolism actively coordinates the metabolic and nervous systems to regulate aging remains unclear. Here, we report a fat-to-neuron lipid signaling pathway induced by lysosomal metabolism and its longevity promoting role in Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that lysosomal lipolysis in peripheral fat storage tissue up-regulates the neuropeptide signaling pathway in the nervous system to promote longevity. This cell-non-autonomous regulation requires the secretion from the fat storage tissue of a lipid chaperone protein LBP-3 and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). LBP-3 binds to specific PUFAs, and acts through a nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 and neuropeptide NLP-11 in neurons to extend lifespan. Together, these results reveal lysosomes as a signaling hub to coordinate metabolism and aging, and a lysosomal signaling mechanism that mediates intertissue communication to promote longevity.",

While studies in single cell systems have defined how ribosomes contribute to cell growth, the mechanisms that link ribosome function to organismal growth are less clear. Here we explore this issue using Drosophila Minutes, a class of heterozygous mutants for ribosomal proteins (Rps). These animals exhibit a delay in larval development caused by decreased production of the steroid hormone ecdysone, the main regulator of larval maturation. We found that this developmental delay is not caused by decreases in either global ribosome numbers or translation rates. Instead, we show that they are due in part to loss of Rp function specifically in a subset of serotonin (5-HT) neurons that innervate the prothoracic gland to control ecdysone production. We found that these 5-HT neurons have defective secretion in Minute animals, and that overexpression of synaptic vesicle proteins in 5-HTergic cells can partially reverse the Minute developmental delay. These results identify a cell-specific role for ribosomal function in the neuroendocrine control of animal growth and development.",

    "abstract": "To what extent do substitutions in protein-coding versus gene-regulatory regions contribute to fitness change over time? Answering this question requires estimates of the extent of selection acting on beneficial mutations in the two classes of sites. New mutations that have advantageous or deleterious fitness effects can induce selective sweeps and background selection, respectively, causing variation in the level of neutral genetic diversity along the genome. In this study, we analyse the profiles of genetic variability around protein-coding and regulatory elements in the genomes of wild mice to estimate the parameters of positive selection. We find patterns of diversity consistent with the effects of selection at linked sites, which are similar across mouse taxa, despite differences in effective population size and demographic history. By fitting a model that combines the effects of selective sweeps and background selection, we estimate the strength of positive selection and the frequency of advantageous mutations. We find that strong positive selection is required to explain variation in genetic diversity across the murid genome. In particular, we estimate that beneficial mutations in protein-coding regions have stronger effects on fitness than do mutations in gene-regulatory regions, but that mutations in gene-regulatory regions are more common. Overall though, our parameter estimates suggest that the cumulative fitness changes brought about by beneficial mutations in protein-coding may be greater than those in gene-regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "Conodont elements have high rates of morphological evolution, but the drivers of this disparity are debated. Positive allometric relationships between dimensions of food-processing surfaces and entire P1 elements have been used in to argue that these elements performed mechanical digestion. If involved in food processing, the surface of the element should grow at a rate proportional to the increase in energy requirements of the animal. This inference of function relies on the assumption that the energy requirements of the animal grew faster ({cong} mass0.75) than the tooth area ({cong} mass0.67). We re-evaluate this assumption based on metabolic rates across animals, and calculate the allometry in platform-bearing P1 elements of Late Triassic co-occurring taxa, Metapolygnathus communisti and Epigondolella rigoi, using 3D models of ontogenetic series. Positive allometry is found in platform and element dimensions in both species, supporting a grasping-tooth hypothesis, based on the assumption that metabolic rate in conodonts scaled with body mass similarly to that in fish and ectoterms. We also calculate the curvature of P1 platform surface using the Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) as a proxy for diet.DNE values increase with body mass, supporting the assumption that conodont metabolic rates increased faster than mass0.67. We finally find that adults in both taxa differ in their food bases, which supports trophic diversification as an important driver of the remarkable disparity of conodont elements.",

    "abstract": "24-nt small interfering siRNAs maintain asymmetric DNA methylation at thousands of euchromatic transposable elements in plant genomes in a process call RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM). RdDM is dispensable for growth and development in Arabidopsis, but is required for reproduction in other plant species, such as Brassica rapa. 24-nt siRNAs are particularly abundant in maternal reproductive tissue, due largely to overwhelming expression from a small number of loci in the ovule and developing seed coat, termed siren loci. Recently it was shown that abundantly expressed 24-nt siRNAs produced in the tapetal tissue of anthers can methylate male meiocyte genes in trans (Long et al., 2021). Here we show that a similar process takes place in female tissue. siRNAs are produced from gene fragments embedded in some siren loci, and these siRNAs can trigger methylation in trans at related protein-coding genes. This trans-methylation is associated with silencing of some target genes and may be responsible for seed abortion in RdDM mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a consensus sequence in at least two families of DNA transposons is associated with abundant siren expression, most likely through recruitment of the CLSY3 putative chromatin remodeller. This research describes a new mechanism whereby RdDM influences gene expression and sheds light on the role of RdDM during plant reproduction.",

    "abstract": "When people make inferences about other peoples minds, called theory of mind (ToM), a network in the cerebral cortex becomes active. ToM experiments sometimes use the false belief task, in which subjects decide whether a story character believes A or B. The \"false\" belief occurs if the character believes A when B is true. We devised a version in which subjects judged whether a cartoon head \"believed\" a ball to be in box 1 or box 2. The task was a visual, reaction-time version of a ToM task. We proposed two alternative hypotheses. In hypothesis 1, cortical regions of interest within the ToM network should distinguish between false and true belief trials, reflecting outside information that the subjects have about the cartoon character. In hypothesis 2, the ToM network should distinguish between conditions only if the subjects think that the cartoon character can distinguish between the conditions, thus reflecting a model of the internal contents of the cartoon characters mind. The results supported hypothesis 2. Events that the cartoon could not \"see\" did not affect activity in the ToM network; the same events, when the cartoon could apparently \"see\" them, significantly affected activity in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The results support the view that the right TPJ participates in modeling the mental states of others, rather than in evaluating the accuracy of the beliefs of others, and may help explain why previous experiments showed mixed results when directly comparing false belief to true belief conditions.\n\nSignificance statementHow do we understand the minds of others? A specific network of areas in the human brain is known to emphasize building models of other peoples minds. In one traditional hypothesis, this network helps us distinguish whether someone elses beliefs are true or false. Here we show that the network is relatively insensitive to ones own, outside knowledge about whether someone elses beliefs are true or false. Instead, at least one node in the network appears to limit itself mainly to reconstructing the other persons point of view. This social cognition network may be more about empathy than about critical evaluation.\n\nClassificationSocial Sciences - Psychological and Cognitive Sciences",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of visual items allows us to infer the presence of latent causes in the world. For instance, a spatial cluster of ants allows us to infer the presence of a common food source. However, optimal inference requires the integration of a computationally intractable number of world states in real world situations. For example, optimal inference about whether a common cause exists based on N spatially distributed visual items requires marginalizing over both the location of the latent cause and 2N possible affiliation patterns (where each item may be affiliated or non-affiliated with the latent cause). How might the brain approximate this inference? We show that subject behaviour deviates qualitatively from Bayes-optimal, in particular showing an unexpected positive effect of N (the number of visual items) on the false-alarm rate. We propose several \"point-estimating\" observer models that fit subject behaviour better than the Bayesian model. They each avoid a costly computational marginalization over at least one of the variables of the generative model by \"committing\" to a point estimate of at least one of the two generative model variables. These findings suggest that the brain may implement partially committal variants of Bayesian models when detecting latent causes based on complex real world data.",
