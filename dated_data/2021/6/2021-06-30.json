    "abstract": "The COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to the occurrence of several variants with time. This has led to an increased importance of understanding sequence data related to COVID-19. In this chapter, we propose an alignment-free k-mer based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model that can classify 20 different variants of COVID-19. We handle the class imbalance problem by sampling a fixed number of sequences for each class label. We handle the vanishing gradient problem in LSTMs arising from long sequences by dividing the sequence into fixed lengths and obtaining results on individual runs. Our results show that one-vs-all classifiers have test accuracies as high as 92.5% with tuned hyperparameters compared to the multi-class classifier model. Our experiments show higher overall accuracies for B.1.1.214, B.1.177.21, B.1.1.7, B.1.526, and P.1 on the one-vs-all classifiers, suggesting the presence of distinct mutations in these variants. Our results show that embedding vector size and batch sizes have insignificant improvement in accuracies, but changing from 2-mers to 3-mers mostly improves accuracies. We also studied individual runs which show that most accuracies improved after the 20th run, indicating that these sequence positions may have more contributions to distinguishing among different COVID-19 variants.",

    "abstract": "Atrazine is ubiquitously used broad-spectrum herbicide to control the weeds in agriculture. The present study aimed to evaluate the acute toxicity and immunotoxicity of Atrazine in two ecologically and economically important bivalves. Acute toxicity of atrazine evaluated in triplicates by taking control and six experimental groups each comprising of 30 animals and treated with a range of atrazine from 2 PPM to 12 PPM for 96 hours. Mortalities were recorded for every 24 hours until 96 hours and data analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett T-test. The results indicated a significant increase in mortalities with increase in dose and time of exposure in both species. The values of LC50 were determined as 6.10 PPM and 4.90 PPM respectively for Perna viridis and Paphia malabarica. Furthermore, the immunotoxic potential of atrazine assessed by treating mussels and clams with the five sub-lethal doses of atrazine for 14 days and quantifying the viability of hemocytes by using simple yet reliable Tryphan blue exclusion assay. The results of the present study suggest atrazine-induced immunotoxicity by decreasing the number of viable hemocytes in bivalves. Hemocytes with phagocytic function are indispensable to confer innate immunity in bivalves, decreased viability of these cells leads to compromised immunity. This study is first of its kind to implicate atrazine with the immunotoxicity in bivalves.",

    "abstract": "Forests are increasingly affected by heatwaves, often co-occurring with drought, with consequences for water and carbon (C) cycling. However, our ability to project the resilience of trees to an intensification of hot droughts remains limited. Here, we used single tree cuvettes (n=18) allowing us to investigate transpiration (E), net assimilation (Anet), root respiration (Rroot) and stem diameter change in Scots pine seedlings during gradually intensifying heat or drought-heat stress (max. 42{degrees}C), and post-stress. Further, we assessed indicators of stress impacts and recovery capacities.\n\nUnder heat stress, well-watered seedlings prevented overheating of leaves effectively via increased E, while under drought-heat leaf temperatures increased to 46{degrees}C. However, leaf electrolyte leakage was negligible, but Fv/Fm declined alongside Anet moderately in heat but strongly in drought-heat seedlings, in which respiration exceeded C uptake. Further, the decrease of needle water potential ({psi}Needle) to -2.7 MPa and relative needle water content (RWCNeedle) under drought-heat reflected a decline of leaf hydraulic conductance (KLeaf) by 90% and stem hydraulic conductivity (KS) by 25%. Alongside, we observed pronounced stem diameter shrinkage.\n\nHeat stress alone resulted in low functional impairment and all measured parameters recovered fast. In contrast, larger impacts following combined heat and drought led to the incomplete recovery of KLeaf and KS. Despite Anet tended to be reduced albeit Fv/Fm had recovered, the seedlings net C balance reached control values 2 d after stress release and stem growth rates exceeded control rates in the 2nd week post-stress. This indicates that a new equilibrium of C uptake and release was maintained at the tree level, slowly supporting regaining of stress-induced losses.\n\nIn summary, we highlight that under moderate heatwaves with low functional impairment, recovery is fast in Scots pine, while in combination with drought hydraulic and thermal stress are intensified, resulting in functional damage and delayed recovery processes. The incomplete recovery of hydraulic conductance indicates limited water transport capacities that could become critical under repeated heat events.",

    "abstract": "India is known for its rich biodiversity and is fortunate to have several endemic species from different classes of vertebrates. India is home to 7.5% of the global fish diversity, with 91 endemic species of ray finned fishes, the actinopterygians. Some fish species have never been reported until recently, one such example is the long-horned Cowfish (Ostracidae), best known for inhabiting only certain areas of the Indo-Pacific oceans. However, this fish has been reported from Bay of Bengal, Costs of Goa and Lakshadweep. This is the first time this fish has been found on the Coasts of Karnataka, west coast of India. Given its morphology, the migration seems highly improbable since it can only endure lethargic swimming. In this article, we have explored the role of other external forces that could have contributed to its range extension in the east and west coast of India. In this paper we are exploring the role of Super Cyclones as a vital force in determining the expansion of its range. The fact of collection longhorn cowfish for the first time from the coast of Karwar coincides with the passage of Cyclone Ockhi on the west coast of India this suggests the possible role of super cyclone in its range extension. A year later, another specimen was recovered from a location very close to the first, which indicates the successful establishment of Lacturia cornuta in its new environment. Related morphometric and meristic studies of our specimens are consistent with previous studies reported in the Bay of Bengal.",

    "abstract": "Task-optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show striking similarities to the ventral visual stream. However, human-imperceptible image perturbations can cause a CNN to make incorrect predictions. Here we provide insight into this brittleness by investigating the representations of models that are either robust or not robust to image perturbations. Theory suggests that the robustness of a system to these perturbations could be related to the power law exponent of the eigenspectrum of its set of neural responses, where power law exponents closer to and larger than one would indicate a system that is less susceptible to input perturbations. We show that neural responses in mouse and macaque primary visual cortex (V1) obey the predictions of this theory, where their eigenspectra have power law exponents of at least one. We also find that the eigenspectra of model representations decay slowly relative to those observed in neurophysiology and that robust models have eigenspectra that decay slightly faster and have higher power law exponents than those of non-robust models. The slow decay of the eigenspectra suggests that substantial variance in the model responses is related to the encoding of fine stimulus features. We therefore investigated the spatial frequency tuning of artificial neurons and found that a large proportion of them preferred high spatial frequencies and that robust models had preferred spatial frequency distributions more aligned with the measured spatial frequency distribution of macaque V1 cells. Furthermore, robust models were quantitatively better models of V1 than non-robust models. Our results are consistent with other findings that there is a misalignment between human and machine perception. They also suggest that it may be useful to penalize slow-decaying eigenspectra or to bias models to extract features of lower spatial frequencies during task-optimization in order to improve robustness and V1 neural response predictivity.\n\nAuthor summaryConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most quantitatively accurate models of multiple visual areas. In contrast to humans, however, their image classification behaviour can be modified drastically by human-imperceptible image perturbations. To provide insight as to why CNNs are so brittle, we investigated the image features extracted by models that are robust and not robust to these image perturbations. We found that CNNs had a preference for high spatial frequency image features, unlike primary visual cortex (V1) cells. Models that were more robust to image perturbations had a preference for image features more aligned with those extracted by V1 and also improved predictions of neural responses in V1. This suggests that the dependence on high-frequency image features for image classification may be related to the image perturbations affecting models but not humans. Our work is consistent with other findings that CNNs may be relying on image features not aligned with those used by humans for image classification and suggests possible optimization targets to improve the robustness of and the V1 correspondence of CNNs.",

    "abstract": "No one likes to be wrong. Previous research has shown that participants may underweight information incompatible with previous choices, a phenomenon called confirmation bias. In this paper we argue that a similar bias exists in the way information is actively sought. We investigate how choice influences information gathering using a perceptual choice task and find that participants sample more information from a previously chosen alternative. Furthermore, the higher the confidence in the initial choice, the more biased information sampling becomes. As a consequence, when faced with the possibility of revising an earlier decision, participants are more likely to stick with their original choice, even when incorrect. Critically, we show that agency controls this phenomenon. The effect disappears in a fixed sampling condition where presentation of evidence is controlled by the experimenter, suggesting that the way in which confirmatory evidence is acquired critically impacts the decision process. These results suggest active information acquisition plays a critical role in the propagation of strongly held beliefs over time.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that pregnancy may have a significant impact on the maternal brain, causing changes in its structure. However, the patterns of these changes have not yet been systematically investigated. Using voxel-based (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM), we compared a group of healthy primiparous women (n = 40) with healthy multiparous mothers (n = 37) as well as nulliparous women (n = 40). Compared to the nulliparous women, the young mothers showed decreases in gray matter volume in the bilateral hippocampus/amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex/subgenual prefrontal area, the right superior temporal gyrus, the right insula, and the cerebellum. However, these pregnancy-related changes in brain structure did not predict the quality of mother-infant attachment at either 3 or 12 weeks postpartum, nor were they more pronounced among the multiparous women. SBM analyses showed significant cortical thinning especially in the frontal and parietal cortices, with the parietal cortical thinning likely potentiated by multiple pregnancies. We conclude, therefore, that the widespread morphological changes seen in the brain shortly after childbirth reflect substantial neuroplasticity. Also, the experience of pregnancy alone may not be the underlying cause of the adaptations for mothering and caregiving. As regards the exact biological function of the changes in brain morphology as well as the long-term effect of pregnancy on the maternal brain, further longitudinal research with larger cohorts will be needed to draw any definitive conclusions.\n\nSignificance StatementBiological adaptations during pregnancy affect the maternal brain. Here, we evaluated morphological changes in the brain of mentally healthy young mothers within the first four days of childbirth. Compared to the nulliparous women, the young primiparous and multiparous mothers demonstrated a substantial reduction in gray matter volume in brain areas related to socio-cognitive and emotional processes. Cortical alterations due to pregnancy-related adaptations are not the underlying cause of mother-infant attachment.",

    "abstract": "Animal nervous systems are highly efficient in processing sensory input. The neuromorphic computing paradigm aims at the hardware implementation of neural network computations to support novel solutions for building brain-inspired computing systems. Here, we take inspiration from sensory processing in the nervous system of the fruit fly larva. With its strongly limited computational resources of <200 neurons and <1.000 synapses the larval olfactory pathway employs fundamental computations to transform broadly tuned receptor input at the periphery into an energy efficient sparse code in the central brain. We show how this approach allows us to achieve sparse coding and increased separability of stimulus patterns in a spiking neural network, validated with both software simulation and hardware emulation on mixed-signal real-time neuromorphic hardware. We verify that feedback inhibition is the central motif to support sparseness in the spatial domain, across the neuron population, while the combination of spike frequency adaptation and feedback inhibition determines sparseness in the temporal domain. Our experiments demonstrate that such small-sized, biologically realistic neural networks, efficiently implemented on neuromorphic hardware, can achieve parallel processing and efficient encoding of sensory input at full temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuits are constructed from nonlinear building blocks, and not surprisingly overall circuit behavior is often strongly nonlinear. But neural circuits can also behave near linearly, and some circuits shift from linear to nonlinear behavior depending on stimulus conditions. Such control of the linearity or nonlinearity of circuit behavior is fundamental to neural computation. Here we study a surprising stimulus dependence of the responses of On (but not Off) parasol retinal ganglion cells: these cells respond nonlinearly to spatial structure in temporally-modulated grating stimuli but linearly to spatial structure in flashed gratings and natural visual inputs. We show that this unexpected response linearity can be explained by a shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that originates at least in part from adaptation in the cone photoreceptors. More generally, this highlights how subtle asymmetries in signaling - here in the cone signals - can qualitatively alter circuit computation.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (MA) abuse results in neurotoxic outcomes, including increased anxiety and depression, during both MA use and withdrawal. Although numerous studies have reported an association between MA exposure and anxiety, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, escalating dose of MA was used to establish an MA-treated mouse model presenting anxiety behavior. RNA seq was then performed to profile the gene expression patterns in the hippocampus (HIPP). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and function enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms. Quercetin as an mitochondria protector was used in vivo and in vitro. The C57BL/6J mice were co-treated with 50 mg/kg Quercetin and escalating MA. Anxiety behavior was evaluated by utilizing the elevated plus maze and the open field test. Transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry were conducted to study the pathology of MA-inducced anxiety. The effects of MA and Quercetin on astrocytes were investigated by fluorescence staining, transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and oxygen consumption rate. Western blot and qPCR were performed to analyze altered protein and gene levels of HIPP in mice and astrtocytes. The results demonstrated that forteen upregulated differentially expressed genes were identified and significantly enriched in signaling pathways related to psychiatric disorders and mitochondrial function. Interestingly, we found that quercetin was able to alleviate MA-induced anxiety-like behavior by improving neuron number and mitochondria injury. Mechanistically, quercetin can mitigate aberrant mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction not only by decreasing the levels of total cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondria-derived ROS (mtROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), but also increasing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and mitochondrial ATP production in vitro, indicating Quercetin ameliorated MA-induced anxiety-like behavior by modifying mitochondrial morphology and function. Furthermore, quercetin reversed OPA1 and DRP1 expression in astrocytes, and mitigated astrocyte activation and the release of inflammatory factors, which can trigger neuronal apoptosis and synaptic loss. Taken together, we provided evidence showing that MA can induce anxiety-like behavior via the induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Quercetin exerted antipsychotic activity through mitochondrial modulation, suggesting its potential for further therapeutic development in MA-induced anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Acne is a multifactorial disease driven by physiological changes occurring during puberty in the pilosebaceous unit (PSU) that leads to sebum overproduction and a dysbiosis involving notably Cutibacterium acnes. These changes in the PSU microenvironment lead to a shift from a homeostatic to an inflammatory state. Indeed, immunohistochemical analyses have revealed that inflammation and lymphocyte infiltration can be detected even in the infraclinical acneic stages, highlighting the importance of the early stages of the disease. In this study, we utilized a robust multi-pronged approach that included flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and bioinformatics to comprehensively characterize the evolution of the infiltrating and resident immune cell populations in acneic lesions, beginning in the early stages of their development. Using a discovery cohort of 15 patients, we demonstrated that the composition of immune cell infiltrate is highly dynamic in nature, with the relative abundance of different cell types changing significantly as a function of clinical lesion stage. Within the stages examined, we identified a large population of CD69+ CD4+ T cells, several populations of activated antigen presenting cells, and activated mast cells producing IL-17. IL-17+ mast cells were preferentially located in CD4+ T cell rich areas and we showed that activated CD4+ T cells license mast cells to produce IL-17. Our study reveals that mast cells are the main IL-17 producers in the early stage of acne, underlying the importance of targeting the IL-17+ mast cell/T helper cell axis in therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "To date there are several studies focusing on the importance of gut microbiome for human health, however the selection of a universal sampling matrix representative of the microbial biodiversity associated to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, still represents a challenge. Here we present a study in which, through a deep metabarcoding analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, we compared two sampling matrices, feces (F) and colonic lavage liquid (LL), in order to evaluate their accuracy to represent the complexity of the human gut microbiome. A training set of 37 volunteers was attained and paired F and LL samples were collected from each subject. A preliminary absolute quantification of total 16S rDNA, performed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), confirmed that sequencing and taxonomic analysis were performed on same total bacterial abundance obtained from the two sampling methods. The taxonomic analysis of paired samples revealed that, although specific taxa were predominantly or exclusively observed in LL samples, as well as other taxa were detectable only or were predominant in stool, the microbiomes of the paired samples F and LL in the same subject hold overlapping taxonomic composition. Moreover, LL samples revealed a higher biodiversity than stool at all taxonomic ranks, as demonstrated by the Shannon Index and the Inverse Simpsons Index. We also found greater inter-individual variability than intra-individual variability in both sample matrices. Finally, functional differences were unveiled in the gut microbiome detected in the F and LL samples. A significant overrepresentation of 22 and 13 metabolic pathways, mainly occurring in Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, was observed in gut microbiota detected in feces and LL samples, respectively. This suggests that LL samples may allow for the detection of microbes adhering to the intestinal mucosal surface as members of the resident flora that are not easily detectable in stool, most likely representative of a diet-influenced transient microbiota.

    "abstract": "The causal SNPs leading to increased cancer predisposition mainly function as gene regulatory elements, the evaluation of which largely rely on the parallel reporter gene assay system. However, the common DNA barcode-based parallel reporter gene assay systems are troubled with tag bias, mainly due to the tag nucleotide composition. Here we describe a versatile dinucleotide-tag reporter system (DiR) that enables parallel analysis of regulatory elements with minimized bias based on the next-generation sequencing. The DiR system is also more robust than the classical luciferase assay method, especially in the investigation of moderate-level regulatory elements. We applied DiR-seq assay in the functional evaluation of the prostate cancer risk SNPs in prostate cancer cell lines and disclosed 2, and 6 regulatory SNPs in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. The DiR system has great potential to advance the functional study of risk SNPs that have associations with polygenic diseases.",

    "abstract": "MCM complexes are loaded onto chromosomes to license DNA replication origins in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but it is not yet known how mammalian MCM complexes are adequately distributed to both euchromatin and heterochromatin. To address this question, we combined time-lapse live-cell imaging with fixed cell immunofluorescence imaging of single human cells to quantify the relative rates of MCM loading in heterochromatin and euchromatin at different times within G1. We report here that MCM loading in euchromatin is faster than in heterochromatin in very early G1, but surprisingly, heterochromatin loading accelerates relative to euchromatin loading in middle and late G1. These different loading dynamics require ORCA-dependent differences in ORC distribution during G1. A consequence of heterochromatin origin licensing dynamics is that cells experiencing a truncated G1 phase from premature cyclin E expression enter S phase with under-licensed heterochromatin, and DNA damage accumulates preferentially in heterochromatin in the subsequent S/G2 phase. Thus G1 length is critical for sufficient MCM loading, particularly in heterochromatin, to ensure complete genome duplication and to maintain genome stability.",

While the Trop2 protein was discovered already in 1981 and first antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop2 were recently approved cancer therapy, the physiological role of Trop2 is still not fully understood. In this article, we show that TACSTD2/Trop2 expression is evolutionarily conserved in lungs of various vertebrates. By analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data we demonstrate that TACSTD2 level consistently increases in lungs infected with miscellaneous pathogens. Single cell and subpopulation based transcriptomic data revealed that the major source of TACSTD2 transcript are lung epithelial cells and their progenitors and that TACSTD2 is induced directly in lung epithelial cells following infection. This increase may represent a mechanism to maintain/restore epithelial barrier function and contribute to regeneration process in infected/damaged lungs.",

    "abstract": "Tire-wear particles (TWPs) are being released into the environment by wearing down during car driving, and are considered an important microplastic pollution source. The chemical additive leaching from these polymer-based materials and its potential effects are likely temporally dynamic, since larger amounts of potentially toxic compounds can gradually increase with contact time of plastic particles with surrounding media. In the present study, we conducted soil toxicity tests using the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with different soil pre-incubation (30 and 75 days) and exposure (short-term exposure, 2 days; lifetime exposure, 10 days) times. Soil pre-incubation increased toxicity of TWPs, and the effective concentrations after the pre-incubation were much lower than environmentally relevant concentrations. The lifetime of C. elegans was reduced faster in the TWP treatment groups, and the effective concentration for lifetime exposure tests were 100- to 1,000-fold lower than those of short-term exposure tests. Water-extractable metal concentrations (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the TWP-soils showed no correlation with nominal TWP concentrations or pre-incubation times, and the incorporated metals in the TWPs may be not the main reason of toxicity in this study. Our results show that toxic effects of TWPs can be time-dependent, both in terms of the microplastic particles themselves and their interactions in the soil matrix, but also because of susceptibility of target organisms depending on developmental stage. It is vital that future work consider these aspects, since otherwise effects of microplastics and TWPs could be underestimated.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Psychostimulant (methamphetamine, cocaine) use disorders have a genetic component that remains mostly unknown. Here, we conducted genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of methamphetamine stimulant sensitivity. To facilitate gene identification, we employed a Reduced Complexity Cross between closely related C57BL/6 mouse substrains and examined maximum speed and distance traveled over 30 min following methamphetamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). For maximum methamphetamine-induced speed following the second and third administration, we identified a single genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 11 that peaked near the Cyfip2 locus [LOD = 3.5, 4.2; peak = 21 cM (36 Mb)]. For methamphetamine-induced distance traveled, we identified a single genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 5 that peaked near a functional intronic indel in Gabra2 that codes for the alpha-2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor [LOD = 5.2; peak = 35 cM (67 Mb)]. Striatal cis-expression QTL mapping corroborated Gabra2 as a functional candidate gene underlying methamphetamine-induced distance traveled. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the mutant intronic deletion on the C57BL/6J background to the wild-type C57BL/6NJ allele was sufficient to reduce methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity toward the wild-type C57BL/6NJ-like level, thus validating the quantitative trait variant (QTV). These studies demonstrate the power and efficiency of Reduced Complexity Crosses in identifying causal genes and variants underlying complex traits. Functionally restoring Gabra2 expression decreased methamphetamine stimulant sensitivity and supports preclinical and human genetic studies implicating the GABA-A receptor in psychostimulant addiction-relevant traits. Importantly, our findings have major implications for investigators studying psychostimulants in the C57BL/6J strain - the gold standard strain in biomedical research.",

However, the storage and analysis of nanopore sequencing data have become major bottlenecks preventing more widespread adoption in research and clinical genomics. Here, we elucidate an inherent limitation in the file format used to store raw nanopore data - known as FAST5 - that prevents efficient analysis on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. To overcome this, we have developed SLOW5, an alternative file format that permits efficient parallelisation and, thereby, acceleration of nanopore data analysis. For example, we show that using SLOW5 format, instead of FAST5, reduces the time and cost of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling by an order of magnitude on common HPC systems, and delivers consistent improvements on a wide range of different architectures. With a simple, accessible file structure and a ~25% reduction in size compared to FAST5, SLOW5 format will deliver substantial benefits to all areas of the nanopore community.",

    "abstract": "Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is the most widespread coniferous tree in the boreal forests of Eurasia and has major economic and ecological importance. However, its large and repetitive genome presents a challenge for conducting genome-wide analyses such as association studies and genomic selection. We present a new 50K SNP genotyping array for Scots pine research, breeding programs, and other applications. To select the SNP set, we first genotyped 480 Scots pine samples on a 407 540 SNP screening array, and identified 47 712 high-quality SNPs for the final array (called  PiSy50k). Here, we provide details of the design and testing, as well as allele frequency estimates from the discovery panel, functional annotation, tissue-specific expression patterns, and expression level information for the SNPs or corresponding genes, when available. We validated the performance of the PiSy50k array using samples from breeding populations from Finland and Scotland. Overall, 39 678 (83.2%) SNPs showed low error rates (mean = 0.92%). Relatedness estimates based on array genotypes were consistent with the expected pedigrees, and the amount of Mendelian error was negligible. In addition, array genotypes successfully discriminate Scots pine populations from different geographic origins. The PiSy50k array will be a valuable tool for future genetic studies and forestry applications.\n\nSignificance statementScots pine is an evolutionary, economically and ecologically impressive coniferous species but its gigantic genome has limited studying e.g. the genetic basis of its functional trait variation. We have developed a genotyping array that facilitates Scots pine genetic research and linking its trait variation to genetic polymorphisms and gene expression levels across the genome.",

Aiming to fill this gap, we developed new benchmarking standards for quantitatively estimating drug retrieval performance. Investigations of potential factors influencing drug retrieval were conducted based on these standards. As a result, we determined an optimal strategy for LINCS data-based therapeutic discovery. With this approach, we further identified new therapeutics for liver cancer of which the current treatment modalities remain imperfect. Both computational and experimental results demonstrated homoharringtonine (HHT) could be a promising anti-liver cancer agent.

    "abstract": "A call for the integration of research experiences into all biology curricula has been a major goal for educational reform efforts nationally. Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have been the predominant method of accomplishing this, but their associated costs and complex design can limit their wide adoption. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced programs to identify unique ways to still provide authentic research experiences while students were virtual. We report here a full guide for the successful implementation of a semester-long virtual CURE that uses Drosophila behavioral assays to explore the connection between pain and addiction with the use of a \"lab-in-a-box\" sent home to students. Individual components were piloted across three semesters and launched as a 100-level introductory course with 19 students. We found that this course increased science identity and successfully improved key research competencies as per the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) survey. This course is ideal for flipped classrooms ranging from introductory biology to upper-level neuroscience courses and can be integrated directly into the lecture period without the need for building a new course. Given the low cost, recent comfort with virtual learning environments, and the current proliferation of flipped biology classrooms following the 2020 pandemic, this curriculum could serve as an ideal project-based active-learning tool for equitably increasing access to authentic research experiences.",

    "abstract": "Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) estimates microstructural properties of brain tissue relating to the organisation and processing capacity of neurites, which are essential elements for neuronal communication. Descriptive statistics of NODDI tissue metrics are commonly analysed in regions-of-interest (ROI) to identify brain-phenotype associations. Here, the conventional method to calculate the ROI mean weights all voxels equally. However, this produces biased estimates in the presence of CSF partial volume. This study introduces the tissue-weighted mean, which calculates the mean NODDI metric across the tissue within an ROI, utilising the tissue fraction estimate from NODDI to reduce estimation bias. We demonstrate the proposed mean in a study of white matter abnormalities in young onset Alzheimers disease (YOAD). Results show the conventional mean induces significant bias that correlates with CSF partial volume, primarily affecting periventricular regions and more so in YOAD subjects than in healthy controls. Due to the differential extent of bias between healthy controls and YOAD subjects, the conventional mean under- or over-estimated the effect size for group differences in many ROIs. This demonstrates the importance of using the correct estimation procedure when inferring group differences in studies where the extent of CSF partial volume differs between groups. These findings are robust across different acquisition and processing conditions. Bias persists in ROIs at higher image resolution, as demonstrated using data obtained from the third phase of the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI); and when performing ROI analysis in template space. This suggests that conventional ROI means of NODDI metrics are biased estimates under most contemporary experimental conditions, the correction of which requires the proposed tissue-weighted mean. The tissue-weighted mean produces accurate estimates of ROI means and group differences when ROIs contain voxels with CSF partial volume. In addition to NODDI, the technique can be applied to other multi-compartment models that account for CSF partial volume, such as the free water elimination method. We expect the technique to help generate new insights into normal and abnormal variation in tissue microstructure of regions typically confounded by CSF partial volume, such as those in individuals with larger ventricles due to atrophy associated with neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in the control and resolution of viral infections and can adopt a wide range of phenotypes and effector functions depending on the inflammatory context and the duration and extent of antigen exposure. Similarly, viral infections can exert diverse selective pressures on populations of clonally related T cells. Technical limitations have nevertheless made it challenging to investigate the relationship between clonal selection and transcriptional phenotypes of virus-specific T cells. We therefore performed single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and transcriptome sequencing of virus-specific CD8 T cells in murine models of acute, chronic and latent infection. We observed clear infection-specific populations corresponding to memory, effector, exhausted, and inflationary phenotypes. We further uncovered a mouse-specific and polyclonal T cell response, despite all T cells sharing specificity to a single viral epitope, which was accompanied by stereotypic TCR germline gene usage in all three infection types. Persistent antigen exposure during chronic and latent viral infections resulted in a higher proportion of clonally expanded T cells relative to acute infection. We furthermore observed a relationship between transcriptional heterogeneity and clonal expansion for all three infections, with highly expanded clones having distinct transcriptional phenotypes relative to lowly expanded clones. Finally, we developed and utilized a bioinformatic pipeline integrating pseudotime and clonality, termed Clonotyme, to further support a model in which expanded virus-specific CD8+ T cells adopt heterogenic, yet preferentially, effector-like phenotypes. Together our work relates clonal selection to gene expression in the context of viral infection and further provides a dataset and accompanying software for the immunological community.",

In our pursuit to establish a model for severe COVID-19, we inoculated young and adult male ferrets intranasally or intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal inoculation established an infection in all ferrets, with viral dissemination into the brain and gut. Upon intratracheal inoculation only adult ferrets became infected. However, neither inoculation route induced observable COVID-19 symptoms. Despite this, a persistent inflammation in the nose was prominent in especially young ferrets and follicular hyperplasia in the bronchi developed 21 days post infection. These effects -if sustained- might resemble long-COVID. Respiratory and systemic cellular responses and antibody responses were induced only in animals with an established infection. We conclude that intranasally-infected ferrets resemble asymptomatic COVID-19 and possibly aspects of long-COVID. Combined with the increasing portfolio to measure adaptive immunity, ferrets are a relevant model for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research.",

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing has the advantage of shortening regulatory preclinical development steps. Here, we screened a library of drug compounds, already registered in one or several geographical areas, to identify those exhibiting antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with relevant potency. Of the 1,942 compounds tested, 21 exhibited a substantial antiviral activity in Vero-81 cells. Among them, clofoctol, an antibacterial drug used for the treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections, was further investigated due to favorable safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties. Notably, the peak concentration of clofoctol that can be achieved in human lungs is more than 20 times higher than its IC50 measured against SARS-CoV-2 in human pulmonary cells. This compound inhibits SARS-CoV-2 at a post-entry step. Lastly, therapeutic treatment of human ACE2 receptor transgenic mice decreased viral load, reduced inflammatory gene expression and lowered pulmonary pathology. Altogether, these data strongly support clofoctol as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n\nSummaryAntivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2 are sorely needed. In this study, we screened a library of drug compounds and identified clofoctol as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2. We further demonstrated that, in vivo, this compound reduces inflammatory gene expression and lowers pulmonary pathology.",

    "abstract": "During loading of viscoelastic tissues, part of the mechanical energy is transformed into heat that can locally increase the tissue temperature, a phenomenon known as self-heating. In the framework of mechanobiology, it has been accepted that cells react and adapt to mechanical stimuli. However, the cellular effect of temperature increase as a by-product of loading has been widely neglected. In this work, we focused on cartilage self-heating to present a \"thermo-mechanobiological\" paradigm, and demonstrate how the synergy of a biomimetic temperature evolution and mechanical loading could influence cell behavior. We thereby developed a customized in vitro system allowing to recapitulate pertinent in vivo physical cues and determined the cells chondrogenic response to thermal and/or mechanical stimuli. Cellular mechanisms of action and potential signaling pathways of thermo-mechanotransduction process were also investigated. We found that co-existence of thermo-mechanical cues had a superior effect on chondrogenic gene expression compared to either signal alone. Specifically, a synergetic effect was observed for upregulation of Sox9 by application of the physiological thermo-mechanical stimulus. Multimodal TRPV4 channels were identified as key mediators of thermo-mechanotransduction process, which becomes ineffective without external calcium sources. We also observed that the isolated temperature evolution, as a by-product of loading, is a contributing factor to the cells response and this could be considered as important as the conventional mechanical loading. Providing an optimal thermo-mechanical environment by synergy of heat and loading portrays new opportunity for development of novel treatments for cartilage regeneration and can furthermore signal key elements for emerging cell-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Excitation contraction coupling (ECC) is the process by which electrical excitation of muscle is converted into force generation. Depolarization of skeletal muscle resting potential contributes to failure of ECC in diseases such as periodic paralysis, ICU acquired weakness and possibly fatigue of muscle during vigorous exercise. When extracellular K+ is raised to depolarize the resting potential, failure of ECC occurs suddenly, over a range of several mV of resting potential. While some studies have hypothesized the sudden failure of ECC is due to all-or-none failure of excitation, other studies suggest failure of excitation is graded. Intracellular recordings of action potentials (APs) in individual fibers during depolarization revealed that APs do not fail in an all-or-none manner. Simultaneous imaging of Ca2+ transients during depolarization revealed failure over a narrow range of resting potentials. An AP property that closely correlated with the sudden failure of the Ca2+ transient was the integral of AP voltage with respect to time. We hypothesize the close correlation is due to the combined dependence on time and voltage of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The quantitative relationships established between resting potential, APs and Ca2+ transients provide the foundation for future studies of depolarization-induced failure of ECC in diseases such as periodic paralysis.",

Wearable devices have emerged as a possible solution to aid in this process, but their use in real-life stress detection has not been systematically investigated.\n\nMethodsUsing ecological momentary assessments (EMA) combined with wearable biosensors for ecological physiological assessments (EPA), we investigated the impact of an ecological stressor (i.e., an exam week) on physiological arousal and affect. With this paradigm we investigated whether we could use wearable devices to detect stress states using machine learning models.\n\nResultsDuring stressful high-stake exam (versus control) weeks, participants reported increased negative affect and decreased positive affect. Intriguingly, physiological arousal was decreased on average during the exam week. Time-resolved analyses revealed peaks in physiological arousal associated with both self-reported stress and self-reported positive affect, while the overall decrease in physiological arousal was mediated by lower positive affect during the stress period. We then used machine learning to show that a combination of EMA and physiology yields optimal identification of stress states.\n\nConclusionsOur findings highlight the potential of wearable biosensors in stress-related mental-health monitoring, but critically show that psychological context is essential for interpreting physiological arousal detected using these devices.",

    "abstract": "Believing that good things will happen in life is essential to maintain motivation and achieve highly ambitious goals. This optimism bias, the overestimation of positive outcomes, may be particularly important during childhood when motivation must be maintained in the face of negative outcomes. In a learning task, we have thus studied the mechanisms underlying the development of optimism bias. Investigating children (8-9 year-olds), early (12-13 year-olds) and late adolescents (16-17 year-olds), we find a consistent optimism bias across age groups. However, children were particularly hyperoptimistic, with the optimism bias decreasing with age. Using computational modelling, we show that this was driven by a reduced learning from worse-than-expected outcomes, and this reduced learning explains why children are hyperoptimistic. Our findings thus show that insensitivity to bad outcomes in childhood helps to prevent taking on an overly realistic perspective and maintain motivation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTMPRSS2 is a host cell membrane fusion protein for SARS-CoV-2 invading human host cells. It also has an association with cancer, particularly prostate cancer. However, its association with lung cancer remains insufficiently explored. Thus, an in-depth investigation into the association between TMPRSS2 and lung cancer is significant, considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and that the lungs are the primary organ SARS-CoV-2 attacks.\n\nMethodsUsing five lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) genomics datasets, we explored associations between TMPRSS2 expression and immune signatures, cancer-associated pathways, tumor progression phenotypes, and clinical prognosis in LUAD by the bioinformatics approach. Furthermore, we validated the findings from the bioinformatics analysis by performing in vitro experiments with the human LUAD cell line A549 and in vivo experiments with mouse tumor models. We also validated our findings in LUAD patients from Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, China.\n\nResultsTMPRSS2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the enrichment levels of CD8+ T and NK cells and immune cytolytic activity in LUAD, which represent antitumor immune signatures. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the enrichment levels of CD4+ regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and PD-L1 expression levels in LUAD, which represent antitumor immunosuppressive signatures. However, TMPRSS2 expression levels showed a significant positive correlation with the ratios of immune-stimulatory/immune-inhibitory signatures (CD8+ T cells/PD-L1) in LUAD. It indicated that TMPRSS2 levels had a stronger negative correlation with immune-inhibitory signatures than with immune-stimulatory signatures. TMPRSS2 downregulation correlated with elevated activities of many oncogenic pathways in LUAD, including cell cycle, mismatch repair, p53, and extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling. TMPRSS2 downregulation correlated with increased proliferation, stemness, genomic instability, tumor advancement, and worse survival in LUAD. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated the association of TMPRSS2 deficiency with increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion and antitumor immunity in LUAD. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that TMPRSS2-knockdown tumors were more sensitive to BMS-1, an inhibitor of PD-1/PD-L1.\n\nConclusionsTMPRSS2 is a tumor suppressor, while its downregulation is a positive biomarker of immunotherapy in LUAD.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has largest RNA genome of approximately 30kb among RNA viruses. The DDX DEAD-box RNA helicase is a multifunctional protein involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. Therefore, host RNA helicases may regulate and maintain such large viral RNA genome. In this study, I investigated the potential role of several host cellular RNA helicases in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, DDX21 knockdown markedly accumulated intracellular viral RNA and viral production, as well as viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that DDX21 strongly restricts the SARS-CoV-2 infection. As well, MOV10 RNA helicase also suppressed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, DDX1, DDX5, and DDX6 RNA helicases were required for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection dispersed the P-body formation of DDX6 and MOV10 RNA helicases as well as XRN1 exonuclease, while the viral infection did not induce stress granule formation. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein interacted with DDX6, DDX21, and MOV10 and disrupted the P-body formation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 N hijacks DDX6 to utilize own viral replication and overcomes their anti-viral effect of DDX21 and MOV10 through as interaction with host cellular RNA helicase. Altogether, host cellular RNA helicases seem to regulate the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 has large RNA genome of approximately 30kb. To regulate and maintain such large viral RNA genome, host RNA helicases may involve in SARS-CoV-2 replication. In this study, I have demonstrated that DDX21 and MOV10 RNA helicases limit viral infection and replication. In contrast, DDX1, DDX5 and DDX6 are required for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupted P-body formation and attenuated or suppressed stress granule formation. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 seems to hijack host cellular RNA helicases to play a proviral role by facilitating viral infection and replication and, by suppressing host innate immune system.",

In this study we focus on genes we have found to be associated with patient outcome following bacteraemia caused by the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. By examining the contribution these genes make to the ability of the bacteria to survive exposure to the antibacterial factors found in serum, we identify three novel serum resistance associated genes, mdeA, mpsB and yycH. Detailed analysis of an MpsB mutant supports its previous association with the slow growing SCV phenotype of S. aureus, and we demonstrate that the effect this mutation has on membrane potential prevents the activation of the Agr quorum sensing system, and as a consequence the mutant bacteria do not produce cytolytic toxins. Given the importance of both toxin production and immune evasion to the ability of S. aureus to cause disease, we believe these findings explain the role of the mpsB gene as a mortality-associate locus during human disease.",

    "abstract": "Fungi that degrade B20 biodiesel in storage tanks have also been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). A member of the filamentous fungal genus Byssochlamys, and a yeast from the genus Wickerhamomyces were isolated from heavily contaminated B20 storage tanks from multiple Air Force bases. Although these taxa were linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in situ, precise measurement of their corrosion rates and pitting severity on carbon steel was not available. In the experiments described here, we directly link fungal growth on B20 biodiesel to higher corrosion rates and pitting corrosion of carbon steel under controlled conditions. When these fungi were growing solely on B20 biodiesel for carbon and energy, consumption of FAME and n-alkanes was observed. The corrosion rates for both fungi were highest at the interface between the B20 biodiesel and the aqueous medium, where they acidified the medium and produced deeper pits than abiotic controls. Byssochlamys produced the most corrosion of carbon steel and produced the greatest pitting damage. This study characterizes and quantifies the corrosion of carbon steel by fungi that are common in fouled B20 biodiesel through their metabolism of the fuel, providing valuable insight for assessing MIC associated with storage and dispensing B20 biodiesel.\n\nIMPORTANCEBiodiesel is widely used across the United States and worldwide, blended with ultralow sulfur diesel in various concentrations. In this study we were able to demonstrate that the filamentous fungi Byssochlamys AF004 and the yeast Wickerhamomyces SE3 were able to degrade fatty acid methyl esters and alkanes in biodiesel causing increases in acidity. Both fungi also accelerated the corrosion of carbon steel, especially at the interface of the fuel and water, where their biofilms were located.

    "abstract": "The beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current global COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses. Assembly and budding of coronavirus particles occur at the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC), with the structural proteins Nucleocapsid, Spike, Membrane and Envelope facilitating budding and release of virions into the secretory pathway lumen. This allows viral release which can occur through delivery of virus particles to deacidified lysosomes and subsequent lysosomal secretion. Coronaviral Envelope proteins are necessary for coronavirus assembly, play important roles in replication and can form oligomeric cation channels. Whilst synthesised in the ER, the mechanism by which Envelope achieves its steady state localisation to the ERGIC remains unclear. Here, we used fluorescent reporters to illuminate the Envelope protein from SARS-CoV-2. We discovered that internal tagging of this protein is necessary to preserve the functionality of a C-terminal ER-export motif and to allow localisation of Envelope to the ERGIC. Using this non-disruptive form of tagging, we used proximity biotinylation to define the vicinal proteome of wild type and ER-restricted versions of Envelope. We show that both Envelope and the presence of its ER-export motif contribute to the packaging of nucleocapsid into virus like particles. Finally, using our labelled versions of Envelope, we discovered that a minor pool of this protein is delivered to lysosomes. We show that lysosomal Envelope is oligomeric and can contribute to pH neutralisation in these organelles.",

    "abstract": "Climate change predicts the increased frequency, duration, and intensity of inclement weather periods, such as unseasonably low temperatures (i.e., cold snaps) and prolonged precipitation. Many migratory species have advanced the phenology of important life history stages, and as a result will likely be exposed to these periods of inclement spring weather more often, thus risking reduced fitness and population growth. For declining avian species, including aerial insectivores, anthropogenic landscape changes such as agricultural intensification are another driver of population declines. These landscape changes may affect the foraging ability of food provisioning parents, and reduce the survival of nestlings exposed to inclement weather, through for example pesticide exposure impairing thermoregulation and punctual anorexia. Breeding in agro-intensive landscapes may thus exacerbate the negative effects of inclement weather under climate change. We observed that a significant reduction in the availability of insect prey occurred when daily maximum temperatures fell below 18.3{degrees}C, and thereby defined any day where the maximum temperature fell below this value as a day witnessing a cold snap. We then combined daily information on the occurrence of cold snaps and measures of precipitation to assess their impact on the fledging success of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) occupying a nest box system placed across a gradient of agricultural intensification. Estimated fledging success of this declining aerial insectivore was 36.2% lower for broods experiencing four cold snap days during the 12 days post hatching period versus broods experiencing none, and this relationship was worsened when facing more precipitation. We further found that the overall negative effects of a brood experiencing periods of inclement weather was exacerbated in more agro-intensive landscapes. Our results indicate that two of the primary hypothesized drivers of many avian population declines may interact to further increase the rate of declines in certain landscape contexts.",

Here, we show that inbreeding in a subsocial invertebrate, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, reduces novel host plant colonization and reproductive fitness. When provided with the possibility to learn from previous experience with a host plant species, outbred mites showed aversive learning ability, but inbred mites did not adapt their behavior.

    "abstract": "After more than a year of the pandemic situation of COVID-19, the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil became the epicenter of new lineages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Variants of Concern (VOCs) were identified through a continuous genomic surveillance global effort, the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and P.1 (Gamma) harboring a constellation set of mutations. This research aims to: (i) report the predominance of the Gamma (P.1) lineage presenting the epidemiological situation of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance at the state of Tocantins, and (ii) describe the emergence of possible new mutations and viral variants with the potential new lineage (P1-related) represented by 8 genomes from the Tocantins harboring the mutation L106F in ORF3a. At the moment, 6,687 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID carry this mutation. The whole-genome sequencing has an important role in understanding the evolution and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, thus, the continuous monitoring will help in the control measures and restrictions imposed by the secretary of health of the state to prevent the spread of variants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpontaneous cancers in companion dogs are increasingly recognized as robust models of human disease. This recognition has led to translational clinical trials in companion dogs with osteosarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. The ability to precisely track tumor-specific immune responses in such clinical trials would benefit from reagents to perform species-specific single cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCRseq). This technology defines clones of T cells reacting to immune interventions and can help identify the specific epitope of response. Single cell gene expression data give insights into the activity and polarization of the T cell. To date, scTCRseq has not been demonstrated for canine samples.\n\nMethodsSamples from two responding dogs in a trial of an autologous deglycosylated melanoma vaccine were selected to demonstrate applicability of scTCRseq in a cancer immunotherapy setting. A single-cell suspension of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was prepared for 10X single cell sequencing. Full length 10X cDNA was amplified using a custom-designed nested PCR of the alpha/beta V(D)J region. A library made from this enriched product (scTCRseq) and a 10X gene expression (GEX) library (scRNAseq) were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000.\n\nResults1,850-2,172 estimated V(D)J-expressing cells yielded 87-103.7 million reads with 73.8%-75.8% mapped to a V(D)J gene (beta/alpha chains ratio 1.5:1). 43 TRAJ, 29 TRAV, 12 TRBJ, and 22 TRBV gene segments were observed representing 72.9%, 51.8%, 100%, and 62.9% of all known V and J gene segments respectively. A large diversity of clonotypes was captured with 966-1,253 TRA/TRB clonotypes identified. Both dogs also exhibited a small number of highly abundant T cell clonotypes suggesting the presence of an anti-tumor T cell population. GEX enriched libraries successfully defined large clusters of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that overlapped with V(D)J-expressing cells.\n\nDiscussionThe developed reagents successfully generated scTCRseq data, for the first time, which allowed the T cell repertoire to be surveyed in dogs responding to anti-tumor immunotherapy. These reagents will allow longitudinal tracking of anti-tumor T cell dynamics in canine cancer immunotherapy trials.",

    "abstract": "Architectural proteins alter the shape of DNA, often by distorting the double helix and introducing sharp kinks that relieve strain in tightly-bent DNA structures. Here we design and test artificial architectural proteins based on a sequence-specific Transcription Activator-like Effector (TALE) protein, either alone or fused to a eukaryotic high mobility group B (HMGB) DNA-bending domain. We hypothesized that TALE protein binding would stiffen DNA to bending and twisting, acting as an architectural protein that antagonizes the formation of small DNA loops. In contrast, fusion to an HMGB domain was hypothesized to generate a targeted DNA-bending architectural protein that facilitates DNA looping. We provide evidence from E. coli Lac repressor gene regulatory loops supporting these hypotheses in living bacteria. Both data fitting to a thermodynamic DNA looping model and sophisticated molecular modeling support the interpretation of these results. We find that TALE protein binding inhibits looping by stiffening DNA to bending and twisting, while the Nhp6A domain enhances looping by bending DNA without introducing twisting flexibility. Our work illustrates artificial approaches to sculpt DNA geometry with functional consequences. Similar approaches may be applicable to tune the stability of small DNA loops in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) within splicing factor RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as phosphorylation, regulate several critical steps in RNA metabolism including spliceosome assembly, alternative splicing and mRNA export. Notably, the arginine-/serine-rich (RS) domains in SR proteins are densely modified by phosphorylation compared with the remainder of the proteome. Previously, we showed that dephosphorylation of SRSF2 regulated increased interactions with similar arginine-rich RBPs U1-70K and LUC7L3. In this work, we dephosphorylated nuclear extracts using phosphatase in vitro and analyzed equal amounts of detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Correlation network analysis resolved 27 distinct modules of differentially soluble nucleoplasm proteins. We found classes of arginine-rich RBPs that decrease in solubility following dephosphorylation and enrich to the insoluble pelleted fraction, including the SR protein family and the SR-like LUC7L RBP family. Importantly, increased insolubility was not observed across broad classes of RBPs. Phosphorylation regulated SRSF2 structure, as dephosphorylated SRSF2 formed high molecular weight oligomeric species in vitro. Reciprocally, phosphorylation of SRSF2 by serine-/arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) in vitro prevented high molecular weight SRSF2 species formation. Furthermore, we pharmacologically inhibited SRPKs in mammalian cells and observed increased cytoplasmic granules as well as the formation of cytoplasmic SRSF2 tubular structures that associate with microtubules by immunocytochemical staining. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that phosphorylation may be a critical modification that prevents arginine-rich RBP insolubility and oligomerization.",

FLYC1 is larger and its sequence diverges from previously studied MscS homologs, suggesting it has unique structural features that contribute to its function. Here, we characterized FLYC1 by cryo-electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and electrophysiology. Akin to bacterial MscS and plant MSL1 channels, we find that FLYC1 central core includes side portals in the cytoplasmic cage that regulate ion conduction, by identifying critical residues that modulate channel conductance. Topologically unique cytoplasmic flanking regions can adopt  up or  down conformations, making the channel asymmetric. Disruption of an up conformation-specific interaction severely delays channel deactivation by 40-fold likely due to stabilization of the channel open state. Our results illustrate novel structural features and likely conformational transitions that regulate mechano-gating of FLYC1.",

    "abstract": "The identification of genes and pathways responsible for the transformation of normal cells into malignant ones represents a pivotal step to understand the aetiology of cancer, to characterise progression and relapse, and to ultimately design targeted therapies. The advent of high-throughput omic technologies has enabled the discovery of a significant number of cancer driver genes, but recent genomic studies have shown these to be only necessary but not sufficient to trigger tumorigenesis. Since most biological processes are the results of the interaction of multiple genes, it is then conceivable that tumorigenesis is likely the result of the action of networks of cancer driver and non-driver genes.\n\nHere we take advantage of recent advances in graph neural networks, combined with well established statistical models of network structure, to build a new model, called Stochastic Block Model Graph Neural Network (SBM-GNN), which predicts cancer driver genes and cancer mediating pathways directly from high-throughput omic experiments. Experimental analysis of synthetic datasets showed that our model can correctly predict genes associated with cancer and recover relevant pathways, while outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.\n\nFinally, we used SBM-GNN to perform a pan-cancer analysis, where we found genes and pathways directly involved in the hallmarks of cancer controlling genome stability, apoptosis, immune response, and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Gene set based phenotype enrichment analysis (detecting phenotypic terms that emerge as significant in a set of genes) can improve the rate of genetic diagnoses amongst other research purposes. To facilitate diverse phenotype analysis, we developed PhenoExam, a freely available R package for tool developers and a web interface for users, which performs: (1) phenotype and disease enrichment analysis on a gene set; (2) measures statistically significant phenotype similarities between gene sets and (3) detects significant differential phenotypes or disease terms across different databases. PhenoExam achieves these tasks by integrating databases or resources such as the HPO, MGD, CRISPRbrain, CTD, ClinGen, CGI, OrphaNET, UniProt, PsyGeNET, and Genomics England Panel App. PhenoExam accepts both human and mouse genes as input. We developed PhenoExam to assist a variety of users, including clinicians, computational biologists and geneticists. It can be used to support the validation of new gene-to-disease discoveries, and in the detection of differential phenotypes between two gene sets (a phenotype linked to one of the gene set but no to the other) that are useful for differential diagnosis and to improve genetic panels. We validated PhenoExam performance through simulations and its application to real cases. We demonstrate that PhenoExam is effective in distinguishing gene sets or Mendelian diseases with very similar phenotypes through projecting the disease-causing genes into their annotation-based phenotypic spaces. We also tested the tool with early onset Parkinsons disease and dystonia genes, to show phenotype-level similarities but also potentially interesting differences. More specifically, we used PhenoExam to validate computationally predicted new genes potentially associated with epilepsy. Therefore, PhenoExam effectively discovers links between phenotypic terms across annotation databases through effective integration. The R package is available at https://github.com/alexcis95/PhenoExam and the Web tool is accessible at https://snca.atica.um.es/PhenoExamWeb/.",

We implemented different methods to mitigate batch effects (R package batchtma), tested in plasmode simulation. Biomarker levels were more similar between mitigation approaches compared to uncorrected values. For some biomarkers, associations with clinical features changed substantially after addressing batch effects.

Honey bees are the most important managed pollinator in agriculture but the long-term survival of honey bees is seriously threatened. Feral honey bee colonies displayed persistence to Varroa mites. However, it is unknown whether feral honey bees are stress-resistant or survive longer than managed bee populations. More work is needed to determine the impact of oxidative stress on honey bee health and survival. We used the paired colony design to determine the lifespan and levels of oxidative stress on worker bees from either a feral or a managed colony. Each pair of colonies shared similar foraging resources. Results exhibit longer survival time and lifespans of foragers in feral colonies than the managed colonies. The levels of oxidative stress from the lipid damage of feral colonies are higher than the managed colonies, indicating a tolerant mechanism not a repair mechanism to survive.

Relatively little is known about what other proteins regulate Piezo2 activity in a cellular context.

Here we find that TACAN co-expression robustly reduced mechanically activated Piezo2 currents, but did not inhibit mechanically activated Piezo1 and TREK1 currents. TACAN co-expression did not affect cell surface expression of either Piezo1 or Piezo2 and did not have major effects on the cortical actin or tubulin cytoskeleton. TACAN expression alone did not result in the appearance of mechanically activated currents above background. In addition, TACAN and Piezo2 expression in DRG neurons overlapped, and siRNA mediated knockdown of TACAN did not decrease the proportion of slowly adapting mechanically activated currents, but resulted in an increased proportion of rapidly adapting currents. Our data do not support TACAN being a mechanically activated ion channel, and identify it as a negative modulator of Piezo2 channel activity.",

The spleen is considered the primary site of autoantibody production by autoreactive B cells and platelet destruction. The immediate failure in ~50% of patients to recover a normal platelet count after anti-CD20 Rituximab-mediated B cell depletion and splenectomy suggest that autoreactive, rituximab-resistant, IgG-secreting B cells (IgG-SC) reside in other anatomical compartments. We analyzed >3,300 single IgG-SC from spleen, bone marrow and/or blood of 27 patients with ITP revealing high inter-individual variability in affinity for GPIIbIIIa with variations over 3 logs. IgG-SC dissemination and range of affinities were however similar per patient. Longitudinal analysis of autoreactive IgG-SC upon treatment with anti-CD38 mAb daratumumab demonstrated variable outcomes, from complete remission to failure with persistence of high-affinity anti-GPIIbIIIa IgG-SC in the bone marrow.

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis, is a basidiomycete haploid budding yeast with a complete sexual cycle. Genome modification by homologous recombination is feasible using biolistic transformation and long homology arms, but the method is arduous and unreliable. Recently, multiple groups have reported the use of CRISPR-Cas9 as an alternative to biolistics, but long homology arms are still necessary, limiting the utility of this method. Since the S. pyogenes Cas9 derivatives used in prior studies were not optimized for expression in C. neoformans, we designed, synthesized, and tested a fully C. neoformans-optimized Cas9. We found that a Cas9 harboring only common C. neoformans codons and a consensus C. neoformans intron together with a TEF1 promoter and terminator and a nuclear localization signal (C. neoformans-optimized CAS9 or \"CnoCAS9\") reliably enabled genome editing in the widely-used KN99 C. neoformans strain. Furthermore, editing was accomplished using donors harboring short (50 bp) homology arms attached to marker DNAs produced with synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR amplification. We also demonstrated that prior stable integration of CnoCAS9 further enhances both transformation and homologous recombination efficiency; importantly, this manipulation does not impact virulence in animals. We also implemented a universal tagging module harboring a codon-optimized fluorescent protein (mNeonGreen) and a tandem Calmodulin Binding Peptide-2X FLAG Tag that allows for both localization and purification studies of proteins for which the corresponding genes are modified by short homology-directed recombination. These tools enable short-homology genome engineering in C. neoformans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe dissemination of pathogens carrying genetic elements such as antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), mobile-genetic elements (MGEs), virulome and methylome have a negative impact on food and environment safety, water quality and animal and human health. The applications of metagenomics to monitor and identify the prevalence/endemicity and emergence of these pathogenic agents from different sources were examined.\n\nMethodsArticles published in English language up to October 2020 were searched for on PubMed. Qualitative and quantitative data extracted from the included articles were translated into charts and maps. GraphPad Prism 9.0.2 was used to undertake statistical analysis using descriptive and column statistics, Chi-square, ANOVA, Wilcoxons signed-rank, and one-sample t-test.\n\nResultsIn all, 143 articles from 39 countries from Europe, America, Asia, and Africa were quantitatively analysed. Metagenomes from sewage/wastewater, surface water samples (ocean, sea, river lake, stream and tap water), WWTP, effluents and sludge samples contained pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii), viruses (Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Hepatovirus, Mamastrovirus and Rotavirus) and parasites (Acanthamoeba, Giardia, Entamoeba, Blastocystis and Naegleria). Integrons, plasmids, transposons, insertion sequences, prophages and integrative and conjugative elements were identified. ARGs mediating resistance to important antibiotics, including {beta}-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline, and virulence factors such as secretion system, adherence, antiphagocytosis, capsule, invasion, iron uptake, hemolysin, and flagella.\n\nConclusionClinically important pathogens, ARGs, and MGEs were identified in diverse clinical, environmental, and animal sources through metagenomics, which can be used to determine the prevalence and emergence of known and unknown pathogens and ARGs.\n\nImportance/significanceGlobal metagenomic analyses of drinking water, effluents, influents, un/-treated sewage, WWTPs, sludge, rivers, lakes, soil, sediments, biosolid, air and plants. showed the global distribution of diverse clinically important ARGs on mobile genetic elements, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and pathogens, metal resistance genes, and virulence genes in almost all environments. These depict the importance of shot-gun metagenomics as a surveillance tool for AMR and infectious disease control to safeguard water & food quality as well as public health from water- and food-borne outbreaks of pathogenic and ARB infections. More concerning was the identification of ARGs to last-resort antibiotics i.e., carbapenems, colistin, & tigecycline.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) infections in sheep have significant implications for animal health, welfare and productivity, as well as being a source of zoonotic pathogens. Interactions between pathogens and epithelial cells at the mucosal surface play a key role in determining the outcome of GI infections; however, the inaccessibility of the GI tract in vivo significantly limits the ability to study such interactions in detail. We therefore developed ovine epithelial organoids representing physiologically important gastric and intestinal sites of infection, specifically the abomasum (analogous to the stomach in monogastrics) and ileum. We show that both abomasal and ileal organoids form self-organising three-dimensional structures with a single epithelial layer and a central lumen that are stable in culture over serial passage. We performed RNA-seq analysis on abomasal and ileal tissue from multiple animals and on organoids across multiple passages and show the transcript profile of both abomasal and ileal organoids cultured under identical conditions are reflective of the tissue from which they were derived and that the transcript profile in organoids is stable over at least five serial passages. In addition, we demonstrate that the organoids can be successfully cryopreserved and resuscitated, allowing long-term storage of organoid lines, thereby reducing the number of animals required as a source of tissue. We also report the first published observations of a helminth infecting gastric and intestinal organoids by challenge with the sheep parasitic nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta, demonstrating the utility of these organoids for pathogen co-culture experiments. Finally, the polarity in the abomasal and ileal organoids can be inverted to make the apical surface directly accessible to pathogens or their products, here shown by infection of apical-out organoids with the zoonotic enteric bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. In summary, we report a simple and reliable in vitro culture system for generation and maintenance of small ruminant intestinal and gastric organoids. In line with 3Rs principals, use of such organoids will reduce and replace animals in host-pathogen research.",

Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria impose one of the major issues, as multidrug- to pandrug-resistant strains have been found, rendering some infections untreatable. In addition, A. baumannii is a champion in surviving in harsh environments, being capable of resisting to disinfectants and to persist prolonged periods of desiccation. Due to the high degree of variability found in A. baumannii isolates, the search for new antibacterials is challenging. Here, we screened a compound library to identify compounds active against recent isolates of A. baumannii bacteria.\n\nMethodsA repurposing drug screen was undertaken to identify A. baumannii growth inhibitors. One hit was further characterized by determining its IC50 and testing its activity on 43 recent clinical A. baumannii isolates, amongst which 40 are extensively drug- and carbapenem-resistant strains.\n\nResultsThe repurposing screen led to the identification of a harmine-derived compound, called HDC1, which proved to have bactericidal activity on the multidrug-resistant AB5075-VUB reference strain with an IC50 of 48.23 {micro}M. In addition, HDC1 impairs growth of all 43 recent clinical A. baumannii isolates.\n\nConclusionsWe identified a compound with inhibitory activity on all tested, extensively drug-resistant clinical A. baumannii isolates.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial communities of the sea grape Caulerpa lentillifera were studied during a disease outbreak in Vietnam. The Rhodobacteraceae and Rhodovulum dominated the composition of healthy C. lentillifera. Clear differences between healthy and diseased cases were observed at order, genus and Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) level. Bacterial diversity was lower in healthy C. lentillifera, probably because of antimicrobial compounds from the macroalgae and/or from Clostridium, Cutibacterium or Micrococcus bacteria. The likely beneficial role of Bradyrhizobium, Paracoccus and Brevundimonas strains on nutrient cycling and phytohormone production was discussed. The white coloration of diseased C. lentillifera may not only be associated with pathogens but also with an oxidative response. Aquibacter, Winogradskyella and other OTUs of the family Flavobacteriaceae were hypothesized as detrimental bacteria, this family comprises some well-known seaweed pathogens. Moreover, Thalassobius OTU 2935 and 1635 may represent detrimental Rhodobacteraceae. Phycisphaera together with other Planctomycetes and Woeseia were probably saprophytes of C. lentillifera. This study offers pioneering insights on the co-occurrence of C. lentillifera-attached bacteria, potential detrimental or beneficial microbes, and a baseline for understanding the C. lentillifera holobiont. Further metagenomic and biotechnological approaches are needed to confirm functions of some microbes on this macroalgae to enhance food security in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "The single-celled parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock and is transmitted by hematophagous tsetse flies. Lifecycle progression from mammalian bloodstream form to tsetse midgut form and, subsequently, infective salivary gland form depends on complex developmental steps and migration within different fly tissues. As the parasite colonises the glucose-poor insect midgut, its ATP production is thought to depend on activation of mitochondrial amino acid catabolism via oxidative phosphorylation. This process involves respiratory chain complexes and the F1FO-ATP synthase, and it requires protein subunits of these complexes that are encoded in the parasites mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast or kDNA). Here we show that a progressive loss of kDNA-encoded functions correlates with an increasingly impaired ability of T. brucei to initiate and complete its development in the tsetse. First, parasites with a mutated F1FO-ATP synthase with a reduced capacity for oxidative phosphorylation can initiate differentiation from bloodstream to insect form, but they are unable to proliferate in vitro. Unexpectedly, these cells can still colonise the tsetse midgut. However, these parasites exhibit a motility defect and are severely impaired in colonising or migrating to subsequent tsetse tissues. Second, parasites with a fully disrupted F1FO-ATP synthase complex that is completely unable to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation can still differentiate to the first insect stage in vitro but die within a few days and cannot establish a midgut infection in vivo. Third, mutant parasites lacking kDNA entirely can initiate differentiation but die within 24 h. Together, these three scenarios show that efficient ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation is not essential for initial colonisation of the tsetse vector, but it is required to power trypanosome migration within the fly.",

    "abstract": "In this project, we investigated the CRISPR/Cas9 system for creating HIV resistance by targeting the human CCR5 and CXCR4 genes, which encode cellular co-receptors required for HIV-1 infection. Using a clinically scalable system for transient ex vivo delivery of Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, we demonstrated that CRISPR-mediated disruption of CCR5 and CXCR4 in T-lymphocytes cells significantly reduced surface expression of the co-receptors, thereby establishing resistance to HIV-1 infection by CCR5 (R5)-tropic, CXCR4 (X4)-tropic, and dual (R5/X4)-tropic strains. CRISPR-mediated disruption of the CCR5 alleles in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) led to the differentiation of HIV-resistant macrophages. In human CD4+ T cells transplanted into a humanized mouse model, disruption of CXCR4 inhibited replication of X4-tropic HIV-1, thus leading to the virus-mediated enrichment CXCR4-disrupted cells in the peripheral blood and spleen. However, in human CD4+ T cells with both CCR5 and CXCR4 disruption, we observed poor engraftment in bone marrow, although significant changes were not observed in the lung, spleen, or peripheral blood. This study establishes a clinically scalable strategy for the dual knockout of HIV-1 co-receptors as a therapeutic strategy, while also raising caution of disrupting CXCR4, which may abate engraftment of CD4+ T cells in bone marrow.",

    "abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step of eukaryotic gene expression carried out by a series of dynamic macromolecular protein/RNA complexes, known collectively and individually as the spliceosome. This series of spliceosomal complexes define, assemble on, and catalyze the removal of introns. Molecular model snapshots of intermediates in the process have been created from cryo-EM data, however, many aspects of the dynamic changes that occur in the spliceosome are not fully understood. Caenorhabditis elegans follow the GU-AG rule of splicing, with almost all introns beginning with 5 GU and ending with 3 AG. These splice sites are identified early in the splicing cycle, but as the cycle progresses and \"custody\" of the pre-mRNA splice sites is passed from factor to factor as the catalytic site is built, the mechanism by which splice site identity is maintained or re-established through these dynamic changes is unclear. We performed a genetic screen in C. elegans for factors that are capable of changing 5 splice site choice. We report that KIN17 and PRCC are involved in splice site choice, the first functional splicing role proposed for either of these proteins. Previously identified suppressors of cryptic 5 splicing promote distal cryptic GU splice sites, however, mutations in KIN17 and PRCC instead promote usage of an unusual proximal 5 splice site which defines an intron beginning with UU, separated by 1nt from a GU donor. We performed high-throughput mRNA sequencing analysis and found that mutations in PRCC but not KIN17 changed 5 splice sites genome-wide, promoting usage of nearby non-consensus sites. We further found that mutations in KIN17 and PRCC changed dozens of 3 splice sites, promoting non-consensus sites upstream of canonical splice sites. Our work has uncovered both fine and coarse mechanisms by which the spliceosome maintains splice site identity during the complex assembly process.\n\nAuthor SummaryPre-mRNA splicing is an essential step of gene regulation, carried out by an unusual molecular machine, the spliceosome. Unlike other molecular machines, such as ribosomes, that simply assemble and catalyze chemical reactions, \"the spliceosome\" is a highly-dynamic cycle, carried out by 5 specialized small nuclear RNAs and over 100 proteins, which sequentially join, rearrange, and withdraw from the splicing assembly during each splicing cycle. These assemblies initially choose \"splice sites\" where the pre-mRNA will be cut, and then undergo multiple rearrangements to finally form the active site which catalyzes the splicing reactions which remove an intron from a pre-mRNA. We are currently in the midst of a \"resolution revolution\", with ever-clearer cryo-EM snapshots of stalled complexes allowing researchers to visualize moments in time in the splicing cycle. These models are illuminating, but do not always elucidate mechanistic functioning, therefore our lab takes a complementary approach, using the power of genetics in a multicellular animal to gain functional insights into the spliceosome. Using a C .elegans genetic screen, we have found novel functional splicing roles for two proteins, KIN17 and PRCC. Our results suggest that the spliceosome does not just rely on its initial identification of the splice site, but in a later step, re-identifies where to cut. We liken this two-stage identification to using a microscope by first using the coarse focus to find the area of interest, and then using the fine focus to adjust as needed. This work moves us closer to full mechanistic understanding of how the spliceosome chooses where to cut a pre-mRNA message.",

    "abstract": "Age-related loss of cellular function and increased cell death are characteristic hallmarks of aging. While defects in gene expression and RNA metabolism have been linked with age-associated human neuropathies, it is not clear how the changes that occur in aging neurons contribute to loss of gene expression homeostasis. R-loops are RNA-DNA hybrids that typically form co-transcriptionally via annealing of the nascent RNA to the template DNA strand, displacing the non-template DNA strand. Dysregulation of R-loop homeostasis has been associated with both transcriptional impairment and genome instability. Importantly, a growing body of evidence links R-loop accumulation with cellular dysfunction, increased cell death and chronic disease onset. Here, we characterized the R-loop landscape in aging Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor neurons and showed that bulk R-loop levels increased with age. Further, genome-wide mapping of R-loops revealed that transcribed genes accumulated R-loops over gene bodies during aging, which correlated with decreased expression of long and highly expressed genes. Importantly, while photoreceptor-specific down-regulation of Top3{beta}, a DNA/RNA topoisomerase associated with R-loop resolution, lead to decreased visual function, overexpression of Top3{beta} or nuclear-localized RNase H1, which resolves R-loops, enhanced positive light response during aging. Together, our studies highlight the functional link between dysregulation of R-loop homeostasis, gene expression and visual function during aging.",

    "abstract": "The authors have withdrawn their manuscript because many of the experiments described in this paper have not been reproducible, or at least are not robust, in the hands of other members of the Kaelin Laboratory who were not initially involved in this work. While we do see apparent secretion of histone H3 under some conditions, it is usually accompanied by secretion of histone H4. In this regard, the Halo tagged-histone H3 and Halo-tagged H4 constructs used for the single molecule imaging studies we reported, which seemingly confirmed specific secretion and transfer of histone H3, were purported to be sequence validated. Upon resequencing these constructs we discovered a non-synonymous mutation in the Halo tag of the H4 construct. We then redid the imaging experiments with the corrected Halo-H4 together with Halo-H3 and, in contrast to our earlier study, unfused Halo. These experiments were difficult to interpret because of the background signal seen with the unfused Halo but did not support specific secretion and transfer of histones (let alone specific secretion and transfer of histone H3).\n\nWe have, in some experiments, observed transfer of H3-Cre into reporter cells ex vivo and in vivo, but 1) the transfer is not specific for H3-Cre versus H4-Cre, 2) the transfer efficiency is highly variable, and 3) the transfer efficiency is typically much less than reported in our original paper. We do not yet know whether this lack of reproducibility and robustness reflects technical and biological variables that we do not yet understand and hence were not captured in our experimental protocols.\n\nTherefore, the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project.

The enuclated nature of erythrocytes makes them inaccessible to genetic tools, which in turn makes studying erythrocyte proteins involved in malaria invasion and development particularly difficult. Here we overcome this limitation using stem cell technology to develop a universal differentiation protocol for in vitro derivation of erythrocytes from a variety of stem cell lines of diverse origin. This allows manipulation of erythrocytic genes and examination of their impact on the parasite by flow cytometric detection of parasite haemozoin. Deletion of Basigin, the essential receptor for P. falciparum, abrogates invasion, while other less studied proteins such as ATP2B4 have a minor effect. Reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells from -thalassemia primary samples shows reduced infection levels, demonstrating this approach is useful for understanding the effect of natural human polymorphisms on the disease.",

Here we present data from a large, targeted knockout programme in which mice were analysed through a phenotyping pipeline. Twenty-five lines out of 1311 displayed different deafness phenotypes that did not segregate with the targeted allele. We have identified 8 different mutations causing deafness in 16 of these 25 lines and characterised the resulting phenotypes. Our data show that spontaneous mutations with observable effects on phenotype are a common side effect of intensive breeding programmes, including those underlying targeted mutation programmes.",

    "abstract": "Site-specific strategies for exchanging segments of dsDNA are important for DNA library construction and molecular tagging. Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3 ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi-base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT[-&gt;]dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non-perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called deoxyUridine eXcision-tagging (dUX-tagging), is an efficient one-pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3 overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5 overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX-tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX-tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high-efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.",

Efficacy of TDF ring was not investigated in sexually active women. Our understanding of the mechanisms of protection is limited. To address this knowledge gap, we performed simultaneous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of a TDF-IVR at the site of SIV challenge in pigtail macaques at the anatomical and cellular level. Specifically, we challenged TDF-IVR administered pigtail macaques with a single high dose of a non-replicative SIV-based vector containing a dual reporter system that helped us to identify the earliest targets of SIV infection within the mucosa. Two and three days after challenge, the macaques were euthanized and tenofovir (TFV) concentrations were measured in the female reproductive tract (FRT) by HPLC-MS/MS to correlate drug concentrations and SIV-vector transduction efficiency. TFV formed a gradient through the mucosal tissue, with the highest concentrations near the ring, in the upper vagina and endocervix. Despite this, several transduction events were identified with the most common sites being in the ovaries. Moreover, proviral DNA was detected in the cervix and vagina. Thus, our studies demonstrate an uneven distribution of TFV in the FRT of macaques after release from a TDF-IVR that leads to incomplete FRT protection from high viral dose challenge.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow toxicity is the most important factor limiting the use of cytotoxic drugs like alkylating agents in cancer treatment. Recently PG synthase enzyme inhibitors have been reported to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of these agents on cancer cells but little is known if they can affect the toxicity of these agents on bone marrow or other tissues. Cyclophosphamide is one of the most commonly used alkylating agent.\n\nIn the present work, the effect of these PG synthase enzyme inhibitors, aspirin on cyclophosphamide myelotoxicity was determined employing the peripheral blood count to reflect bone marrow injury. The effect on body weight changes caused by cyclophosphamide was also determined.\n\nO_LICyclophosphamide in doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg i. v. produced as a dose dependent reduction in total WBC count, granulocyte, non granulocyte, and Hb% which was maximum on second day after injection and still present on 5th day post injection. It also produced a dose dependent reduction in body weight on day 5 after injection.\nC_LIO_LIAspirin in doges of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg i. m. protected against the reduction in WBC counts  measured for 5 days after injection of cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg).

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a devastating brain disorder whose cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Excitatory mossy cells (MCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common form of focal epilepsy in adults. However, the role of MCs during initial seizures, before MC loss occurs, is unclear. Here, we show that initial seizures induced with kainic acid (KA) intraperitoneal injection in adult mice, a well-established model of experimental epilepsy, not only increased MC and granule cell (GC) activity in vivo, but also triggered a BDNF-dependent long-term potentiation at MC-GC synapses (MC-GC LTP). In vivo induction of MC-GC LTP worsened KA-induced seizures, whereas selective MC silencing and Bdnf genetic removal from GCs, which abolishes LTP, were both anti-epileptic. Thus, initial seizures strengthen MC-GC synaptic transmission, thereby promoting epileptic activity. Our findings reveal a potential mechanism of epileptogenesis that may help develop therapeutic strategies for early intervention.",

Manipulation of DC targeting the master regulator TANK-binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) might be useful to acquire controller-like properties. Here, we evaluated the impact of TBK1-primed DC inducing protective CD8+ T cell responses in lymphoid tissue and peripheral blood and their association with reduced HIV-1 disease progression in vivo in the humanized bone marrow, liver and thymus (hBLT) mouse model. A higher proportion of hBLT-mice vaccinated with TBK1-primed DC exhibited less severe CD4+ T cell depletion following HIV-1 infection compared to control groups. This was associated with infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the white pulp from the spleen, reduced spread of infected p24+ cells to secondary lymphoid organs and with preserved abilities of CD8+ T cells from the spleen and blood of vaccinated animals to induce specific polyfunctional responses upon antigen stimulation. Therefore, TBK1-primed DC might be an useful tool for subsequent vaccine studies.\n\nAuthor summaryEmulating protective immunological characteristics from individuals capable of spontaneously controlling HIV-1 infection might be useful for the development of a protective vaccine. Enhanced function of dendritic cells (DC) in these HIV-1 controllers depends on the activation of TANK-binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) and might associate with protective T cells. Our study evaluated the ability of DCs trained through TBK1 activation inducing protective adaptive immune responses against HIV-1 and reducing disease progression in vivo, using a humanized mouse model. Our data indicate that mice vaccinated with tailored DC exhibit delayed disease progression, increased induction of protective CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets in the lymphoid tissue and blood upon antigen recognition. Therefore, trained-DC might be an useful tool for future HIV-1 vaccine designs.",

    "abstract": "The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes has been widely deployed as a tool for bacterial strain construction. Conventional CRISPR-Cas9 editing strategies require design and molecular cloning of an appropriate guide RNA (gRNA) to target genome cleavage and a repair template for introduction of the desired site-specific genome modification. Here, we present a streamlined method that leverages the existing collection of nearly 4000 Bacillus subtilis strains (the BKE collection) with individual genes replaced by an integrated erythromycin (erm) resistance cassette. A single plasmid (pAJS23) with a gRNA targeted to erm allows cleavage of the genome at any non-essential gene, and at sites nearby to many essential genes. This plasmid can be engineered to include a repair template, or the repair template can be co-transformed with the plasmid as either a PCR product or genomic DNA. We demonstrate the utility of this system for generating gene replacements, site-specific mutations, modification of intergenic regions, and introduction of gene-reporter fusions. In sum, this strategy bypasses the need for gRNA design and allows the facile transfer of mutations and genetic constructions with no requirement for intermediate cloning steps.\n\nImportanceBacillus subtilis is a well-characterized Gram-positive model organism and a popular platform for biotechnology. Although many different CRISPR-based genome editing strategies have been developed for B. subtilis, they generally involve the design and cloning of a specific gRNA and repair template for each application. By targeting the erm resistance cassette with an anti-erm gRNA, genome-editing can be directed to any of nearly 4000 gene disruptants within the existing BKE collection of strains. Repair templates can be engineered as PCR products, or specific alleles and constructions can be transformed as chromosomal DNA, thereby bypassing the need for plasmid construction. The described method is rapid, free of off-target effects, and facilitates a wide-range of genome manipulations.\n\n\"Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.\" - Hippocrates",

Mutations in KIF1C cause hereditary spastic paraplegia and cerebellar dysfunction in human patients. However, neither the force generation of the KIF1C motor protein, nor the biophysical and functional properties of pathogenic mutant proteins have been studied thus far.\n\nHere we show that full length KIF1C is a processive motor that can generate forces up to 5.7 pN. We find that KIF1C single molecule processivity relies on its ability to slip and re-engage under load and that its slightly reduced stall force compared to kinesin-1 relates to its enhanced probability to backslip. Two pathogenic mutations P176L and R169W that cause hereditary spastic paraplegia in humans maintain fast, processive single molecule motility in vitro, but with decreased run length and slightly increased unloaded velocity compared to the wildtype motor. Under load in an optical trap, force generation by these mutants is severely reduced. In cells, the same mutants are impaired in producing sufficient force to efficiently relocate organelles.\n\nOur results establish a baseline for the single molecule mechanics of Kif1C and explain how pathogenic mutations at the microtubule-binding interface of KIF1C impair the cellular function of these long-distance transporters and result in neuronal disease.",

Because most works focus either on mutualism or predation, how pollination and herbivory interactively determine the stable coexistence in plant-pollinator-herbivore communities is still poorly understood. Studying the typical three-species module of such communities, we determine the conditions allowing stable coexistence then investigate how its maintenance constrains the relative interaction strengths. Our results show that coexistence is possible if pollination is sufficiently strong relative to herbivory, while its stability is possible if herbivory is sufficiently strong relative to pollination. A balance between pollination and herbivory is therefore required. Interestingly, shared preferences for plant phenotypes, that would favor such balance, have been frequently reported in the empirical literature. The identified ecological trade-off between attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores therefore also appears as an emergent property of stable plant-pollinator-herbivore communities.",

    "abstract": "Pavlovian fear conditioning is a widely used behavioral paradigm for studying associative learning in rodents. Despite early recognition that subjects may engage in a variety of both conditioned and unconditioned responses, the last several decades have seen the field narrow its focus to measure freezing as the sole indicator of conditioned fear. We previously reported that female rats were more likely than males to engage in darting, an escape-like conditioned response that is associated with heightened shock reactivity. To determine how experimental parameters contribute to the frequency of darting in both males and females, we manipulated factors such as chamber size, shock intensity, and number of trials. To better capture fear-related behavioral repertoires in our animals, we developed ScaredyRat, an open-source custom Python tool that analyzes Noldus Ethovision-generated raw data files to identify Darters and quantify both conditioned and unconditioned responses. We find that like freezing, conditioned darting occurrences scale with experimental alterations. While most darting occurs in females, we find that with an extended training protocol, darting can emerge in males as well. Collectively, our data suggest that darting reflects a behavioral switch in conditioned responding that is a product of both an individual animals sex, shock reactivity, and experimental parameters, underscoring the need for careful consideration of sex as a biological variable in classic learning paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Polypeptides with multiple enzyme domains, such as type I polyketide synthases, produce chemically complex compounds that are difficult to produce via conventional chemical synthesis and are often pharmaceutically or otherwise commercially valuable. Engineering polyketide synthases, via domain swapping and/or site directed mutagenesis, in order to generate novel polyketides, has tended to produce either low yields of product or no product at all. The success of such experiments may be limited by our inability to predict the key functional residues and boundaries of protein domains. Computational tools to identify the boundaries and the residues determining the substrate specificity of domains could reduce the trial and error involved in engineering multi-domain proteins. In this study we use statistical coupling analysis to identify networks of co-evolving residues in type I polyketide synthases, thereby predicting domain boundaries. We extend the method to predicting key residues for enzyme substrate specificity. We introduce bootstrapping calculations to test the relationship between sequence length and the number of sequences needed for a robust analysis. Our results show no simple predictor of the number of sequences needed for an analysis, which can be as few as a hundred and as many as a few thousand. We find that polyketide synthases contain multiple networks of co-substituting residues: some are intradomain but most multiple domains. Some networks of coupled residues correlate with specific functions such as the substrate specificity of the acyl transferase domain, the stereo chemistry of the ketoreductase domain, or domain boundaries that are consistent with experimental data. Our extension of the method provides a ranking of the likely importance of these residues to enzyme substrate specificity, allowing us to propose residues for further mutagenesis work. We conclude that analysis of co-evolving networks of residues is likely to be an important tool for re-engineering multi-domain proteins.\n\nAuthor summaryMany important compounds such as antibiotics or food flavourings are produced naturally by molecular factories within plant, fungal and bacterial cells. These molecular factories typically comprise a complex of multiple interacting enzymes, each enzyme being a stage in a molecular production line. Often the enzymes are connected together as subsections of the same amino acid chain, i.e. protein, with the amino acid chain folding into the separate functional enzymatic domains that comprise the production line. Polyketide synthases are such multi-domain proteins, and their products often have antibacterial, antifungal and antitumoric effects. Engineering polyketide synthases thus has the potential to produce novel drug candidates. We applied and developed statistical approaches to detect where in an amino acid sequence the boundaries are between different domains, potentially allowing these regions to be swapped around for the synthesis of novel compounds. We used the same approaches to identify parts of the amino acid chain important for the function of different types of domain, pointing to how they might be modified to make novel compounds. These analyses agree with published experimental data and allow us to make novel predictions, which we expect to help experimentalists produce novel compounds of commercial and pharmaceutical interest.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) attaches to the host cell surface to initiate the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein (S) and the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) receptor. SARS-CoV-1 mutates frequently because of its RNA genome, which challenges the antiviral development. Here, we performed computational saturation mutagenesis of the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 to identify the residues crucial for its functions. We used the structure-based energy calculations to analyze the effects of the missense mutations on the SARS-CoV-1 S stability and the binding affinity with hACE2. The sequence and structure alignment showed similarities between the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that target mutations of S protein amino acids generate similar effects on their stabilities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. For example, G839W of SARS-CoV-1 corresponds to G857W of SARS-CoV-2, which decrease the stability of their S glycoproteins. The viral mutation analysis of the two different SARS-CoV-1 isolates showed that mutations, T487S and L472P, weakened the S-hACE2 binding of the 2003-2004 SARS-CoV-1 isolate. In addition, the mutations of L472P and F360S destabilized the 2003-2004 viral isolate. We further predicted that many mutations on N-linked glycosylation sites would increase the stability of the S glycoprotein. Our results can be of therapeutic importance in the design of antivirals or vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAuthor SummarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) is an RNA virus that undergoes frequent mutations, which may result in more virulent SARS-CoV-1 variants. To prevent another pandemic in the future, scientists must understand the mechanisms of viral mutations and predict if any variants could become a dominant. The infection of SARS-CoV-1 in cells is largely depending on the interactions of the viral Spike (S) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We applied a computational method to predict S missense mutations that will make SARS-CoV-1 more virulent. We are interested in the variants that can change SARS-CoV-1 spike protein stability and/or change the virus-receptor interactions. We mutated each residue of SARS-CoV-1 spike to all possible amino acids; we calculated the differences between the folding energy and binding energy of each variant and the wildtype and identified the target S mutations with significant effects on protein stability and protein-protein interaction. We found some viral mutations could destabilize S and weaken S-hACE2 binding of SARS-CoV-1 isolate. Our results show that the computational saturation mutagenesis is a reliable approach in the analysis and prediction of missense mutations.",

    "abstract": "To successfully perform goal-directed navigation, animals must know where they are and what they are doing--e.g., looking for water, bringing food back to the nest, or escaping from a predator. Hippocampal neurons code for these critical variables conjunctively, but little is known about how this where/what code is formed or flexibly routed to other brain regions. To address these questions, we performed intracellular whole-cell recordings in mouse CA1 during a cued, two-choice virtual navigation task. We demonstrate that plateau potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons rapidly strengthen synaptic inputs carrying conjunctive information about position and choice. Plasticity-induced response fields were modulated by cues only in animals previously trained to collect rewards based on these cues. Thus, we reveal that gradual learning is required for the formation of a conjunctive population code, upstream of CA1, while plateau-potential-induced synaptic plasticity in CA1 enables flexible routing of the code to downstream brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic manipulation of genetically-specified neuron populations has become a key tool in circuit neuroscience. The medial amygdala (MeA) receives pheromone information about conspecifics and has crucial functions in social behaviors; interestingly, this amygdalar structure contains a majority of GABAergic projection neurons. A previous study showed that optogenetic activation of MeA GABA neurons with channelrhodopsin-2H134R (ChR2) strongly enhanced inter-male aggression (Hong et al. 2014, Cell). When we attempted to reproduce these findings, accidentally using a faster channelrhodopsin variant (channelrhodopsin-2H134R,E123T or ChETA), we found the opposite results. We therefore systematically compared the behavioral outcome of optogenetic stimulation of MeApd GABA neurons with ChETA versus ChR2, employing two widely used AAV serotypes. This revealed that optogenetic stimulation with ChETA suppressed aggression, whereas optogenetic stimulation with ChR2 increased aggression. Recordings of membrane potential changes following optogenetic stimulation with ChETA versus ChR2 revealed larger plateau depolarizations, smaller action potential amplitudes, and larger local inhibition of neighboring inhibitory neurons with ChR2 as compared to ChETA. Our study shows that channelrhodopsin variants have to be chosen with care for in-vivo optogenetic experiments. Furthermore, the role of MeApd GABA neurons in aggression control should be re- evaluated.",

    "abstract": "At chemical synapses, synaptic vesicles release their acidic contents into the cleft leading to the expectation that the cleft should acidify. However, fluorescent pH probes targeted to the cleft of conventional glutamatergic synapses in both fruit flies and mice reveal cleft alkalinization, rather than acidification. Here, using a reaction-diffusion scheme, we modeled pH dynamics at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as glutamate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and protons (H+) are released into the cleft. The model incorporates bicarbonate and phosphate buffering systems as well as plasma membrane calcium-ATPase (PMCA) activity and predicts substantial cleft acidification but only for fractions of a millisecond following neurotransmitter release. Thereafter, the cleft rapidly alkalinizes and remains alkaline for over 100 milliseconds, as the PMCA removes H+ from the cleft in exchange for calcium ions (Ca2+) from adjacent pre- and post-synaptic compartments; thus recapitulating the empirical data. The extent of synaptic vesicle loading and time course of exocytosis has little influence on the magnitude of acidification. Phosphate, but not bicarbonate buffering is effective at ameliorating the magnitude and time course of the acid spike, while both buffering systems are effective at ameliorating cleft alkalinization. The small volume of the cleft levies a powerful influence on the magnitude of alkalinization and its time course. Structural features that open the cleft to adjacent spaces appear to be essential for alleviating the extent of pH disturbances accompanying neurotransmission.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAcid-base imbalances have surprisingly potent neurological effects highlighting the acute pH sensitivity of many neural mechanisms. Acid-Sensing Ion-Channels (ASICs), which open in response to acid shifts in extracellular pH, are an example of such a mechanism. However, while ASICs open during neurotransmission at conventional glutamatergic synapses, pH-sensitive electrodes and fluorophores show no signs of acidification at these synapses, only alkalinization. To resolve this paradox, we built a computational model which allows a glimpse beyond the experimental limitations of pH-sensitive electrodes and fluorophores. Our model reveals a highly dynamic pH landscape within the synaptic cleft, harboring deep but exceedingly rapid acid transients that give way to a prolonged period of alkalinization, thus reconciling ASIC activation with direct measurements of extracellular pH.",

While certain neurons in mammalian brain release multiple transmitters, the prevalence, physiology of such pluralism and if the release occurs from same or distinct vesicle pools is not clear. Using quantitative single vesicle imaging, we show that a small population of neuronal SVs indeed contain different VTs to accomplish corelease. Surprisingly, this population is highly diverse (27 types), expressing distinct dual transporters suggesting corelease of various combinations of neurotransmitters. Using glutamatergic vesicles as an example, we demonstrate that transporter colocalization not only determine the transmitter type but also influences the SV content and synaptic quantal size. Thus, presence of diverse transporters on the same vesicle is bona-fide and, depending on the VT types, this may act as one mechanism to regulate neurotransmitter type, content and release in space and time.",

    "abstract": "Successful navigation requires the ability to compute ones location and heading from incoming multisensory information. Previous work has shown that this multisensory input comes in two forms: body-based idiothetic cues, from ones own rotations and translations, and visual allothetic cues, from the environment (usually visual landmarks). However, exactly how these two streams of information are integrated is unclear, with some models suggesting the body-based idiothetic and visual allothetic cues are combined, while others suggest they compete. In this paper we investigated the integration of body-based idiothetic and visual allothetic cues in the computation of heading using virtual reality. In our experiment, participants performed a series of body turns of up to 360 degrees in the dark with only a brief flash (300ms) of visual feedback en route. Because the environment was virtual, we had full control over the visual feedback and were able to vary the offset between this feedback and the true heading angle. By measuring the effect of the feedback offset on the angle participants turned, we were able to determine the extent to which they incorporated visual feedback as a function of the offset error. By further modeling this behavior we were able to quantify the computations people used. While there were considerable individual differences in performance on our task, with some participants mostly ignoring the visual feedback and others relying on it almost entirely, our modeling results suggest that almost all participants used the same strategy in which idiothetic and allothetic cues are combined when the mismatch between them is small, but compete when the mismatch is large. These findings suggest that participants update their estimate of heading using a hybrid strategy that mixes the combination and competition of cues.\n\nAuthor summarySuccessful navigation requires us to combine visual information about our environment with body-based cues about our own rotations and translations. In this work we investigated how these disparate sources of information work together to compute an estimate of heading. Using a novel virtual reality task we measured how humans integrate visual and body-based cues when there is mismatch between them -- that is, when the estimate of heading from visual information is different from body-based cues. By building computational models of different strategies, we reveal that humans use a hybrid strategy for integrating visual and body-based cues -- combining them when the mismatch between them is small and picking one or the other when the mismatch is large.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWolbachia is an endosymbiont bacterium generally found in about 40% of insects, including mosquitoes, but it is absent in Aedes aegypti which is an important vector of several arboviral diseases. The evidence that Wolbachia trans-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes lost their vectorial competence and became less capable of transmitting arboviruses to human hosts highlights the potential of using Wolbachia- based approaches for prevention and control of arboviral diseases. Recently, release of Wolbachia trans-infected Ae. aegypti has been deployed widely in many countries for the control of mosquito-borne viral diseases. Field surveillance and monitoring of Wolbachia presence in released mosquitoes is important for the success of these control programs. So far, a number of studies have reported the development of loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays to detect Wolbachia in mosquitoes, but the methods still have some specificity issues.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe describe here the development of a LAMP combined with the DNA strand displacement-based electrochemical sensor (BIOSENSOR) method to detect wAlbB Wolbachia in trans-infected Ae. aegypti. Our developed LAMP primers were more specific to wAlbB detection than those of the previous published ones if the assays were conducted with low-cost and non-specific detecting dyes. The detection capacity of our LAMP technique was 3.8 nM and the detection limit reduced to 2.16 fM when combined with the BIOSENSOR. Our study demonstrates that the BIOSENSOR can also be applied as a stand-alone method for detecting Wolbachia; and it showed high sensitivity when used with the crude DNA extracts of macerated mosquito samples without DNA purification.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results suggest that both LAMP and BIOSENSOR, either used in combination or stand-alone, are robust and sensitive. The methods have good potential for routine detection of Wolbachia in mosquitoes during field surveillance and monitoring of Wolbachia-based release programs, especially in countries with limited resources.\n\nAuthor SummaryMosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever are transmitted to humans mainly by the bites of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Controlling these diseases relies mostly on the use of insecticides, in which the efficiency has been reduced through development of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Wolbachia is the endosymbiotic bacteria that are naturally found in 40% of insects, including mosquitoes. The bacteria could protect their hosts from viral infections and could also cause sterility in host populations, therefore, providing an opportunity to use them for disease control. Application of a Wolbachia-based strategy needs simple, rapid and sensitive methods for detecting the bacteria in released mosquitoes. In this paper, we develop the combined methods of LAMP and BIOSENSORS for detecting wAlbB Wolbachia in mosquitoes. Our positive LAMP reaction can be visualized by color change from violet to blue at a sensitivity of [&ge;] 60 pg of genomic DNA. When used in combination with the BIOSENSOR method, the sensitivity increased a million fold without losing specificity. Our study indicates that both developed methods, either used in combination or stand-alone, are efficient and cost-effective, hence, it could be applied for routine surveys of Wolbachia in mosquito control programs that use Wolbachia-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "The pronephros is the first renal structure in the embryo, arising after mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) of the intermediate mesoderm, where Pax2 induces epithelialisation of the mesenchyme. Here we show that, in the early embryo, Snail1 directly represses Pax2 transcription maintaining the intermediate mesoderm in an undifferentiated state. Reciprocally, Pax2 directly represses Snail1 expression to induce MET upon receiving differentiation signals. We also show that BMP7 acts as one such signal by downregulating Snail1 and upregulating Pax2 expression. This, together with the Snail1/Pax2 reciprocal repression, establishes a regulatory loop in a defined region along the anteroposterior axis, the bistability domain within the transition zone, where differentiation of the neural tube and the somites are known to occur. Thus, we show that the antagonism between Snail1 and Pax2 determines the epithelial/mesenchymal state during the differentiation of the intermediate mesoderm and propose that the bistability zone extends to the intermediate mesoderm, synchronizing the differentiation of tissues aligned along the mediolateral embryonic axis.\n\nSummaryThe antagonism between Snail and Pax2 factors in the embryonic differentiation zone, tightly regulates the timing of mesodermal epithelialisation",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHigh-throughput experimentation has revolutionized data-driven experimental sciences and opened the door to the application of machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the quality of any data analysis strongly depends on the quality of the data and specifically the degree to which random effects in the experimental data-generating process are quantified and accounted for. Accordingly calibration, i.e. the quantitative association between observed quantities with measurement responses, is a core element of many workflows in experimental sciences. Particularly in life sciences, univariate calibration, often involving non-linear saturation effects, must be performed to extract quantitative information from measured data. At the same time, the estimation of uncertainty is inseparably connected to quantitative experimentation. Adequate calibration models that describe not only the input/output relationship in a measurement system, but also its inherent measurement noise are required. Due to its mathematical nature, statistically robust calibration modeling remains a challenge for many practitioners, at the same time being extremely beneficial for machine learning applications. In this work, we present a bottom-up conceptual and computational approach that solves many problems of understanding and implementing non-linear, empirical calibration modeling for quantification of analytes and process modeling. The methodology is first applied to the optical measurement of biomass concentrations in a high-throughput cultivation system, then to the quantification of glucose by an automated enzymatic assay. We implemented the conceptual framework in two Python packages, with which we demonstrate how it makes uncertainty quantification for various calibration tasks more accessible. Our software packages enable more reproducible and automatable data analysis routines compared to commonly observed workflows in life sciences. Subsequently, we combine the previously established calibration models with a hierarchical Monod-like differential equation model of microbial growth to describe multiple replicates of Corynebacterium glutamicum batch microbioreactor cultures. Key process model parameters are learned by both maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference, highlighting the flexibility of the statistical and computational framework.",

    "abstract": "Withdrawal noticeThe authors have withdrawn their manuscript. The lipidomic data presented in the manuscript were based on an excel summary sheet provided by VIT, whose group (AP and KM) conducted the analysis using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. However, after submitting to BioRxiv, the VIT group could not recover the RAW (primary source) files from the lipidomic platform because these files were deleted due to the maintenance protocol used for the Orbitrap mass spectrometer. It was agreed to reconduct the lipidomic analysis. As the Orbitrap mass spectrometer was out of service at that time, the lipidomic analysis was conducted with the help of a QToF mass spectrometer. Important differences were noted for the relative abundance and species of many lipids across the strains compared to the previously reported data hence casting some doubt on their interpretation. Therefore, until further analysis can be carried out the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project. If you have any questions, please contact the corresponding author.",

    "abstract": "The migration of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is key for the development of the complex and vast lymphatic vascular network that pervades most of the tissues in an organism. In zebrafish, arterial intersegmental vessels together with chemokines have been shown to promote lymphatic cell migration from the horizontal myoseptum (HM). Here we found that LECs departure from HM coincides with the emergence of mural cells around the intersegmental arteries, raising the possibility that arterial mural cells promote LEC migration. Our live imaging and cell ablation experiments revealed that LECs migrate slower and fail to establish the lymphatic vascular network in the absence of arterial mural cells. We determined that mural cells are a source for the C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12a and Cxcl12b) and vascular endothelial growth factor C (Vegfc). We showed that ERK, a downstream component of Vegfc-Vegfr3 singling cascade, is activated in migrating LECs and that both chemokine and growth factor signalling is required for the robust migration. Furthermore, Vegfc-Vegfr3 has a pro-survival role in LECs during the migration. Together, the identification of mural cells a source for signals that guide LEC migration and survival will be important in the future design for rebuilding lymphatic vessels in the disease contexts.",

    "abstract": "Variation in lung alveolar development is strongly linked to disease susceptibility. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying alveolar development are difficult to study in humans. Using primary human fetal lungs we have characterized a tip progenitor cell population with alveolar fate potential. These data allowed us to benchmark a self-organising organoid system which captures key aspects of lung lineage commitment and can be efficiently differentiated to alveolar type 2 cell fate. Our data show that Wnt and FGF signalling, and the downstream transcription factors NKX2.1 and TFAP2C, promote human alveolar or airway fate respectively. Moreover, we have functionally validated cell-cell interactions in human lung alveolar patterning. We show that Wnt signalling from differentiating fibroblasts promotes alveolar type 2 cell identity, whereas myofibroblasts secrete the Wnt inhibitor, NOTUM, providing spatial patterning. Our organoid system recapitulates key aspects of human lung development allowing mechanistic experiments to determine the underpinning molecular regulation.",
