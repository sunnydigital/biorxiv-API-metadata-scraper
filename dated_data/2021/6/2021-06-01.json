    "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons modulate neural circuits and behaviors via dopamine release from expansive, long range axonal projections. The elaborate cytoarchitecture of these neurons is embedded within complex brain tissue, making it difficult to access the neuronal proteome using conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate APEX2 proximity labeling within genetically targeted neurons in the mouse brain, enabling subcellular proteomics with cell type-specificity. By combining APEX2 biotinylation with mass spectrometry, we mapped the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Our dataset reveals the proteomic architecture underlying proteostasis, axonal metabolism, and neurotransmission in these neurons. We find a significant enrichment of proteins encoded by Parkinsons disease-linked genes in striatal dopaminergic axons, including proteins with previously undescribed axonal localization. These proteomic datasets provide a resource for neuronal cell biology, and this approach can be readily adapted for study of other neural cell types.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica is common foodborne pathogen that generates both enteric and systemic infections in hosts. Antibiotic resistance is common is certain serovars of the pathogen and of great concern to public health. Recent reports have documented the co-occurrence of metal resistance with antibiotic resistance in one serovar of S. enterica. Therefore, we sought to identify possible co-occurrence in a large genomic dataset. Genome assemblies of 56,348 strains of S. enterica comprising 20 major serovars were downloaded from NCBI. The downloaded assemblies were quality controlled and in silico serotyped to ensure consistency and avoid improper annotation from public databases. Metal and antibiotic resistance genes were identified in the genomes as well as plasmid replicons. Co-current genes were identified by constructing a co-occurrence matrix and group the genes using k-means clustering. Three groups of co-occurrent genes were identified using k-means clustering. Group 1 was comprised of the pco and sil operons that confer resistance to copper and silver respectively. Group 1 was distributed across four serovars. Group 2 contained the majority of the genes and little to no co-occurrence was observed. Metal and antibiotic co-occurrence was identified in group 3 that contained genes conferring resistance to: arsenic, mercury, beta-lactams, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines. Group 3 genes were also associated with an IncQ1 class plasmid replicon. Metal and antibiotic cooccurrence was isolated to one clade of S. enterica I 4,[5],12:i:.",

    "abstract": "Although virtually all gene networks are predicted to be controlled by miRNAs, the contribution of this important layer of gene regulation to tissue homeostasis in adult animals remains unclear. Gain and loss of function experiments have provided key insights into the specific function of individual miRNAs, but effective genetic tools to study the functional consequences of global inhibition of miRNA activity in vivo are lacking. Here we report the generation and characterization of a genetically engineered mouse strain in which miRNA-mediated gene repression can be reversibly inhibited without affecting miRNA biogenesis or abundance. We demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy by investigating the consequences of acute inhibition of miRNA function in adult animals. We find that different tissues and organs respond differently to global loss of miRNA function. While miRNA-mediated gene repression is essential for the homeostasis of the heart and the skeletal muscle, it is largely dispensable in the majority of other organs. Even in tissues where it is not required for homeostasis, such as the intestine and hematopoietic system, miRNA activity can become essential during regeneration following acute injury. These data support a model where many metazoan tissues primarily rely on miRNA function to respond to potentially pathogenic events.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen adaptation to public health interventions, such as vaccination, may take tortuous routes and involve multiple mutations at distinct locations in the pathogen genome, acting on distinct phenotypic traits. Despite its importance for public health, how these multilocus adaptations jointly evolve is poorly understood. Here we consider the joint evolution of two adaptations: the pathogens ability to escape the vaccine-induced immune response and adjustments to the pathogens virulence and transmissi-bility. We elucidate the role played by epistasis and recombination, with an emphasis on the different protective effects of vaccination. We show that vaccines reducing transmission and/or increasing clearance generate positive epistasis between the vaccine-escape and virulence alleles, favouring strains that carry both mutations, whereas vaccines reducing virulence mortality generate negative epistasis, favouring strains that carry either mutation, but not both. High rates of recombination can affect these predictions. If epistasis is positive, frequent recombination can lead to the sequential fixation of the two mutations and prevent the transient build-up of more virulent escape strains. If epistasis is negative, frequent recombination between loci can create an evolutionary bistability, such that whichever adaptation is more accessible tends to be favoured in the long-term. Our work provides a timely alternative to the variant-centered perspective on pathogen adaptation and captures the effect of different types of vaccines on the interference between multiple adaptive mutations.",

    "abstract": "Organismal growth and development rely on RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) synthesizing the appropriate repertoire of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from protein-coding genes. Productive elongation of full-length transcripts is essential for mRNA function, however what determines whether an engaged RNAPII molecule will terminate prematurely or transcribe processively remains poorly understood. Notably, despite a common process for transcription initiation across RNAPII-synthesized RNAs1, RNAPII is highly susceptible to termination when transcribing non-coding RNAs such as upstream antisense RNAs (uaRNAs) and enhancers RNAs (eRNAs)2, suggesting that differences arise during RNAPII elongation. To investigate the impact of transcribed sequence on elongation potential, we developed a method to screen the effects of thousands of INtegrated Sequences on Expression of RNA and Translation using high-throughput sequencing (INSERT-seq). We found that higher AT content in uaRNAs and eRNAs, rather than specific sequence motifs, underlies the propensity for RNAPII termination on these transcripts. Further, we demonstrate that 5 splice sites exert both splicing-dependent and autonomous, splicing-independent stimulation of transcription, even in the absence of polyadenylation signals. Together, our results reveal a potent role for transcribed sequence in dictating gene output at mRNA and non-coding RNA loci, and demonstrate the power of INSERT-seq towards illuminating these contributions.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates transcription through binding to specific DNA motifs, particularly at enhancers. While the motif to which it binds is constant across cell types, GR has cell type-specific binding at genomic loci, resulting in regulation of different genes. The presence of other bound transcription factors (TFs) is hypothesized to strongly influence where GR binds. Here, we addressed the roles of other TFs in the glucocorticoid response by comparing changes in GR binding and nascent transcription at promoters and distal candidate cis-regulatory elements (CCREs) in two distinct human cancer cell types. We found that after glucocorticoid treatment, GR binds to thousands of genomic loci that are primarily outside of promoter regions and are potentially enhancers. The majority of these GR binding sites are cell-type specific, and they are associated with pioneer factor binding. A small fraction of GR occupied regions (GORs) displayed increased bidirectional nascent transcription, which is a characteristic of many active enhancers, after glucocorticoid treatment. Non-promoter GORs with increased transcription were specifically enriched for AP-1 binding prior to glucocorticoid treatment. These results support a model of transcriptional regulation in which multiple classes of TFs are required. The pioneer factors increase chromatin accessibility, facilitating the binding of GR and additional factors. AP-1 binding poises a fraction of accessible sites to be rapidly transcribed upon glucocorticoid-induced GR binding. The coordinated activity of multiple TFs then results in cell type-specific changes in gene expression. We anticipate that many models of inducible gene expression also require multiple distinct TFs that act at multiple steps of transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-Fucose is the most widely distributed O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-hexose in marine and terrestrial environments, and presents a variety of functional roles. O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-Fucose is the major monosaccharide in the polysaccharide fucoidan from cell walls of brown algae, and is found in human milk oligosaccharides and the Lewis blood group system, where it is important in cell signaling and immune response stimulation. Removal of fucose from these biomolecules is catalyzed by fucosidases belonging to different carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) families. Fucosidases of glycoside hydrolase family 29 (GH29) release -O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-fucose from non-reducing ends of glycans and display activities targeting different substrate compositions and linkage types. While several GH29 fucosidases from terrestrial environments have been characterized, much less is known about marine members of GH29 and their substrate specificities, as only four marine GH29 enzymes were previously characterized. Here, five GH29 fucosidases originating from an uncultured fucoidan-degrading marine bacterium (Paraglaciecola sp.) were cloned and produced recombinantly in E. coli. All five enzymes (Fp231, Fp239, Fp240, Fp251, Fp284) hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate CNP--O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-fucose. By screening each of these enzymes against up to 17 fucose-containing oligosaccharides Fp231 and Fp284 showed strict substrate specificities against the fucosyl-N-acetylglucosamine regioisomers Fuc(1,4)GlcNAc and Fuc(1,6)GlcNAc, respectively, the former representing a new specificity. Fp231 is a monomeric enzyme with pH and temperature optima at pH 5.6-6.0 and 25{degrees}C, hydrolyzing Fuc(1,4)GlcNAc with kcat = 1.3 s-1 and Km = 660 M. Altogether, the findings extend our knowledge about GH29 family members from the marine environment, which are so far largely unexplored.",

    "abstract": "Shade-intolerant plants rapidly elongate their stems, branches, and leaf stalks to compete with their neighboring vegetation to maximize sunlight capture for photosynthesis. This rapid growth adaptation, known as the shade avoidance response (SAR), comes at a cost; reduced biomass, crop yield, and root growth. Significant progress has been made on the mechanistic understanding of hypocotyl elongation during SAR; however, the molecular account of how root growth is repressed is not well understood. Here, we explore the mechanisms by which low red:far-red induced SAR restrict the primary and lateral root (LR) growth. By analyzing whole-genome transcriptome, we identified a core set of shade-induced genes in the roots of Arabidopsis and tomato seedlings grown in the shade. Abiotic and biotic stressors also induce many of these shade-induced genes and are predominantly regulated by the WRKY transcription factors. Correspondingly, a majority of the WRKYs were also among the shade-induced genes. Functional analysis using transgenics of these shade-induced WRKYs revealed their role is essentially to restrict primary root and LR growth in the shade, and captivatingly, they did not affect hypocotyl elongation. Similarly, we also show that ethylene hormone signaling is necessary to limit root growth in the shade. Our study proposes that during SAR, shade-induced WRKY26, 45, and 75, and ethylene reprogram gene expression in the root to restrict its growth and development. The reduced growth of root organs helps the plant divert its critical resources to the elongating organs in the shoot to ensure competitiveness under limiting photosynthetic radiation.\n\nOne sentence summaryShade represses root growth by inducing WRKY transcription factors.",

In some years, the second dose will be the same vaccine formulation, in others years it with be re-formulated to include HA proteins derived from antigenically drifted or shifted circulating influenza strains. In addition, natural exposure to influenza can create permanent changes to the memory B cell repertoire and specificities. The effect that the specificity of pre-existing humoral immunity has on antibody levels and specificity after repeat vaccination is an ongoing research area.\n\nMethodsWe used a computational framework (ssMod.v1) to simulate scenarios that occurred during the 2009 influenza pandemic: children receiving a second dose who have previously exposed to the 2009 influenza HA antigen, children previously exposed to an HA antigen antigenically similar to the 2009 influenza HA antigen, and children previously exposed to an antigenically dissimilar strain. To assess the contribution of pre-existing immunity, two experimental permutations in the sMod.v1 were made: elimination of antibody-mediated antibody clearance of vaccine (HA) antigen by pre-existing antibodies and elimination of the ability of memory B cells to form germinal centers. In the simulation, 30 days after repeat vaccination antibody specificities were examined against 12 antigenically historical vaccine/HA variant influenza strains for each of the five canonical antigenic-sites and the subdominant, conserved, stalk antigenic-site.\n\nResultsWe found that elimination of antibody-mediated antigen clearance significantly increased antibody levels while elimination of the ability of memory B cells to form germinal center reactions significantly decreased the total antibody levels, but this was dependent on the antigenic relationship between the original vaccine and repeat vaccine and the particular antigenic-site. Moreover, highly-cross-reactive antibody was highest when the antigenic distance between original vaccine HA antigen and repeat vaccine HA antigen was larger and antibody-mediated antigen clearance was eliminated.",

Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of three llama-derived single-domain antibodies that bind the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein with high affinity. Each antibody recognizes a specific folded domain of the protein, with two antibodies recognizing the N-terminal RNA binding domain and one recognizing the C-terminal dimerization domain. The two antibodies that recognize the RNA binding domain affect both RNA binding affinity and RNA-mediated phase separation of the Nucleocapsid protein.

    "abstract": "Repurposing FDA-approved inhibitors able to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could provide a rapid path to establish new therapeutic options to mitigate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Proteolytic cleavages of the spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2, mediated by the host cell proteases cathepsin and TMPRSS2, alone or in combination, are key early activation steps required for efficient infection. The PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod interferes with late endosomal viral traffic, and through an ill-defined mechanism prevents in vitro infection through late endosomes mediated by cathepsin. Similarly, inhibition of TMPRSS2 protease activity by camostat mesylate or nafamostat mesylate prevents infection mediated by the TMPRSS2-dependent and cathepsin-independent pathway. Here, we combined the use of apilimod with camostat mesylate or nafamostat mesylate and found an unexpected ~5-10-fold increase in their effectiveness to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in different cell types. Comparable synergism was observed using both, a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing S of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 virus. The substantial ~5-fold or more decrease of half maximal effective concentrations (EC50 values) suggests a plausible treatment strategy based on the combined use of these inhibitors.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) global pandemic. There are ongoing efforts to uncover effective antiviral agents that could mitigate the severity of the disease by controlling the ensuing viral replication. Promising candidates include small molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activities of host proteins, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. They include Apilimod, an inhibitor of PIKfyve kinase and camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, inhibitors of TMPRSS2 protease. Our research is significant for having uncovered an unexpected synergism in the effective inhibitory activity of apilimod used together with camostat mesylate or with nafamostat mesylate.",

Here we visualized infection using time-lapse microscopy of a human lung cell line and used live virus neutralization to determine the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell spread to neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly led to cell fusion, forming multinucleated cells with clustered nuclei which started to be detected at 6h post-infection. To compare sensitivity of cell-to-cell spread to neutralization, we infected either with cell-free virus or with single infected cells expressing on their surface the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We tested two variants of SARS-CoV-2: B.1.117 containing only the D614G substitution, and the escape variant B.1.351. We used the much smaller area of single infected cells relative to infection foci to exclude any input infected cells which did not lead to transmission. The monoclonal antibody and convalescent plasma we tested neutralized cell-free SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of B.1.351 virus, which was poorly neutralized with plasma from non-B.1.351 infections. In contrast, cell-to-cell spread of SARS-CoV-2 showed no sensitivity to monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma neutralization. These observations suggest that, once cells are infected, SARS-CoV-2 may be more difficult to neutralize in cell types and anatomical compartments permissive for cell-to-cell spread.",

    "abstract": "The metabolism of tryptophan to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) through the kynurenine pathway is increasingly linked to aging and age-associated disease. Kynurenine pathway enzymes and metabolites influence a range of molecular processes critical to healthy aging, including regulation of inflammatory and immune responses, cellular redox homeostasis, and energy production. Aberrant kynurenine metabolism is observed during normal aging and has been implicated in a range of age-associated pathologies, including chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer. In previous work, we and others identified three genes--kynu-1, tdo-2, and acsd-1--encoding kynurenine pathway enzymes for which decreasing expression extends lifespan in invertebrate models. Here we report that knockdown of haao-1, a fourth kynurenine pathway gene encoding the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO), extends lifespan by ~30% and delays age-associated decline in health in Caenorhabditis elegans. This lifespan extension is mediated by increased physiological levels of the HAAO substrate 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA). 3HAA increases resistance to oxidative stress during aging by directly degrading hydrogen peroxide and activating the Nrf2/SKN-1 oxidative stress response. Aging mice fed a diet supplemented with 3HAA are similarly long-lived. Our results identify HAAO and 3HAA as novel therapeutic targets for age-associated disease. This works provides a foundation for more detailed examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying the benefits of 3HAA, and how these mechanisms interact with other interventions both within and beyond the kynurenine pathway. We anticipate that these findings will bolster growing interest in developing pharmacological strategies to target tryptophan metabolism to improve health aging.",

This disease has spread globally, causing more than 161.5 million cases and 3.3 million deaths to date. Surveillance and monitoring of new mutations in the virus genome are crucial to our understanding of the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, how the temporal dynamics of these mutations is influenced by control measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is poorly understood. Using 1 058 020 SARS-CoV-2 from sequenced COVID-19 cases from 98 countries (totaling 714 country-month combinations), we perform a normalization by COVID-19 cases to calculate the relative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and explore their dynamics over time. We found 115 mutations estimated to be present in more than 3 % of global COVID-19 cases and determined three types of mutation dynamics: High-Frequency, Medium-Frequency, and Low-Frequency. Classification of mutations based on temporal dynamics enable us to examine viral adaptation and evaluate the effects of implemented control measures in virus evolution during the pandemic. We showed that Medium-Frequency mutations are characterized by high prevalence in specific regions and/or in constant competition with other mutations in several regions. Finally, taking N501Y mutation as representative of High-Frequency mutations, we showed that level of control measure stringency negatively correlates with the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 with High-Frequency or not-High-Frequency and both follows similar trends in different levels of stringency.",

Beyond a preference for cleaving RNA 3 of uridines, it is unknown if Nsp15 has any additional substrate preferences. Here we used cryo-EM to capture structures of Nsp15 bound to RNA in pre- and post-cleavage states. The structures along with molecular dynamics and biochemical assays revealed critical residues involved in substrate specificity, nuclease activity, and oligomerization. Moreover, we determined how the sequence of the RNA substrate dictates cleavage and found that outside of polyU tracts, Nsp15 has a strong preference for purines 3 of the cleaved uridine.

    "abstract": "The RBR E3 ligase parkin is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) during oxidative stress where it becomes activated and ubiquitinates numerous proteins. Parkin activation involves binding of a phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb), followed by phosphorylation of parkin itself, both mediated by the OMM kinase, PINK1. However, targeted mitochondrial proteins have little structural or sequence similarity, with the commonality between substrates being proximity to the OMM. Here, we demonstrate that parkin efficiently ubiquitinates a mitochondrial acceptor pre-ligated to pUb and phosphorylation of parkin triggers autoubiquitination activity. Mitochondrial target proteins, Miro1 or CISD1, tethered to pUb are ubiquitinated by parkin more efficiently than if alone or Ub-tethered and ubiquitin molecules are ligated to acceptor protein lysines and not pUb. Parkin phosphorylation is not required for acceptor-pUb ubiquitination. In fact, only phospho-parkin induced self-ubiquitination and deletion of Ubl or mutation at K211N inhibited self-ubiquitination. We propose divergent parkin mechanisms whereby parkin-mediated ubiquitination of acceptor proteins is driven by binding to pre-existing pUb and subsequent parkin phosphorylation triggers autoubiquitination. This finding is critical for understanding parkins role in mitochondrial homeostasis and has implications on targets for therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Heme is an essential cofactor required for a plethora of cellular processes in eukaryotes. In metazoans the heme biosynthetic pathway is typically partitioned between the cytosol and mitochondria, with the first and final steps taking place in the mitochondrion. The pathway has been extensively studied, and all the biosynthetic enzymes have been structurally characterized to varying extents. Nevertheless, our understanding of the regulation of heme synthesis and factors that influence this process in metazoans remains incomplete. Herein we investigate the molecular organization as well as the catalytic and structural features of the terminal pathway enzyme, ferrochelatase (Hem15), in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Biochemical and genetic analyses reveal dynamic association of Hem15 with Mic60, a core component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS). Loss of MICOS negatively impacts Hem15 activity and results in accumulation of highly reactive and potentially toxic tetrapyrrole precursors that may result in oxidative damage. Restoring intermembrane connectivity in MICOS-deficient cells mitigates these cytotoxic effects. Our data provide new insights into how heme biosynthetic machinery is organized and regulated, linking mitochondrial architecture-organizing factors to heme homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Transport Protein Particle complexes (TRAPP) are evolutionarily conserved regulators of membrane trafficking, with this mediated by their guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards Rab GTPases. In metazoans evidence suggests that two different TRAPP complexes exist, TRAPPII and TRAPPIII. These two complexes share a common core of subunits, with complex specific subunits (TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC10 in TRAPPII and TRAPPC8, TRAPPC11, TRAPPC12, TRAPPC13 in TRAPPIII). TRAPPII and TRAPPIII have distinct specificity for GEF activity towards Rabs, with TRAPPIII acting on Rab1, and TRAPPII acting on Rab1 and Rab11. The molecular basis for how these complex specific subunits alter GEF activity towards Rab GTPases is unknown. Here we have used a combination of biochemical assays, hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and electron microscopy to examine the regulation of TRAPPII and TRAPPIIII complexes in solution and on membranes. GEF assays revealed that the TRAPPIII has GEF activity against Rab1 and Rab43, with no detectable activity against the other 18 Rabs tested. The TRAPPIII complex had significant differences in protein dynamics at the Rab binding site compared to TRAPPII, potentially indicating an important role of accessory subunits in altering the active site of TRAPP complexes. Both the TRAPPII and TRAPPIII complexes had enhanced GEF activity on lipid membranes, with HDX-MS revealing numerous conformational changes that accompany membrane association. HDX-MS also identified a membrane binding site in TRAPPC8. Collectively, our results provide insight into the functions of TRAPP complexes and how they can achieve Rab specificity.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-based therapeutics are the fastest growing drug class on the market, used to treat aggressive forms of cancer, chronic autoimmune conditions, and numerous other disease states. While the specificity, affinity, and versatility of therapeutic antibodies can provide an advantage over traditional small molecule drugs, their development and optimization can be much more challenging and time-consuming. This is, in part, because the ideal formulation buffer systems used for in vitro characterization inadequately reflect the crowded biological environments (serum, endosomal lumen, etc.) that these drugs experience once administered to a patient. Such environments can perturb the binding of antibodies to their antigens and receptors, as well as homo- and hetero-aggregation, in ways that are incompletely understood, thereby altering therapeutic effect and disposition. While excluded volume effects are classically thought to favor binding, weak interactions with co-solutes in crowded conditions can inhibit binding. The second virial coefficient (B2) parameter quantifies such weak interactions and can be determined by a variety of techniques in dilute solution, but analogous methods in complex biological fluids are not well established. Here, we demonstrate that fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is able to measure diffusive B2 values directly in undiluted serum. Apparent second virial coefficient (B2,app) measurements of antibodies in serum reveal that changes in the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions can dramatically impact global nonideality. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the common approach of isolating specific components and completing independent cross-term virial coefficient measurements is an incomplete representation of nonideality in serum. The approach presented here could enrich our understanding of the effects of biological environments on proteins in general, and advance the development of therapeutic antibodies and other protein-based therapeutics.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe present FCS as an orthogonal method to traditional methods for characterizing weak, nonspecific homo- and hetero-interactions through determination of self- and cross-term second virial coefficients, respectively. We also characterize weak interactions between therapeutic antibodies and serum components through determination of an apparent second virial coefficient (B2,app) directly in undiluted serum. Our results suggest that global nonideality effects are antibody-dependent, and that attractive and repulsive interactions with co-solutes are occurring simultaneously. This approach could advance our understanding of the impact of nonideality to the biophysical and pharmacological properties of therapeutic antibodies and other engineered proteins in relevant biological environments, and could accelerate the development and optimization of protein-based therapeutics.",

We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically-ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely-expressed housekeeping genes with roles in cell cycle progression, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development.",

Proteomic analysis revealed that when M. abscessus LeuRS mutants were fed the non-proteinogenic amino acid norvaline, leucine residues in proteins were replaced by norvaline, inducing expression of GroEL chaperonins and Clp proteases. In vitro data revealed that supplementation of media with norvaline reduced the emergence of EPT mutants in both M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis. The combination of EPT and norvaline had improved in vivo efficacy compared to EPT in a murine model of M. abscessus infection.",

    "abstract": "Microbial genomes are highly adaptable, with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as integrative conjugative elements (ICE) mediating the dissemination of new genetic information throughout bacterial populations. This is countered by defence mechanism such as CRISPR-Cas systems, which limit invading MGEs by sequence-specific targeting. Here we report the distribution of the pVir, pTet and PCC42 plasmids and a new 70-129 kb ICE (CampyICE1) in the foodborne bacterial pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. CampyICE1 contains a degenerated Type II-C CRISPR system consisting of a sole Cas9 protein, which is distinct from the previously described Cas9 proteins from C. jejuni and C. coli. CampyICE1 is conserved in structure and gene order, containing blocks of genes predicted to be involved in recombination, regulation, and conjugation. CampyICE1 was detected in 134/5,829 (2.3%) C. jejuni genomes and 92/1,347 (6.8%) C. coli genomes. Similar ICE were detected in a number of non-jejuni/coli Campylobacter species, although these lacked a CRISPR-Cas system. CampyICE1 carries 3 separate short CRISPR spacer arrays containing a combination of 108 unique spacers and 16 spacer variant families. A total of 69 spacers and 10 spacer variant families (63.7%) were predicted to target Campylobacter plasmids. The presence of a functional CampyICE1 Cas9 protein and matching anti-plasmid spacers was associated with the absence of the pVir, pTet and pCC42 plasmids (188/214 genomes, 87.9%), implicating that the CampyICE1-encoded CRISPR-Cas has contributed to the exclusion of competing plasmids. In conclusion, the characteristics of the CRISPR-Cas9 system on CampyICE1 suggests a history of plasmid warfare in Campylobacter.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTUnderstanding pathogen evolution is paramount for enhancing food safety and limiting pathogenic disease in humans and animals. Campylobacter species comprise a group of human and animal pathogens with a remarkable success rate, being the most frequent cause of bacterial food-borne disease in high-income countries. A common theme among Campylobacter evolution is genomic plasticity, and a significant proportion of this plasticity is driven by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that results in acquisition of complex traits in one evolutionary event. Understanding the mechanisms of transfer of MGEs and how MGEs such as integrative conjugative elements (ICE) exclude other MGEs is fundamental to understanding Campylobacter evolution. CRISPR-Cas9 proteins play a role in bacterial immune systems, mediating the defence against bacteriophage, plasmids, and integrative elements. The use of CRISPR-Cas by a mobile element to fight off competing elements, possibly to the advantage or detriment to their host, also increases our understanding of how important selfish genomic islands undergo co-evolution with bacterial pathogens, and generates insight into the complex warfare between MGEs.\n\nDATA STATEMENTAll genome sequences used in this study are available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genome database or in the Campylobacter PubMLST website; the assembly accession numbers (NCBI Genome) or genome ID numbers (Campylobacter PubMLST) are listed in Table S1 (available in the online version of this article). Genome assemblies were quality checked based on N50, L50, genome size and number of contigs. CRISPR Spacer sequences and predicted targets, Cas9 alignments, presence of mobile elements and plasmids are all included in the Supplementary Information.",

    "abstract": "Genome copy number variation occurs during each mitotic and meiotic cycle and it is crucial for organisms to maintain their natural ploidy. Defects in ploidy transitions can lead to chromosome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. Ploidy in the haploid human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is exquisitely orchestrated and ranges from haploid to polyploid during sexual development and under various environmental and host conditions. However, the mechanisms controlling these ploidy transitions are largely unknown. During C. deneoformans (formerly C. neoformans var. neoformans, serotype D) unisexual reproduction, ploidy increases prior to the onset of meiosis, can be independent from cell-cell fusion and nuclear fusion, and likely occurs through an endoreplication pathway. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this ploidy transition, we identified twenty cell cycle-regulating genes encoding cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), and CDK regulators. We characterized four cyclin genes and two CDK regulator genes that were differentially expressed during unisexual reproduction and contributed to diploidization. To detect ploidy transition events, we generated a ploidy reporter, called NURAT, which can detect copy number increases via double selection for nourseothricin-resistant, uracil-prototrophic cells. Utilizing this ploidy reporter, we showed that ploidy transition from haploid to diploid can be detected during the early phases of unisexual reproduction. Interestingly, selection for the NURAT reporter revealed several instances of segmental aneuploidy of multiple chromosomes, which conferred azole resistance in some isolates. These findings provide further evidence of ploidy plasticity in fungi with significant biological and public health implications.\n\nAuthor SummaryPloidy is an intrinsic fundamental feature of all eukaryotic organisms, and ploidy variation and maintenance are critical to the organism survival and evolution. Fungi exhibit exquisite plasticity in ploidy variation in adaptation to various environmental stresses. For example, the haploid opportunistic human fungal pathogen C. deneoformans can generate diploid blastospores during unisexual reproduction and also forms polyploid titan cells during host infection, however, the mechanisms underlying these ploidy transitions are largely unknown. In this study, we elucidated the genetic regulatory circuitry governing ploidy duplication during C. deneoformans unisexual reproduction through the identification and characterization of cell cycle regulators that are differentially expressed during unisexual reproduction. We showed that four cyclin and two cyclin-dependent kinase regulator genes function in concert to orchestrate ploidy transition during unisexual reproduction. To trace and track ploidy transition events, we also generated a ploidy reporter and revealed the formation of segmental aneuploidy in addition to diploidization, illustrating the diverse mechanisms of genome plasticity in C. deneoformans.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible coronavirus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic. Herein we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While ACE2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccine sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall, our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission, with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbionts can influence host reproduction and fitness to favor their maternal transmission. For example, endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria often cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that kills uninfected embryos fertilized by Wolbachia-modified sperm. Infected females can rescue CI, providing them a relative fitness advantage. Wolbachia-induced CI strength varies widely and tends to decrease as host males age. Since strong CI drives Wolbachia to high equilibrium frequencies, understanding how fast and why CI strength declines with male age is crucial to explaining age-dependent CIs influence on Wolbachia prevalence. Here, we investigate if Wolbachia densities and/or CI gene (cif) expression covary with CI-strength variation and explore covariates of age-dependent Wolbachia-density variation in two classic CI systems. wRi CI strength decreases slowly with Drosophila simulans male age (6%/ day), but wMel CI strength decreases very rapidly (19%/ day), yielding statistically insignificant CI after only three days of D. melanogaster emergence. Wolbachia densities and cif expression in testes decrease as wRi-infected males age, but both surprisingly increase as wMel-infected males age, and CI strength declines. We then tested if phage lysis, Octomom copy number (which impacts wMel density), or host immune expression covary with age-dependent wMel densities--only host immune expression correlated with density. Together, our results identify how fast CI strength declines with male age in two model systems and reveal unique relationships between male age, Wolbachia densities, cif expression, and host immunity. We discuss new hypotheses about the basis of age-dependent CI strength and its contributions to Wolbachia prevalence.\n\nImportanceWolbachia are the most common animal-associated endosymbionts due in large part to their manipulation of host reproduction. Many Wolbachia cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that kills uninfected host eggs. Infected eggs are protected from CI, favoring Wolbachia spread in natural systems and in transinfected mosquito populations where vector-control groups use strong CI to maintain pathogen-blocking Wolbachia at high frequencies for biocontrol of arboviruses. CI strength varies considerably in nature and declines as males age for unknown reasons. Here, we determine that CI strength weakens at different rates with age in two model symbioses. Wolbachia density and CI gene expression covary with wRi-induced CI strength in Drosophila simulans, but neither explain rapidly declining wMel-induced CI in aging D. melanogaster males. Patterns of host immune gene expression suggest a candidate mechanism behind age-dependent wMel densities. These findings inform how age-dependent CI may contribute to Wolbachia prevalence in natural systems and potentially in transinfected systems.",

The translational GTPase EF-G stands out, as it uses GTP hydrolysis to generate force and promote the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA. The key unresolved question is how GTP hydrolysis drives molecular movement. Here, we visualize the GTPase-powered step of ongoing translocation by time-resolved cryo-EM. EF-G in the active GDP-Pi form stabilizes ribosomal subunit rotation and induces twisting of the sarcin-ricin loop of the 23S rRNA. Refolding of the GTPase switch regions upon Pi release initiates a cascade of rearrangements and a large-scale rotation of EF-G that exerts force on the ribosome and ultimately drives tRNA movement. The findings demonstrate how a GTPase orchestrates spontaneous thermal fluctuations of a large RNA-protein complex into force-generating molecular movement.",

    "abstract": "After invasion of mammalian cells, the parasite Toxoplasma gondii multiplies in a self-made membrane-bound compartment, the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). We previously showed that intravacuolar Toxoplasma interacts with many host cell organelles, especially recycling endosomes, and further manipulates the host endocytic recycling through the sequestration of Rab11 vesicles into the PV. Mammalian Rab-PV interactions are likely mediated by Toxoplasma and host proteins that remain to be identified. In this context, we have examined the specificity of host Rab vesicle interaction with the PV by monitoring the recruitment of subtypes of Rab11 vesicles differing in their composition in Rab11-Family Interacting Proteins (FIPs). We found that vesicles with FIPs from Class I (FIP1C, FIP2, FIP5) or Class II (FIP3, FIP4) are distributed at the PV and detected to varying degrees inside the PV. The PV delivery of vesicles with FIPs from Class I, but not Class II, is Rab11-dependent. In addition to Rab11, FIP3 binds to Arf6, and vesicles associated with FIP3-Arf6 complexes are observed within the PV. Binding of FIP3 to either Rab11 or Arf6 significantly increases the internalization of vesicles into the PV. These data point to a selective process of host recycling endosome recognition and scavenging mediated by Toxoplasma.",

    "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays numerous critical roles in maintaining vision and this is underscored by the prevalence of degenerative blinding diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which visual impairment is caused by progressive loss of RPE cells. In contrast to mammals, zebrafish possess the ability to intrinsically regenerate a functional RPE layer after severe injury. The molecular underpinnings of this regenerative process remain largely unknown yet hold tremendous potential for developing treatment strategies to stimulate endogenous regeneration in the human eye. In this study, we demonstrate that the mTOR pathway is activated in RPE cells post-genetic ablation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of mTOR activity impaired RPE regeneration, while mTOR activation enhanced RPE recovery post-injury, demonstrating that mTOR activity is necessary and sufficient for RPE regeneration in zebrafish. RNA-seq of RPE isolated from mTOR-inhibited larvae identified a number of genes and pathways dependent on mTOR activity at early and late stages of regeneration; amongst these were components of the immune system, which is emerging as a key regulator of regenerative responses across various tissue and model systems. Our results identify crosstalk between macrophages/microglia and the RPE, wherein mTOR activity in the RPE is required for recruitment of macrophages/microglia to the injury site. In turn, these macrophages/microglia reinforce mTOR activity in regenerating RPE cells. Interestingly, the function of macrophages/microglia in maintaining mTOR activity in the RPE appeared to be inflammation-independent. Taken together, these data identify mTOR activity as a key regulator of RPE regeneration and link the mTOR pathway to immune responses in facilitating RPE regeneration.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness world-wide, with incidences predicted to rise substantially over the next few decades. Cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are affected in AMD and there are currently no effective therapies that slow RPE cell death or restore lost RPE cells in advanced-stage AMD. An exciting potential approach to treat many diseases of the eye, including AMD, is to stimulate endogenous regeneration to restore cells lost to disease. For this to become possible, we must first understand the molecular and cellular underpinnings of the regenerative response. In this study, we utilize zebrafish as a model system, which possess tremendous regenerative potential in multiple cell and tissue types, including the RPE. Our results identify the mTOR signaling pathway as a key regulator of RPE regeneration. We identify a link between mTOR signaling and immune responses, which are known to modulate regeneration of a variety of tissues and organs. Together, our results identify one of the first molecular mechanisms facilitating intrinsic RPE regeneration and these data could serve as a foundation for the development of new therapies aimed at stimulating the regeneration of RPE cells in the diseased eye.",

    "abstract": "The uses of bivalve molluscs in environmental biomonitoring have recently gained momentum due to their ability to indicate and concentrate human pathogenic microorganisms. In the context of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, the objective of this study was to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid genome can be detected in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters from two separate plants to support its interest as bioindicator of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contamination in water. The zebra mussels were exposed to treated wastewater through caging at the outlet of two plants located in France, as well as to raw wastewater at laboratory scale in controlled conditions. Within their digestive tissues, our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 genome was detected in zebra mussels, whether in raw and treated wastewaters. Moreover, the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in such bivalve molluscans appeared even with low concentrations in raw wastewaters. This is the first detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the tissues of a sentinel species exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters. Despite the need for development for quantitative approaches, these results support the importance of such invertebrate organisms, especially zebra mussel, for the active surveillance of pathogenic microorganisms and their indicators in environmental waters.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446136v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@781087org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@853128org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5e667forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b243e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In the Drosophila genus, inversions have been widely characterized cytologically, and play an important role in local adaptation. Here, we characterize chromosomal inversions in the Drosophila nasuta species group using chromosome-level, reference-quality assemblies of seven species and subspecies in this clade. Reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes allowed us to infer the order in which the 22 identified inversions occurred along the phylogeny. We found a higher rate of inversions on the X chromosome, and heterogeneity in the rate of accumulation across the phylogeny. We molecularly characterize the breakpoints of six autosomal inversions, and found that repeated sequences are associated with inversion breakpoints in four of these inversions, suggesting that ectopic recombination is an important mechanism in generating inversion. Characterization of inversions in this species group provides a foundation for future population genetic and functional studies in this recently diverged species group.",

Ctenomys torquatus and Ctenomys lami are solitary subterranean rodents, thus demanding an improvement of the communicative channels, especially in territorial defense actions and meeting potential reproductive partners. This work was aimed to describe the variability of acoustic signals emitted by C. torquatus and C. lami by analyzing the physical-morphological characteristics of the signals. The study was carried out in two populations, one of each species and was selected 14 individuals of C. torquatus and 15 C. lami. The acoustic signals were recorded in a natural environment, obtaining the sounds straight from the animal tunnels. A total of 1,380 signals were captured and analyzed, 786 from C. torquatus and 594 from C. lami. It was possible to characterize 5 different types of signals, emitted by both species. Most of the analyzed sequences presented low frequency, and many of these calls exhibited characteristics of long-range signals. It was verified a sharing of sound signals in both species, as regarding the acoustic parameters as the morphology of the analyzed spectrograms. For the first time, it was possible to have access to sound data emitted by direct subterranean rodents from their tunnels in the natural environment.",

Lithiasis specifically nephro- and urolithiasis is no exception and needs urgent attention. Currently, only semi-invasive and surgical methods are widely employed which leads to trauma and reoccurrence of kidney stones. Hence complementary and alternative herbal medicine could pave newer ways in exploring anti-lithiatic contributors. The current study attempts to screen twenty herbal hot aqueous leaf extracts for assessing their antioxidant potency (anti-stress) and efficiency against urolithiasis in an experimental calcium oxalate-induced in vitro (chicken egg membrane) model. The study was further validated by In silico molecular docking studies using the Molegro software package on enzymatic biomarkers involved in scavenging oxidants in the host and regulating oxalate metabolism at a cellular level. Among the screened botanicals Kalanchoe pinnata exhibited promising results compared to the standard chemical (potassium-magnesium citrate) and phyto-formulation drug (cystone) currently used by clinicians for treating urolithiasis. The phytochemical profiling (qualitative and quantitative) and virtual studies indicated rutin from Kalanchoe pinnata as a potential candidate for preventing kidney stones. The results of the current study provide better insights into the design and development of newer, smart, and cost-effective herbal therapeutics making food as medicine.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "There is considerable interest in developing antibodies as modulators of signaling pathways. One of the most important signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which plays fundamental roles in growth, metabolism and immunity. The class IB PI3K, PI3K{gamma}, is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic p110{gamma} subunit bound to a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit. PI3K{gamma} is a critical component in multiple immune signaling processes and is dependent on activation by Ras and GPCRs to mediate its cellular roles. Here we describe the rapid and efficient characterization of multiple PI3K{gamma} single chain camelid nanobodies using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) for structural and biochemical studies. This allowed us to identify nanobodies that stimulated lipid kinase activity, blocked Ras activation and specifically inhibited p101-mediated GPCR activation. Overall, this reveals novel insight into PI3K{gamma} regulation and identifies sites that may be exploited for therapeutic development.\n\nHighlights- HDX-MS rapidly identifies epitopes of camelid single-chain nanobodies raised against Class IB PI3K complexes, p110{gamma}/p101 and p110{gamma}/p84\n- A nanobody targeting p101 improves local resolution in EM studies with p110{gamma}/p101 facilitating structural characterization of the complex\n- Nanobodies that bind at the interfaces with the lipidated activators Ras and G{beta}{gamma} can prevent activation of p110{gamma}/p101 and p110{gamma}/p84",

Using a tight-binding fluorescent ghrelin-derived peptide designed for high selectivity for GOAT over the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a, we demonstrate that GOAT interacts with extracellular ghrelin and facilitates ligand cell internalization in both transfected cells and prostate cancer cells endogenously expressing GOAT. Coupled with enzyme mutagenesis, ligand uptake studies provide the first direct evidence supporting interaction of the putative histidine general base within GOAT with the ghrelin peptide acylation site.

    "abstract": "In genomics, optical mapping technology provides long-range contiguity information to improve genome sequence assemblies and detect structural variation. Originally a laborious manual process, Bionano Genomics platforms now offer high-throughput, automated optical mapping based on chips packed with nanochannels through which unwound DNA is guided and the fluorescent DNA backbone and specific restriction sites are recorded. Although the raw image data obtained is of high quality, the processing and assembly software accompanying the platforms is closed source and does not seem to make full use of data, labeling approximately half of the measured signals as unusable. Here we introduce two new software tools, independent of Bionano Genomics software, to extract and process molecules from raw images (OptiScan) and to perform molecule-to-molecule and molecule-to-reference alignments using a novel signal-based approach (OptiMap). We demonstrate that the molecules detected by OptiScan can yield better assemblies, and that the approach taken by OptiMap results in higher use of molecules from the raw data. These tools lay the foundation for a suite of open-source methods to process and analyze high-throughput optical mapping data. The Python implementations of the OptiTools are publicly available through http://www.bif.wur.nl/.",

    "abstract": "ATP13A2 is a gene encoding a protein of the P5B subfamily of ATPases and is a PARK gene. Molecular defects of the gene are mainly associated with variations of Parkinsons Disease (PD). Despite the established importance of the protein in regulating neuronal integrity, the three-dimensional structure of the protein currently remains unresolved crystallographically. We have modelled the structure and reactivity of the full-length protein in its E1-ATP state. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD), Quantum cluster and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods, we aimed at describing the main catalytic reaction, leading to the phosphorylation of Asp513. Our MD simulations suggest that two positively charged Mg2+ cations are present at the active site during the catalytic reaction, stabilizing a specific triphosphate binding mode. Using QM/MM calculations, we subsequently calculated the reaction profiles for the phosphoryl transfer step in the presence of one and two Mg2+ cations. The calculated barrier heights in both cases are found to be [~]12.5 and 7.0 kcal mol-1, respectively. We elucidated details of the catalytically competent ATP conformation and the binding mode of the second Mg2+ cofactor. We also examined the role of the conserved Arg686 and Lys859 catalytic residues. We observed that by lowering significantly the barrier height of the ATP cleavage reaction, Arg686 had significant effect on the reaction. The removal of Arg686 increased the barrier height for the ATP cleavage by more than 5.0 kcal mol-1 while the removal of key electrostatic interactions created by Lys859 to the {gamma}-phosphate and Asp513 destabilizes the reactant state. When missense mutations occur in close proximity to an active site residue, they can interfere with the barrier height of the reaction, which can halt the normal enzymatic rate of the protein. We also found large binding pockets in the full-length structure, including a transmembrane domain pocket, which is likely where ATP13A2 cargo binds.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of MYC is a genuine cancer driver in lymphomas and related to poor prognosis. However, therapeutic targeting of the transcription factor MYC remains challenging. Here, we show that inhibition of the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) using the HDAC6 inhibitor Marbostat-100 (M-100) reduces oncogenic MYC levels and prevents lymphomagenesis in a mouse model of MYC-induced aggressive B-cell lymphoma. M-100 specifically alters protein-protein interactions by switching the acetylation state of HDAC6 substrates, such as tubulin. Tubulin facilitates nuclear import of MYC, and MYC-dependent B-cell lymphoma cells rely on continuous import of MYC due to its high turn-over. Acetylation of tubulin impairs this mechanism and enables proteasomal degradation of MYC. M-100 targets almost exclusively B-cell lymphoma cells with high levels of MYC whereas non-tumor cells are not affected. M-100 induces massive apoptosis in human and murine MYC-overexpressing B-cell lymphoma cells. We identified the heat-shock protein DNAJA3 as an interactor of tubulin in an acetylation-dependent manner and overexpression of DNAJA3 resulted in a pronounced degradation of MYC. We propose a mechanism by which DNAJA3 associates with hyperacetylated tubulin in the cytoplasm to control MYC turnover. Taken together, our data demonstrate a beneficial role of HDAC6 inhibition in MYC-dependent B-cell lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is a common feature of many positive-strand RNA viruses, playing an important role in virus evolution. However, to date, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms behind the process. Utilising in vitro assays, we have previously shown that the template-switching event of recombination is a random and ubiquitous process that often leads to recombinant viruses with imprecise genomes containing sequence duplications. Subsequently, a process termed resolution, that has yet to be mechanistically studied, removes these duplicated sequences resulting in a virus population of wild type length genomes. Using defined imprecise recombinant viruses together with Oxford Nanopore and Illumina high throughput next generation sequencing technologies we have investigated the process of resolution. We show that genome resolution involves subsequent rounds of template-switching recombination with viral fitness resulting in the survival of a small subset of recombinant genomes. This alters our previously held understanding that recombination and resolution are independent steps of the process, and instead demonstrates that viruses undergo frequent and continuous recombination events over a prolonged period until the fittest viruses, predominantly those with wild type length genomes, dominate the population.\n\nAuthor SummaryViruses with positive-sense RNA genomes, such as poliovirus, have several mechanisms by which they evolve. One of these is the process of recombination involving the large-scale exchange of genetic information. Recombination occurs during replication when the viral polymerase switches from copying one genome to another. However, the polymerase does not always accurately switch between the two, resulting in sequence duplications or deletions, and genomes that are referred to as imprecise. Over multiple rounds of replication sequence duplications are lost and genomes are resolved to wild type length, but it is unclear how this occurs. Here we used synthetic polioviruses containing defined sequence duplications to determine that the genome population undergoes repeated rounds of recombination until sequence duplications are lost and viruses with precise, wild type length genomes are selected for. This selection is based on the overall fitness of the virus population, with less fit imprecise viruses evolving more quickly. Our study suggests that recombination is a continual process where virus fitness drives the selection of a small subset of recombinant variants. These data are important for understanding how novel viruses evolve via recombination and how this process can be blocked to prevent novel and dangerous pathogens from arising.",

However, the scale of temporal and spatial variability in eDNA signatures, and how this variation may impact eDNA-based marine biodiversity assessments, remains uncertain. To address this question, we systematically examined variation in vertebrate eDNA signatures across depth (0 m to 10 m) and horizontal space (nearshore and surf zone) over three successive days in a Southern California kelp forest. Across a broad range of marine vertebrates (teleosts, elasmobranchs, birds, and mammals), results showed significant variation in species richness and community assemblages across 4-5 m depth, reflecting microhabitat depth preferences of common Southern California nearshore rocky reef taxa. We also found significant differences in community assemblages between nearshore and surf zone sampling stations at the same depth, and across three sampling days. Patterns of microhabitat partitioning in eDNA signatures across space and time were largely consistent with known habitat preferences and species behavior. Results highlight the sensitivity of eDNA in capturing fine-scale vertical, horizontal, and temporal variation in marine vertebrate communities, demonstrating the ability of eDNA to capture a highly localized snapshot of marine biodiversity in dynamic coastal environments.",

    "abstract": "Cilia and flagella are ancient structures that achieve controlled motor functions through the coordinated interaction of structures including dynein arms, radial spokes (RSs), microtubules, and the dynein regulatory complex (DRC). RSs facilitate the beating motion of these organelles by mediating signal transduction between dyneins and a central pair (CP) of singlet microtubules. RS complex isolation from Chlamydomonas axonemes enabled the detection of 23 different proteins (RSP1-23), with the roles of RSP13, RSP15, RSP18, RSP19, and RSP21 remained poorly understood. Herein, we show that Lrrc23 is an evolutionarily conserved testis-enriched gene encoding an RSP15 homolog in mice. Through immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that LRRC23 localizes to the RS complex within murine sperm flagella. We further found that LRRC23 was able to interact with RSHP9 and RSPH3A/B. The knockout of Lrrc23 resulted in RS disorganization and impaired motility in murine spermatozoa, whereas the ciliary beating was unaffected by the loss of this protein. Spermatozoa lacking LRRC23 were unable to efficiently pass through the uterotubal junction and exhibited defective zona penetration. Together these data indicate that LRRC23 is a key regulator underpinning the integrity of RS complex within the flagella of mammalian spermatozoa, whereas it is dispensable in cilia.\n\nAuthor summary",

    "abstract": "The cocoa pod borer, Conopomorpha cramerella (Snellen) is a serious pest in cocoa plantations in Southeast Asia. It causes significant losses in the crop. Unfortunately, genetic resources for this insect is extremely scarce. To improve these resources, we sequenced the transcriptome of C. cramerella representing the three stages of development, larva, pupa and adult moth using Illumina NovaSeq6000. Transcriptome assembly was performed by Trinity for all the samples. A total number of 147,356,088 high quality reads were obtained. Of these, 285,882 contigs were assembled. The mean contig size was 374 bp. Protein coding sequence (CDS) was extracted from the reconstructed transcripts by TransDecoder. Subsequently, BlastX and InterProScan were applied for homology search to make a prediction of the function of CDS in unigene. Additionally, we identified a number of genes that are involved in reproduction and development such as genes involved in general function processes in the insect. Genes found to be involved in reproduction such as porin, dsx, bol and fruitless were associated with sex determination, spermatogenesis and pheromone binding. Furthermore, transcriptome changes during development were analysed. There were 2,843 differentially expressed genes (DEG) detected between the larva and pupa samples. A total of 2,861 DEG were detected between adult and larva stage whereas between adult and pupa stage, 1,953 DEG were found. In conclusion, the transcriptomes could be a valuable genetic resource for identification of genes in C. cramerella and the study will provide putative targets for RNAi pest control.",

We investigated the links between MHC class I and II gene variability gut microbiome diversity and micro- (adenovirus, AdV) and macro- (helminth) parasite infection probabilities in a wild population of non-human primates, mouse lemurs of Madagascar. This setup encompasses a plethora of underlying interactions between parasites, microbes and adaptive immunity in natural populations. Both MHC classes explained shifts in microbiome composition and the effect was driven by a few select microbial taxa. Among them were three taxa (Odoribacter, Campylobacter and Prevotellaceae-UCG-001) which were in turn linked to AdV and helminth infection status, evidence of the indirect effect of the MHC via the microbiome. Our study provides support for the coupled role of MHC variability and microbial flora as contributing factors of parasite infection.\n\nAuthor summaryThe selective pressure of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on microbial communities, and the potential role of this interaction in driving parasite resistance has been largely neglected. Using a natural population of the primate Microcebus griseorufus, we provide evidence of two outstanding findings: that MHCI and MHCII diversity shapes the composition of the gut microbiota; and that select taxa associated with MHC variability predicted adenovirus and helminth infection status. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating the microbiome when investigating parasite-mediated MHC selection.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic signaling dynamics expand living cells information processing capabilities. An increasing number of studies report that regulators encode information in their pulsatile dynamics. The evolutionary mechanisms that lead to complex signaling dynamics remain uncharacterized, perhaps because key interactions of signaling proteins are encoded in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), whose evolution is difficult to analyze. Here we focused on the stochastic pulsing dynamics of Crz1, a transcription factor in fungi downstream of the widely conserved calcium signaling pathway. We find that Crz1 IDRs from anciently diverged fungi can all respond transiently to calcium stress; however, only Crz1 IDRs from the Saccharomyces clade support pulsatility, encode extra information, and rescue fitness, while the Crz1 IDRs from distantly related fungi do none of the three. On the other hand, we find that Crz1 pulsing is conserved in the distantly related fungi, consistent with the evolutionary model of stabilizing selection. Further, we show that a calcineurin docking site in a specific part of the IDRs appears to be sufficient for pulsing and show evidence for a beneficial increase in the relative calcineurin affinity of this docking site. We propose that evolutionary flexibility of functionally divergent IDRs underlies the conservation of stochastic signaling by stabilizing selection.",

    "abstract": "Language and music are two human-unique capacities whose relationship remains debated. Some have argued for overlap in processing mechanisms, especially for structure processing. Such claims often concern the inferior frontal component of the language system located within  Brocas area. However, others have failed to find overlap. Using a robust individual-subject fMRI approach, we examined the responses of language brain regions to music stimuli, and probed the musical abilities of individuals with severe aphasia. Across four experiments, we obtained a clear answer: music perception does not engage the language system, and judgments about music structure are possible even in the presence of severe damage to the language network. In particular, the language regions responses to music are generally low, often below the fixation baseline, and never exceed responses elicited by non-music auditory conditions, like animal sounds. Further, the language regions are not sensitive to music structure: they show low responses to intact and structure-scrambled music, and to melodies with vs. without structural violations. Finally, in line with past patient investigations, individuals with aphasia who cannot judge sentence grammaticality perform well on melody well-formedness judgments. Thus the mechanisms that process structure in language do not appear to process music, including music syntax.",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies reveal that genome architecture splits into DNA sequence domains suggesting a well-structured genomic architecture, where, for each species, genome populations are integrated by individual mutational variants. Herein, we show that, consistent with the fundamental theorem of Abelian finite groups, the architecture of population genomes from the same or closed related species can be quantitatively represented in terms of the direct sum of homocyclic Abelian groups of prime-power order defined on the genetic code and on the set of DNA bases, where populations can be stratified into subpopulations with the same canonical decomposition into p-groups. Through concrete examples we show that the architectures of current annotated genomic regions including (but not limited to) transcription factors binding-motif, promoter regulatory boxes, exon and intron arrangement associated to gene splicing are subjects for feasible modeling as decomposable Abelian p-groups. Moreover, we show that the epigenomic variations induced by diseases or environmental changes also can be represented as an Abelian group decomposable into homocyclic Abelian p-groups. The nexus between the direct sum of homocycle Abelian p-groups and the endomorphism ring paved the ways to unveil unsuspected stochastic-deterministic logical propositions ruling the ensemble of genomic regions. Our study aims to set the basis for concrete applications of the theory in computational biology and bioinformatics. Consistently with this goal, a computational tool designed for the analysis of fixed mutational events in gene/genome populations represented as endomorphisms and automorphisms is provided. Results suggest that complex local architectures and evolutionary features no evident through the direct experimentation can be unveiled through the analysis of the endomorphism ring and the subsequent application of machine learning approaches for the identification of stochastic-deterministic logical rules (reflecting the evolutionary pressure on the region) constraining the set of possible mutational events (represented as homomorphisms) and the evolutionary paths.",
