    "abstract": "The viscosity of lipid membranes sets the timescales of membrane-associated flows and therefore influences the dynamics of a wide range of cellular processes. Techniques to measure membrane viscosity remain sparse, however, and reported measurements to date, even of similar systems, give viscosity values that span orders of magnitude. To address this, we improve a method based on measuring both the rotational and translational diffusion of membrane-anchored microparticles and apply this approach and one based on tracking the motion of phase-separated lipid domains to the same system of phase-separated giant vesicles. We find good agreement between the two methods, with inferred viscosities within a factor of two of each other. Our technique uses ellipsoidal microparticles, and we show that the extraction of physically meaningful viscosity values from their motion requires consideration of their anisotropic shape. The validation of our method on phase-separated membranes makes possible its application to other systems, which we demonstrate by measuring the viscosity of bilayers composed of lipids with different chain lengths ranging from 14 to 20 carbon atoms, revealing a very weak dependence of two-dimensional viscosity on lipid size. The experimental and analysis methods described here should be generally applicable to a variety of membrane systems, both reconstituted and cellular.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe lipid bilayers that underlie cellular membranes are two-dimensional fluids whose viscosity sets timescales of flow. Lipid membrane viscosity remains poorly quantified, with a paucity of methods and considerable disagreement between values reported using different techniques. We describe a method based on measuring the Brownian diffusion of ellipsoidal microparticles which we apply to phase-separated membranes alongside a previously established method for determining membrane viscosity, finding good agreement between the two techniques. We further examine homogenous membranes composed of lipids with different chain lengths, not amenable to phase-separationbased methods, revealing a very weak dependence of viscosity on lipid size. Our approach should be applicable to a wide range of membrane systems, both in vitro and in living cells.",

    "abstract": "A multitude of sequencing-based and microscopy technologies provide the means to unravel the relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) organization of genomes and key regulatory processes of genome function. However, it remains a major challenge to systematically integrate all available data sources to characterize the nuclear organization of genomes across different spatial scales. Here, we develop a multi-modal data integration approach to produce genome structures that are highly predictive for nuclear locations of genes and nuclear bodies, local chromatin compaction, and spatial segregation of functionally related chromatin.\n\nBy performing a quantitative assessment of the predictive power of genome structures generated from different data combinations, we demonstrate that multimodal data integration can compensate for systematic errors and missing values in some of the data and thus, greatly increases accuracy and coverage of genome structure models. We also show that alternative combinations of different orthogonal data sources can converge to models with similar predictive power. Moreover, our study reveals the key contributions of low-frequency inter-chromosomal contacts (e.g., \"rare\" contact events) to accurately predicting the global nuclear architecture, including the positioning of genes and chromosomes. Overall, our results highlight the benefits of multi-modal data integration for genome structure analysis, available through the Integrative Genome structure Modeling (IGM) software package that we introduce here.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCoagulation dysfunction and thromboembolism emerge as strong comorbidity factors in severe COVID-19. However, it is unclear when particularly platelet activation markers and coagulation factors dysregulated during the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here, we sought to assess the levels of coagulation and platelet activation markers at moderate and severe stages of COVID-19 to understand the pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsTo understand this, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with (severe cases that required intensive care) or without pneumonia (moderate cases) were recruited. Phenotypic and molecular characterizations were performed employing basic coagulation tests including PT, APTT, D-Dimer and TFPI. The flow cytometry-based multiplex assays were performed to assess FXI, anti-thrombin, prothrombin, fibrinogen, FXIII, P-selectin, sCD40L, plasminogen, tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and D-Dimer.\n\nResultsThe investigations revealed induction of plasma P-selectin and CD40 ligand (sCD40L) in moderate COVID-19 cases which were significantly abolished with the progression of COVID-19 severity. Moreover, a profound reduction in plasma tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and FXIII were identified particularly in the severe COVID-19. Further analysis revealed fibrinogen induction in both moderate and severe patients. Interestingly, an elevated PAI-1 more prominently in moderate, and tPA particularly in severe COVID-19 cases were observed. Particularly, the levels of fibrinogen and tPA directly correlated with the severity of the disease.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, induction of soluble P-selectin, sCD40L, fibrinogen and PAI-1 in moderate COVID-19 cases suggests the activation of platelets and coagulation system before patients require intensive care. These findings would help in designing better thromboprophylaxis to limit the COVID-19 severity.",

    "abstract": "Plant resistance genes (or NLR \"Nod-like Receptors\") are known to contain atypical domains procuring them with a decoy capacity. Some of these integrated domains (or ID) allow the plant to lure the virulence determinants (\"effectors\") of pathogens and triggering a specific NLR immune reaction.\n\nIn this work, our goal was to generate a library of known IDs that could be screened with plant pathogen effectors in order to identify putative new effector virulence targets and NLR-effector pairs.\n\nWe curated the IDs contained in NLRs from seven model and crop plant species. We cloned 52 IDs representing 31 distinct Pfam domains. This library was screened for interaction by yeast-two-hybrid with a set of 31 conserved Ralstonia solanacearum type III effectors. This screening and the further in planta interaction assay allowed us to identify three interactions, involving different IDs (kinase, DUF3542, WRKY) and two type III effectors (RipAE and PopP2).\n\nPopP2 was found to physically interact with ID#85, an atypical WRKY domain integrated in the GmNLR-ID85 NLR protein from Soybean. Using a imaging method in living plant cells, we showed that PopP2 associates with ID#85 in the nucleus. But unlike the known WRKY-containing Arabidopsis RRS1-R NLR receptor, this newly identified soybean WRKY domain could not be acetylated by PopP2 and its atypical sequence (WRKYGKR) also probably renders it inefficient in plant immunity triggering.\n\nThis ID toolkit is available for screening with other plant pathogen effectors and should prove useful to discover new effectors targets and potentially engineer new plant resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) consist of an extracellular antigen-binding region fused to intracellular signaling domains, thus enabling customized T cell responses against target cells. Due to the low-throughput process of systematically designing and functionally testing CARs, only a small set of immune signaling domains have been thoroughly explored, despite their major role in T cell activation, effector function and persistence. Here, we present speedingCARs, an integrated method for engineering CAR T cells by signaling domain shuffling and functional screening by single-cell sequencing. Leveraging the inherent modularity of natural signaling domains, we generated a diverse library of 180 unique CAR variants, which were genomically integrated into primary human T cells by CRISPR-Cas9. Functional and pooled screening of the CAR T cell library was performed by co-culture with tumor cells, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell CAR sequencing (scCAR-seq), thus enabling high-throughput profiling of multi-dimensional cellular responses. This led to the discovery of several CAR variants that retained the ability to kill tumor cells, while also displaying diverse transcriptional signatures and T cell phenotypes. In summary, speedingCARs substantially expands and characterizes the signaling domain combinations suited for CAR design and supports the engineering of next-generation T cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that several cattle breeds may be more resistant to infection with the zoonotic pathogen Mycobacterium bovis than others. Our data presented here suggests that the response to mycobacterial antigens varies in macrophages generated from Brown Swiss (BS) and Holstein Frisian (HF) cattle, two breeds belonging to the Bos taurus family. Whole genome sequencing of the Brown Swiss genome identified several potential candidate genes, in particular Toll-like Receptor-2 (TLR2) a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that has previously been described to be involved in mycobacterial recognition. Further investigation revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in TLR2 that were identified between DNA isolated from cells of BS and HF cows. Interestingly, one specific SNP, H326Q, showed a different genotype frequency in two cattle subspecies, Bos taurus and Bos indicus. Cloning of the TLR2 gene and subsequent gene-reporter and chemokine assays revealed that this SNP, present in BS and Bos indicus breeds, resulted in a significantly higher response to mycobacterial antigens as well as tri-acylated lipopeptide ligands in general. Comparing wild-type and H326Q containing TLR2 responses, wild-type bovine TLR2 response showed clear, diminished mycobacterial antigen responses compared to human TLR2, however bovine TLR2 responses containing H326Q were found to be partially recovered compared to human TLR2. The creation of human:bovine TLR2 chimeras increased the response to mycobacterial antigens compared to the full-length bovine TLR2, but significantly reduced the response compared to the full-length human TLR2. Thus, our data, not only present evidence that TLR2 is a major PRR in the mammalian species-specific response to mycobacterial antigens, but furthermore, that there are clear differences between the response seen in different cattle breeds, which may contribute to their enhanced or reduced susceptibility to mycobacterial infection.",

There are currently no effective vaccines or prophylactics to prevent Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Limiting exposure to infected mosquitoes is best way to reduce disease incidence. Recent studies have focused on targeting mosquito reproduction and immune responses to reduce transmission. In particular, previous work evaluated the effect of insulin signaling on antiviral JAK/STAT and RNAi in vector mosquitoes. In this work, we demonstrate that targeting insulin signaling through the repurposing of small molecule drugs results in the activation of both of these antiviral pathways. Activation of this coordinated response additively reduced ZIKV levels in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This effect included a quantitatively greater reduction in salivary gland ZIKV levels relative to single pathway activation, indicating the potential for field delivery of these small molecules to substantially reduce virus transmission.",

However, limited accessibility obscures study of these crucial processes. Here, we develop an ex vivo Matrigel-collagen-based culture to recapitulate mouse development from E4.5 to 6.0. Our system not only recapitulates embryonic growth, axis initiation, and overall 3D architecture in 49% of cases, its compatibility with light-sheet microscopy enables study of cellular dynamics through automatic cell segmentation. We find that upon implantation, release of the increasing tension in the polar trophectoderm is necessary for its constriction and invagination. The resulting extra-embryonic ectoderm plays a key role in growth, morphogenesis and patterning of the neighboring epiblast, which subsequently gives rise to all embryonic tissues. This 3D-ex vivo system thus offers an unprecedented access to peri-implantation development for in toto monitoring, measurement and spatio-temporally controlled perturbation, revealing a mechano-chemical interplay between extra-embryonic and embryonic tissues.",

SmcHD1 is essential for stable silencing of the Xi, and its functional deficiency results in derepression of many X-inactivated genes. Although SmcHD1 has been suggested to play an important role in the formation of higher order chromatin structure of the Xi, the underlying mechanism is largely obscure. Here we explore the epigenetic state of the Xi in SmcHD1-deficient epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in comparison with their wild-type counterparts. The results suggest that SmcHD1 underlies the formation of H3K9me3-enriched blocks on the Xi, which, although the importance of H3K9me3 has been largely overlooked in mice, play a critical role in the establishment of the stably silenced state. We propose that the H3K9me3 blocks formed on the Xi facilitate robust heterochromatin formation in combination with H3K27me3, and the substantial loss of H3K9me3 caused by SmcHD1 deficiency leads to aberrant distribution of H3K27me3 on the Xi and derepression of X-inactivated genes.",

Despite extensive work on the formation and functions of EVs in cultured cells, studies of EVs in vivo have remained scarce. We report here that EVs are present in the developing lumen of tracheal tubes in Drosophila embryos. We defined two distinct EV subpopulations, one of which contains the Munc13-4 homologue Staccato (Stac) and is spatially and temporally associated with tracheal tube fusion events. The formation of Stac-positive luminal EVs depends on the tip-cell-specific GTPase Arl3, which is also required for the formation of Stac-positive multivesicular bodies, suggesting that Stac-EVs derive from fusion of Stac-MVBs with the luminal membrane in tip cells during anastomosis formation. The GTPases Rab27 and Rab35 cooperate downstream of Arl3 to promote Stac-MVB formation and tube fusion. We propose that Stac-MVBs act as membrane reservoirs that facilitate tracheal lumen fusion in a process regulated by Arl3, Rab27, Rab35, and Stac/Munc13-4.",

    "abstract": "The forests of central Europe have undergone remarkable transitions in the past 40 years as air quality has improved dramatically. Retrospective analysis of Norway spruce (Picea abies) tree rings in the Czech Republic shows that air pollution (e.g. SO2 concentrations, high acidic deposition to the forest canopy) plays a dominant role in driving forest health. Extensive soil acidification occurred in the highly polluted \"Black Triangle\" in Central Europe, and upper mineral soils are still acidified. In contrast, acidic atmospheric deposition declined by 80% and atmospheric SO2 concentration by 90% between the late 1980s and 2010s. Annual tree ring width (TRW) declined in the 1970s and subsequently recovered in the 1990s, tracking SO2 concentrations closely. Furthermore, recovery of TRW was similar in unlimed and limed stands. Despite large increases in soil base saturation, as well as soil pH, as a result of repeated liming starting in 1981, TRW growth was similar in limed and unlimed plots. TRW recovery was interrupted in 1996 when highly acidic rim (originating from more pronounced decline of alkaline dust than SO2 from local power plants) injured the spruce canopy, but recovered soon to the pre-episode growth. Across the long-term site history, changes in soil chemistry (pH, base saturation, Bc/Al soil solution ratio) cannot explain observed changes in TRW at the two study sites at which we tracked soil chemistry. Instead, statistically significant recovery in TRW is linked to the trajectory of annual SO2 concentrations or sulfur deposition at all three stands.",

By analyzing transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq), we found that LPAIV-infected mallards do not exhibit differential gene expression compared to uninfected birds, but that gene expression was associated with viral shedding quantity early in the infection. In both tissues, immune genes were mostly up-regulated in higher shedding birds and had significant positive relationships with viral shedding. In the ileum, host genes involved in viral cell entry were down-regulated in low shedders one day post-infection (DPI), and host genes promoting viral replication were up-regulated in high shedders on two DPI. Our findings indicate that viral shedding is a key factor for gene expression differences in LPAIV-infected mallards, and the genes identified in this study could be important for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving intraspecific variation in pathogen shedding.",

    "abstract": "Members of eustigmatophyte algae, especially Nannochloropsis, have been tapped for biofuel production owing to their exceptionally high lipid content. While extensive genomic, transcriptomic, and synthetic biology toolkits have been made available for Nannochloropsis, very little is known about other eustigmatophytes. Here we present three near-chromosomal and gapless genome assemblies of Monodopsis (60 Mb) and Vischeria (106 Mb), which are the sister groups to Nannochloropsis. These genomes contain unusually high percentages of simple repeats, ranging from 12% to 21% of the total assembly size. Unlike Nannochloropsis, LINE repeats are abundant in Monodopsis and Vischeria and might constitute the centromeric regions. We found that both mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathways for terpenoid biosynthesis are present in Monodopsis and Vischeria, which is different from Nannochloropsis that has only the latter. Our analysis further revealed extensive spliced leader trans-splicing in Monodopsis and Vischeria at 36-61% of genes. Altogether, the high-quality genomes of Monodopsis and Vischeria not only serve as the much-needed outgroups to advance Nannochloropsis research, but also shed new light on the biology and evolution of eustigmatophyte algae.",

    "abstract": "Aluminum toxicity is one of the most important abiotic stresses that affect crop production worldwide. The soluble form (Al3+) inhibits root growth by altering water and nutrients uptake, which also reduces plant growth and development. Under a long term Al3+ exposure, plants can activate several tolerance mechanisms, and to date, there are no reports of large-scale proteomic data of maize in response to this ion. To investigate the post-transcriptional regulation in response to Al toxicity, we performed a label-free quantitative proteomics for comparative analysis of two Al-contrasting popcorn inbred lines and an Al-tolerant commercial hybrid during 72 h under Al-stress. A total of 489 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) were identified in the Al-sensitive inbred line, 491 in the Al-tolerant inbred line, and 277 in the commercial hybrid. Among them, 120 DAPs were co-expressed in both Al tolerant genotypes. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and carbohydrate metabolism were significant biochemical processes regulated in response to Al toxicity. The up accumulation of sucrose synthase and the increase of sucrose content and starch degradation suggest that these components may enhance popcorn tolerance to Al stress. The up-accumulation of citrate synthase suggests a key role of this enzyme in the detoxification process in the Al-tolerant inbred line. The integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data indicated that the Al tolerance response presents a complex regulatory network into the transcription and translation dynamics of popcorn roots development.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has its origins in distant antiquity and has piled up over a long time with much knowledge about diseases, especially stroke. Different combinations of symptom variables yield different combinations of herbs to form a myriad of prescriptions, and they have undergone repeated confirmation and are worthy objects of excavation and analysis. Herbal studies on stroke have developed from genomics to transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, yet more thought is needed on putting time in a wider perspective of the symptoms and herbs for stroke in Chinese medicine.\n\nDue to this, we studied the dynamic structure of TCM prescriptions on stroke, using over 270 TCM prescription books containing 2231 prescriptions related to stroke recorded from 341 to 2000 CE. We labeled the functions of the prescriptions with the symptoms based on subject terms in MESH Neurologic Manifestations, then standardized the herbs in the prescriptions, and finally connected the co-occurring symptoms and herbs in the prescriptions to build an undirected complex network. The Stroke Symptom-Herb Networks (SSHNs) can be seen from its network characteristics that it is not a random network and has small-world characteristics. It has experienced two peaks in its nearly 1700-year history, during the Song dynasty, the Ming and Qing dynasties. From 600 years onwards, the core herb cluster has been initially formed. The comparison of sub-network similarities allowed us to identify several symptoms with similar herb clusters.\n\nWe divided the community based on modularity, and by analyzing the community evolution, we found a more fixed historical evolutionary trend with Hemiplegia and Sialorrhea nodes and their associated symptom and herb nodes. In the time series analysis, we found many symptom-herb combinations that were consistently closely related to historic time depends on assessing the similarity between the symptoms and the herbs. The complex network provides a distinctive perspective for understanding the symptom-herb relationships embedded in TCM prescriptions in remote antiquity.",

Basolateral amygdala neurons were recorded from freely-moving rats as they interacted with different ethological stimuli: male or female rats, a moving toy and food. Over 20% of neurons showed highly tuned event-specific responses to a single class of stimuli. Firing persisted in 30% of these responsive cells for minutes after the removal of the eliciting stimulus. Neural information flowed directionally from event-specific neurons to less specific neurons with changes in connection strength after removal of the stimulus. We propose that the basolateral amygdala identifies specific ethological events, with circuit-wide activity driven by the event-specific neurons during and after the termination of those events likely facilitating active short-term memory consolidation.",

A little studied potential fomite of great concern in the community is currency, which has been shown to harbor microbial pathogens in several studies. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses in the United States have limited the use of banknotes in favor of credit cards. However, SARS-CoV-2 has shown greater stability on plastic in several studies. Herein, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature on banknotes, money cards and coins was investigated. In vitro studies with live virus suggested SARS-CoV-2 was highly unstable on banknotes, showing an initial rapid reduction in viable virus and no viral detection by 24 hours. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was far more stable on money cards with live virus detected after 48 hours. Environmental swabbing of currency and money cards on and near the campus of Brigham Young University supported these results, with no detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on banknotes, and a low level on money cards. No viable virus was detected on either. These preliminary results suggest that the use of money cards over banknotes in order to slow the spread of this virus may be ill-advised. These findings should be investigated further through larger environmental studies involving more locations.",

    "abstract": "Derivation of astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is inefficient and cumbersome, impeding their use in biomedical research. Here, we developed a highly efficient chemically defined astrocyte differentiation strategy that overcomes current limitations. This approach largely bypasses neurogenesis, which otherwise precedes astrogliogenesis during brain development and in vitro experiments. hPSCs were first differentiated into radial glial cells (RGCs) exhibiting in vivo-like radial glia signatures. Activation of NOTCH and JAK/STAT pathways in bona fide RGCs resulted in direct astrogliogenesis confirmed by expression of various glial markers (NFIA, NFIB, SOX9, CD44, S100B, GFAP). Transcriptomic and genome-wide epigenetic analyses confirmed RGC-to-astrocyte differentiation and absence of neurogenesis. The morphological and functional identity of hPSC-derived astrocytes was confirmed by using an array of methods (e.g. electron microscopy, calcium imaging, co-culture with neurons, grafting into mouse brains). Lastly, the scalable protocol was adapted to a robotic platform and used to model Alexander disease. In conclusion, our findings uncover remarkable plasticity in neural lineage progression that can be exploited to manufacture large numbers of human hPSC-derived astrocytes for drug development and regenerative medicine.",

Previous studies focused more on the economic effects of the adjustment of administrative divisions, while, in this paper, we also take environmental effects into consideration. The administrative division adjustment for Chaohu Lake is used as a quasi-natural experiment to explore the influence of the adjustment on pollution control. The synthetic control method is used in this study to access the effect of administrative division adjustment on the water quality indicators of Chaohu Lake and its internal mechanism. Some conclusions are as follows. First, after the administrative division adjustment, some water quality indicators, such as ammonia nitrogen, have indeed been alleviated; however, other major pollution indicators, such as chemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen, have deteriorated to varying degrees. Second, the results also reveal that improper development ideas, industrial excessive expansion, and the swing of economic growth and environmental goals are problems after the adjustment. Returning to the original intention of adjustment, rationalizing the Chaohu Lake management system and designing a sound and feasible accountability mechanism are fundamental measures to reduce pollution.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing of tens of thousands of humans has enabled the measurement of large selective effects for mutations to protein-coding genes. Here we describe a new method, called ExtRaINSIGHT, for measuring similar selective effects in noncoding as well as in coding regions of the human genome. ExtRaINSIGHT estimates the prevalance of strong purifying selection, or \"ultraselection\" ({lambda}s), as the fractional depletion of rare single-nucleotide variants in target genomic sites relative to matched sites that are putatively free from selection, after controlling for local variation and neighbor-dependence in mutation rate. We show using simulations that{lambda} s is closely related to the average site-specific selection coefficient against heterozygous point mutations, as predicted at mutation-selection balance. Applying ExtRaINSIGHT to 71,702 whole genome sequences from gnomAD v3, we find strong evidence of ultraselection in evolutionarily ancient miRNAs and neuronal protein-coding genes, as well as at splice sites. By contrast, we find weak evidence in other noncoding RNAs and transcription factor binding sites, and only modest evidence in ultraconserved elements and human accelerated regions. We estimate that ~0.3-0.5% of the human genome is ultraselected, implying ~0.3-0.4 lethal or nearly lethal de novo mutations per potential human zygote. Overall, our study sheds new light on the genome-wide distribution of fitness effects for new point mutations by combining deep new sequencing data sets and classical theory from population genetics.",

    "abstract": "Adult men are, on average, [~]13 cm taller than adult women. Although previous studies have suggested a significant contribution of sex chromosomal genes to sexual dimorphism in height, all attempts to identify a male-specific growth gene have failed. In the present study, we analyzed transcripts from cartilage tissues, and found that the expression of SHOX, a growth-promoting gene in the pseudoautosomal region on the X and Y chromosomes, was lower in females than in males. DNA methylation analyses showed that SHOX has some characteristics of genes subjected to X chromosome inactivation (XCI). These findings indicate that sex difference in human height is mainly ascribed to incomplete spreading of XCI on a pseudoautosomal gene. More importantly, RT-PCR of fibroblast clones revealed XCI-independent random clonal monoallelic expression of SHOX. We presume that during eutherian evolution, SHOX translocated from an autosome to the proto-sex chromosome without losing the epigenetic memory of random clonal monoallelic expression and subsequently underwent partial XCI. This study provides a novel model of epigenetic gene regulation leading to phenotypic diversity in humans.",

    "abstract": "The human intestinal microbiota starts to form immediately after birth, and is important for the health of the host. During the first days facultatively anaerobic bacterial species generally dominate, such as Enterobacteriaceae. These are succeeded by strictly anaerobic species, particularly Bifidobacterium species. An early transition to Bifidobacterium species is associated with health benefits: for example, Bifidobacterium species repress growth of pathogenic competitors and modulate the immune response. Succession to Bifidobacterium is thought to be due to consumption of intracolonic oxygen present in newborns by facultative anaerobes, including Enterobacteriaceae. To study if oxygen depletion suffices for the transition to Bifidobacterium species, here we introduce a multiscale mathematical model that considers metabolism, spatial bacterial population dynamics and cross-feeding. Using publicly available metabolic network data from the AGORA collection, the model simulates ab initio the competition of strictly and facultatively anaerobic species in a gut-like environment under the influence of lactose and oxygen. The model predicts that individual differences in intracolonic oxygen in newborn infants can explain the observed individual variation in succession to anaerobic species, in particular Bifidobacterium species. Bifidobacterium species become dominant in the model by using the bifid shunt, which allows Bifidobacterium to switch to sub-optimal yield metabolism with fast growth at high lactose concentrations as predicted here using flux-balance analysis. The computational model thus allows us to test the internal plausibility of hypotheses for bacterial colonization and succession in the infant colon.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe composition of the infant microbiota has a great impact on infant health, but its controlling factors are still incompletely understood. The frequently dominant anaerobic Bifidobacterium species benefit health, e.g., because they can keep harmful competitors under control and modulate the intestinal immune response. Controlling factors could include nutritional composition and intestinal mucus composition, as well as environmental factors, such as antibiotics. We introduce a modeling framework of a metabolically realistic intestinal microbial ecology in which hypothetical scenarios can be tested and compared. We present simulations that suggest that greater levels of intra-intestinal oxygenation more strongly delay the dominance of Bifidobacterium species, explaining the observed variety of microbial composition and demonstrating the use of the model for hypothesis generation. The framework allows us to test a variety of controlling factors, including intestinal mixing and transit time. Future versions will also include detailed modeling of oligosaccharide and mucin metabolism.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable efficacy, especially in preventing severe illness and hospitalization. However, the emergence of several variants of concern and reports of declining antibody levels have raised uncertainty about the durability of immune memory following vaccination. In this study, we longitudinally profiled both antibody and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive and recovered individuals from pre-vaccine baseline to 6 months post-mRNA vaccination. Antibody and neutralizing titers decayed from peak levels but remained detectable in all subjects at 6 months post-vaccination. Functional memory B cell responses, including those specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, were also efficiently generated by mRNA vaccination and continued to increase in frequency between 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Notably, most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern, and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover, the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals, with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory. Together, this study provides insights into the generation and evolution of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and has implications for future booster strategies.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=146 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457229v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c64b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@146ca3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86b7edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@956879_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolution in nonhuman primate models used to test vaccines and therapies and to model human disease. Viral RNA was sequenced from rectal swabs from Chlorocebus aethiops (African green monkeys) after experimental respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two distinct patterns of viral evolution were identified that were shared between all collected samples. First, mutations in the furin cleavage site that were initially present in the virus as a consequence of VeroE6 cell culture adaptation were subsequently lost in virus recovered in rectal swabs, confirming the necessity of this motif for viral infection in vivo. Three amino acid changes were also identified; ORF 1a S2103F, and spike D215G and H655Y, that were detected in rectal swabs from all sampled animals. These findings are demonstrative of intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolution unique to this nonhuman primate species and may identify a host-adapted variant of SARS-CoV-2 that would be useful in future development of primate disease models.",

    "abstract": "Pregnant women are an at-risk group for severe COVID-19, though the majority experience mild/asymptomatic disease. Although severe COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of active viral replication, the immune response to asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 remains unknown. Here, we assessed immunological adaptations in both blood and term decidua from 9 SARS-exposed pregnant women with asymptomatic/mild disease and 15 pregnant SARS-naive women. In addition to selective loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, we report attenuation of antigen presentation and type I IFN signaling but upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in blood monocyte derived decidual macrophages. On the other hand, infection was associated with remodeling of the T cell compartment with increased frequencies of activated CD69+ tissue-resident T cells and decreased abundance of Tregs. Interestingly, frequencies of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells increased only in the blood, while CD8 effector memory T cells were expanded in the decidua. In contrast to decidual macrophages, signatures of type I IFN signaling were increased in decidual T cells. Finally, T cell receptor diversity was significantly reduced with infection in both compartments, albeit to a much greater extent in the blood. The resulting aberrant immune activation in the placenta, even with asymptomatic disease may alter the exquisitely sensitive developing fetal immune system, leading to long-term adverse outcomes for offspring.",
